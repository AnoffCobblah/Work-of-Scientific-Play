  .  On tbe different Proportions of Carbon which constitute the
    various Qualities of Crude Iron and Steel ; being a Con
    tinuation of tbe Experiments on tbe fame Subjecl detailed

H     -AV7NG selected a parcel of well-prepared Stourbridge
clay crucibles, with covers exactly fitting, I proceeded to
make the following experiments upon the quantity of char
coal which forms crude iron and steel ; first premising that
both crucible and cover were brought to a bright reef heat
before the substances acted upon were introduced.            This was
done with the greatest possible caution, to avoid volatilizing
any part of the charcoal, and rendering the result inaccurate.
From the approximation of these results in repeating most of
these experiments, I found that no material difference had
occurred.                                                       Grains.

that bar iron may be converted into the finest qualities of
crude iron by the addition of any portion of charcoal from
4 to -,±xth part its weioht : that in passing from the malleable
to the carbonated crude state, it uniformly gains in weight by

    Upon     the  whole,   if the results of these six experiments,
performed in open       vessels,  arc compared with the three first
detailed in last     communication,         where a similar quality of
crude iron     was  obtained   in  vessels   perfectly close, no material
 difference   will be found. They mutually support each other,
 as   to the quantity of carbon necessary to form crude iron,
while they still leave in doubt the cause of the disappearance
of the charcoal in close vessels.          In the cafe of open vessels,
it  is highly probable that a considerable portion of the char
coal is destroyed before the heat of the furnace is sufficiently
 strong to lute the cover of the crucible.
    This still, however, leaves unexplained, why, in experi
ment I. a loss of 152 grains of charcoal is sustained; while
 in No. VI. the original quantity introduced did not amount
 to half that quantity, yet 1 3 grains of the latter was found
entire resting upou the surface of the reduced metal.                   The
 thickness and capacity of the crucible in both cafes, and, in
 deed, all these experiments, were nearly alike.
     The fact of malleable iron being convertible into the most
 carbonated state of crude iron, either in close or open vessels,
 where a portion of the carbonaceous matter was found re
 posing upon the surface of the newly-changed metal, creates
 some doubts as to the existence of oxygen in crude iron.                 If
 it is admitted that bar iron is destitute of oxygen, which it is
 highly probable is the cafe ; if a portion of this iron is intro
 duced and fused along with a portion of carbonaceous matter
 in a vessel impervious to air, which vessel is found, when
 cold, to be more than half filled with charcoal, protecting a
                                    A4                              metallic

metallic button of crude iron below ; it is with the greatest
difficulty we can admit of the presence of oxygen in the me
tallic mass.     It may be urged, that charcoal, considered as
an oxide of carbon, might impart a portion of oxygen to the
metal.      This must suppose, however, a continual action and
reaction of affinity, wherein it is presumable the carbon
would finally prevail, and carry off the oxygen.        I conceive
it more just to suppose, that what quantity of oxygen was
contained in the charcoal, would be discharged by the latter
deoxydating itself analogous to its superior affinity, rather
than combining with the iron.
    It is a fact well known amongst manufacturers, that cast
iron of a silvery white fracture may be saturated to excess with
carbonaceous matter simply by cementing it in contact with
charcoal.      In this process it acquires a soft gray fracture,
easily   reducible  by the file. If this cast iron originally con
tained oxvgen, a long cementation in contact with charcoal,
most likely, would deprive it of this; yet we find it still pos
sessed of all the properties of cast iron.   From this we should
be apt to conclude that oxygen at least is not necessary to
the production of crude iron.
    Again, in the process of cementation bar iron is first
changed, by a comparatively small dose of carbon, into steel.
If   this steel, by accident or intention, be continued some
what longer in the furnace under an increased temperature,
 an excess of affinity is established betwixt the metal and the
 charcoal without the presence of a third principle : the steel
becomes gradually more and more carbonated : it changes
 its fracture of granulation, if I may be allowed the term,
from that peculiar to blistered steel, through nil those breaks
 peculiar to the respective qualities of crude iron ; and may
 at last pass into the state of a carburet of iron totally different
 in its properties and appearance from either steel or crude
 iron. This process may be carried on to the utter exclusion
 of atmospheric air ; and here, if the process is stopped in its
 proper stages, will be found all the various qualities of crude
 iron formed without perfect fusion, where we cannot con
 ceive oxvgen to have existed.
    I am aware of adducing circumsiances from these experi
 ments, at variance with the present received opinions upon
 the constituent parts of cast iron, and also in opposition to
 principles which I have formerly laid down.         I wish not the
 present hints to be considered as assertions.      As irreconcil
 able in some degree with former opinions, I wisli they may
 lead to an ample investigation of the subject.        The distinc
 tion hitherto made betwixt crude iron and steel, particularly
                                                                  by

by the French chemists, has been, that crude iron was the
metal imperfectly reduced, but that the latter was iron per
fectly reduced, combined with a small portion of carbon.
The fact, however, of malleable iron passing into the state of
fine crude iron without the contact of an oxygenous body,
puts it upon a similar footing with steel, only altered by a
greater comparative quantity of carbon.     This reduces us to
the necessity of drawing one of the two following conclu
sions: that steel       is,
                     equally as crude iron,     combination of       a
iron, carbon, and oxygen     or, that crude iron differs from
                                          ;

saturated. —The communication       which -shall be forwarded

II.   Memoir on Gluten.                   By    Charles Louis Cadet,                          of
                   the College        of      Pharmacy,           Paris *.
T.HE            chemistswho have made researches
the glutinous principle of vegetables, ar.d particularly that of
                                                                   regard to    in

and caustic alkalies.      When the gluten indeed               fresh, these   is

but, however,          by

the agglutinative property.         These    solutions    have  not yet af
forded any application      useful   to  the  arts;  and   gluten itself, in
its natural state, has been employed only to cement broken
china  ;  but, when gluten has experienced                commencement
                                                                     a

proved     by
            the  following experiments                       :
 I   put into an earthen veisel about three hectogrammes of
gluten extracted from wheat in the usual manner.                        This
vessel was placed in        damp  a  hot-bed      at  the  end
                                                             :  of  seven or
eight days    the surface   of the    gluten    became    brown,     and co
vered with white byffus similar to that which vegetates on
ripening fruit.       removed this byssus, and continued to ob

acid liquor. On the twenty-fifth day the odour was stronger,
but always acescent and, on removing the sort of skin which
                              ;

viscid, and bad a great resemblance to grayish white glue.
In this state I employed it for making the following trials :
    I triturated four grammes of this glue in a glass mortar,
after having poured over it some drops of alcohol.                 The
gluten appeared       to  me    to  dissolve.  I gradually   added  al
cohol, and thus brought the gluten to the liquid consistence
of thick syrup. I increased the quantity of alcohol, hoping
lo obtain a complete solution ; but when the quantity of al
cohol was nearly double that of the gluten, the latter suddenly
separated, reappeared under its first form, and it was impos
sible for me to charge the solution more.            I filtered the al
cohol, which passed with a flight amber colour.
    To ascertain whether this solution contained much gluten.
I  poured over it an equal volume of distilled water : the mix
ture immediately became white like an emulsion, and suf
fered to be flowly deposited an abundant precipitate, which
had the appearance of a fecula, but which, when more closely
examined, appeared to be gluten very much divided. The al
coholic solution of gluten, when left for fifteen months in a
flask stopped with cork, deposited a part of the gluten in the
 form of a white, thick, elastic membrane, which shrinked
 when exposed to heat, burned in the manner of animal mat
ters, and had a great resemblance to white caout-chouc
formed from the juice of the heræa.
     I evaporated, at a gentle heat, the remainder of the solu
tion, and obtained dry gluten, brittle, yellowish at the sur
face, and shining like beautiful varnish.
    It results from these experiments, that the gluten which
has experienced acid fermentation is in a great part soluble
in alcohol. This effect is owing, no doubt, to the acetous
acid which is formed by the fermentation, and which breaks
the force of the aggregation of the gluten ; for I kneaded the
fresh gluten a long time in alcohol without being able to
dissolve a sensible quantity.          This chemical fact is of very
little importance in itself, but it suggests some useful applica
tions.
    Having brought the fermented gluten to the consistence of
syrup by means of alcohol, I spread this thick solution with
a brush over different bodies, such as wood, glass, and paper.
It dried speedily, and formed a transparent varnish, which
adhered strongly and did not become scaly.            Paper varnished
in this manner might be substituted for that brought from
England under the name of papur h cautere *.
    The fermented gluten, diluted in acetous acid, furnished a

ironmongery   goods are usually lapped up. — Edit.

varnish nearly similar; but that obtained by an alcoholic
solution of gluten evaporated to the consistence of syrup is
preferable.
    I employed this varnish to preserve several objects of na
tural history from the influence of damp air. As it possesses a
certain decree of elasticity, I consider it to be equally proper
for varnishing anatomical preparations. It is more conve
nient than fresh glue for cementing broken porcelain.
    This first trial necessarily conducted to the idea of employ
ing the solution of gluten as an excipient of different colour
ing matters.      I mixed then a certain quantity of glutinous
varnish with white oxide of lead, minium, indigo, and car
mine, and obtained colours more or less bound, but which
were all easily extended with the pencil, which adhered
strongly even to glass, dried speedily, and had no disagree
able odour.      I remarked that the vegetable colours mixed
with greater facility than the oxides.
    As I formed these mixtures in mortars of glass or agate,
I did not obtain colours so homogeneous as if I had ground
them on porphyry.         When these colours are well prepared,
that is to fay, when the proportion of the colouring matter
does not exceed that of the gluten, the painting may be
washed without any fear of altering             unLss rude friction
                                              it,
be employed.
    This gluten presents then to artists new kind of painting,
                                           a
less solid, perhaps, than oil painting, which experience         will
determine, but perhaps less susceptible of changing               by
                                                                 the
action of air and light.     It  would be attended with two grea*
advantages in. printing figures or paintings — that of speedily
drying, and of not exposing the persons who inhabit apart
ments newly painted to any of those accidents frequently oc
casioned by oil painting.
    As the price of alcohol might render this painting dear,           I
tried to prepare colours with glutinous varnish made         by
                                                             means
of acetous acid; but was never able to mix
                         I                              itwith any
oxide: the gluten immediately separated itself, and was pre
cipitated in   a  more solid form than   it had before its solution:
it   istherefore necessary to employ alcohol      but the common
                                                    ;
alcoholic products, fold commonly in the shops under the
name of varnifbers' spirit    of  ivine, may be employed.
    If this painting were adopted,    it    would be necessary that
the gluten should be found in sufficient quantity and at low      a
price.    It might be furnished     by   the starch-makers,   ifthey
substituted for their method of operation         process analogous
                                                    a
 to that employed   in    the laboratories for separating the starch
from gluten.   It  would be easy to construct     machine to tritu •

 entirely freed from any amylaceous principle.             But before
 this object can be carried into execution, it will be necessary
 that various trials should be made by artists to ascertain whe
 ther the glutinous solution has the properties requisite for
 painting, or at least fo|r varnishing.
      Chemists mav, however, employ it in the mean time as
 luting.    I mixed with fermented gluten diluted in alcohol a
 certain quantity of quicklime: ammonia and caloric were
 disengaged, and the mixture assumed a soft consistence. With
 this paste I luted several vessels, placed over them bands of
 linen dipped in the solution of gluten, and besprinkled them
 with quicklime : they soon adhered with such force that I
 think this luting preferable to that prepared with the whites
 of eggs.
     It appears  to me to result from these exeperiments     :
     ist, That  fresh gluten is insoluble in alcohol.
     2d, That it   becomes soluble when it has undergone acid
fermentation.
    3d, That the alcoholic solution of gluten is precipitated
by water.
    4th, That this solution, evaporated to the consistence of
 syrup, furnishes a varnish which may be employed in the arts.
    5th, That fermented gluten diluted in alcohol becomes an
excipient of colouring matters, and makes them adhere to
the smoothest bodies.
    6th, That vegetable colouring substances combine with
gluten better than others.
    7th, That painting where gluten has been used dries very
soon, has no noxious odour, and may be washed.
    8th, That a very strong and tenacious luting may be made
with gluten and lime.
  III.   Observations   on tbe Acetic and Acetous       Acids.   By
                         C. DARRAca*.
   X   HE numerous opinions of chemists on the difference
between the acetic and acetous acids have induced me to
make a few researches on the subject.           But before I give an
account of my experiments I sliall mention a few of those of
the modern chemists, and also the conclusions which they
have drawn from them.
    C. Adet read a memoir in the Institute, on the nth Thet-
                * From the A finales dc Cblmie, No. nx.
                                                              midor,

                on tba Acetic and Acetous Acids.                13
midor, year 6, on the acetic acid, published in the Annales
de Cbimie of the same year.          By very interesting and well-
performed experiments       C.  Adet   endeavoured to prove that
there did not exist two acids of vinegar, and he concluded
from them, that the acetous acid is constantly at the highest
degree of oxygenation ; that it is consequently in the state of
acetic acid ; and, in the last place, that the difference which
exists between the acetous and acetic acid seems to depend
on the less quantity of water contained in the latter, and not
on a greater proportion of oxygen, as before believed. I shall
not describe his experiments, as they are too numerous ;          I
shall only observe that they are very exact.
    In the month of Brumaire, year 7, C. Chaptal published
his observations on the fame subject *. By new experiments
he combats not those of C. Adet, but the consequences he
has deduced from them.          He however does not consider the
acetic acid as more oxygenated than the acetous acid, but
only as containing less carbon ; he mentions several experi
ments which seem to support his theory, and particularly the
distillation of acetite of copper. This celebrated chemist fays,
that when this salt is distilled the acetous acid is decarbonized;
a part of this carbon combines itself with the oxygen of the
oxide of the copper, and escapes in carbonic acid ; while the
other remains in its natural state in the retort with the me
tallic oxide, and while the acetous acid, thus deprived of a
portion of its carbon, pastes into the receiver in the state of
acetic acid.    A number of other experiments are quoted in
support of this reasoning; but I shall not describe them as
they are printed, I (hall only describe those made by myself.
   To ascertain whether the acetic acid was more oxygenated
than the acetous acid, I repeated some of C. Adet's experi
ments, which I found to be perfectly correct ; but it would
be useless to describe them, since all those chemists acquainted
with them are agreed in regard to the oxygenation of the
acetic and acetous acids ; but it will not be improper, per
haps, to mention some new ones which seem to support this
theory.
    As the two acids in question differ a great deal by their
concentration, I brought them before I employed them to
 the fame degree ; and for this purpose employed the specific
gravity of pure acetous acid, which was 1 "007 : on the other
 nand, I mixed with the acetic acid a sufficient quantity of
distilled water until its density was equal to that of i-oo7, or
 of acetous acid.     In this state there is very little difference
                * Annales de Cbimie, vol. xxviii. p. 113,

 14                   Darracq's  Observations
 between    these two acids,  only that the acetic   acid emits  a
 very slight empyreumatic odour.
    I took 2000 parts of acetous acid, which I put into a retort
 with 500 parts of nitric acid. The apparatus being properly
disposed for collecting the liquid and gaseous products, the
mixture was carried to the state of ebullition, and continued
till the 2000 parts nearly of the acetous acid employed were
distilled.    No gas passed during the operation, and the pro
duct, when examined, sliowed no mark of alteration, its spe
cific gravity being equal to that of the acid employed, that is
to fay, i"007. When combined with oxide of lead, I ob
tained, by proper evaporation, a crystallized salt, which was
found to be common acetite of lead : it appears to be nearly
certain that the acetous acid experienced no change during
this operation; its odour was neither stronger nor more pe
netrating than that of the acetous acid employed, and its sa
vour was neither stronger nor more pungent.
    By a second experiment I again endeavoured to oxygenate,
if possible, the acetous acid. For this purpose I prepared
what was necessary to obtain oxygenated muriatic acid gas,
and the apparatus being arranged the gas was received in a
flask containing acetous acid : after more than a sufficient
quantity had passed over, the apparatus was unluted, and the
acid collected was carefully examined.
    As the odour of the oxygenated muriatic acid conceals that
of the acetous acid, the product was placed in a capsule, and
exposed to a gentle heat.    When the greater part of the oxy
genated muriatic acid had been destroyed, the acetous acid
exhibited no sensible change; its- savour only appeared to bo
stronger ; on account, no doubt, of the muriatic acid which
it contained. When combined, like that of the first experi
ment, with oxide of lead, I obtained a needle-formed crys
tallization of muriate of lead ; and then a second salt, perfectly
similar to common acetite of lead, and to that of the first ex
periment. I am therefore of opinion, especially when I call to
mind the numerous experiments of C. Adet, that we may assert
that there do not exist two degrees of oxygenation in vinegar.
Other experiments would be superfluous, since, as I have
already laid, chemists are agreed on this point; but that on
which opinions differ, is in regard to the different proportions
of the carbon : the experiments I made on this subject I (hall
here describe.
    Exp. I. After having brought    the acetic and acetous acids,
as  in the former cafe, to the fame degree of specific gravity,
I  saturated a given quantity of pure ana crystallized carbonate

to me to be nearly equal.       When I had evaporated these two
salts to dryness, they both presented themselves under the
form of laminae, of a savour equally pungent and hot, and,
at last, urinous and alkaline ; in a word, no difference could
be observed between them.
     For the present, I sliall call the one acetite of pota/b, and
that made with acetic acid acetate.        I took 576 parts of each
of these salts, which had been evaporated and brought as far
 as possible to the same degree of desiccation, and put them
 into two glass retorts. They were exposed in a furnace to an
 equal heat, and during the distillation the same phænomena
 were observed.     Some drops of a liquor slightly coloured, and
 of an acrid savour, passed over into the two receivers. This
 liquor increased in a sensible manner till the end of the di-          . .
 stillation ; and after exposure to a strong heat there remained
 in the two retorts a carbonaceous matter, which was treated
 with boiling water in order to remove by washing all the al
 kaline part mixed with the carbon. Being separately filtered,
 there remained in the filters two light residuums known to
  be charcoal.     The two filters which contained them were
  placed in a stove for 24 hours, and consequently were dried
  nearly in an equal degree.      In this state the two portions of
  charcoal being weighed, that of the acetite weighed 22 '- parts,
  while that of the acetate weighed only 22. It is seen by this
  result that the difference is exceedingly small, and that there
  is reason to believe that the degree of the desiccation of the
  residuums, or of the salts employed, may be the cause of the
  small quantity of charcoal which the acetite furnished more
   than the acetate.
       Exp. II. I saturated crystallized carbonate of soda with
   equal quantities of the acetous and acetic acid, and, by re
   peated evaporations, I obtained the two salts crystallized in
   the fame manner: they exhibited striated prisms, among
   which I remarked some hexaedral ; their savour was equally
   pungent and bitter, and their colour white and brilliant.
       These two salts, well crystallized, were dried in an equal
   degree between filtering paper in a place (lightly heated,
   where they were left till the paper was no longer moistened.
   I  then took, as in the former experiment, 576 parts of acetite
   and acetate of soda, and put them into two retorts : these two
   salts, exposed to a graduated heat, first became liquid : in pro
   portion as I augmented the heat they became black, and
    there passed over into the two receivers liquors slightly co
                                                                loured,

   16                   Darracq's  Observations
   loured, in which floated a kind of oil, the quantities of which
   were apparently equal.      After strongly "rging the fire, there
  remained in the two retorts black rehduums, which I treated
  with boiling water as in the first experiment. The charcoals
   remaining in the filters were dried in a stove, and then
  weighed : that produced by the acetate of soda weighed eight
  parts, and that produced by the acetite eight parts and a
  half.    These two residuums when examined were found to
  be charcoal, similar to that obtained by the acetite and ace
  tate of potash.    This experiment, which on account of the
  crystallization of the salts ought to be considered as correct,
  since the proportions of the constituent parts of the salts were
  found to be the fame, explains what we have already an
  nounced, why the acetite of potash gave a little more char
  coal than the acetate.    There is reason, no doubt, to believe
  that it arose from the greater or less desiccation of the salts,
  and the manner in which they were burnt, since in the se
  cond experiment I found not only the same quantity of char
  coal in the residuum of the acetate of soda, but even a small
 quantity more than in the acetite.
     Exp. III. Being persuaded, by the results of these two ex
  periments, that the acetous was not more carbonized than the
 acetic acid, I made as a new proof the following experiment :
 I put equal parts of sulphate of copper and acetite of lead, both
 crystallized, pulverized, and mixed, into a retort, which was
 placed in a furnace over an open fire, joined to the retort an
 adapter and a receiver, and to the latter a bent tube to collect
 the elastic fluids.   At a verv gentle heat there pasted over a
 white liquid, which increafeu without changing its colour:
 the fire being continued a considerable time that I might
 obtain all the acetic acid, no other gas pasted over but a part
 of the air of the vessels ; the heat was continued till the glass
 retort began to enter into fusion, upon which it was taken
from the fire.      There remained a residuum of a reddish yel
low colour, the weight of which was equal to two-thirds that
of the mixture employed : the liquid obtained had a perfect
resemblance      to pure acetic acid, its weight was equal to a
third of the quantities employed. A similar experiment is
described in the Annales de Cbimie by C. Badolier; but its
object, indeed, was different from that of the present one, it
was published merely for the purpose of giving a simple and
economical process for obtaining radical vinegar. The au
thor, however, observes very justly that no carbonic acid was
disengaged, as was the cafe in my operation ; nor did I ob
tain a tingle atom of acid gas. I endeavoured also to discover
whether any carbon remained in the residuum ; a rigorous
                                                     examination

                   en the Acetic and Acetous Acids.              17
 examination showed that none existed.           This experiment
 with that above described seems evidently to prove that
 acetous acid is not more carbonized than acetic acid ; for it
  is certain that, if it contained more, the excess above that
 necessary to constitute the acetic acid produced would have re
 mained in the residuum.
     However conclusive my experiments might be in my own
 opinion, I ought not to lose fight of that of Chaptal, since it
 is described in the observations I have quoted. Having di
 stilled then, with a proper apparatus, 576 parts crystallized
 acetite of copper, there passed over into the receiver a white
 liquor, which was coloured by the progress of the distillation,
 and which became green by the copper: this liquid was
 acetic acid.     Before the distillation there were disengaged
 65    inches  of a gaseous fluid, which, when examined, was
 found to be a mixture of carbonic acid gas and hydrogen gas :
 the residuum, of a blackish brown colour, being treated with
 muriatic acid, the latter dissolved the oxide of copper, and
 left a powder slightly black, which was collected on a filter:
 this black matter, when edulcorated, dried, and then sub
jected to chemical examination, was found to be charcoal,
 the weight of which was 22 parts.         As this result was per
 fectly similar to that described by the chemists, it was neces
 sary to examine whether the consequences they deduced from
it were very exact ; for it may be asked, why the acetous
 acid was decarbonized under these circumstances alone, and
not in that of which I here give an account. Presuming that
 I should find a solution of this question by means of compa
 rative experiments, I made the following:
     I  prepared acetate of copper by dissolving oxide of copper
 in acetic acid diluted with water, and by proper evaporation
I obtained a salt crystallized in octaedra. Of this salt, when
dried to the fame degree as the acetite of copper, I introduced
576 parts in a retort, and exposed it to heat : it exhibited ex
 actly the same phænomena as the acetite.        I obtained nearly
 equal quantities of hydrogen gas and carbonic acid.           The
liquid, when collected in the receiver, had the fame colour;
when examined comparatively with that produced by the
acetite, it was impossible to find any difference between them.
The residuum, of a blackifli brown colour, was treated with
muriatic acid, which dissolved the oxide of copper, and left a
black matter, which floated on the liquid.        This matter, se
parated by means of the filter, and dried on a stove, being
subjected      to analysis, was found to be charcoal perfectly
similar to that of the preceding experiment: it had abl'o-
     Vol.XIII. No. 49.              B                        luteiy

18                     Darracq's    Observations
lutely the same weight as that produced bv the distillation of
the acetite of copper; that is to fay, it weighed 22 parts.
   From this result it is evident that the charcoal obtained by
distilling acetite of copper does not arise from the acetous
acid containing more than the acetic acid, since the latter,
when subjected to the same operation, gives an equal quan
tity.   In mv opinion, that produced in these operations does
not arise from a portion os the acid decomposed, the quan
tities of which ought to vary according to the progress of the
decomposition.         Experience authorizes me to believe that
the difference which may exist between the two acids in
question     does not depend either on the proportions of the
oxygen     or of the charcoal.       I superintended some trials, not
on the constituent principles of vinegar, but on vinegar itself,
and the kind of mucilage with which it is accompanied.
Before I describe this labour I must not forget to observe that
C. Chaptal furnislied me with the idea by his observations
on the acetic and acetous acids. He fays on this subject,
that the acid of vinegar may be considered as existing primi
tively in a state almost saponaceous; which diminishes its
action, and weakens its properties.
    After having ascertained, by some experiments, the exist
ence of this extractive or mucilaginous principle, I endea
voured to separate it.         Distillation as well as filtration were
found to be imperfect means : my vinegar always contained
mucilage: it remained nearly the fame. However, by com
bining    it,  after distillation, with alkaline bases,    it    deposited
very   little   of  that  flaky   matter     called    extraBive   m tier.
Having not forgot, during these researches, the opinion of
C. Adet, who lays that the quantity of water might occasion
the difference between the acetous and acetic acids, com
paring the observations of these two chemists,          I     made some
experiments, which appear to me to be interesting; but                I
(hall describe that only which appeared to me to be most
conclusive.
    Entertaining the idea that there was no difference between
the acetous acid and the acetic, but         a    larger quantity of wa
ter, and an extractive or mucilaginous matter,         I     endeavoured
to find the proper means ot separating the former from                 it,
and bringing     it  to the (late of acetic acid. For this purpose,
[  prepared   muriate    of lime, which  I    strongly calcined. Afier
reducing  it   to  powder, I    putit   into a     tubulated retort, and
poured over     it common acetous acid with an apparatus proper
for receiving tbe products. The retort, which was on            a    sand-
bath, being exposed to     a    gentle  heat,  the   matter  immediately
                                                                 entered

                  on the Acetic            and Acetous Acids.            19
                                                                 1
entered into ebullition, on account                of
                                                  the heat produced by
the calcareous salt in solidifying the         major part of the water
contained in the vinegar.              During this distillation there
pasted over a clear liquor, which fell in striæ on the sides of
the adaptor, and which was collected in a receiver.                 This
liquor totally changed in appearance ; had a stronger and
more pungent favour than the acetous. acid employed, and
its odour was sharper and more penetrating: one might have
taken it for diluted radical vinegar.             This product, when
subjected to a second distillation with dried muriate of lime,
acquired a little more strength : after a third and a fourth,
rectification, a transparent liquor was obtained, of an odour
and savour very similar to that of common acetic acid.
During these rectifications, not an atom of charcoal was
deposited.      To ascertain whether the acid obtained, in losing
a great quantity of its water, had lost also the mucilaginous
matter which accompanied                     it,

crystallized carbonate of potafli in vain did  :           add an excess

of this salt, for nothing was precipitated; whereas common
 acetous acid, by          similar saturation, precipitates
                           a                                        flaky

matter, which      is   collected in the bottom of the vessel em
 ployed.
     Though the strong and penetrating odour of the acetic
 acid obtained     by  the simple means above described was suf
 ficient to induce me to conclude that              was really similar to
                                                        it

 acetic acid obtained           by I
                                 rectification alone with muriate of
 lime, that  it   is far more agreeable than the acetic acid pro

                                by
 and especially when they are diluted with water.              The latter
 then assumes     a   disagreeable empyreumatic odour, and an
 oily savour, arising from         portion of acetic acid which has
                                       a

                           by
a   kind of oil which the acid retains in combination.                The
 other, on the contrary, passes only to the state of common
 acid of vinegar bv preserving an agreeable pungency.                 Be
  fore any conclusion can be drawn from the preceding results,

 covered the eliminate of iron in France, sent, about eiuht

months ago, to C. Vauquelin a flask containing a liquor
obtained by the distillation of vinegar on a large scale.              As
C. Pontier was not ignorant that the first product of the di
stillation of the acetous acid is aqueous, he separated it from
that which followed.         Aster uniting several phlegms of the
fame kind, he was much astonished to find that these phlegms
had a very agreeable aromatic odour : having discovered, by
preliminary trials, the properties which gave this product a
similarity to ethereal liquors, he rectified all the supposed
phlegms, and by these means obtained a peculiar ether,
which Vauquelin found to be acetic ether completely rec
tified.
    From an identity so striking in the experiments above de
scribed, it is evident that there exists no difference between
the constituent parts of the acetic and acetous acids; that the
water, and mucilaginous or extractive matter, are the only
two apparent differences observed in these two acids ; and,
consequently, that there exists only one acid of vinegar,
which being at its maximum of oxygenation, ought, ac
cording to the chemical nomenclature, to be distinguished by
the name of acetic acid. In future, therefore, there will not
exist two different kinds of salts, either by the combination
of distilled vinegar or of radical vinegar ; they will hereafter
be so many products, the names of which must be the fame ;
and hence acetates will exist, and not acetites.

as all tenacious foils are pulverized in the best manner in dry

their contact broken, the propriety of taking the advantage
of working them in that state will be obvious : and at the

V. Description of a newly invented Undershot IVatcr-tvheel.
                   By Mr. J. Besant, of Bromplon* .
           SIR,
 I       BF.G leave to lay before the Society some observations
 respecting the common undershot water-wheel, and to point
 out the superiority of that of my invention.
      isi, In common water-wheels more than half the water
 passes     from the gate through the wheel, without giving it any
 assi   (lance.
      2d Iy ,  The   floats coming out of the tail-water are resisted
 with       almost   the whole weight of the atmosphere at the in
 stant they leave the surface of the water.
      3<dly, The lame quantity of water which pasted between
 the floats at the head, must of course pass between them at
 the. tail, and consequently impede the motion of the wheel.
      In the water-wheel of my invention,
      ist, No water can pass but what acts, with all its force,
 on the extremity of the wheel.
      2dly, The floats coming out of the water in an oblique
 direction, prevent the weight of the atmosphere from taking
 any effect.
      3dly, Although the new water-wheel is heavier than that
 on the old construction, yet it runs lighter on its axis, the
 water having a tendency lo float it.
      4thlv, By experiments made with the models, proofs have
  been shown that the new wheel has many advantages over
  the common wheel; and that, when it works in deep tail—
  water, it will carry weights in proportion of three to one,
  so that it will be particularly serviceable for tide-mills.
       I hope on trial, before the Society, my invention will
  prove successful ; and am, Sir,

 JL   HE  concordance of     variety of facts seems to render
                                       a                                             it
most indisputable, that certain stony and metalline substances
have, at different periods, fallen on the earth.       Whence
their origin, or whence they came,     yet, in my judgment,
                                                   is
involved     in
             complete obscurity.
   The accounts of these peculiar substances, in the early
annals, even of the Royal Society, have unfortunately been
blended with relations which we now consider as fabulous;
and the more antient histories of stones fallen from heaven,
from Jupiter, or from the clouds, have evidently con
founded such substances with what have been termed ce-
raunia, bœtilia, ombria, brontia, &c. names altogether un-
appropriate to substances fallen on our globe.   Indeed some
mislead, and others are inexpressive.
   The term ceraunia,       misnomer, deduced from ils sup
                                  by   a
posed origin, seems, as well as batdia\, to have been an-

24                      Experiments and Observations
tiently used to denote many species of stones, which were
             and shaped into various forms, though mostly wedge-
  ike or triangular, sometimes as instruments, sometimes as
fiolifhed
oracles, and iometimes as deities. The import of the names
ombria, brontia, &c. seems subject to the same uncertainty.
    In very early ages it was believed that stones did in reality
fall, as it was said, from heaven, or from the gods; these,
either from ignorance, or perhaps from superstitious views,
were confounded with other stones, which, by their compact
aggregation, were better calculated to be sliaped into different
instruments, and to which it was convenient to attach a spe
cies of mysterious veneration.                  In modern days, because ex
plosion     and   report     have    generally accompanied the descent of
such substances, the name of thunderbolt, or thunderstone,
has ignorantly attached itself to them ; and because a variety
of substances accidentally present near buildings and trees
struck with lightning have, with the fame ignorance, been
collected as thunderbolts, the thunderbolt and the fallen
metalline substance have been ranked in the same class of
absurdity. Certainly, since the phænomena of lightning and
electricity have been so well identified, the idea of a thunder
bolt is ridiculous.           But the existence of peculiar substances
fallen on the earth, I cannot hesitate to assert ; and on the
concordance of remote and authenticated facts I fliall rest
the assertion.
     Mr. King, the learned author of " Remarks concerning
 Stones said to have fallen from the Clouds, in these Days,
and in antient Times," has adduced quotations of the greatest
 antiquity, descriptive of the descent of fallen stones ; and,
 could it be thought necessary to add antique testimonies to
those instanced           by so profound an antiquarian, the quota
tions of Mons. Falconet, in his papers upon bœtilia, inserted
 in the Hijhire des Inscriptions et Bellcs-Lettres* ; the quota
 tions in Zahn's Specula Pbyjico-mathematica Hi)loriana\ ;
 the Fijica Sotterranea of Giac'mto Gemma ; the works of
 Pliny, and others, might be referred to.
     Dr. Chladni, in his " Observations on the Mass of Tron
 found in Siberia, and on other Masses of the like Kind," as
 well as in his " Observations on Fire-balls and hard Bodies
 fallen from the Atmosphere,"                     has collected almost every
 modern instance of phænomena of this nature.

Portugal Feb. 19, 1796, and was taken, still warm, from
the ground *.
   The first of these peculiar substances with which chemistry
has interfered, was the stone presented by the abbe Bachelay
to the Royal French Academy.           It was found on the 13th
of Sept. 1768, yet hot, by persons who saw it fall. It is
described as follows t :
    " The substance of this stone is of a pale ash-gray colour;
when examined with a magnifying glass, it is found to be
interspersed with a multitude of smalT brilliant metallic points
of a pale yellow colour; its exterior surface, that which, ac
cording to the abbe Bachelay, was not engaged in the earth,
was covered with a small and very thin stratum of a blackish
matter, puffed up in some places, and which appeared to have
been fused.      This stone, when the interior of it was struck
with steel, produced no sparks : on the other hand, when
struck on the thin external stratum, which appeared to have
been attacked by sire, some few sparks were elicited."
   The specific gravity of this stone was as 3535 to 1000.
   The academicians analysed the stone, and found it to contain
               Sulphur                                  8^

                                                     100
    Of their mode of       analysis, I (hall have occasion to speak
hereafter.    Th ;y   were   induced to conclude, that the stone,
presented to the academy by the abbe Bachelay, did not owe
its origin to thunder; that it did not fall from heaven; that
it was not formed by mineral substances, fused by lightning;
and that it was nothing but a species of pyrites, without pe
culiarity, except as to the hepatic smell disengaged from it by
marine acid. " That this stone, which was, perhaps, covered
by a small stratum of earth or turf, may have been struck
with lightning, and thus uncovered : the heat may have
been sufficiently great to fuse the surface of the part struck,
but it may not have been long enough continued to be able
to penetrate to the inside : on this account, the stone has not
been decomposed.        The quantity of metallic matters it con
tains, opposing less resistance than another body to the cur
rent of the electric matter, may perhaps have contributed to
determine the direction of the lightning."
   The memoir is however concluded, by observing it to be

original words of the author : we have substituted faithful translations.—

  26                  Experiments and Observations
 sufficiently singular, that M. Morand le fils had presented a
 fragment of a (lone, from the environs of Coutances, also
 said to have fallen from heaven, which only differed from
 that of the abbe Bachelav because it did not exhale the he
 patic smell with spirit of salt.          Yet the academicians did not
 think any conclusion could be drawn from this resemblance,
 unless that the lightning had fallen by preference on pyritical
 matter*.
     Mons. Barthokf, professeur a l'ecole centrale du Haut-
 Rhrn, gave, I believe, the next, and lasts, analytical account
 of what he also denominates pierrede tonnerre. He describes
 it thus : — " The mass of stone known under the name of
plerre de tonnerre d' E'ijT/leim, weighing about two quintals,
 has its exterior form rounded, almost oval, is rugged, and of
 a dull earthy appearance.
     " The ground of the          stone is of a blueisli gray colour in
terspersed with insulated crystals of pyrites, the crystallization
of which is confused, in some places scaly, accumulated,
 forming nodes and small veins, which traverse it in every
direction: the pyrites is of a golden colour : polishing gives
 it the splendour of steel, and, when exposed to the atmolphere,
it becomes tarnished and brown.                  One may distinguish also
with the naked          eye gray scaly iron ore, not sulphureous,
susceptible     of being   attracted by the magnet, little oxidated,
or approaching much to the metallic state.
    " The fracture is irregular, granulated, of a grain some
what compact : in the inside very small fissures are seen. It
does not strike fire with steel : its texture is so soft, that it
readily suffers itself to be attacked by a knife. By pounding,
it is   easily reduced to a blueish gray powder of an earthy
odour. Sometimes there are found small crystals of iron ore,
which present a greater resistance to the blows of the stamper."
    The specific gravity of the piece in professor Barthold's pos
session was 3233, distilled water being taken at 1000.

occasion to speak hereafter, gave in the 100,

   From the       external    characters, and from his analysis, the
protestor  considers      the stone of Knsistieim to be argillo-ferru-
ginous ; and is of opinion, that ignorance and superstition
have attributed to it a miraculous existence, at variance with
the first notions of natural philosophy *.
    The account next in succession is already printed in the
Transactions of the Royal Society ; but cannot be omitted,
as it immediately relates to one of the substances I have ex
amined.      I allude to the letter received by Sir William Ha
milton from the earl of Bristol, dated from Sienna, July 12,
j 794: — " In the midst of a most violent thunder-storm,
about a dozen stones, of various weights and dimensions,
fell at the feet of different persons, men, women, and chil
dren. The stones are of a quality not found in any part of
 the Siennese territory : they fell about eighteen hours after
the enormous eruption of mount Vesuvius ; which circum
 stance leaves a choice of difficulties in the solution of" this
extraordinary phænomenon.                lither these stones have been
 generated    in this igneous mass of clouds, which produced
 such unusual thunder; or, which is equally incredible, they
 were thrown from Vesuvius, at a distance of at least
                                                                 250 miles;
judge then of its parabola. The philosophers here incline to
 the first solution.       I wish much, Sir, to know your senti
 ments.     My     first objection was to the fact itself ; but of this
 there are so many eye witnesses, it seems impossible to with
 stand their evidence." (Phil. Trans. for 1795, p. 303.)                 Sir
 William Hamilton, it seems, also received a piece of one of
 the largest stones, which weighed upwards of five pounds;
  and had seen another which weighed about one.                    He like
 wise observed, that the outside of every stone which had been
 found, and had been ascertained to have fallen from the
 clouds, near Sienna, was evidently frestily vitrified, and was
  black, having every fign of having passed through an extreme
  heat; the inside was of a light gray colour, mixed with black
  spots and some Alining particles, which the learned there had
  decided to be pyrites.
     In 1796 a stone weighing 56 pounds was exhibited in
  London, with several attestations of persons who, on the
  13th of December 1795, saw it fall, near Wold Cottage, in
  Yorkshire, at about three o'clock in the afternoon.                It had
  penetrated     through twelve inches of foil and six inches
  of solid chalk rock; and, in burying itself, had thrown up
  an immense quantity of earth to a great distance: as it fell,
  a number of explosions were heard, about as loud as pistols.

  33                 Experiments and Observations
 In   the  adjacent villages, the sounds heard were taken for
 guns at sea;     but, at two adjoining villages, were so distinct
 of something singular pasting through the air, towards ihe
 habitation of Mr. Topham, that five or fix people came up
 to see if any thing extraordinary had happened to his house
 or grounds.       When the stone was extracted, it was warm,
 smoked, and smelt very strong of sulphur.             Its course, as far
 as eould be collected from different accounts, was from the
 south-west.       The day was mild and hazy, a fort of weather
 very frequent in the Wold hills, when there are no winds or
 storms; but there was not any thunder or lightning the
 whole day. No such stone is known in the country. There
 was no eruption in the earth ; and, from its form, it could
 not come from any building; and, as the day was not tem
 pestuous, it did not seem probable that it could have been
 forced from any rocks, the nearest of which are those of
 Flamborough Head, at a distance of twelve miles *. The
 nearest volcano I believe to be Hecla in Iceland.
     The exhibition of this stone as a fort of (how, did not tend
 to accredit the account of its descent, delivered in a hand
 bill at the place of exhibition ; much less could it contribute
 to remove the objections made to the fall of the stones pre
 sented to the Royal French Academy.             But the right hon.
 President of the Royal Society, ever alive to the interest and
 promotion of science, observing the stone so exhibited to re
 semble a stone sent to him as one of those fallen at Sienna,
 could not be misted by prejudice : he obtained a piece of this
 extraordinary mass, and collected many references to de
 scriptions of similar phænomena.             At length, in 1 799, an
 account of stones fallen in the East Indies was sent to the
 president by John Lloyd Williams, esq. which, by its un
 questionable authenticity, and by the striking resemblance it
 bears to other accounts of fallen stones, must remove all pre
judice.      Mr. Williams has since drawn up the following
 more detailed narrative of facts.

    Williams,      Esq.  F.R.S.
    A  circumstance of      so extraordinary a nature as the fall of
 stones from     the  heavens   could not fail to excite the wonder
 and attract the attention of every inquisitive mind.
    Among a superstitious people, any preternatural appearT
 ance is viewed with silent awe and reverence : attributing the

                                                                    causes

             on certain Stony and Metalline      Substances.        sa
causes to the      will of    the Supreme Being, they do not pre
sume to judge      the   means    by which they were produced, nor
the purposes for which they were ordered ; and we are natu
rally led to suspect the influence of prejudice and superstition
in their descriptions of such phænomena : my inquiries were
therefore chiefly directed to the Europeans, who were but
 thinly dispersed about that part of the country.
    The information I obtained was, that on the            19th of De
cember 1798, about eight o'clock in the evening, a very
luminous meteor was observed in the heavens, by the inha
bitants of Benares and the parts adjacent, in the form of a.
large ball of fire ; that it was accompanied by a loud noise
 resemb'ing thunder; and that a number of stones were said
 to have fallen from it near Krakhut, a village on the north
 fide of the river Goomty, about 14 miles from the city of
 Benares.
     The meteor appeared in the western part of the hemi
 sphere, and was but a stiort time visible : it was observed by
several Europeans, as well as natives, in different parts of the
 country.
     In the neighbourhood of Juanpoor, about twelve miles
 from the spot where the stones are said to have fallen, it was
 very distinctly observed by several European gentlemen and
 ladies ; who described it as a large ball of fire, accompanied
 with a loud rumbling noise, not unlike an ill-discharged pla
 toon of musketry,         ft was also seen, and the noife heard, by
 various persons at Benares. Mr. Davis observed the light
 come into the room where he was, through a glass window,
 so strongly as to project shadows         from the bars between the
 panes,   on   a dark   coloured   carpet, very distinctly; and it ap
 peared   to  him   as  luminous    as the brightest moonlight.
     When an account of the fall of the stones reached Benares,
 Mr. Davis, the judge and magistrate of the district, sent an
 intelligent person to make inquiry on the spot.             When the
 person    arrived   at  the  village near  which  the stones  were said
 to have fallen, the natives, in answer to his inquiries, told
 him, that they had either broken to pieces, or given away to
 the teffiUar (native collector) and others, all that they had
 picked up; but thnt he might easily find some in the adjacent
 fit-Ids, whcie they would be readily discovered (the crops
 bring then not above two or three inches above the ground)
 bv tlbserviug where the earth appeared recently turned up.
  Following trule dincti mis, he sound four, which he brought
  to Mr. Davis : most of tin fe the tone of the fall had buried,
  according to a measure he produced, about (i\ inches deep,
  in rielu» which seemed to have been recently watered; and
                                                                       it

                Experiments and Observations,             &e.
it appeared, from the man's description, that they must have
lain at the distance of about a hundred yards from each other.
    What he further learnt from the inhabitants of the village
concerning the phænomenon was, that about eight o'clock
in the evening, when retired to their habitations, they ob
served a very bright light, proceeding as from the sky, ac
companied with a loud clap of thunder, which was imme
diately followed by the noise of heavy bodies falling in the
vicinity. Uncertain whether some of their deities might not
have been concerned in this occurrence, they did not ven
ture out to inquire into it until the next morning; when the
first circumstance which attracted their attention was the ap
pearance of the earth being turned up in different parts of
their fields as before mentioned, where, on examining, they
found the stones.
    The assistant to the collector of the district, Mr. Erskine,
a very intelligent young gentleman, on seeing one of the
stones, brought to him by the native superintendant of the
collections, was also induced to fend a person to that part of
the country to make inquiry; who returned with several of the
stones, and brought an account similar to that given by the
person sent by Mr. Davis, together with a confirmation of it
from the cauzy, (who had been directed to make the in
quiry,) under his hand and seal.
    Mr. Maclane, a gentleman who resided very near the vil
lage of Krakhut, gave me part of a stone that had been
brought to him the morning after the appearance of the
phænomenon, by the watchman who was on duty at his
house ; this, he laid, had fallen through the top of his hut,
which was close by, and buried itself several inches in the
floor, which was of consolidated earth. The (tone must,
by his account, previous to its having been broken, have
weighed upwards of two pounds.
    At the time the meteor appeared, the sky was perfectly

since the nth of the month, nor were any observed for
many days after.
    Of these Hones, I have seen eight, nearly perfect, besides
parts of several others, which had been broken bv the pos
sessors to distribute among their friend*.                The form of the
more perfect      one*  appeared    to  be  that  of   an   irregular cube,
rounded    off at  the edges ;  but   the  angles   were     to be observed
on most of them.          They   were    of   various   size*,  from about
three   to  upwards    of  four  inches      in  their   largest diameter ;
one of them, measuring         sour  inches     and  a  quarter, weighed
two pounds twelve ounces.             In appearance, they were ex

acthy similar : externally they were covered with a hard black
coat or incrustation, which in some parts had the appear
ance of varnish, or bitumen ; and on most of them were frac
tures, which, from their being covered with a matter similar
to that of the coat, seemed to have been made in the fall, by
the stones striking against each other, and to have passed
through some medium, probably an intense heat, previoas
to their reaching the earth.                     Internally, they consisted of a
number of small spherical bodies, of a slate colour; embedded
in a whitish gritty substance, interspersed with bright mining
spiculæ, of a metallic or pyritical nature. The spherical
bodies were much harder than the rest of the stone: the
white gritty part readily crumbled, on being rubbed with a
hard body ; and, on being broken, a quantity of it attached
itself to the magnet, but more particularly the outside coat or
crust, which appeared almost wholly attradtable bv it.
    As two of the more perfect stones which I had obtained,
as well as parts of some others, have been examined by se
veral gentlemen well versed in mineralogy and chemistry, I
 shall not attempt any further description of their constituent
parts ; nor (hall I offer anv conjecture respecting the forma
 tion of such singular productions, or even record those which
 I have heard of others, but leave the world to draw their
 own inferences from the facts above related.                        I sliall only
 observe, that it is well known there are no volcanos on the
 continent of India ; and, as far as I can learn, no stones
 have been met with in the earth, in that part of the world,
 which bear the smallest resemblance to those above described.

 duced         to give support to the assertion, that this mineral it
 found        in a natural state.            The certainty of its existence has

  rested hitherto on very flight foundations ; and, as most of
 our mineralogists have always spoken merely of probability,
 they have suffered the doubt to remain, whether the masses
 of iron which have been found were not artificial produc
 tions, or the effect of subterranean fire, &c. I must confess
 that I have myself doubted, on good grounds, of the reality
 of those specimens of supposed native iron which I have seen
 in different collections of Germany.
     If such difficulty of belief is excusable in a science where
 every thing ought to be determined by observation and ex
 perience; a mineralogist, however, ought not to persist in a
 previously adopted opinion, when he has been convinced
 of the contrary by his own eyes. A conviction of this kind
 occurred to myself the present year, and by a singular acci
 dent. A company, who are proprietors of two iron-works
 in this county, being in want of good iron-stone, and on
 that account prevented from manufacturing the iron of the
 best quality, received a letter from the neighbouring county
 of Hachcnburg containing an offer of a thousand waggon
 loads of iron-stone for five years, from a quarry of iron-stone
 which had been lately discovered at a small distance from the
 borders of this county.        The offer was accepted, and the
 iron-stone was delivered at the two works in pretty large
 masses, which were afterwards broken, according to the
 custom usual in this part of the country, with small ham
mers. After its arrival, one of the workmen put- a piece
under the hammer; but, as it resisted every effort made to
break      it,
             he was naturally induced to examine          it more nar
rowly.      He immediately carried       itto    forge   in the  neigh
                                              it a
bourhood; and the smith, having put             into the fire, forged
from       it,
             in  afew minutes, some excellent horse-shoe nails.
It   is,however, much to be regretted, that, through the           ig
norance and carelessness of the workman, this remarkable
production of nature was, in         agreat measure, destroyed.       It
weighed     altogether  four  pounds;    and  only   a few  fragments,
which had almost all been in the sire, and which exhibit on
the one fide the native iron, and on the other the forged
nails, were saved     : but these fragments are preserved bv the
possessors    with as much care as       if they were sacred relics.
One piece, which came into my possession, seems to have
been very little in the sire    :    weighs nearly half
                                    it                         apound,
has  a   shining fracture of steel gray colour,
                               a                     is  of brownish

colour on the outside running into black, and perfectly mal
leable.
    Being induced         by
                           this singular phænomenon to make
some researches in the place where             occurred,

   thither, and found a pit newly opened which had a greater
   resemblance to a quarry than an iron-mine. Some old pits,
   of no great extent, one of which forms at present a small
   bog, seemed to indicate that a mine had been here worked
   formerly; but never to any great extent, because the strata
. of iron-stone, very compa6t, half a fathom in thickness, were
   found at the depth of only half a fathom below the surface of
   the earth.
      The whole surface of the surrounding district is covered
   with huge irregular masses of basal tea, a prodigious quantity
   of which forms in the neighbouring forest a group of rocks
   known under the name of IVolfJlein, where Targe pieces of
   bafaltes are heaped upon each other, as if by art, to the
   height of nearly ten fathoms ; and, as this accumulation
   occupies a circumference of some hundred fathoms, this
   mass, in consequence of its gravity, and the pressure thence
  arising, may have deviated from its perpendicular direction,
  and produced those numerous apertures and fissures in the
  neighbourhood.       It forms a very awful appearance in the
  dark forest; which, however, is pretty much on a level, and
  excites a well-grounded fear, that, in the course of time, con
  siderable fragments of it may tumble down and crush some
   of the inhabitants who stray about in the neighbourhood,
  and who often visit this Wolfstein, which they consider as
   the ruins of an antient castle.
      About 200 fathoms to the east of the above iron-stone
  quarry lie the boundaries of the territory of Orange-Nassau;
  where the mountains evidently consist of strata, and where
  bituminous wood mav be found almost every where at a cer
  tain depth.    I (hall abstain from all further description, as a
  full account of this district mav be seen in a small work on
  this subject, written a few years ago by Mr. Becher, coun
  sellor of mines at Dillenburg, and also in the third part of the
  Mineraloojcal Description of the Country of Nassau-Orange.
  I must however observe, that near the boundaries of Nassau
  and Hachenburg the mountain changes, and the argillaceous
  state-mountains begin. The district around the iron-stone
  pits of Hachenburg consists of argillaceous slate. The stratum
  itself is composed chiefly of brown hematite almost without
  variation, in which particles of red iron ochre, lithomarga,
  and argil, occur.      The hematite is pretty fusible, and abun
  dant in metal, and produces good malleable iron.         Accord
  ing   to the account   of  the director of the  works,   who  was
 examined on the subject, the above piece of native iron was
  imbedded in a round crust of such hematite : it was some
  what grown on the one fide, and the irou-ltone on it was

very hard and compact.           He thinks he knows the place
where it was broken off, and that more of the fame kind will
hereafter be found : but this, notwithstanding the strictest
search, has not yet been the cafe.
      I am happy therefore that I have been able to give this
occasional notice of a phænomenon so remarkable in the mi
neral kingdom : if 1 receive any further information on the
 subject, I Hi all not fail to communicate it.
      The second remarkable phænomenon in the mineral king
 dom occurred to me in the county of Wachtersbach, on the
 river Kinzig, not far from the town of Gelnhausen, where I
 resided some time last summer, for the benefit of my health,
 with the reigning count. An iron-work, situated at the di
 stance of two miles from the count's palace, belongs to Mr.
 von Lilienllern, of Franckfort, and is one of the completest
 and most beautiful I have seen.         It consists of an elegant
 mansion and tavern, a large edifice for the subalterns, a cast
 ing-house, a forge, and various large and small hammers,
 which are situated so advantageously under each other that
 they can all be driven together by the fame water. The
 whole forms a small colony, and exhibits to the amateurs of
 such establishments      a most agreeable prospect,    especially as
 it is variegated by romantic walks, and agreeable fruit- and
 kitchen-gardens. The smelting of the iron-stone is performed
  in   a common high furnace.        The product, according to the
  account of the founder, may be about 24,000 pounds per
  week, which amounts to nearly 3500 pounds in 24 hours,
  The iron obtained, as far as I can judge, is malleable, and
  of a good quality ; but, in particular, very proper for cast
  work, on which alone the workmen were employed during
  two visits which I paid to the establisliment. Tney have a
  very able director, and cast not only the most beautiful round
   fire-stoves, according to the antique mode, with many appro
   priate ornaments, but also pot3 and other vessels, according
   to the demand and other circumstances.       They are eniploveci
   in making such articles, and casting the raw iron into the
   usual prismatic pigs, which is afterwards subjected to the
   operation of the different hammers.
       Notwithstanding     the great extent of the Budinger forest,
   and the private woods belonging to the count in the neigh
   bourhood, the proprietors of this iron-work have been obliged
   to purchase the necessary charcoal at a very dear rate, and to
   bring some of it from a great distance, because the numerous
   salt-works, glass-houses, and other smaller manufactories in the
   neighbourhood, naturally increase the consumption ; and the
   many rights of commonage in the Budinger iorest belonging
                                                                    to

                Peculiarities lately found in Iron-Jlcne.           35
   td the adjacent country, and the neighbouring towns and vil
   lages, who employ their privileges to the fullest extent, are a
  great impediment to the cultivation of timber.
      The iron-stone for this work is procured chiefly from the
  neighbouring principality of Isenberg-Birstein, and in par
   ticular from the district of Wenings, near which there have
   long been a great many large iron-stone works.         In all these
   the iron-stone is found in strata; and the strata in general
   are only from four or five inches to one foot in breadth ; but
  in the above-mentioned principal work they are sometimes
  •from one to two fathoms in breadth, but at present they have
  decreased to two or three feet.       The iron-stone dug up from
   the different pits, and employed at the Lilienstem work, is
   in part compact brown iron-stone, and partly brown hematite,
   which is found for the most part in pretty round hard pieces
   without much variation.       It is exceedingly argillaceous, and
  so difficult to be fused, that it requires a considerable addition
  of calcareous stone, a large quantity of which is found in the
  county of Wachteribach. In this district, at present, the
  work has only a few iron-stone pits, none of which are of
  much importance: -one of them, however, on account of the
  Angular metallurgic property of the iron-stone it produces,
  deserves the attention of mineralogists.
      Under the exterior crust there hrst occurs a strong stratum
  of white and red sandstone in alternate order, which extends
  to the distance of several miles in the neighbourhood. Under
  this lies a gray argillaceous stone, which feels somewhat greasy,
  soft, and friable, and is scarcely three inches in thicknels : be
  low this there is a stratum of excellent iron-stone of equal
  thickness, the bottom of which consists of solid sandstone, of
  a kind of millstone which frequently occurs in these districts.
  This iron-stone is different from every other kind in the
  neighbourhood; it is a compact argillaceous iron-stone of a
  reddilh brown colour and of a rough fracture, sometimes
  mixed with shells, among which there is found, though very
  seldom, a variety which has a fibrous fracture, with an al
  most metallic splendour, and seems worthy of further exa
  mination.
      When I visited this work, some masses of this compact
  iron-stone were dug up which contained charcoal.               This
  charcoal was found loose in the iron-stone, and partly grown
  into its substance and adhering to it. By what natural or
  artificial fire this charcoal was burnt, and by what singular
  revolution it was carried to the depth of from three to four
  fathoms, and there so intimately combined with the iron-

stone that           it      seems to form one body             with     it,   no mineralogist
can with certainty explain.
   The hypothesis which           have ventured
                                            I       to form of this
singular   and   certainly  uncommon       subterranean  mixture is,
that  the  charcoal   was  burnt      the   neighbourhood either in
                                                  in
the usual manner or                    by
                             natural fire, and that some fragments
of         some convulsion of nature, were thrown to the above
         it,   by
depth,    where   they united with the ferruginous matter, and
by  these  means   produced the above remarkable phænomenon.
On manv fragments one can observe the transition of the not
completely burnt wood into iron-stone; even the bark of the
wood, actually converted into iron-stone, may be clearly                                       di

_r\.FTER                     studying the works of Duhamel,                      Senebier, De
Saussure, and several other philosophers, without being able
to form any fixed opinion of the internal anatomy of vege
tables,   appeared to me that
                it               would be more advantageous
                                                    it
to study nature in her own works.     endeavoured to banish   I
from my mind every thing systematic, in order that my ob
servations might be free from every kind of bias. All vege
tables have  too much relation in the mode of the develop
ment of their organization not to exhibit great similitude.
This reflection, which naturally presents itself to the mind,
induced me to direct my first observations to one species.                                     I
made choice of the elder, as having        looser texture, and       a
easier to be observed, than that of many other vegetables.

 acquiring a knowledge of the organs of that plant.         I  used
 comparatively four or five different microscopes ; and, when
 I  supposed that I had got the whole series of facts, I tried
 the fame observations on a great number of other vegetables.
 The comparisons I then made greatly contributed to give me
 information respecting the nature and form of the organs ;
 and to obviate, by every mean possible, the illusions which
 might lead me into a false path, I begged C. Massey, my
 friend and fellow-labourer, to revise my observations, and to
 examine them with the severest criticism.       His observations
 compared with mine have either confirmed or rectified them.
     I shall now give a description of the parts which I call
•elementary organs, because all the other organs are composed
 of them.

    Of  those Parts which arc distinguished   by the naked  Eye.
    Vegetables in general are composed, as every body may
 have observed, of soft and hard parts.       Some, indeed, such,
 as mushrooms and fuci, seem to be formed entirely of a ho
mogeneous substance, pretty soft; but this class is not very
 numerous.
     The stem of the most perfect plants presents at its surface
 a  coloured substance of greater or less thickness, which is the
 bark, ft adheres strongly to the interior parts in a great many
of the monocotyledons, and sometimes even is confounded
 and connected with them in such a manner that it is impos
 sible to distinguish them. It may in this cafe be said that no
 bark exists.    This phæn'omenon is observed in the palms,
gramineous plants, &c. But in the dicotyledons and some
 monocotyledons the bark, very distinct from the rest of the
tissue, forms an exterior stratum, which may be easily de
 tached.
    Below the bark is found the wood more compact, harder,
and more connected in all its parts, and which seems to be
 formed of longitudinal fibres strongly cemented to each other.
In the monocotyledons without bark there is found, imme
diately below the epidermis, a fine transparent membrane,
which is the exterior part of the vegetable.
    The wood, as the learned Desfoutaines has said in his ex
cellent memoir on the Comparative Anatomy of Vegetables,
is distributed lengthwise in the stem and branches of the
monocotyledons in delicate threads : these threads are often
parallel, and sometimes convergent one towards the other;
they unite one and one, two and two, or divide themselves,
and become ramified in threads of still greater fineness.       All
                               C3                             these

these threads   are surrounded with a soft, elastic, spongy sub-i
fiance, easily torn, and generally whitish, which is called the
pith, and to which I shall give the name of farenebyme, that
it may not be confounded with the pith ot the dicotyledon
plants. The wood of the latter, lying always under the bark,
is not divided into distin6t threads ; it generally forms a cy
linder, in the centre of which is placed the pith, as in a cafe.
Some plants, however, evidently furnished with two cotyle
dons, exhibit ligneous filaments similar to those of the mo
nocotyledons, running along the whole length of the medul
lary canal : but these are exceptions which do not destroy the
general rule.
   In trees or shrubs with two cotyledons there are almost
always observed distinct lines of the wood, which proceed
from the pith, traverse the ligneous cylinder, and end at the
bark.    They appear on the transversal section of the trunk,
stem, branches, and twigs, like the hour-lines of a dial.
They are called the medullary radii.           They seldom stiow
themselves in the stems of the dicotyledon herbs, and do not
exist in the monocotyledons either herbaceous or ligneous.
   In the leaves, flowers, pericarpia, &c. there are found also
parts of greater or less softness, and greater or lei's hardness,
the substance of which appears to be similar to the bark, pith,
or wood.
   Such are the different parts which vegetables exhibit to
the naked eye.      We must now examine the elementary or
gans which enter into their composition.

                   Of  the Membranous      Tissue.
   Vegetables    are composed    of a membranous tissue, which
varies in its form and consistence, not only in the different
species, but even in the fame individual.           I sliall not here
examine whether the membranes are composed of organic
fibres, ranged close to each other and united by a gluten, as
some authors assert.     This  supposition   is susceptible neither
of strict demonstration, nor    a  formal refutation ; it is one of
those systems which amuse      the mind when research becomes
fruitless. I shall content myself with stating, that, whatever
may have been the perseverance of my observations,            I never
observed real fibres in vegetables; the filaments to which
that name has been given are only membranes, which tear
into longitudinal stripes : such were the delicate filaments
which Duhamel separated from a bit of wood which he ob
served through the microscope.

the tubular tissue.
                               Chap.   III.
                       Of  the   Cellular  Tissue.
   This   tissue presents to the observer a series of membranous
bags,   which   on the first view seem to have no communication
with each other. They are not small bladders or utriculi,
as most authors assert; they are a membrane, which bends
itself, in some measure, to form vacuities contiguous to each
other.     In the parts where these cells experience no foreign
pressure, they are all equally dilated, their transversal and
vertical sections present hexagons similar to the alveolæ of
bee-hive3; each side of these geometrical figures is com
mon to two cells, and the whole tissue is wonderfully regu
lar : but, when the tissue is compressed, the hexagons lose
their shape, and are converted sometimes into parallelograms
more or less elongated. The membranous sides of the cells
are exceedingly thin and colourless : they are transparent like
glass, and their organization is so delicate, that it cannot be
perceived even with the help of the molt powerful micro
scopes.     They are generally filled with pores, the apertures
of which do not certainly exceed the 300th part of a line j
these pores are bordered with small unequal and glandulous
rolls, which intercept the light, and refract it with force
when they receive its ravs. The cellular tissue is spongy,
elastic, and without consistence;         when immersed in water
it becomes altered, and, in a little time, is even destroyed :
it is then reduced to a kind of mucilage. These ports esta
blish a communication between one cell and another, and
serve for the transfusion of the juices in that tissue, which is
exceedingly slow. I must also observe, that it is not a con
ductor ot the fluids diffused throughout the vegetable, and
that it produces nothing of itself.
    I have said that the membranes are transparent and co
lourless : when the tissue is disengaged from every foreign
body, this is true; but it is often marked by colouring sub
stances,   which   tarnish  its transparency.      This tissue exists  in
all vegetables, but not in the fame proportion.            Mushrooms
and fuci appeared to me to be composed only of cellular tis
sue.    The bark of monocotyledons and dicotyledons is al
most entirely formed of it : in these, it is generally somewhat
compressed between the epidermis and the wood ; it is filled
with resinous juices, commonly coloured green, but some
times red or yellow, according to the nature of the vegetable.
This gives different tints to the epidermis, which is nothing

else  than the exterior side of the first row of cells, as the illus
trious Malphigi supposed.           The pith in all plants is com
posed    os   hexagonal   cells.     In herbaceous plants, and parti
cularly    those   which   are     highly succulent, these cells arc
often filled with juices more or less thick or coloured.                 In
ligneous plants, naturally        drier,  they   are, on the other   hand,
almost entirely empty, and transparent.                The cellular tissue
in bulbous roots is pulpy and succulent; in the cotyledons it
is hard and brittle; and in the albumen and feeds it is dry
aud arid. The parenchyme of the leaves, of the bracteæ, sti-
pulæ, andcalvees, is formed by cells silled with a juice almost
always coloured, and green.              The rich corollæ, which di
splay to the light the elegance of their forms and the splen
dour of their colours, but of which the beauty and freshness
vanish in a moment, are not so thin as the delicate mem
branes of the cellular tissue : the juices' which swell the
transparent      utriculi of which they are formed give them
 these colours ; the one sometimes diffused into the other by
imperceptible tints, sometimes abruptly opposed, and height
ening their splendour bv the contrast. Here the cellular tissue
is so delicate, that the slightest touch is sufficient to alter and
 tarnisli it : the least pressure reduces it to mucilage, and it
appears to be the momentaneous product of the air and
 water. This tissue is observed also in the stamina and the
 pistils. The pollen, that fine dust which contains the subtile
 fluid necessary for fecundation, appears to be only an. accu
 mulation of small bags formed of the cellular tissue : in a
 word, it is this tissue which, by dilating itself, produces luc-
 culent fruits.
     The cells are proportionally more abundant in herbs than
 in trees, and in young ihoots than in old timber. The embryo
 is composed almost entirely of cellular tissue. The medullary-
 radii, 'which extend from the centre to the circumference in
 the trunks and branches of trees with two cotyledons, are
 sometimes also nothing but a thin membrane of cells.

regard to cleanliness and health, to purify it from this hete
rogeneous substance which covers all the faces of its crystals.
    Hitherto this salt has been purified or refined only by so
lution, filtration, or precipitation, according as the opera
tion is performed on a large or a small scale, and then by
evaporation.             This method requires time, wood or charcoal,"
and proper vessels.           Many persons, however, are unacquainted
with this process ; sometimes they have not leisure to employ
it ; and sometimes they have neither the necessary' vessels nor
fuel.
    I have thought, therefore, that a process which requires
neither fire nor particular vessels, is attended with no expense,
may be practised at all times, and is within the reach of every
one, might be of general utilitv.        This method is as follows:
    Take four ounces of gray salt, and, if dry, besprinkle it
gently with water till it be only what is called moist ; but it
will be very seldom necessary to have recourse to this opera
tion.    Put the salt into the corner of a table napkin or piece
of linen cloth, and form the cloth into a kind of knot or bag,
which you. must hold in one hand, while with the other you
 rub and shake the salt against the inside of the cloth for the
 space of half an hour.         Then shift the salt to another place
of the cloth, successively repeating the same manœuvre six,
 seven, or eight times, according as the salt is more or less
 gray. After the salt has been rolled for the first time, the
 cloth begins to exhibit spots occasioned by the earth which
 the salt deposits, and of which the intensity sensibly decreases
 at each change of place till they entirely disappear.        In ge
 neral, the salt must be besprinkled every two or three times
that its place is changed. The bleaching will be accelerated
 by pounding the salt slightly before it is besprinkled.
    After two or three aspersions and rubbings, the salt          in       is,
general, as pure and white as that refined, according to the
 usual method,            by
                       solution and evaporation. The loss in both'
 cafes   is nearly   the   fame; that      to fay, about an eighth,
                                                      is
 when   the  fait    dry,is and  when   care  has been taken at each
 change    of  place  to  (hake off the  grains which adhere to the
 cloth.       It   is,
                  for the most part, the whitest salt that adheres
 in this manner; and          may be shaken off without fear, as
                                     it
 the earth deposited on the cloth cannot detach itself till the
 cloth    dry. The gray salt of commerce contains in general
         is
 ia per cent, of foreign matters, nearly one-half of which                       is
 water, and about as much earth.
  . This process,    which on account of its simplicity     consider   I
 as likely to become useful for domestic purposes, might per
 haps be applicable to salt manufactories and salt refineries.

    in the French Institute by B. G. Sage, Director os the

 JLilGHT       alters the red colours    of oxides or metallic calces.
 Minium as well as red oxide of mercury, when exposed to
 the light, becomes black, though in close glass jars.
    One of the most celebrated chemists, Schecle, made knowa
 that muriate of silver lost its white colour by light even when
 under water. The fame philosopher, having decomposed the
 light by means of a prism, found that muriate of silver, here
 tofore known under the name of luna. cornea, was coloured
              In 4 seconds, by        - the violet ray ;
              In 35 seconds, by - the purple ray j
              In 29   seconds,  by    -     the blue ray ;
              In 37   seconds, by     -     the green ray ;

              In is minutes, by - the orange ray;
              In %o minutes, by - the red ray.
Native realgar, which is found in considerable masses among
the volcanic productions of Japan, is of a brilliant purple
 red when it has been polished.         Large masses of it are found
also in the tin mines in the province of Kianfu, five days
journey from Nankin.          Le Camus had a piece of it which
weighed     twenty-eight     pounds.       The fame naturalist ha^
 some worked realgar, in the centre of which there is a vein
of calcareous spar. The Chinese and Indians employ it for
 making pagodas and vases. Having put one of these pagodas
into a glass cafe, to which neither the fun nor external air
had any access, I sound, some months after, that the pagoda
had lost its brilliancy and its red colour, and was covered
with an efflorescence of an orange-yellow colour, which
readily detached itself and fell on the stand : having collected
this efflorescence, and fused it in a crucible, it presented
realgar.
    I have made known that orpiment, or yellow ore of arsenic,
»e flakes of which are of a brilliant golden-yellow colour,
and semi-transparent, passes to the state of realgar, or sul
phurated red ore of arsenic, when fused or sublimated.               I
have presented to the Institute a piece of orpiment, a part of
which I have made to pass to the state of realgar by applying
beneath it the flame of a taper by means of a blowpipe : for
this purpose, the flame must not be too strong.

     The Marquis       of Worcester's Scantlings of Inventions.                         43
   Pott has made known that orpiment contains only a
tenth of sulphur.      As this substance passes to the state of
realgar merely by the action of heat, and afterwards repasses
to the state of orpiment by the contact of light, it is evident
that these two substances, so different in colour, are composed
of the same elements. Having taken the realgar pagoda from
the glass cafe, 1 saw that a part of                    it,
                                            which had not been
exposed to the immediate contact of the light, had retained
its colour and brilliancy.

 stupendous     work in the whole world : r\o\ only with little
 charge to drain all sorts of mines, and furnisli cities with
 water, though never so high seated, as well to keep them
 sweet, running through several streets, and so performing the
  work of scavingers, as well as furnifliing the inhabitants with
  sufficient water for their private occasions; but likewise sup
  plying rivers with sufficient to maintain and make them
  portable from town to town, and for the bettering or lands
  all the way it runs ; with many more advantageous and yet
  greater effects of prosit, admiration, and consequence.        So
  that deservedly I deem this invention to crown my labours,
  to reward my expenses, and make my thoughts acquiesce in

      School of Mines *.
 H      LAVING
 Klaproth,
                       resolved to repeat the experiments by which
                  Tassaert, and Haiiy determined that cobalt and
 nickel are susceptible of acquiring magnetic properties, I pro
 ceeded to refine these semi-metallic substances by means
 •which I (hall here describe, and by which I extracted from
 cobalt the arsenic, iron, bismuth, and silver j substances with
 ¦which.it is almost always combined.
     Having disengaged the arsenic, by torresaction, from co
 balt ore of a whitish gray colour, I mixed pounded charcoal
 with the oxide or brownish calx which remained in the test.
1 then torrefied it a second time, in order to disengage                   the
 arsenical acid.
     I then mixed this oxide of cobalt with two parts of vitreous
fluxf and a little pulverized charcoal. I fused this mixture,
and obtained a' button of cobalt, which I again fused witb
borax : after these two fusions the cobalt exhibited a homo
geneous grain, though it contained iron, bismuth J, and par
ticularly silver, in the ratio of nearly a fourth.
     I pulverized this cobalt, and, having mixed it with an
equal part of sal-ammoniac,                subjected      it to distillation:
caustic volatile alkali was disengaged, and there was after
wards sublimed in the neck of the retort sal-ammoniac co
loured yellow by a little iron.            The next sublimated portion
had a pale green tint, a colour which arose from the cobalt.
The retort having been kept in a red heat for an hour, salt
or muriate os bismuth was sublimated in white foliaceous
crystals.        This salt, when put into distilled water, was de
composed, and rendered it milky.
    I mixed the muriate of cobalt which remained in the
retort with sal-ammoniac, and proceeded to distillation : the
sal-ammoniac, which was sublimated, contained neither iron
nor muriate of bismuth, and was coloured of a delicate green
by a little cobalt.
    I fused the salt or muriate of cobalt which remained in the
retort with equal parts of black flux and a fiftieth of pul
verized charcoal : in this alkaline flux I found the cobalt

    It was this purified cobalt which I employed to discover
whether it was susceptible of acquiring polarity by ihe mag
net ; and to ascertain it fully, I begged our colleague Cou
lomb, who is so familiar with these experiments, to have
the goodness to assist me.          I carried to him the ingots of .
purified cobalt and nickel, which he endeavoure'd td mag
netize ; but, as they did not indicate any magnetic property
in a satisfactory manner, he desired me to fuse them into
thin plates, which I accordingly did. They. were then eafily
magnetized, and, being suspended merely by a silk thread,
indicated the poles in a perfect manner.               These facts prove'
 that these two semi-metallic substances have, as well as iron,
the faculty of retaining the magnetic fluid introduced into
 their pores.
 XIII.     Experiments and Observations on the Heat and Cold
    produced by the mechanical Condensation and Rarefaclion
     of Air.      By John Dalton-j-.
  I  F a thermometer be inclosed in a receiver and the air
                             the thermometer rises a few degrees
 suddenly condensed,
 above the temperature         of the atmosphere; and if the air be
 exhausted from a receiver inclosing a thermometer, the mer
 cury sinks a few degrees immediately ; but in both cafes after
 some time it resumes its former station.            These facts are well
 known to philosophers of the present age, but they do not all
  agree in the explanation of them.              Thinking the subject
  worthv of elucidation, I was induced to institute a series of
  experiments for the purpose, which I apprehend have led to a
  clear demonstration of the cause of the phænomcna, and more
  over make the facts themselves appear in a somewhat different
  point of view from what they are seen in at the first moment.
      One circumstance is very remarkable, that whether the
  mercury rises or falls in these instances, it is done very ra
  pidly; whereas in the open air, if a thermometer be only
  two or three degrees above on below the temperature, it
  moves very tlowly.         This seems to have suggested to every
  one the idea that the elasticity'of the glass bulb of the ther
  mometer has a principal sliare in producing the effect, by
     * I purified the nickel from the iron it contained bv sublimation with
  sal-ammoniac, and reduced it by fusing it with black flux.
     f From the Muiicbfjler Memoirs, vol. v. part 2.
                                                                    causing

 60           On the Heat and Cold produced        by the
  causing the bulb to yield a little to the pressure of the air.
  It has however been found upon trial that the fame effects
  take place whether the thermometer is scaled or not.             My
  experiments accord with this, having made a thermometer
  and left it unsealed for the express purposes in all the expe
  riments with condensed and rarefied air, there was no sensible
 difference observed to arise from the inequality of pressure on
 the external and internal surfaces of the bulbs, the sealed and
 open thermometers varying the fame in kind and also in de
 gree, except from circumstances to be noticed hereafter.
     It being certain then that a real change of temperature
 takes place, it remained to determine the quantity and man
 ner of that change. Having chosen a small and consequently
 sensible thermometer, with a scale of degrees sufficiently large
 to admit of distinguishing one- tenth of a degree, I proceeded
 to ascertain several facts experimentally.
     Exp. I. Took a receiver, the capacity of which was about
 1 20 cubic inches, and suspended the thermometer with ita
 clear bulb in the central part of it; then letting the whole
 acquire the temperature of the room, which was without a
 fire, I exhausted the air and afterwards restored       it, marking
 the effects upon the thermometer.            The medium of several
 trials nearly agreeing with each other was as nnder        :
   The thermometer in the air of the room stood at - 363.8
                        funk upon exhaustion to         -       34   .7
                        rose w hen the air was restored to 38 .9
    The suddenness of the fall and rife puzzled me most after    :
 reflecting upon  it   for some time,     I conjectured that the real
 change of temperature         of the air or medium was much
greater than the thermometer indicated, but that the in
equality existed only for few seconds of time, because the re
                           a
ceiver, &c. immediately impart heat to, or abstract         itfrom,       so
small a   quantity  of  air  as  120  cubic  inches,  which  are  only
equal to 40 grains in weight.         The phænomena of the ther
mometer seemed very well to accord with the supposition of
great heat or cold acting upon          for   few seconds only.
                                   I it
                                              a
    Exp.   II.  Pursuing  this  idea,   imagined that  if   two ther
mometers whose bulbs were very unequal in magnitude were
inclosed together, the smaller bulb ought to give the greater
variation :    accordingly
                         I     inclosed two, the diameters of their
bulbs being .35 and .65 of an inch respectively      ;    and having
exhausted the air and restored      it   again repeatedly in succes
sion, and found   a   mean of the variations, that of the (mall
bulb was 2\8, and that of the large,          2 .2.

mometer inclosed iu three different cireumlianccs succes

   Exp.     IV.   Inclosed a wine glass with about a cubic inch
of water in           it,
                       containing the bulb of thermometer, in
                                               a                        a
receiver   ;  and, exhausting the air, the thermometer funk half
a degree suddenly, and then continued stationary          ;  upon re
storing   the   air,    it
                        suddenly  rose halfa  degree.
    All these experiments confirmed my conjecture of much      a
greater degree of heat and cold being produced in these cafes
than the thermometer points out, but that its continuance               is
so short as not to effect        material change in the temperature
                                  a
of the mercury. The following experiments were made to
ascertain what may be the real degree of heat and cold ge
nerated in those operations.
     Exp. V. The fame receiver and small thermometer as
above being used,           found the exhaustion was effected by
                             I
working       the    pump   one   minute.    The thermometer funk
nearly 2° in the first half minute, and the remainder,            few
                                                                   a
tenths of degree, in the latter half minute.
               a                                        The operation
being stopped, and things remaining in the fame state,                  it
 required some minutes of time before the thermometer re
covered one degree of the heat lost. Upon opening the cock,
 the receiver filled with air in five seconds, and the greatest
velocity of the rising mercury was about the end of that time.
The rising continued for 30 or 40 seconds from its com
mencement, but 3-4ths of the effect were produced in the
 first ten seconds.       The greatest velocity of the rising mercury
is   i° in 3^ seconds. After the thermometer had attained its
 utmost height,         began to fall again at the rate of T'gth of
                        it                                              a
  degree   in  a minute.
     Exp. VI. Took the fame thermometer and heated                  to
                                                                   it
 _50°  above    the   temperature   of the  air;  then letit be cooled
 by the medium of air, and             began to fall at the rate of 1°
                                      it
in   '
     3    seconds.
    The two last experiments seem to prove that when air
 let in to the receiver in the ordinary way, an increase                of is
 temperature     500  ofproduced in the medium within the re
                             is

 few   seconds, by the receiver and surrounding bodies, to their
  own temperature.
      Exp. VII. On condensed Air. —Took a large spherical glass
  receiver, the capacity of which was something more than
  twice that of the former (above one gallon), and suspended
  a thermometer in the centre of           of larger hulb than that
                                                  a it,
                                                          a

                     ;                     brass cap and stop-cock
  adapted to it: then doubled the density of the air within                           it
 by     condenser.
        a             The thermometer rose 2° or more. Let out
  the air suddenly, and the thermometer immediately sunk each
  time from       to 3°.5
                     30     at the same time an exceedingly dense
                                   ;
  mist was produced in the receiver, which soon subsided.
     Suspecting that aqueous vapour, which always exists in
  the atmosphere,     and      liable to assume the liquid or aerial
                                        is
 form according to circumstances, might be the principal

    These experiments (how that the greater the quantity of
vapour condensed, the less          the change of temperature

                             the condensation of part of the vapour
it  contains.    Suppose, for instance, that       portion of the at

mosphere contained ^th of its weight of aqueous vapour, and
that |ths of this vapour were condensed                            by

then the heat given out would be sufficient to raise the tem

which sufficiently accounts for the small difference observed
in the results upon warm vapoury air and cold dry air. Hence
vapour, far from producing the change of temperature in
question, tends to diminish the effect.
    If any doubt remained with me respecting the re /change
of temperature that takes place in the operations related above,
it was completely removed by the results of the two following
experiments.
    Exp. X. Inclosed a small graduated glass tube, of ^th of
 an inch internal diameter, and ten inches long, with a short
 column of mercury in     it,in the large receiver; the tube was
 sealed at one end and open at the other,           so
                                                   that    portion of

 air of given capacity was confined        by
                                           the mercurial column,
 which was near the open end of the tube, and subject to rise
 or fallby   any variation of elasticity of the air on either fide,
 being a   proper  manometer then doubled the density of the
                                :
 air in the receiver, and, opening the stop-cock, the mercu
 rial column soon ran up to its former station; but instantly
 turning the cock again, the mercurial column returned or
 fell down gradually for five or ten seconds, to the amount
 of nearly T'sth of the whole aerial column, and then became
 stationary. Again opening the cock,        aquantity of air rushed
 out, and the mercury resumed its original station.             These
 effects were always the fame, on      a repetition of the experi
 ment.
    Exp. XI. Let the mercurial column of the manometer
 down   by
        a      wire to th of the length of the tube from the
                     ]
 sealed end  ;  then exhausted -^ths of the air from the receiver,
 which was seen     by the mercury rising to the top of the tube            ;
 and upon opening the cock the mercury fell to its former
 station, but then suddenly turning the cock, the mercury
 gradually rose, for the space of five or ten seconds, to more
 than -r^th of its original height above the stationary point,
 and remained there till the cock was opened; after which                   it
 resumed its proper station.
    The phænomena in the two last experiments can be ex
 plained only on the following principle —The air
                                                :                in

 nearly so.     When the equilibrium of heat in the air           dis is
 turbed    by the operations of condensation and rarefaction,               it
is  restored in the manometer instantly          reason of the con

 tiguity of the glass to the air; but in the large receiver        re it
                                                                quires

64                   Some Account        of Dr. Olbers,
 quires a sensible time of ten seconds or more to restore the
 equilibrium throughout the whole internal capacity.          It is
this restoration that increases or diminishes the elasticity of
 the air confined in the receiver, and thereby causes the retro-
gradation of the mercurial column.          Now I have found by
former experiments that a change of 500 in temperature ef
fects a change of T'eth nearly, in the capacity or bulk of air.
It follows therefore that in the cafe of restoring the equili
brium in condensed air, about 50° of cold is produced ; and
in letting in air to an exhausted receiver, something more
than KO° of heat is produced.      The small difference seems to
arise from this, that the condensation of vapour in the former
case diminislies the effect, and in the latter, if any there be,
increases the effect, that would arise from operating upon
purely dry air.
   The experiments and observations hitherto related go prin
cipally to ascertain facts without any reference to the theory
of them : this, however, may be given in a few words, and
is the fame that is ascribed to Mr. Lambert by Meslrs. Saus-
sure and Pictet, and by them adopted.          He conceives that a
vacuum has its proper capacity for heat, the fame as air, or
any other substance ; and that the capacity of a vacuum for
heat is less than that of an equal volume of atmospherical
air; also that the denser air           is,
                                     the less     its capacity for
                                                        is
heat: upon these principles the phænomena are easily refer
able to that class of chemical facts where heat and cold are
generated        the mixture of two different bodies.

theory   be right,  and I think  there     little

                                AJIronomer.
  VV     ILLIAM     OLBERS, M. D. and member of dif
ferent learned societies,    was J)orn on the nth of Octo
ber 1758, at Arbergen,        village in the duchy of Bremen,
                                a
where his father was      clergyman.
                            a            His father having been
promoted to    living in Bremen in 1760, young Olbers re
                a
ceived his education in that city; but          1772 he lost his
                                                       in
father, who, besides being        man of great general learning,
                                    a
was  a  good mathematician, and had          great attachment to

   astronomy. About the same period young Olbers, then in
   his 14th year, conceived at once a great taste for that science.
  During an evening walk in the month of August, having
  observed the Pleiades or seven stars, he became very desirous
  of knowing to what constellation they belonged. He there
  fore purchased some charts and books, and began to study
  astronomy with the greatest diligence.         He read with the
  utmost avidity every astronomical work he was able to pro
  cure, and in a few months made himself acquainted with all
  the constellations.
      He, however, soon observed, that without a knowledge of
  the mathematics it would be impossible for him to be an
  astronomer, or to understand the necessary operations : he
  therefore applied to the mathematics, and devoted all his
  leisure time to the study of these sciences.   In the year 1777,
   when a student of medicine at the university of Gottingen,
   he had made himself master of every thing that could be
  learned from Wolf's Elements, and had read also a consi
  derable part of the works of Euler and Lambert.
      At Gottingen he had the good fortune lo study mathema
  tics under the celebrated Kastner, whose lectures he attended.
  The method to which that eminent master accustomed his
  scholars was excellent; and Dr. Olbers considers himself in
  debted to him for what he has hitherto been able to do in
   regard to the solution of difficult problems.    In consequence
  of Kastner's well-known readiness to promote the progress of
  his pupils, Dr. Olbers had free access to his extensive library,
  and also to the observatory of which Kastner was then director.
  The study of medicine, however, which was the principal
  object of his attention, and which he pursued with a success
  equal to his zeal, allowed him very little time for the study
  ot practical astronomy.
      In the year 1779 he observed at Gottingen, and calculated,
  the first comet. Au account of this labour was published by
   Kastner in the Berlin Astronomical Calendar for the year 1782,
  and in the G'Jttinger Anzeigen of 'May 31, 1 799; where it
  is mentioned that Olbers made his construction one night
  while attending a patient.      Kastner here observes, with great
  justice, that under such circumstances the orbit of a comet
  could hardly be determined.       But it was afterwards seen that
  Olbers's determination of this orbit corresponded with the
  most accurate elements of the comet which were calculated.
  Since that period the astronomy of comets has been his fa
  vourite study; and how much he has distinguished himself in
  this department, and how much he has enlarged the theory,
  is seen by his new method of calculating the orbit of a comet

'from observations, which was published, with a preface by
  the editor, at Weimar, in the year 1797.
     Newton himself considered the calculation of the orbit
of   a comet as exceedingly difficult, and for this reason he
 calls the problem longe ilrfficillimum.    The greatest and most
 ingenious mathematicians    of   the last century employed their
 talents, with various success, on this difficult subject; such as
La Caille, Euler, La Grange, Lambert, Boscovich, Du Se-
jour, Condorcet, Hennert, Tempelhof, Laplace, &c. : all the
 resources of genius and all the formulas of the higher analysis
 have been tried; but none of the methods devised can be
 simpler, and at the same time more elegant, than that of
 Dr. Olbers. It can indeed be said, that the whole was ef
 fected by hiB own genius ; for the conciseness and easiness of
 his method are chiefly founded on some happy ideas, and on
 a supposition which approaches very near the truth.               But it
 required     no   little    ingenuity and practice in calculation to
apply     these  ideas    to  the solution of the problem.
      In the year 1780 he wrote his inaugural dissertation, De
 Oculi Mutationibus internis ; that      is,    on the Method    inwhich
 the Eye changes to fee distinctly near and distant Objects.
 Most physiologists have adopted his theory on this subject            ;
 and it    has lately been placed beyond all doubt        by  Ranisden's
 and    Home's      experiments, published in the Transactions of
 the Royal Society.
      From Gottingen Olbers proceeded to Vienna,            in  1781, to
 acquire  a   more     extensive   knowledge    of medicine  under  Stoll,
 Quarin, Stork, and other eminent masters.                Recommenda
 tions which he carried with him from Kiistner procured him
a    favourable reception from father Hell the astronomer, and
 from many of the Vienna literati        :       but he could not turn it
 to much advantage, as his application to the principal object
 of his study, and attendance at the hospitals, left him very
 little leisure for astronomy.          He was the first, however, who
 observed the Georgian planet, or Uranus, on the 17th of
 August of the above year: on the 19th he perceived its mo
 tion and on that account entered into more intimate friend
     ;                                         a
 ship with father Hell, as this new planet had not then been
  seen from the Imperial observatory.           He observedit  at Vienna
  till the end of September and, under the erroneous opinion
                              ;
  of its being comet, calculated its orbit in parabola.

      Between the years 1785 and 1788, much was expected
  from   a   comet which had appeared in 1533 and 1661, and
  which   it   was supposed would return about the year 1789.
  Some astronomers spoke of this expected phænomcnon with
 the fame confidence as       if   it     had been an eclipse of the
                                                                     sun,

 fun, or   an occultation of a fixed star. Dr. Olbers was the first
  who proved, in 1787, that the comets of 1533 and 1661 were
  totally different ; consequently, that neither of them could be
  expected in the year 1789. Astronomy, therefore, is indebted
  to Dr. Olbers for having -cleared up this point of so much
 importance.       He showed how uncertain the return of these
  comets is; and that it is no fault in the exalted science of
  astronomy, if predictions, which astronomers ought never to
 have ventured to make, are not accomplished.
     From Vienna Dr. Olbers proceeded to Prague and Dres
 den, and returned thence to Bremen, where he settled as a
 physician, and where he soon acquired the confidence of his
 fellow-citizens,    both on account of his successful practice
 and of the integrity and affability of his character.       Since
 that time astronomy has been only the amusement of his
 leisure hours, or a sort of recreation, to relieve and unbend
 the mind after the fatigue of his professional duties.
    We shall add to this short sketch, that Dr. Olbers lately
 discovered another planet, or, perhaps, comet, for the point
 seems not yet determined, of which some account was given
 in the last two numbers of the Philosophical Magazine.
     XV.   Experiments    on   Charcoal.        By  Clement and
                           Desormes *.
  IT    is generally believed    that the charcoal obtained by the
 decomposition of organic matters still contains, notwithstand
 ing the action of the strongest heat to which it can be sub
jected, some remains of the volatile principles to which it was
united.
    This opinion is founded upon this circumstance, that by
 the combustion of charcoal water is sometimes obtained,
 which /eems to prove the presence of hydrogen ; and that to
 form carbonic acid with charcoal less oxygen is required than
 with the diamond; which might induce a belief that some of
it existed already in the charcoal.
    The memoir published by us in the 315th number of the
Annales de Chimie, and of which the results are nearly the
fame as those obtained by Mr. Cruikshank, announces the
gaseous oxide of carbon as free from hydrogen.
    Several chemists, convinced of the presence of hydrogen
in charcoal, have supposed that this gas is a triple combina
tion of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, and that its inflam
mability arises from the last-mentioned principle.

on  this subject, and we proposed the following questions :
   Does hydrogen exist in charcoal when properly made ?
Are the various kinds of charcoal indebted for their differ
ences to the quantities of oxygen which they contain ?
  .We employed two methods to conic to the solution of these
problems: the action of oxygen, and that of sulphur.

   Tn our memoir on the gaseous oxide of carbon we gave

close vessels in which no water was deposited.     It    how                               is,

    In repeating the combustion of different kinds of charcoal
properly made, but of which sonic remained exposed to the
air, we remarked that the latter suffered   great deal of water   a
to evaporate merely     the action of the heat, and that during
                              by
their combustion     was not produced in sufficient quantity to
                         it
be deposited.   Those which had been carefully protected from,

instrument indicates only the degree of-saturation, and not the

   The property which concrete muriate of lime has to take
moisture from the gases without altering them, induced us
to make choice of it as the means of desiccation.
    We made use of the apparatus generally employed. It
consists of a glass tube containing the concrete muriate of
lime, the weight of which is known, and through which the

direct experiment, since the gases cannot be obtained perfectly
dry.
     From analogy we were inclined to think, that if the gases
absolutely contained the same quantity of water, they ought
also to contain equal quantities of the liquids which are vola
tilized by their contact, such as alcohol and ether.
    The action of the elastic fluids on the latter being very
great, it was easy to form an exact opinion of it. We there-
tore made experiments, from which it results, that, tempera
ture, pressure, and other circumstances, being the fame, all
the gases of which we have here spoken, hydrogen as well as
the carbonic acid, equally favour the evaporation of ether;
that is to fay, that in equal spaces occupied by any gas what
ever, the fame quantity of this liquid may be there reduced to
the elastic stale, and produce the fame expansion.          The cafe is
the fame with alcohol, but the quantity evaporated is much
less than that of ether *.
    The nature of the gas, then, has no influence on the pro
perty which they have of vaporizing ether and alcohol, as it
depends only on the temperature and pressure. It is probable
that the cafe is the fame with the evaporation of water.                If
it were possible, indeed, to exercise on the ethereal or alco
holized gases an action similar to that of the muriate of lime
on humid gases ; that is to fay, if the ether or alcohol could
be taken away by similar means, they might be equally de
prived of it ; but, as we took from the gases the fame quan
tity of water, there is great reason to presume that it is abso
lutely the same.
    This being the cafe, it appears to us that if well made char
 coal, not moist, be burned with dried oxygen, and if the gas
produced by the combustion should not contain more water
 than what the absorbing salt had left in the oxygen before
its being employed ; that is to fay, if it should pass upon a
 similar quantity of salt without augmenting its weight, we
 should be almost certain that the combustion of charcoal
 would produce no water : we therefore made the following
 experiment :
     Into a very long glass tube placed upon a small furnace we
 introduced 4*50 grammes of charcoal of common wood
 healed in a furnace for an hour, and not vet cooled. To
 the extremities of the tube we adjusted two others containing
 the fame quantity of muriate of lime : the latter were im-
    " The   interesting  phenomena exhibited bv the action of gases on the
 liquids induced us to make experiments,   which we shall give an account
 of in another memoir.
                                                                  mersed

mersed in a mixture     of ice and marine salt kept constantly at
7  or  8 degrees  below  zero of the centigrade thermometer. To
one of them was adapted an empty bladder, and to the other
a second containing 12 litres of oxvgen.
    The great tube being heated, at the place where the char
coal was the gas was made to pass ; and, when the combus
tion was completed, a single atom of water was not deposited.
The tube containing the muriate of lime, which had traversed
the oxygen before it was employed, having been weighed,
was found to be increased 0M3 grammes; that                   is,
                                                          0*02 more
than  it   ought to have been according to the above table of
desiccations; which arose from the cold experienced bv the
gas.     The muriate of lime traversed        by the product of the
combustion, which ought to have contained water, was not
increased more than cr02 grammes.              This was still owing
to the moisture taken        by the charcoal from the atmosphere
at the time of its introduction into the tube.            But,    we     if
should choose to believe that this quantity was produced                       by
the combustion, as      it contained only C003 grammes of hy
drogen, arising from 4-50 grammes of charcoal, there would
exist in 100 grammes but 0-065 grammes; that                  to fay,

to contain, therefore, the 0-0902 grammes of hydrogen that               ;

C. Bertbollet, then, has fixed higher than          indicated

that we can suppose in the latter body at molt 0'o65 per cent.
    This experiment, made with the greatest exactness possible,
still proves that 100 parts of carbonic acid consist nearly of
28 parts of carbon and 72 of oxygen — result given

    The combustion of plumbago was the most interesting.
  The whole was not burnt. The portion which remained
  had become of pale black colour exactly like charcoal: at
                              a
  some parts of its surface appeared that the texture os its
                                              it
  parts     had            compact, and that the black colour
                       become         less
  was entirely owing to this attenuation.
                                                                                            Many

   Many      substances    which
                              have a fine splendour become tar
nished when scraped : oxygen, by scratching, as we may fay,
the plumbago, produces in it small vacuities which disperse
the rays os light, and suffering them no longer to be reflected
towards the eye but in a small quantity : they therefore pro
duce only a weak sensation, and the body is judged to be tar
nished.
   Besides this experiment, in which the black colour gene
rally observed in the carbonaceous principle seems to us to be
owing to its division and its texture, we have had occasion to
fee the charcoal of turpentine and wax, which are commonly
so black and dull, become brilliant like plumbago when their
parts became more compact.
    It is known that Prieftlev, that illustrious observer, was
acquainted with this charcoal of turpentine, and which he
positively called white charcoal.
   Thus charcoal, whatever be its texture or colour, if it has
been heated, is always the fame, contains no hydrogen, and
requires for its combustion the fame quantity of oxygen. The
alkaline or earthy matters, which may vary the carbonaceous
principle without making any change in                 it,

    Stockholm 1800.            ,
    THE society of the proprietors of mines and iron-works
in Sweden gave such liberal encouragement and support to
Mr. Rinmann, who has been of so much service to mining in
Sweden, that he was enabled in the year 1772 to publish an
Introduction to the Art of Improving the Manufactory of
Iron and Steel ; in 1782, his History of Iron, since trans
lated into German; and, in 1789, his large Dictionary of
Mining, in quarto. The society so early as 1784 had en
gaged him to undertake, with the assistance of Mr. Nord
wall, a system of mechanics applicable to the working of
mines, or a theoretical and practical treatise on all the appa
ratus and water-works, a knowledge of which is necessary to
iron-masters and those who superintend iron manufactories.
Mr. Rinmann undertook the practical part of this work
which we have here announced, and which comprehends
the following chapters: — 1st, On the general construction of
dams or dykes, of their height and breadth, with a descrip
tion of more than twelve different kinds, and the method of
constructing them : 2d, Of canals and cisterns : 3d, On the
construction of water-wheels, and particularly those used for
working hammers: 4th, Of the manufacturing bar iron:
5th, Of hammers and other apparatus for blacksmiths : 6th,
Of the tilting hammer, where weight is not so much con
sidered as the greater frequency of the stroke: 7th, Of rolling
and splitting iron : 8th, Of wire-drawing : 9th, Of machines
                                                              for

for boring cannon to work both horizontally and vertically,
the whole apparatus belonging to them, and the method of
improving them. The detailed descriptions which the author
gives of all these machines, constructed under his own in
spection, are illustrated by accurate engravings, to each of
which a proper scale is added.         Most of the plates were en
graved    from   drawings    executed  under  his own eye, or by his
Ions.     The invention, delineation, and construction of a steel
hammer of cut granite, belongs, however, exclusively to his
younger son, who was appointed by the College of Mines to
 supply his father's place during his long illness. The draw
 ings respecting dams and dykes are by Mr. Nordwall, who
 has invented a new and advantageous method of constructing
 canals of cut granite for hammer- works.
      The theoretic part, announced also as above, is the work
 of Mr. Nordwall, and was not published till ] 800. The ex
 periments made on a small scale, in regard to the motion and
 power of water, are not sufficient for establishing a general
 theory, as it is not yet known with certainty what results
 would be given by experiments on a large scale.               For esta
  blishing   the   theory  of  the action  of water  on  water-wheels,
  a peculiar machine was invented by the late Polhem, the
  object of which was to determine the power of water accord
  ing to the different heights fiom which it falls, the best me
  thod of constructingfloat^boards, andtodetermine according to
  the different depths the size of the troughs. Some experiments
  made on this subject by the late Wallerius may be found in
  Triewald's Lectures on Natural Philosophy, in Elvius's Trea
  tise on the Action of the impelling Power of Water, and here
  and there in the papers of the Academy of Sciences at Stock
  holm.     In the years j 752 and 1753 the late ingenious Mr.
  Smeaton made similar experiments, which were published in
  1794 under the following title : Experimental Inquiry con
  cerning the natural Powers of Wind and Water to turn
  Mills and other Machines.           Some newer experiments have
  been given by the abbe Bossut in his excellent work on Hy
  drodynamics.        By all these, however, the subject has not
  been illustrated so fully as its importance and extent required.
  It has been found, indeed, by experiment, that the moving
  momentum of the power of water is very different according
  to the nature of the wheels driven by           it,  the more or less
  oblique   situation  of  the  troughs,  the different  position of the
   float-boards, and their distance from each other; but         it  has
  never yet been sufficiently examined what variations may be
   produced  by    the different pressure of the water in the trough       ;
   the different forms and construction of the float-boards in
                                                             overshot,

  overshot,  half-overshot, and undershot wheels ; by the dif
  ferent depths, curvature, and breadth of the troughs ; the
  different breadth of the float-boards in regard to the diameter
  of the wheel; the height and thickness of the column of
  water by which it is impelled; the greater or less velocity
  with which the wheel revolves; its height as compared with
  that from which the water falls upon it; the effect which
  the water produces by its weight or its impulse alone on the
  wheel, &c. All these points must be explained in a theo
  retical treatise to render it sufficiently useful, and before this
  can be done it will be necessary to make a great many re
  searches, not merely sounded on mathematical principles and
  demonstrations, which may often mislead the practical me
  chanician, but on incontestable experiments ; and even if this
  should be fully accomplished, it would still be necessary to
  examine what ratio the results arising from experiments on a
 small scale bear to those made on a large scale. This ratio the
 author has here endeavoured to determine with as much ac
 curacy as possible.      In regard lo the small difference which
 is sometimes observed in experiments with small overstiot
 wheels, on account of the attraction of the water by the float-
 boards, and in consequence of which the action is somewhat
 greater on a large scale, the author, in order to obtain a cer
 tain formula, made various experiments on a large scale, and
 compared them with those of Polhem, Smeaton, and Bofliit,
 and his formulae with those os Karsten, Kastner, Desaguliers,
 Belidor, Fabre, Elvius, &c.
    The whole work consists of three parts. — I. Mechanics.

 — This work mows that the author is not a mere theorist, and
 that he has united the principles of found theory with very
 extensive practice.

    The thins and fourth volumes, now published, contain the
 history of the mathematics since the commencement of the
 eighteenth century to the present period. This century is
 more fertile than any of the preceding, having produced a
great many men of eminence in the mathematica Iscierrces; as
Euler, Maclaurin, the two Simpsons, Dalembert, Condorcet,
La Grange, Landen, De la Place, Delalaude, &c. Montucla
died while employed in putting the last hand to this part, by
which means the end of the third volume, and great part of
the fourth, were left imperfect.         Dclalande undertook to

        ROYAL INSTITUTION OF GREAT BRITAIN.
An    JT a meeting of the managers and visitors of the Royal
Institution of Great Britain, held at the house of the Institu
tion, on the 26th day of April 1803, the following report,
relative to the present state of the Institution, was laid before
them by Count Rumford.
    On the 25th of May last year I had the honour to lay be
fore the managers an account, which by their directions was
published in the journals of the Institution on the 13th of
June, respecting the progress that had been made in the ar
rangement of the Institution at that time, and of the works
that were then going on at the house of the Institution ; and
I shall now briefly state to the managers and visitors what has
since been accomplished, and what still remains to be done
to complete this great and interesting establishment in all its
details.
    The new lecture-room has been finished, and is acknow
ledged to be one of the most beautiful and most convenient
scientific theatres in Europe.     It is so favourable lo the pro
pagation   of  sound,  that though it is sufficiently capacious to
contain 900 persons, a whisper may be distinctly heard from
one extremity of it to the other, and no echo is ever perceived
in it on any occasion. It is so contrived, that day-light may
                                                                be

              Royal lnjlitution   of Great Britain.         81
be entirely excluded in a moment, by lowering the moveable
ceiling ot the lantern, by which the light enters the room
from above, and allowing it to rest on the cornice which
makes the finish of the lower part of the lantern, just above
the level of the flat part of the ceiling of the room.
   The form of the room is semicircular, with an addition of a
parallelogram, equal in length to the diameter of the circular
part of the room (60 feet), and 15 feet wide; and there are
eleven rows of feats rising one above the other below, and
three rows of feats in the gallery : and there is a covered cir
cular passage, eight feet wide, all round the room, without,
under the higher rows of feats, next the wall, and four con
venient openings or vomitoria, with light doors with two
wings, which shut of themselves without noise, forming so
many passages of communication between the lower part of
the theatre or pit, and the arched gallery or passage without.
   The floor and feats of this theatre are painted of a dark
green colour ; and the feats are all covered with green moreen
cushions.    The floor of the circular passage without, which,
 surrounds the pit, and the stairs belonging to the vomitoriat
 are all covered with green cloth to prevent the noise of the
 footsteps from being heard of those who come in or go out
 of the theatre during the lecture.
     The windows which form the lantern (which is 15 feet in
 diameter) are all double, which not only renders the tempe
 rature of the room very equal and pleasant, but also prevents
 so effectually all noises from without disturbing the silence
 which reigns in the room, that even the rumbling of the car
 riages which pass in the neighbouring streets is never heard
 in it.
    This theatre is warmed in cold weather by steam, which
 coming in covered and. concealed tubes, from the lower part
 of the house, circulates in a lame semicircular copper tube,
 eight inches in diameter, and above 60 feet long, which is
 concealed under the rising feats of the pit.
    Adjoining to this new theatre is the apparatus room,
 which communicates with it by a door which is on one side
 of the large open chimney fireplace within the theatre, and
just behind the lecturer's table, which chimney fireplace
 serves for placing the furnaces that are occasionally used in
 the chemical experiments.
    The repository, which is 44 feet long, and 33 feet wide,
 (the ceiling of which, and the floor of the theatre, which is
 above  it, being supported by two rows of handsome columns,)
is  finished, and already contains    aconsiderable  number of
 specimens of new and useful mechanical contrivances.

8z                Royal Lijlitution of Great Britain.
   The chemical laboratory, in which there is provision made
for placing and using no less than sixteen furnaces of different
 kinds at the fame time, is quite finished, and has been fur
 nished, under the direction of the committee of chemistry
 (which has been formed since the last year), with a ver)' com
 plete chemical apparatus, and also with a considerable pro
 vision of materials necessary in making chemical experi
 ments.
     All the workshops of the Institution are now quite finished ;
 and they have been furnished with the most complete sets of
 tools that could be procured ; and several excellent workmen
 are now employed in them; and a great variety of useful ar
 ticles, designed as models for imitation, have already been
 manufactured in the house, and are ready to be delivered to
 any of the proprietors or subscribers to the Institution who
 may be disposed to purchase them.
     The great kitchen at the house of the Institution has been
 finished, and now contains a variety of new and useful uten
 sils, and implements of cookery, many of which are in daily
 use, and others which are not are so exposed to view as to
 be easily understood, and their merit appreciated.
     The dining-room and the managers room, which is ad
joining to  it,  have both been quite finished and furnished.
     The eonversation-room has been finished, and every thing
 has been prepared for its being used as     a  coffee-room.    It   is
 now set apart for the reading of the domestic newspapers, of
 which no less number than ten are regularly taken in and
                  a                                        ;
it  has been furnished with     aset of the best geographical maps
 and charts that were to be procured.        In (electing them, the
advice and assistance of that able geographer major Rennell,
were obtained.      The maps are fitted up according to newa
method, which has been found to be very convenient, and
at the fame time to contribute much to the economy of space,
and to the preservation of the maps.
     The first reading-room (that nearest to the great hall) has
lately been appropriated exclusively to the reading of foreign
newspapers.       It  lighted up, as formerly, every evening and
                      is                                    ;
on the table are found seven foreign gazettes, from different
parts of the continent,    in the French and German languages,
which are regularly taken in, and which, coming            Tby  the
post, constantly arrive at the earliest periods.
    Mr. Stanhope, of the general post-office, has generously
undertaken to manage the whole business of procuring these
foreign newspapers, and to cause them to be delivered at the
bouse of the Institution free of all expenses for postage.
                                                                The

                 Royal Inftitution  of Great Britain.           83
   The second, or principal reading-room, which is 26 feet
long, by 24 wide, has been fitted up in a very complete and
elegant manner, and furnished with neat book-cases, which
now extend round three sides of the. room, affording space for
more than 3800 volumes. This arrangement has rendered,
it possible to allow the second lecture-room (which at some
future period is to become the library) to remain for some
time longer in its present state; and it will no doubt be found
very useful for giving, occasionally, lectures on particular sub
jects, unconnected with the general courses of lectures that
 are regularly given in the great lecture-room by the professors
 and lecturers of the Institution.       This second lecture-room
 will likewise be found very convenient for the meetings of
 the committees of the Institution, and for exhibiting new
 experiments to select meetings of scientific men.
    But to return to the principal reading-room. The accom
 modations for those who frequent this room have been greatly
 augmented since the last year.       There are now two long ma
 hogany    tables  (each 1 1 feet  in length, and 3 feet 10 inches
 wide), covered with green cloth; which are placed parallel
 to each other, on opposite sides of the room ; and each of
 these tables is well lighted at night by an elegant Grecian
 lamp of three branches, suspended by a chain from the ceiling
 of the room, and covered with a shade of white si!k.
    On these tables are found no less than 54 foreign and do
 mestic, scientific and literary periodical publications, which
 are regularly taken in.
    The books in the library of the Institution have been con
 siderably increased during the last year, both by presents and
 by new purchases.
    The principal reading-room has been ornamented by art           .
 elegant bust of his majesty, our most gracious sovereign,
 patron of the Institution; and by the busts of those great lu-     .
 minaries of science, Bacon, and the immortal Newton.
    With regard to the public opinion respecting the Institu
 tion, I have the most sensible satisfaction in being able to lay
 before the managers and visitors indisputable proofs of its
 growing reputation. The reading-rooms and lectures at the
 house of the Institution are considerably more frequented this
 year than they ever have been before; and, although the
 prices of proprietors' sliares, and of life and annual subscrip
 tions, have been considerably raised, the lists of proprietors
 and subscribers have, during the last ten months, been aug
  mented by no less than 154 new names, as will appear by
 the following statement.

    The   income    and pecuniary    resources  of  the Institution    have,
of course, kept pace with the increase of its proprietors and
subscribers; and its expenses, though they have necessarily
been very heavy, while so great and extensive a plan has been
carrying into execution, yet they have been regulated with
so much order and economy, that the proprietors will, no
doubt, be satisfied with the accounts that will be laid before
them at their next annual meeting, which will be held in a
few days.
    It will still be fresh in the recollection of the managers and
visitors, that, when, in the year 1800, it was finally deter
mined by the proprietors to undertake the additional build*
ings at the house of the Institution, it was then thought to
be quite impossible lo complete so great and expensive an un
dertaking without a loan of at least 5000 1.; and it will like
wise be remembered that, on opening a subscription for that
   urpole, no less a sum than 7000 1. was generously offered,
1! y a comparatively small number of the proprietors, in a very
short time.       It will also be recollected that I took the liberty
in the report which I had the honour to lay before the ma
nagers last year, on the 25th of Mav, to express a hope that
not only the expenses of the new buildings above-mentioned,
 but of others also which were wanted, and of all the altera
tions and additions that would be necessary to be made to
finish the house in the most complete manner, and to furnish
it elegantly, might, perhaps, with due care and attention, be
 defrayed without calling for any part of that sum of 7000I.,
which had been subscribed to enable the managers to com
 plete this great undertaking.
    I have now, in common with my two colleagues of the
 committee, of expenditure
                                   (Lord Pelham and Mr. Sulivan),
 who with myself have been specially charged by the mana
 gers of the Institution with the fuperintendance and control
 of these expenses, the pleasure to state that these hopes have
 noi  been disappointed.
                                                                          By

                 Royal Institution    of Great Britain.           $5
      By   the accounts which     have been laid before the visitors
 itappears,
   That the whole of the sums that have from time to time
 become due to Mr. Hancock, who contracted with the ma
 nagers for completing the new buildings, have been regularly
  paid. That his work having been finished, and regularly
  examined by the surveyor of the Institution, his accounts
  have been closed, and the balance due to him from the Insti
  tution has been settled.
     That the instalments agreed to be advanced to him, on his
  separate contract for completing the attic story, have likewise
  been regularly paid, and that no more than about 500I. will
  be due to him, on his last contract, when he (hall have com
  pleted the whole of that work ; which will be finished in a
 few weeks.
     It appeared likewise, by these accounts, that all the car
  penters, plumbers, painters, and glaziers bills, for extra work
 at the house of the Institution, — not included in Mr. Han
 cock's contracts, — have been brought to- account : that the
 salaries and wages of those who constitute the establishment
 of the Institution have been regularly paid ; and that all the
 tradesmens bills have been duly checked, and regularly dis
 charged.
     And, lastly, that all the sums due from the Institution on
 current accounts, including every demand that can be brought
 against the Institution, even after all the new works now car
 rying on at the house of the Institution shall have been com
 pleted, amounts to about 3900I.; white the sums belonging
 to the Institution in the hands of their different bankers,
added to those sums which are due to the Institution from
proprietors and subscribers, and from some other persons,
 amounts to about 8100I.
     From this statement it is evident that the Institution has
been completed without any debt being incurred; and, by
an account which has been laid before the managers and
visitors, it appears that the present annual income of the In
stitution is quite sufficient to defray all the expenses of keep
ing it. The Royal Institution of Great Britain may therefore
be considered as finished and firmly established.     That it may
long    continue  to flourish   is,
                                  no  doubt,  the  ardent   wish of
thole who are connected with it; and also of all those who
are acquainted with the principles on which          it   founded,
                                                          is
and who know how powerfully           must contribute to the ge
                                      it
neral diffusion of an active spirit of inquiry and useful im
provement among all ranks of society.

    This    society, instituted only a few years ago, is now in so
 flourisliing a state', that it has at this time under consideration
 a plan for establishing a lecturesliip on the subject of natural
 and experimental philosophy. A paper on the subject, drawn
 up by Mr. Thomas Biggs, one of the members, has been
 printed and circulated by the society ; and such exertions are
 making, that we hope soon to be able to announce that a
 sufficient fund has been obtained for carrying this desirable
 measure into effect.
                     PHYSIOLECTICAL SOCIETY.
     A  society under the above title has just been instituted at
 Birmingham         " for the purpose of improving its members in
 natural philosophy by lecture, experiment, and discussion."
  A  suitable apparatus     is to be provided  at the expense  os the
  members, each of whom during the sessions is to lecture, in
  his turn, upon a subject in natural philosophy chosen by him
  self, but approved by a quorum of the society, and visiting
  auditors are to be admitted to the sittings under certain re
  gulations.      This is as it ought to be, and does much credit
  to those scientific gentlemen who planned and have united
  for such objects. This will not only insure their own im

       As the society received no answer to the following question:
   A   historico-critical treatise on the printed and manuscript
   works written by individuals of the royal family; it has
  been again proposed for the year 1802.
      The following prize questions have also been proposed :
      Foreign languages. —An examination of the advantages or
  disadvantages of the new methods invented in modern times
  for facilitating the study of the sciences; and whether these
  methods are prejudicial to real learning.       The prize is a gold
  medal of the value of twenty-six ducats.
      Antiquities. — An essay on the origin of the arts and ma
  nufactures in Sweden, and on the progress of them, to the
  accession of Gustavus I.; with a general view of the laws and
  regulations which relate to trades and companies. The prize
  is a gold medal of fifteen ducats.

  Charles VIII. ; Knutson, BirgerJarl, and Terkel Knutson,
  regents of the kingdom during the minority of king Birger.
  Sketch of medals on the most remarkable events which took
  place in Sweden in the course of the 18th century, to be
  chosen at the pleasure of the author.         The prize is a gold
 medal of twelve ducats.
     The papers must be transmitted to the academy, in the
 usual manner, before the 20th of January 1803.
              ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AT BERLIN.
     On the 28th of January 1802 the academy held a public
 fitting, which was opened by M. Merian with a discourse
 in French ; after which he read the eulogy of M. Selle, the
 late director of the philosophic class.        He announced also
 that his intimate friend M. Gerhard had discovered that, in
galvanic experiments, nickel combined with zinc produces
 the fame effect as silver and copper.
     Pcofessor Bode read a history of the discovery of the new
planet Ceres, observed by him on the 15th, 23d, 25th, and
36th of January.

                     PHILOMATIC SOCIETY.
     C. Pictet read a notice on the state of agriculture in the
 environs of Alicant.      The foil in the neighbourhood of Ali-
 cant is in general light; xm the heights it is formed almost
 entirely of the wrecks of rocky and calcareous mountains,
 while in the valleys it is sandy, with beds of clay and marl :
 but in a climate so warm, this difference in the nature of the
 foil is of less importance to agriculture than that which re
 sults from the dryness or moistness of the ground.        C. Pictet
 describes separately the agriculture of the dry lands and that
 of those which     are watered.
      The  tree  reserved almost   exclusively for the dry land is
 the almond-tree, with a hard or soft shell : it flowers in the
 month of February.        The green bark of the almonds is em
 ployed in the manufacturing of soap, on account of the alkali
 which it contains.
      The caroub-tree, the fruit of which serves as food to the
 mules, is also cultivated, and that variety of the olive-tree
  which produces small black olives: the oil of them is of a
  bad quality, because the olives are left heaped upon each
  other for a long time before lhe oil is made.
      The date-tree at Aiicant rises to the height of 60 feet; the
  fruit is inferior in quality to that of Barbary. The leaves of
  this tree arc employed for a very singular purpose: they are
  blanched, and being then blessed by the priefis, are sold to
  individuals, who place them in the balconies of their houses
  as preservatives from all kinds of danger.         These blanched
  leaves are exported also to Italy.       The leaves of the male or
  barren date are employed for this purpose.        A person climbs
  tip to the top of the tree, turns up the exterior leaves which
   have shot forth, and they are surrounded by a cord which
   is gradually drawn tighter, after which they are covered with
   a bundle of straw to iecure them from the iight. The bundle
   of straw is not entirely closed over them till the month of
   August.     This operation may be repeated every three years
   on the fame tree.
       The land is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Alicant by
    two mules yoked

the farmers endeavour to level the ground, that it may be
watered     in a more uniform manner. For this operation they
employ a box open before, and having a concave bottom ; it
is drawn by a mule : the driver holds it behind by means of
a handle, and, making it enter the ground when the latter is
too high, transports what it has pared off to some other place
where the foil is too low.
     The usual rotation for dry land is as follows : — The land is
suffered to rest for a year, after which it is ploughed and
dunged: it is then sown with the soda plant, then with
wheat, and, in the last place, with barley.
     The soda is extracted from a great number of maritime
plants ; but the two exclusively cultivated at Alicant for that
purpose are the Parilla {Salfola fativa, Linn.), and the
 SoJJa {Salfola soda, Linn.).        The method of cultivating
 them is the fame; but the former requires a better soil, and
produces much better soda.
     After the land has been ploughed several times, and
 dunged, it is sown with barilla in the month of December :
 it is scarcely covered with earth, and the days when the
 weather seems most disposed for rain are chosen for that
 operation.      About the end of winter the field is weeded as
 often as is necessary to destroy the weeds.         The barilla is
  ready to be collected in September : that intended for seed is
  left in the ground for a month longer. The plant is easily
  torn up, because it has very small roots : when pulled it is
  deposited in heaps, and left for a month to dry.      About the
  middle of October it is burnt.       Spherical holes capable of
  containing about thirty hundred weight of soda are made in
  the earth, above each cavity are placed two bars of iron
  which support the plants to be burnt, and which are mixed
  with reeds or straw.     Care is taken to make choice of a day
  when the wind is hot too strong, otherwise the soda would
  burn too rapidly, and be reduced with more difficulty to a solid
   mass : it is necessary also that the air should not be entirely
   calm; for in that case the smoke, by not being carried off,
   dirties the soda. The barilla in burning experiences a kind
   of fusion, and is reduced to a red mass, which resembles a
   fused metal, and which is stirred once or twice, in order that
   the fusion sliould be more complete. When the pits are full,
   which generally requires a whole night, the matter is covered
   with earth, and it is suffered to cool for ten or twelve days :
   the cake formed is then uncovered, and it is broken into
   large fragments with hammers ; after which it is carried to
   warehouses.     While the barilla is burning, the sweepings
   left the preceding year are thrown into the pits in order that
                                                                they

  they may be fused with the rest. The sojsa and barilla are
  cultivated not only on the coast, but at the distance of nearly
  forty leagues.      The soda, however, is of an inferior quality
  with that of Alicant.
      The cultivation of wheat and barley presents nothing re
  markable except the defective method of threshing them.
 The grain is spread out on a plat of ground well covered with
 grass, and mules yoked two and two are made to trot over it.
 These mules are often yoked also to an instrument called trillo,
 on which the driver places himself: this trillo is composed of
 two planks joined by two cross pieces, and turned up before.
 This operation detaches the grain and breaks the straw. When
 a gentle wind blows, advantage is taken of it to separate them ;
 they are thrown into the air wih a shovel ; the straw is car
 ried to a distance, and nothing remains but the grain mixed
 with earth, which is afterwards separated by means of a sieve.
      The environs of Alicant are watered either by wells, from
 which the water is drawn up by a wheel that moves a rope
 furnished with buckets, or by running water brought entirely
 from a large reservoir called Pantano di Tili. This reservoir,
 begun by the Moors and finished by the Spaniards, is a defile
 between the mountains, shut by a strong wall. The water is
 fold to individuals : each proprietor generally receives some
 of it twice every year to water his land, and every fortnight
 to water his garden.
      It is in the districts thus watered that Iucern is cultivated ;
 it produces thirteen or fourteen crops annually : but the most
 important production cultivated in the watered districts is the
 vine.
     The vineyards are divided into squares with elevated edges
 that they may be watered with more effect.               The vines are
 pruned      in  the  month   of  January they
                                            :       are  not stripped of
 their leaves,    nor  are they  ever raised  up,  and  they are  dunged
 only when the whole vineyard is renewed : they are tlug
 once in winter and once in summer.              The vines are watered
 once or twice every year, and more copiously when young.
 When the grapes are very ripe, they are cut, and spread out
 in a dry place on hurdles made of reeds. When they have
 lost their humidity they are pressed above large stone jars, co
 vered with boards which join badly.             The grapes are mixed
 with a little lime, the probable effect of which, accord
 ing to C. Pictet, is to neutralize the acid, and fix or seven
men, almost naked, press them down with their feet. The
 stalks are then separated, and the husks are thrown into the
jars to colour the wine. At the end of eight or ten days the
 liquor is drawn off and put into casks.

            SOCIETY OP EMULATION AT ROUEN.
    This  society has proposed the following question : —To in
dicate for dyeing spun cotion of a red colour similar to that
called Indian red, a process which shall require only six de
siccations.
    The dyed specimens will be subjected to the same proofs
as those dyed in the best dye-houses of Rouen ; like them
they must withstand the action of soap and that of the nitric
 acid.
    The prize will   be a gold medal of the value of 600 francs
 (251. sterling),   and will be adjudged in the public sitting of
 Thermidor 7, year 11 (July 26, 1803).
    The memoirs, written in French or in Latin, must be
 transmitted, post paid, to C. Auber, secretary for correspond
 ence, at the Central School, before the 25th of Meifidor,

                            ASTRONOMY.
  X HE planet discovered by Mr. Olbers, of Bremen, on the
 28th of March has been calculated by C. Burckhardt, who,
 after long and laborious operations, has found the elements
 of this planet in the following manner : —Ascending node,
 172° 28' 57" ; perihelion, 1220 3' 2"; mean longitude March
 31st, 1620 51' I4'2"; inclination,       34° 50' 40"; mean di
 stance from the fun or greater semi-axis, 2791 ; eccentricity,
 0-2463 ; diurnal sidereal motion, 12' 4o,84": sidereal revolu
 tion, 1703 days 7-tenths.        C. Burckhardt has been obliged
 to calculate the perturbations which this planet experiences
 from the attraction of Jupiter, and which occasioned very
 sensible differences in the observed places : but these calcula
 tions are very complex, on account of the great inclination
 and great eccentricity of that planet.               Lalande.
     The orbit of the planet of Olbers, calculated by C. Burck
 hardt, the elements of which we have published, agrees with
 in a few seconds with the observation made on the 26th by

  Messier and Mechain, so that this new planet may be con
  sidered as already well known.           Its revolution is 1703 days,
  or 4 years 8 months and 3 days. That of Piazzi's planet is
 4 years 7 months and 10 days: but their distances are dif
  ferent on account of the difference of their eccentricities.
 The planet of Olbers varies from 21 to 35, and that of Piazzi
 from 27 to 28, the distance of the fun from the earth, being
  ten. When I publislied the two last volumes of Montucla's
 History of the Mathematics, I was not able to give the ele
 ments of the latter planet : this article will therefore serve as
 a supplement.                                               Lalasde.
                             ANTIOUITIES.
     A letter from Naples of a late date contains the following
 information : — In the musæum of Porlici, belonging to the
 king of Naples, there have been for a long time nearly eigh
 teen hundred manuscripts on papyrus, which were found
 among the ruins of Herculaneum.              All the attempts hitherto
made to take advantage           of this valuable   discovery have pro
 cured only a very insignificant work of Philodemus on Music*;
The prince of Wales lately requested the court of Naples to
 authorize Mr. Haiter, one of his librarians, to examine the
manuscripts of Herculaneum, in order to discover on what
subjects they treat, and to publish such works as appear most
interesting.
     Mr. Haiter has entered upon this research with a courage
 and zeal of which no idea can be formed but by those who
have witnessed the almost insurmountable difficulties he has
had to surmount in unrolling manuscripts reduced to char
coal, and so brittle, that they Dreak and fall into dust by the
effect of the least breath.
     Mr. Haiter has been so fortunate as to discover, a few days
ago, a work of Epicurus entitled Of the Nature of Things,
which was known only from the mention made of it by some
writers of antiquity, and which appears to have served as the
basis for the poem of Lucretius on the fame subject.              A copy
is now making of this manuscript, and when transcribed                   if
will be printed.
    Mr. Haiter has employed ten persons to unroll the fame
number of manuscripts 011 papyrus ; and there is reason to
expect from this laudable activity discoveries of the more
importance, as he will not grow weary like father Anthony,
formerly charged with the Tike labour on works of little im-
    f There appears to be here a small error. A manusi ript on the Virtues
and Vices, dt Virtutibus et fniis, has also been unrolled ; and, if we are
not mistaken, a third, the name of which we do not recollect.

poetry or history, or which are in some measure interesting
in consequence of the celebrity of their authors.
                 BABYLONIAN INSCRIPTIONS.
     Some time ago we gave a short account of Dr. Hager's
ingenious Dissertation on the Inscriptions found on some
bricks, brought to this country at the expense of the East
 India Company, from the ruins of a city on the Euphrates
 supposed to be the site of the antient Babylon.         We now
 learn that M. Lichtenstein, intendant-general of Helmstadt,
 in the duchy of Brunswick, having studied one of these in
 scriptions, (the one of which we gave a copy in our eleventh
 %olume,) has succeeded in decyphering the hieroglyphical
 characters which it exhibited, and that he means to lay be
 fore the learned world an explanation of the principles on
 which his discovery rests. This discovery, if well founded,
 will be of immense advantage to history, as the characters
 which distinguish the monuments of Fersepolis and the in
 terior of Asia, and which have hitherto baffled every attempt
 of the learned to decypher them, seem nearly allied to those
  of Babylon, from which they are probably derived.
           GEOGRAPHY,        VOYAGES,      AND TRAVELS.
     According    to the  last letters from Mr. Humboldt, dated
  November 26, 1801, he was then on his way to Quito, and
  in January 1802 intended to proceed to Lima, thence in the
  month of May to Acapulco and Mexico, from which he pro
  posed taking a passage to the Philippines,    and then to return
  to Europe by the Cape of Good Hope.
     The following account is extracted from a letter dated
  Leghorn, March 22, 1802, addressed to the editor of the
  Magazin Encyclopedique : — " I have found here a large
  packet of letters from Ceylon, addressed to me by lord Glen-
  bervie.   I learn from the letters of M. de I. that he has sent
  to London a work on that island.         Colonel North, the go
  vernor of Ceylon, had so good an opinion of it that he took
  the trouble himself to correct the English translation.         It
  contains information of every kind respecting this famous
  island.   M. de I., having learned the Portuguese and Cin-
   guese, which   are the languages of the country, was enabled
   to acquire information respecting the antient history of the
  country, and other branches of antiquity entirely new: this
   part of the work, therefore, has been sent to the society at
   Calcutta to be inserted in the Astatic Researches.     It shows
  that Ceylon had for a legislator Boudhoo, whose laws are older,
   perhaps, than those of Brahma in the peninsula of India, and
                                                              differ

  94            Geography, Voyages,     and Travels.
  differ from them in several important points, such as the
  mortality of the foul, which Boudhoo admits after a multi
  tude of transmigrations ; whereas the Brachmans admit the
  fame transmigrations, and conclude with establishing the
 immortality of the purified soul.      The work, then, contains
  a description of the manners, customs,        and government of
 the island; account of an embassy to Candia, the capital of
 the kingdom, in the interior of the island, on which occasion
 M. de I. served as interpreter ; a letter to the governor on
  captain Symes's embassy to Ava ; a dissertation on the agri
  culture, natural history, mineralogy, botany, &c. of the
 island ; with an account of 3000 infects and other animals
 prepared and dried, and a collection of 500 drawings of
 plants and animals sent to the East India company.          This
 work contains also different memoirs on the operations of the
 governor in regard to labours with which M. de I. was
 charged. That on the cultivation of the cinnamon states,
 that a wood 15 miles in circumference became a garden in
 18 months : it produced 800 bales of cinnamon : at present
 it produces 3000, which are worth to the East India com
 pany 60,000 1. sterling. A memoir on the pearl fishery in
 the gulph of Mannar, where M. de I. superintended the ex
 traction of the pearls last year in the month of March. Two
 hundred and fifty boats, with divers, were employed in the
 fishery : these boats bring the oysters every day on fliore,
 where they are suffered to rot for about a week ; they are
 then washed, after which the fish is boiled and exposed to
dry. This matter is then winnowed by women, and the
   earls are extracted.  In the midst of this air, which might
E e expected to be rendered poisonous by the stench, the
people employed find no more inconvenience than if they
breathed the purest air.       A memoir on the hunting of ele
phants, which fliows, that of 200 of these animals caught
during one of these hunting excursions, 160 perish by dis
agreeable accidents in consequence of the bad method em
ployed : no more than forty remain to be tamed, though, by
simpler means, the loss might be reduced to eight or ten.
A journey to the southward part of the island to examine the
saline marshes it contains, and to discover the best method of
improving the production of salt.       In consequence of the to
pographical observations made by M. de I. during the course
of this journey he has been appointed surveyor-general of the
island ; and fifteen surveyors,   in five divisions, are now em
ployed in making plans, and in other operations necessary
for the construction of a general map, which is to be finished
in two years.

                        EARTHO.UAKES.
   A French officer of dragoons, now in garrison at Lodi, in
a letter to his father, dated the 9th of May, gives the follow
ing account : — " I write in haste to inform you, that an
earthquake has been felt here, but that I have met with no
accident.     We were sitting quietly at breakfast, when our
house gave a terrible crash, that shook us on our feats.        We
ran out and flew to the barracks.            Every thing  was  over
turned ; the cloaks and portmanteaus rolled about, and the
dragoons were tumbled down in attempting to descend the
stairs.    Some chimneys were thrown down ; all the people
were at prayers in the streets. The shock commenced at forty
minutes past ten in the morning, and lasted about three se
conds. We have escaped with the fright.              We might now
laugh   were  we not much    affected,  when  we  learned that about
ten miles distance (three French leagues) the town of Crema
was almost demolished by the earthquake. The inhabitants
saved themselves by flight; and no people were remaining
there, except the chasseurs of the 15th regiment, to prevent
plunder. At 40 miles distance (about 13 French leagues) the
village of Menguin, where there was a fine lake of about tea
miles circumference, has been swallowed up in the lake ; and
not a single person has been saved, nor does a single vestige of
 that village remain."
    Letters from Verona state, that they experienced an earth
quake there on the 12th of May, which extended also to the
Venetian territories, where, however, it was less violent than
at Crema and Brescia.      In the latter city, three churches and
twelve houses were thrown down.            Bergamo sustained some
damage also.
    After the earthquake, which was felt in the states of Parma,
several fissures were formed on the heights and in the environs
of the town of Bardi, from which           a  quantity of petroleum
issued.    This circumstance    has already produced a fall in the
price   of all the common       oils, as it affords light at a much
cheaper rate.
                       DEAF AND DUMB.
    Some interesting experiments were lately made in the Deaf
and Dumb Institute at Paris.         It has been long known that
most deaf and dumb persons, when near large cannon which
are fixed, or pear churches when the bells are rung, give some
indications of hearing.     It has, however, not yetl>een deter
mined with certainty, whether the impressions made on such
occasions are produced merely by the violent motion or con
cussion of the air.   The experiments lately made by C. Beyer
pn this subject, leave no doubt respecting this problem. The
instruments which he employed did not emit very strong
                                                              tones j

tones: he produced the most acute tones in the diatonic
scale; and these were found to be the best calculated for ex
citing the organs of hearing.        Tn the fitting of March 31st
last, the society were desirous of ascertaining whether the
sensation produced on the deaf and dumb by musical instru
ments was an indefinite and obscure perception, or if they
were capable of distinguishing gradations in the tones pre
sented to their ears.    For this purpose they were blindfolded,
and different instruments which had been before employed
were then made to found. The persons who were the objects
of this experiment not only showed by uniform movements
that they heard these sounds, but they indicated by particular
signs the kind of instruments employed ; which was a certain
  roof that they were able to distinguish the different tones,
J n regard to one of them, the following remarkable phæno-
menon was observed : a single tone made no impression upon
him, and it was necessary to repeat it several times before he
was sensible of       and able to distinguisti it.   It was thence
concluded that         it it,
                      would be necessary for this young man to
learn to bear, as persons born blind who recover their fight
in consequence of         chirurgical operation must gradually
                                a
learn to see and to distinguisti objects.

at Paris   byC. Beyer, from which             itconcluded that the

                                CONDITIONS        FOR THE POLITE ARTS.
      No person who has gained the first premium in any class shall be admitted a candidate in a
 class of an inferior age ; and no candidate         shall receive more than one premium in one year •
  nor shall they, who for two successive years have gained tne first premium in one class, be again
  admitted    as candidates in that class.
      No person shall be admitted a candidate        in any class, who has three times   obtained   the first
  premium in that class.
      No   more than one performance in any class stall he received frorq the same caudidate.
      All  performances (lo which premiums or bounties are adjudged) shall remain with the Society
  till after the public distribution of rewards in May, when they will be re-delivered unless men
  tioned in the premiums to the contrary.
      No performance shall be admitted, that has obtained a premium, reward, or gratification, from
  any orher society, academy, or school, or been offered for that purpose.
      All performances that obtain premiums in the Polite Arts must have been begun after the
  publication of such premiums, except line engravings.
      To encourage real merit, and prevent attempts to impose on the Society, by producing draw
  ings made or retouched by any other person than the candidate, the Society require a specimen            of
  the abilities of each successful candidate in classes 97 to 122 inclusive, under the inspection of the
   Committee of Polite Arts, in eveiy instance where such pioof may appear necessary.
      All candidates in the Polite Arts are required to signify, on their drawings, their age; and
  Whether the performances are originals or copies ; and if copies, whence they weic taken.
                                                 Society's      Office, Adel?hi, June          1st, 1802.
         ORDERED,
                             That the several Candidates and Claimants to ivhcm the Society shall adjudge
  premiums      or Bounties, do attend at the Society1s Office in the Alelphi, on the last Tuesday in May
   1 803, at Tivelve o' Clock at No-jn precisely, to receive the same ; that Day being appointed by the So
  ciety for the Distribution of their Rewards: And before that Time no Premium or Bounty luiil be
  delivered, excepting to those ivh>i are about to leave the kingdom.
      In Cases tvhere the Society may think    ft  to admit Excuses for not attending in Person, Deputies
  tsusybe substituted to receive the Rewards, provided such Deputies are either Members of the Society     or
  the superior Officers thereof.
                                        GENERAL CONDITIONS.
      As the great object of the Society in rewarding individuals is lo draw forth and give currency
   to those inventions and improvements,       which arc likely to benefit the public at large, candidates)
  arc requested to observe, that if rhe means, by which the respective objects aic effected, do require
   an expense or trouble too great (ox general purposes, the Society will not consider itself as bound
  to give the offered revjard ; but, though it thus reserves the power of giving in all cases such
  part only of any premium as the performance shall be adjudged lodeserie, or of withholding the
  whole if theie be no merit, yet the candidates may be assured the Society will always judge libe
  rally of their several claims.
      It is required that the matters for which premiums are offered, be delivered in without names
  er any intimation to whom they belong ; that each particular thing be marksd in what manner..

   •ach claimant thinks fit, such claimant sending with it a paper sealed up, having on the outside a
   corresponding     mark, and, on the inside, the claimant's name and address ; and all candidates are
   tu take notice, that no clnim for a premium will be attended to, unless the conditions of the ad
   vertisement are fully complied with.
       No papers shall be opened, but such as shall gain premiums, unless where it appears to the
   Society absolutely necessary for the determination      of the claim ; all the rest shall be returned un
   opened with the matrers to which they belong, if inquired after by the mark, within two years ;
   after which time, if not demanded, they shall be publicly burnt, unopened, at some meeting of
   the Society.
       All mudcls of machines, which obtain premiums or bounties, shall be the property of the So
   ciety ; and, where a premium or bounty is given for any machine, a perfect model thereof shall
  be given to the Society.
       All the premiums of this Society are designed for Great Britain and Ireland, unless expressly
  mentioned to the contrary.
     •The claims shall be determined      as soon as possible after the delivery of the specimens.
       No person shall receive any premium, bounty, or encouragement, from the Society, for any
  matter for which he has obtained, or purposes to obtain, a patent.
       A candidate for a premium, or a person applying for a bounty, being detected in any disinge
  nuous method to impose on the Society, shall forfeit such bounty, and be deemed incapable of
  obtaining any for the future.
       The performances which each year obtain premiums or bounties are to remain with the So
  ciety until after the public distribution of rewards.
       No member of this Society shall be a candidate for, or entitled to receive, any premium,
  bounty, or reward, whatsoever, except the honorary medal of the Society.              The cand dates are,
  in all cases, expected to furnish a particular account of the subject of their claims ; and, wheie
  certificates arc required to be produced in claim of premiums, they should be expressed, as nearly
  •is possible, in the words of the respective advertisements,       and be signed by persons who have a
  positive knowledge of the facts stated.
      Where premiums or bounties are obtained in consequence of specimens produced, the Society

TTh E       following paper was written in answer to a question
proposed   as the subject of a prize for the year 1797 by the
Royal    Academy of Sciences at Copenhagen, and obtained
the  first prize.  To avoid confusion or mistake, we have
adopted the author's notation, and have adhered as closely to
the original as the nature of the subject would admit. — E.

    The question, which        I             13th number of
                                       first saw in the

the following words: — Ex principiis mecbanicis exponere ra-

 principles, the ratio of the moving power to the burthen both
 in four-wheeled and two-wheeled carriages, taking into ac
 count at the fame time the impediments to motion, that is
 to fay, friction, and the other obstacles to be overcome by
 the moving power which commonly occur in roads, that it
 may in general appear on what occasions either of these car
 riages can be employed with most advantage."
     The general utility of this question induced me, last sum

 consequence of two months relaxation from my usual occu

                     On the Rejtflance experienced by
                                  Seclion 2.
      The    roads and ways on which loaded carriages are drawn
  from    one   place to another by horses, oxen, and other ani
  mals,     are  so different in their nature, and the impediments
  which the moving power has to overcome are so numerous,
  that, on the first view, it appears very difficult to find general       ,
                                                                             «
  formulae to indicate the resistance for every given kind of
  road, carriage and loading, and to determine the circum-
1 stances under which the one kind of carriage is to be pre
  ferred to the other.        However, when we separate from con
   stant impediments the action of which is nearly uniform,
  and which, properly speaking, characterize the nature of the
   way, but without excluding them from our research, those
   which occur on every road, but only occasionally, and which,
   consequently, can be overcome by a momentary exertion of
   the moving power, among which may be included single
   eminences and hollows, such as ridges, stones, channels,
   holes, pavements, bridges, &c; all the different kinds of
   roads may be reduced to the three following classes :
       ist, Solid and smooth, to which belong all level as well as
   inclined roads, crooked and straight; also hollow roads, with
   solid, broad, smooth ruts: in a word, all roads the surface of
   which is neither rugged nor yields to the impreflion of the
  wheels.
      2d, Solid and uneven, which do not suffer the wheels to
   fink into them, but which, by their inequality, present a
   pretty uniform resistance.         In this class are comprehended
   rough     nigged    roads,  interspersed  w ith
                                                   ridges of rock, paved
   roads, and roads in which parts are covered with timber and
   the trunks of trees.
      3d, Soft smooth roads which yield to the impreflion of the
   wheels, such as marshy or clayey roads, or roads covered with
   soft earth, sand, flints, or small stones.
                                   Seclion 3.
       As all roads, either in whole or in part, are comprehended
    in one of the above classes, I shall examine them according
    to these principal divisions, and determine for each in parti
    cular the resistance experienced by four as well as by two-
    w heeled carriages, and point out the conditions under which
    the one kind of carriage is to be preferred to the other for
    each kind of road. It appears, however, that a distinction
    ought to be made in regard to each of these three classes ;
    that is to fay, whether the road be horizontal or inclined,
    smooth or covered with small eminences, new or worn into
              6                                                   circular

                   tin o and four-wheeled           Carriages,
circular inequalities.   But, as level as well as inclined roads
covered with small eminences and intersected with circular
depressions, as far as the comparative maximum of resistance
is concerned, belong to inclined roads, and may be consi
dered as such with an increased degree of inclination,       the
angle  of inclination  may  be taken  into the calculation with
out much difficulty; consequently these properties require no
particular division.
                                  Seclion      4.
  But, though this natural division of all the different kinds
of roads into three principal classes will facilitate a com
parison between two-wheeled and four-wheeled carriages in
regard to the resistance which they oppose to the moving power
on each kind of road proposed, which is properly the object
of this research ;     on the other hand, appears difficult to
                           it,
give   satisfactory
       a             answer  to the first part of the question,
and to deduce, from mechanical principles, the ratio of the
moving poWer to the resistance.    The latter, indeed, can be
determined a priori from statical principles    but this  not;         is
the cafe with the former, which, on account of the endless
difference in the strength of animals, and the various modi
fications of this strength on different roads, can be deter
mined only         by
                 experiments, and even then the result will
be merely an approximation.

  In the following determinations, however, that        may be   I
able   in some measure to compare each kind of resistance with
the moving power,     shall premise the following principles
                           I                                                :
    1st, That the weight M, equal to one pound, (Plate IT.
fig. 1.) freely suspended from      rope passing over the fixed
                                           a
pulley C,      the heaviest that an animal standing on the
              is
level plain  AB can draw or sustain during the period of                    /
 hours.
    ad, That      G the greatest velocity with which the above
                      is
animal, w ithout bearing any burihen or drawing any thing
after  it,can travel for the period of hours along  t    road of a
any given nature;       that, in regard to this animal, the. ve
                             so
locity G will be sometimes greater and sometimes less, ac
cording to the nature of the road.
    Now,      M and G, in regard to the animal which we
             if
suppose to be employed, and         regard to the road on which
                                          in
the burthen       to be carried, be known
                   is                                   by
                                                experiments, we
sliall have   adeterminate measure of the moving power, as
we know that the proposed animal can draw on the proposed
load during the period of hours, with the velocity g, freely
                                  t                                a

Il8                On the Reftjlance experienced by
suspended weight       of   M     —        pounds. This well known
formula, however, is only empirical ; but it agrees so far with
experience as to answer all the purposes of practice.
                                 SeQlon 6.
   Now if the resistance which, in regard to four-wheeled
carriages we shall express by R, and for two-wheeled car
riages by R', has been found for both these kinds, we shall
have,
      M       —             =  R;  and  M      —           =   W;
          (i       -J-)'                   (i     -^-)*
from which we deduce the velocity with which each of these
kinds of carriages is moved, namely,
                                    g = G        —
         For   the four-wheeled
                                              [i     •/ -igj-) ;
                                                         R'
         For the two-     wheeled  g' = G        —  Vs
                                             (1
    Having thus        established the means for estimating the
moving power,        I  shall now proceed to determine the resist
ance   itieif in  regard to the different kinds of carriages.

                                 Sedion 7.
    If the road AB (fig. a.), the inclination of which is the
 angle ABC
                 = a, be perfectly solid and smooth, the resistance
 to be overcome by the moving power OV will consist of two
 parts. The first arises from the friction of the wheels against
 the axle-tree.      If the whole burthen resting on the fore and
 hind axle-trees be
                         ~ P, that
                                      supported by each will be   i P>
 consequently, when the vertical lines OQ and OF, proceed
 ing from O the centre of the axis, the former of which in
 tersects the circumference of the axis in D, and the latter
 in E, are drawn in the perpendicular direction BA, the pres
 sure on the nave of the wheel in D is =            \  P, and m E =
 I  P cos. a ; consequently, the friction, which Acts m the di
 rection EA = -i *P cos. a, where, as is well known, *. repre
 sents a fraction, the quantity of which depends on the matter
 of the axle-tree and the nave, and on the substance with which
 they are bismeared.           Now for the fore-wheels let OE —
 w.OF, and for the hind-wheels OE = n.OF. The resistance
                                                                     in

in the direction FA is for the former = \ m >. P cos. a, and
tor the latter =             i
                     n * P cos.   a. Hence the whole first part of
the resistance arising from the friction of the axle-tree will be
     i
= (»» + «) xP cos. a.
                             Setlion 8.
   The second part of the resistance arises from the power of
gravity acting in the direction OQ.        If the weight of the
two fore-wheels be        and that of the hind-wheels p', the

of this    class, and in regard to two-wheeled carriages, has to
overcome a resistance compounded of these three parts :

      III. Comparison between these two Kinds of Carriages.
    If a = o, then is R — i (m + n) \ P, and R' = * P ;                   /«
consequently, R < R' when m + n < 2/x. That is : on solid,
smooth, horizontal roads, four-wheeled carriages are better
than two- wheeled when the axles and wheels are so con
structed that the sum of the exponents of the ratio of their
diameters in the former, is less than double the exponent of
the ratio of the diameters of the axles and wheels in the latter.
                                    Section 14.
    If^+^'=*P+*-,then               will R < R', when p + n <         2u.    That
is: on solid, smooth, inclined roads, four-wheeled carriages
 are to be preferred to two-wheeled carriages under the above
conditions, provided also that the weight of the fore and hind
wheels in the former is equal to the, sum of the weight of the
wheels -and of the overweight* in the latter.
                                    Section 15.
    If  m  +   n  =  2/t, then is R < R', when p + p' < fP + it.
That is on solid, smooth, inclined roads, four-wheeled car
            :
 riages are preferable to two-wheeled carriages when the ratio
 of the diameters of the axles and wheels is such that the sum"
 of the exponents in the former is equal to double the expo
 nents in the latter, and provided also that the weight of the
 wheels of the four-wheeled carriage is less than the weight of
 the wheels and the overweight in the two wheeled carriages.
                                    Section 16.
    From the comparison, in general it results,                   that for this
 kind of roads four-wheeled carriages ought to                  be preferred    to
 two-wheeled carriages.

that choice we judge whether his taste be good or the con
trary. Whether this faculty of the mind is to be acquired
is doubtful; that it may be improved is unquestionable;
hence it becomes our duty to avoid, particularly in our first
outset, if possible, the seeing, much less the copying, things
deformed and chimerical, as there is an acquired as well as
a natural dulness.      He whose taste is delicately just may be
said to have received the highest polish from nature, and one
of her choicest gifts ; on the contrary, to want           to be      it,

having been translated into several of the most respectable of the foreign
journals, we have no hesitation in promising, that the lovers of the fine
arts in general, and practical artists in particular, will derive much in
struction and information from the essays with which Mr. Dayes has now
favoured us.    On the fine arts we have had too many publications from
mere amateurs, and hardly any from professional men.         From the latter,          a

 blunt and cold that they can hardly be said to be awake
 during life.    From a degree of exquisite sensibility arise our
 notions of beauty and deformity in the natural as well as the
 moral world, and as our different minds happen to be more
 or less exquisite, the more or less sensibly do we perceive the
various degrees of good and bad, and of course are more or
 less capable of being charmed with the right and beautiful,
 and disgusted with the wrong and deformed. Hence it is
 that this sensibility constitutes what is termed genius, which
 is only the power or capacity of clearly conceiving and pro
 perly combining images, and of adding to mere theory prac
 tice : to which a found head and a good heart is as necessary
 as a delicate imagination ; for we cannot possess true genius
 without as exquisite a feeling for moral beauty as for what
 is great and beautiful in nature or masterly in poetry, paint
 ing, sculpture, and music.
     she reverse of true taste is shown in magnificence, parade,
and luxury ; and in whatever is horribly glaring) extrava
gant, and unnatural in the last degree.          Gold, showy co
lours, gaudy tapestry, the heavy, clumsy, and whatever is
superfluous, will ever pass with the vulgar for elegance and
greatness.     So persons of a bad taste will prefer the forced,
unnatural,    and  exaggerated, in expression, attitude, or colour,
to the truly simple, noble, or beautiful. We should be guilty
of an error were we to attempt to establish one principle of
taste only, for were we to establisli one as right, all the others
must: be wrong ; hence the mistake of Sir Joshua Reynolds,
in speaking or the Hercules, Gladiator, and Apollo; for,
though each of those figures are perfect of their kind, yet
Sir Joshua affirms that the highest perfection of the human
figure is not to be found in any one of them,
                                                     " but in that
form which is taken        from   them  all, and   which  partakes
equally of the activity of the Gladiator, of the delicacy of
the Apollo, and of the muscular strength of the Hercules."
Such an opinion is contrary to nature, as it goes to destroy
that variety arising from the active, the delicate, and the
strong: as well mie;ht we suppose a fine tree from consoli
dating the various forms found in nature.
    We must carefully distinguish between truth and taste; for
a, thing may be true, and not possess one atom of taste. The
Dutch and Flemish pictures are true, as far as mere imitation
goes ; but will any one fay, the wretches one fees in some
of Rembrant's works are tasty, or can the women of Rubens
be considered as such ; yet those men possessed great taste in
colour, cbiaro-scuro, &c. We should be careful of mistaking
tinsel for gold ; many who represent kings, do it by a great

recourse to a crown ; where the greatest profusion of orna
ments are ad mi (stole, we should be sparing in their use, for
fear of making that fine we cannot make good.           Taste and
genius have been called inspiration, the gist of heaven, and
our feelings have been irritated by mere words, that have
alarmed and benumbed our faculties ; but let us attend to the
progress of our own minds, and we stiall find that our taste
has improved in proportion to our industry to acquire know
ledge. The old masters have, in their turn, been held up as
bugbears to frighten young artists; the Italian writers on the
 arts have on all occasions used the words heavenly and divine,
till they have operated as scarecrows, to create a terror in
 mods rn painters, many of whom have ceased to labour as
 competitors.    We mould never suppose the most sublime de
 gree of perfection has been attained; the fact                is,
                                                         the most
 perfect works are not without their imperfections, and, while
 thatis  the cafe, there     room to improve it. M. Angelo

 charged with heaviness; Raphael as being dry, and possessing
a    poor chiaro-scuro   ; Titian, as defective in drawing; and
 Parmegiano as making his figures too tall       :but, while those
 considerations act as      spur to our industry, we are bound to
                             a
 venerate them for the great catalogue of perfections they have
 made us heirs to.        is from these they have obtained their
                         It
 renown, the imperfections being only foils.           We should
 never forget the obligations we are under to those who have,
 by directing our studies, introduced us to the arts        to our   ;
 parents we owe our being, but to our teachers we owe the
 power of making"    a right use of   it, matter of no small con

bituate ourselves to compare and digest our thoughts, be well
read in human nature as connected with the characters,

knowledge of the human mind, will, in time, enable us to
distinguish right from wrong, which constitutes the true prin
ciples of taste. We must distinguish real from apparent truth
in our pursuit. Real truth does not depend on opinion,                   it   is
immutable, fixed, and permanent, and in          must be sought

it the   appearance of science, yet is far from having any true
 connection with it. Such is the constrained air and erect
 attitude taught in dancing, the violent actions used in thea
 tres, and many others not countenanced by nature, but de
 pending wholly on custom for support. The artist must tread
 in the simple path of nature, and leave those adventitious and
 forced airs to the persons to whom they belong, the dancing
 master, hair-drefler, &c. Unfortunately there is a fashion
 in art, and which the vulgar would attempt to force upon us.
 Whatever is flight, crude, or undetermined, is all the rage,
 and the artists appear to be falling into a habit of painting
 without form : that decision observable in the old masters,
 and which is inseparable from the grand style, is almost
 neglected. To paint for what is termed effect may an
 swer the purpose of the idle, the ignorant, and those who
 make a trade of the art, but such a practice will not satisfy
 the discerning.       The only apology the artist can offer            is,
                                                                         that
he must fish with such baits as will take           :     unfortunately, he
does not live to paint, but paints to live.                The Greeks had
 a great advantage over the moderns in having philosophers to
juaee of their works, and states to reward them.
    We must not reject works of art because they do not pos
sess the first degree of taste; for they may be tasty though
 not ranking in the first class just as we fay
                                   ;                    a    thing is  sweet,
though   it    only in
              is        a    certain degree so.   It    is the condition of
man to labour much to obtain little this should make us
                                                ;
cautious of pronouncing hastily on works of art               :     none are
unexceptionable,        and   perhaps  there    are   but  few  from   which
we may     not   derive   some   benefit.
    Of the various degrees of taste, the grand consists in the
choice of objects superior to the common (not only in man
but in nature), and in the omission of the subordinate and
trivial parts.     Beautiful taste selects the beautiful for imita
tion.     An  union     of the grand and beautiful will form the
best and most perfect tafle.             Meanness of taste expresses
distinctly   all   the   trivial  and  little    parts of objects, hence
the whole becomes little.             The debased or corrupt, de
lights in things monstrous, deformed, and ugly                :   it may be
called the grotesque, and the praise bestowed on              it   should be
as  limited   as   the   views   of the  artist.    Those    who   have  suc
ceeded    most    in   this  way,  have   been    praisedby    the  ignorant
in proportion to the ugliness of the objects introduced in
their works.       Great and noble spirits will ever admire the
sublime parts of creation, while the rural and all the more
humble beauties will best associate with the domestic virtues.

     Wisdom is      the parent   of taste and virtue, the offspring of
taste is pleasure    —of   virtue, happiness.       A man without tastf
may be said to be without piety, as by not feeling he is in,,
capable of offering that praile which results from an admira7
tion of the beauties of creation ; he has a natural disrelish fojr
what is good ; he becomes the enemy of all the world ; h#
feels not for a relative, a friend, or society : the law of the
land is his gospel, and his attorney regulates his conscience j
 he lives without love, and dies without pity.
     We have two ways open to \is to acquire a good taste ; the
 first* and most difficult is by a reference to nature, the second
 is through the medium of art. But, as the former would
 prove too difficult a task, we must therefore first diligently
  apply ourselves to discover it in the works of the most cele
  brated artists, and thereby fit ourselves to pursue the same
 inquiry in nature.
      Besides a perfection of judgment, we have .also a truth os
 hand to attain. To this end, having selected an object worthy
 our attention, we are bound to imitate it with all the fidelity
  we are matters of; and, as each master has in him excel
 lencies not to be found in any other, we must avoid a par
  tiality, or we (hall lose the benefit to be derived from them all.
 Thus we shall obtain a mass of information not to be derived
  from any particular one. Hence the benefit resulting from
  viewing galleries of pictures, as the various masters become
  correctives to each other, and truth results from their general
  testimony.       The company and conversation of men well in
 formed     in the  arts will contribute to improve our taste, be
  cause artists form opinions on the works of different masters
  according to their peculiar manner of thinking, which will
  naturally furnish us with hints which we did not attend to,
  and enable us to enjoy other men's parts and reflections as
  well as our own.        Information from this source must not,
  however, be generally expected ; the artills are not all wile
  or liberal; many produce an effect without knowing the
  cause, some are morose and reserved, others unwilling to
                                                                    teach

  IZ8                       On Tainting.
  teach another what they have with difficulty learned, and
some few will be found easy and communicative.
     When we have made ourselves acquainted with the beau
 ties of art, we may consider ourselves at liberty to act on our
 own foundation ; but we are bound to (how in our works
 that we act from an impression made on our minds by na-
 rure, or we shall never excite similar sensations in the spec
 tator, but ultimately sink into mere mannerists or imitators.
 A general likeness prevailing through the whole of his works
 must stamp the artist a mannerist ; we mean not, however,
 such a similitude as may happen by chance.          The adoption
 of a grace or an ornament, by no means implies plagiarism.
 If  they are introduced with fitness, there can be no charge of
 want of judgment.        This is very different to using a visible
 or striking part of a composition, which no independent spirit
 would stoop to.      Representations of antient urns, armour,
 costumes, buildings, &c, will be of more value to the ge
 nuine artist than even the finest historical or other composi
 tion. A knowledge of the latter he ought to possess before
 he attempts to compose, and the utility ot urns, armour, &c,
 will be obvious. Falling into imitation has produced what
 has been termed the schools, and ultimately proved their
 ruin ; Nature sufficiently revenges herself on those who neg
lect her.
    In the arts, as in every branch of study, the first thing we
have to learn is what others have done, or, in other words,
the present state of human knowledge.         Without this neces
sary information we stiall stand as children only, and of course
our improvement will be but slow ; besides, we shall have the
mortification of finding our imaginary discoveries anticipated,
and our labour fruitless. Another advantage will result from
such an inquiry, the learning how much experience is within
the reach of diligence.
    Imitation is the first part of painting, the second is a judi
cious selection ; but even in the imitative part we must cau
tiously shun objects deformed and base if we hope to possess
the first taste, and only copy such as will teach us greatness,
beauty, or accuracy.        Such a conduct will enable us to
reflect with wisdom, and also to discover the cause, or from
whence arise those perfections by which we are moved.            If
in the course of our inquiry we find a perfection prevail
through the whole of an artist's works so as to become a
character, we may depend on it that was the kind of per
fection sought by the master; as in M. Angelo, greatness of
style, knowledge of the figure, and foreshortening;        in Ra

 works of many justly celebrated living artists.               Much will
 depend     on  industry  ; if we  fee  a  grace  or beauty   in a master
 we must endeavour to make it our own, not merely by copy

 helped     by imitation.    If composition strikes, (ketch of the

  what has been observed           it will be evident we must, in the
  first instance, either go to, or suffer ourselves to be guided to

  be that independence residing from tiffing on an original
  principle, or seeking thole perfections in nature with which
  art abounds, or, in other words, giving those energies to the
   soul that leave     to act free of all restraint.

     It will also, no doubt, afford great pleasure, both to philo
 sophers and men of taste, to learn that a very exact delinea
 tion of this great natural curiosity, painted in a capital style,
 has been finished by Mr. Thomas Robinson, now in Belfast,
 whose fine picture of the battle of Ballynahinch,          at present
 in possession of the marquis of Hertford, was so much ad
 mired.       In this picture of the Giants' Causeway, Mr. Ro
 binson has not only done justice to its picturesque and stu
 pendous forms, but has paid particular attention to some
 striking peculiarities in its structure, deserving the notice of
 men of science.
     To the following remarks       I (hall prefix extracts from the
account or description given by Dr. Hamilton in his Letters,
part ii. p. 26 :
     "  The Giants' Causeway is generally described as a mole
or quay, projecting from the base of a steep promontory some
hundred feet into the sea, and is formed of perpendicular pil
lars of basaltes, which stand in contact with each other, ex
hibiting a sort of polygon pavement, somewhat resembling
the appearance of a solid honeycomb.           The pillars are irre-
          prisms of various denominations, from three to eight
tular   f
   des j but the hexagonal columns are as numerous as all
the others put together.
    "   On a minute inspection, every pillar is found to be se
parable into several joints, whose articulation is neat and
compact beyond expression, the convex termination of one
joint always meeting a concave socket in the next ; besides
which, the angles of one frequently ssioot over those of the
other, so that they are completely locked together, and can
never be separated without a fracture of these parts.
    " The sides of each column are unequal among themselves,
but the contiguous fides of adjoining columns are always of
equal dimensions, so as to touch in all their parts.
    "   But it is not here that our admiration ftould cease :
whatever the process was by which Nature produced that
 beautiful and curious arrangement of pillars so conspicuous
 about the Giants' Causeway, the cause, far frdm being limited
to that spot alone, appears to have extended itself through a
 large tract of country in every direction; insomuch that many

nine sides.

     I      now subjoin the promised remarks, which are so
         shall
original and  satisfactory, that every judicious reader will join
with the writer of this letter, in hoping that they will be
resumed and given to the public in a more extended form;
and let me add that the testimony, of so accurate a judge,
of the correctness of Mr. Robinson's delineation, will raise it
high in the opinion of persons of sciences.                A. B.
Remarks on the Accounts      given by Naturalists of the Giants'
                             Causeway.
    The basaltic pillars which in the last thirty years have
been discovered in various parts of France and Germany, and
the Hebrides, have excited much attention, and occasioned
many controversies among modern naturalists.
   The Giants' Causeway was the first assemblage of such
pillars that attracted notice, and is still admitted by all to be
the neatest and most perfect group hitherto discovered ; but
in point of magnificence, the particular spot called the Giants'
Causeway is inferior to many others on the fame coast.        Mr.
Pennant probably knew of no other columns in the north of
Ireland when he pronounced, that " basalt pillars in Stassa
far exceed the Irish in grandeur."       He was little aware that
our basaltic country, and especially our coast, exhibits many
miles of vast perpendicular precipices, lined with basalt co
lumns, in parallel ranges, with a magnificence unrivalled in
any other part of the world.
    The colonade at Fairhead, on the coast of Antrim, is
proved, in Nicholson's Philosophical Journal for December
1801, far to exceed Staffa in grandeur; its columns being
each 250 feet long; that                is,
                                near five times as long as the
tallest pillars at Stassa.
    Nor     our superiority confined to the grandeur alone; our
           is
towering and extensive precipices disclose to the naturalist the
materials and arrangement of the strata of which this country

is composed, displaying a variety os the basalt, of different
forms and of a different principle of construction, internal
and external ; such as is not met w ith or not noticed in any
other part of the world.
     As we row along the base of these stupendous fagades, we
enjoy a scenery magnificent bevond description, and discover
 many curious circumstances which have hitherto escaped the
 notice of naturalists : I will mention one.
      The Giants' Causeway, compared by Dr. Hamilton' to a
 mole or quay, and supposed by Messrs. Desniaresi and Raspe
 to be a jet or current of lava running into the sea from the
 base of a volcanic hill, now appears lo be a part of one of
 the original strata of our globe, placed at its intersection with
 the plane of the sea.         This stratum is forty-four feet thick,
 and entirely composed of basalt pillars of that length : it is
 inclined to the horizon in a small angle, and, when traced
 from the causeway eastward, ascends obliquely along the face
 of the precipice. It culminates at the distance of about a
 mile from the causeway : its upper surface is now elevated
 near 250 feet above the surface of the sea : proceeding east
 ward, it dips and finallv emerges at Portmoon, two miles east
 from the causeway, forming at its immersion the vases of two
 beautiful conical islands.
      Magnificent as the colonades may be supposed, which this
 stratum displays in so extensive a course across the face of
  these mighty precipices, they are bv no means our finest ;
  the stratum next but one above this is eleven feet thicker,
  aud of course the pillars, of w hich it also is entirely com
  posed, are fifty-five feet each, and its extent is somewhat
  greater than the former.          The intermediate stratum is com-
    10fed of another variety       of basalt, prismatic, but not co-
  r iininar: this is fifty-four feet thick.
       The Giants' Causeway stratum, where it attains its greatest
  height, is the eighth, counting from the sea ; all the lower
   ones emerge in succession as we approach Portmoon ; and,
   where this stratum finallv emerges, il has eight over        it,  four
   of them columnar, the pillars being 01 very different lengths,
   determined    by    the thickness, of the stratum.      P. ut in each
   separate  stratum    die diameters  of  the pillars,  and the  perfec
   tion or imperfection of their construction, appear pretty much
   the fame, while the whole mass of the strata are steadily pa
   rallel to each other.
       WhenI      last summer found at the Giants' Causeway an
   ingenious    and   rising artist, Mr. Robinson, whom     I    knew to
   be highly favoured      by    my friend the bishop of Dromore,
   employed to make    a    drawing of it,
                                         I     at first thought I  would
                                                                    have

                          On Basaltet.                           133
have directed him to parts of the coast, which would have
afforded him subjects of greater beauty as well as novelty.
But, upon refledtion, I think he has made the best choice,
as the name of ihe Giants' Causeway will probably excite an
attention to the subject and the artist, which more stupendous
scenery could not have procured with such as had not seen it.
It remains, then, to relate a few particulars belonging to this
wonderful production of nature, and to give a brief statement
of the controversies to which it has given rife among modern
naturalists.
   The Giants' Causeway has been often compared to a
honeycomb, which it certainly resembles much ; but accu
rate observers find a very striking difference between their
component prisms. The powers of the bee seem to be li
mited; he can construct his cell of no other figure than a
regular hexagon, that    is,with fix fides.
   Mathematicians well know that the hexagon           is the only
regular figure (with more fides than four), of which    a  number
put together completely fill up space.
   Yet      appears that in the Giants' Causeway, the space
            it                                                    is
completely filled without any such limitation, figures of every
number of fides from three to eight (as Dr. Hamilton ob
serves) being intermixed, yet the space        as accurately filled
                                                 is
up as in the honeveomb, and             closely as to hold water
                                       so
when   a hollow in the surface suffers     to collect.
                                            it
   The extreme regularity of the Giants' Causeway pillars has
much embarrassed naturalists    :  some ascribe their regularity
to crystallization   but the celebrated Mr. Kirwan has shown
                     ;
that in many particulars these prisms differ from all known
crystals.
    Some modern philosophers follow the opinion of      aFrench
naturalist,   M. Desmarest, who supposed the Giants' Cause
                 a
way to be of volcanic origin, and that its regular prisms were
 formed in the currents of lava as they cooled. To this      has
                                                            it
been strongly objected that similar figures have not been found
in the currents of any known volcano.
    Dr. Hamilton and M. Monnet allege that these prisms
were formed in the heart of the volcano, at the bottom of its
crater, and that we must wait until the mountain decays be
fore we can discover them.
    But they cannot have been formed there, as regular basalt
prisms abound on the tops of mountains, and also several
ranges of them ate found placed alternately one over the other,
forming accumulations manv strata deep and most regularly
disposed, which, had they been in the crater of       avolcano,
                               K   %                       must

134    .                      On Basaltes.
must have all nielted into one mass ; besides, these gentlemen
 make us wait too long for proof.
    Mr. Raspe, observing that the Giants' Causeway ran into
the sea, and conceiving it to be a current of lava, supposed
 that some unknown quality in the salt water, together with
 the sudden cooling, occasioned the material, of which it was
 composed, to assume regular forms.
    But many currents of lava have been found in different
 parts of the world running into the sea, while prisms, like
 those at the Giants' Causeway, have not been observed at
 any of .them.
    An attentive examination of our coast shows the weakness
 of Mr. Raspe's theory, though warmly adopted bv M. Do-
 lomieu ; for, although basalt pillars and colonades abound in
 the faces of our precipices hanging over the sea for twenty
 miles, yet columnar basalt comes into contact with the salt
 water but in three points; to wit, the two intersections of
 the Giants Causeway stratum mentioned above, and at Car-
 rickarede, five miles eastward.
    Dr. Hutton, adhering to the igneous system, but giving
up the usual mode of producing lava by volcanic eruption,
affirms that all basalt (the stone of which the Giants' Cause
way is formed) is lava, first fused, and then consolidated in
the bowels of the earth, whence it was elevated to its sur
face, and to the tops of our mountains, by the expansive
force  of  subterranean   sire.
    Wild    as this fashionable theory must appear, and contrary
to all probability, it is also unsupported byanv species of proof,
and contradicted bv facts in every part of this country ; for,
instead of the dislocation and contortion of the strata, which,
according to his theory, he sa\s, we must expect, (Edin
 burgh Transactions, vol. i. p. 265,) and instead of finding
them, as he savs we do, " in every possible position, from
 horizontal becoming vertical, from continuous broken and
separated in every possible direction, from a plane bent and
doubled," nothing can exceed the regularity with which the
strata are disposed over the whole face of this basalt country,
nor does their steady parallelism seem ever to be disturbed.
    Though basalt has for a long time been pretlv generally
considered as a volcanic production, yet more accurate mo
dern observers have discovered many circumstances which
show it never could have been in fusion; for instance,
    All lavas abound with air-holes, while not a single cavity
is to be found in any of our basalts, except what are men
tioned below.
                                                               AU

      All   lavas  are accompanied by scoria, not a particle of
  which is to be found at the Giants' Causeway, or any where
  on our coast *.
      Currents of lava are stated by Sir William Hamilton,
  Ferber, and Spalanzani, always to vary in their density,
  their materials being generally arranged according to their
  specific gravities : thus, at the bottom compact lava, thea
 cellular lava, then scoria, lastly cinders and volcanic; ashes.
  Now, if basalt be of volcanic origin, our strata must be cur
  rents of lava, of course should be governed by the same rule ;
 instead of which, every basalt stratum here is of uniform den
  sity and uniform material from top to bottom.
      Marine (hells and their impressions have lately been disco
 vered in some of our basalts f: this proves they never were in
 fusion, as such substances calcine and turn into lime with a
 very moderate heat.
      Basalt pillars have also been lately found with cavities filled
 with fresh water ; a fact incompatible with igneous fusion J.
      Mr. Kirwan derives every thing from aqueous solution;
 and fays, that the material of which our causeway is formed
  was split into columns by desiccation.
      Eminent as this great man undoubtedly is in the chemical
  and mineralogical branches of natural history, yet on this
 subject his theory seems to be as insufficient as those of any
 of his predecessors; for his system does not account for the
 delicate articulations of our pillars, by far the most curious
 circumstance attending them, and most happily exhibited in
 different points of view in the present picture.
     This theory, too, is incompatible wiih the different ranges
 or strata of pillars placed on one another with solid rock be
 tween them.
     But, above all, it is contradicted by fact, our pillars being
     * Some traveller! have thing, t thev observed vestiges as fire and scoria
of iron; bur, if they had b'okc tile stones, they would      have found they
 had   been deceived by the exterior appearance, and that the internal struc
ture was incompatible with any such pinciplc,       Somj stones which have
 been picked up on our coast have been produced as exhibiting real marks
of lire ; but these had been used in forming hearths for the burning of kelp.
     t These had not been discovered when Dr. Hamilton's book was pub
 lished.
     % That such water could not possibly have got through any chinks or
cleft* between the basalt columns will be shown below ; for nothing can
be more compact and closely joined, so as not to admit the minutest in
terval.    Indeed, this water is always found as a kind of nucleus, within
the most compact part of the stone, and inclosed in a gh:zcd covercle or
glossy (hell, which seems to have formed its nidus from the first formation
of its stony bed.
                                     K3                                    in

in   close contact with each other, as appears by their surface
holding water ; whereas, had they been formed by their sub
stance splitting on desiccation, great intervals must have ex
isted between them.
    From all this it must appear that philosophers have not
yet Jiscovered the process adopted by nature in the construc
tion of this beauiiful and stupendous work ; but, though we
 cannot penetrate the secret of her operations, it is with plea*
sure we admire her magnificence, especially when joined to
the most consummate neatness ; and where are both so abun
dantly displayed as at the Giants' Causeway and its vicinity ?
The toils of a journev are amply repaid by the contemplation
of such wonderful objects; and to those who are too distant
for such an expedition, Mr. Robinson's fine picture, finished
 on the spot, and now at Belfast, will give a better idea of the
 Giants' Causeway, and its to\vering promontories,             than any
thing of the kind yet attempted.                                 W. R.

    Iron.    By Edward Howard, Esq. F. R.S.
                         [Continued from p. 31.]
 J.T remains for me to speak of a substance mentioned in the
Lithophylactum Bornianum, part i. p. 125, described thus: —
" Ferrum retractorium, granulis niteutibus, matrice viref-
centi immixtis, {Ferrum virens Linn.,) cujus fragmenta, ab
unius ad vigenti usque librarum pondns, cortice nigro scori-

    The iron thus described is moreover made remarkable by
a note *, which observes, that credulous people aflert it to
have fallen from heaven, during a thunder storm, on the
3d   of July 1753.
    The collection of baron Born, it is well known, has a
         in the cabinet of the right hon. Charles Greville, who,
Jilace
  rom the effect produced by comparing the histories and struc
ture of the Italian and Yorkshire stones with the description
of this iron, was induced to search the collection of Born,
where he discovered the very substance asserted to have fallen

resemblance      to each other, it will soon appear not to be my
province to anticipate.
   The president having done me the honour to submit his
specimens of the Yorkshire and Italian stones to my exami
nation, I became indebted to Mr. Greville and Mr. Williams
for a similar distinction : and, being thus possessed of four
substances,  to all of which the fame origin had been attri
buted, the necessity of describing them niineralogically did
not fail to present itself. To execute this talk, no one could
be more eager, and certainly no one better qualified, than
the count de Bournon.       He has very obligingly favoured me
with the following descriptions.

different substances, which may be easily distinguished                               by
making use of    a   lens.
    One of these substances, which                     in
                                              great abundance, ap-
                                                  is
        in the form of small bodies, some of which are per-
  ectly globular, others rather elongated or elliptical.
f>ears                                                          They
are of various sizes, from that of       small pin's head to that of
                                              a
a  pea, or nearly    so;  some of them however, but very few,
are of a   larger size.    The colour of these small globules
                                                         "                            is

gray, sometimes inclining very much to brown ; and they
are completely opaque.       They may, with great ease, be
broken in all directions : their fracture is conchoid, and
(hows a sine, smooth, compact grain, having a small degree
of lustre, resembling in some measure that of enamel. Their
hardness is such, that, being rubbed upon glass, they act upon
it in h flight degree; this action is sufficient to take off its
polish, but not to cut it: they give faint sparks when struck
with steel.
   Another of   these substances, is a martial pyrites, of an in
determinate form ; its colour is a reddish yellow, slightly in
clining to the colour of nickel, or to that of artificial pyrites.
The texture of this substance is granulated, and not very
strongly connected : when powdered, it is of a black colour.
This pyrites is not attractable by the magnet; and is irregu
larly distributed through the substance of the stone.
    The third of these substances consists in small particles of
iron in a perfectly metallic state, so that they may ealilv be
flattened or extended by means of a hammer.           These par
ticles give to the whole mass of the stone the property of
being attractable by the magnet ; they are, however, in less
•proportion than those of pyrites just mentioned.        When a
piece of the stone was powdered, and the particles of iron
separated from          it,
                      as accurately as possible, bv means of              a
magnet, they appeared to compose about *-0th of the whole

means      of   a               nearly of an earthv consistence.

       a
the very attractable black oxide of iron.    This crust     how     is,

with small particles of iron in the metallic state they may:

is more particularly the cafe with respect to the crust of those
stones which remain to be mentioned, they being much

more rich in iron than that I have just described ; a circum
stance I think it needless to repeat in the following descrip
tions of them.          The stone now treated of, does not, when
breathed upon, emit an argillaceous smell : the same remark
may be applied to all the others.
     The specific gravity of this stone is 3352.
                            Stone from York/hire.
     This    stone,   the constituent parts of which are exactly the
fame as those        of the stones from Benares, differs from them,
however,
     First, sn having a finer grain.
     Secondly, Thaf the substance described as being in the
 form of small globular or elliptical bodies, is not so con
stantly in those forms, but is also found in particles of an
irregular shape ; a circumstance that is not met with in the
 other stones : these bodies are likewise, in general, of a
 smaller size.
     Thirdly, The proportion of martial pyrites, which has
 precisely the same characters as that in the stones from Be
 nares, is less; on the contrary, that of the iron in the me
 tallic state is much greater.           The quantity I was able to se
 parate by means of the magnet, appeared to me to compose
 about eight or nine parts, in one hundred, of the weight of
 the whole mass.           I observed manv pieces of this iron, of a
 pretty considerable size ; one of them, taken from a portion
 of the Hone I had powdered in order to separate the iron,
 weighed several grains.
     The part of the stone which is in an earthy state, and
 which serves to connect the other parts together, has rather
  more consistence than that of the preceding stones; and its
  appearance does not differ much from that of decomposed
  felspar or kaolin.        The stone itself, therefore, although by no
  means hard, is rather more difficult to break with the fingers.
      The specific gravity of this stone is 3508.
                               Stone from Italy.
      This stone was in a perfectly entire state ; consequently, its
 -whole surface was covered over with the black crust peculiar
  to all stones of this kind.          As the stone was of a very small
  size,   it became necessary to sacrifice the whole of it to the
  investigation of its nature.         Its grain was coarse, similar to
  that ot the stones from Benares : in it might be perceived the
  fame gray globular bodies, the fame kind of martial pyrites,
  and the fame particles of iron in the metallic state. The
                                                               proportion

    140                     Experiments and Observations
    proportion of these last was much less than in the stone from
    Yorkshire, but rather greater than in the stones from Be
    nares. The fame kind of gray earthy substance served to
    connect the different parts together ; and nothing more could
    be perceived, except a few globules, which consisted wholly
    of black oxide of iron, attractable by the magnet, and one
    single globule of another substance, which appeared to differ
    from all those we have already described.     This last substance
    had a perfectly vitreous lustre, and was completely transpa
    rent : it was of a pale yellow colour, slightly inclining to
    green ; and its hardness was rather inferior to that of calca
    reous spar.    The quantity of                 it,
                                         however, was too small to
    be submitted to such an investigation as might have deter
    mined its nature.    The black crust which covered the stone
    was rather thinner than that of the stones already described      ;
    and seemed to have undergone kind of contraction, which had
                                               a
    produced in    it number of fissures or furrows, thereby tracing
                        a
    upon the surface the appearance of compartments, similar in
    some measure to what      observed in the stones called Jeptaria.

    of the stone from Yorkfliire. Its grain      finer than that of

    lame kind of earthy substance likewise served to connect the
    other parts together.
       This stone, however, differs materially from the others.
       First, The particles of pyrites cannot be seen without    lens.
                                                                  a
       Secondly,      contains
                       It          much larger quantity of iron in
                                       a
    the metallic state; insomuch, that the proportion of that
    metal, separated from          means of the magnet, amounted
                                  it     by
    to about Tooths of the weight of the whole.
       This stone has also (owing, perhaps, to its having remained
    a much longer time          in
                              the earth than the preceding ones, all
    of which were taken up nearly at the very instant of their
    fall,) another difference, viz. many of the particles of iron
    in metallic state have undergone an oxidizement at their
        a
    surface;    circumstance that has produced       great number of
             a a

the other constituent parts of the stone,. has occasioned a
greater degree of adhesion between these parts, and has ren
dered the substance of the stone more compact.
    The great quantity of iron in a metallic state which this
stone contains,    added to its greater compactness,        makes it
capable of receiving a flight degree of polish ; whereas it U
impossible to give any polish to the others. When polished,
the iron becomes very evident, in the polished part; appear
ing in the form of small specks, almost close to each other,
which have the colour and lustre peculiar to that metal :
these specks are, in general, nearly of an equal size.
    The black crust of this stone is similar to that of the others.
    The specific gravity of the stone is 4281.
    It is easy to perceive, from the foregoing description, that
these stones, although they have not the smallest analogy with
any of the mineral substances already known, either ot a vol
canic or any other nature, have a very peculiar and striking
analogy with each other. This circumstance renders them
truly worthy to engage the attention of philosophers, and
 naturally excites a desire of knowing to what causes they owe
 their existence.              —— — —
    I proceed to consider the assistance to be derived from che
 mistry, in distinguishing these stones from all other known
 substances, and in establishing the assertion, that they have
 fallen on the earth.
    The analysis made by the French academicians of the
 stone presented to them by the abbe Bachelay, was, in part,
conducted by the ever to be deplored Lavoisier; but it was
performed before that celebrated author had enriched che
mistry with his last discoveries, and before he had given birth
 to the system under which it flourishes.          The result of this
 analysis might   well  induce  the conclusion,   that the subject of
 it was  common    pyritical matter.     It  was unfortunately made
 of an aggregate portion of the stone, and not of each distinct
 substance, irregularly disseminated      through it. The propor
 tions obtained were, consequently, as accidental as the ar
 rangement of every substance in the mass.
    The analysis of M. Barthold, of the stone of Ensiflieim, is
 subject to the same objections; but, after having the advan
 tage of the foregoing descriptions, the researches which fol
 low cannot be supposed altogether liable to a similar fatality.

distinct, were not so prominent as those of easy drawing cast

 The under surface rough, and possessed of one large pit in the

 The fracture presented regular light blue grains, distinct, and
 more prominent than No. XIII.               One- half of the button
 was drawn into a neat square bar, and proved steel of an ex
 cellent quality.      One end of the bar being loose and (haled,
 welded tolerably well, and hardened afterwards with a low

                                                                      the

   14.5         On the different Proportions   of Car Ben
  the dose of carbon, the metallic result approached more ancf
  more to the softness of malleable iron, though by no means
  possessed of all. its properties. In this series of experiments,
 iron presented with t4 th part its weight of charcoal was
  found to form very soft steel fit for making scissars, &c,
 which, in a good workman's hands, would have doubled,
 welded, and formed a very perfect point, afterwards harden
ing so as to display a beautiful close break of steel. By using
 the following precaution, it was even found capable of weld
 ing perfectly to iron. Two flat bars of a similar shape, one
 of this quality of steel, and one of good malleable iron, were
 put under the hammer with a good welding heat. After a
 few light blows, the junction was completely made.             The
 united bars were allowed to cool without further hammering
 till the (hade of heat was bright red. The whole piece was
 then drawn out in a solid compact form, whose fracture,
 when cold, presented a complete junction of the iron and
steel, exhibiting at the same time their respective grains.
     When iron is presented in fufi n to T~ th or rjbth part of
its weight of charcoal, the resulting product occupies a kind
of middle state betwixt malleable iron and steel. It then
welds with facility, and, provided the precaution formerly
mentioned is attended to, may be joined either to iron or
steel, at a very high welding heat.          Thus combined with
carbon, it is still sulceptible ot hardening a little, but without
any great alteration in the fracture.       It possesses an uncom
mon degree of strength and tenacity, capable of an exquisite
degree of polish, arising from its complete solidity and the
purity of fracture conveyed to it by fusion.
     When the dose os carbon is further diminished, and in the
ratio of this diminution, the fame steel or iron becomes more
and more red short, and less capable of cohesion under a
welding heat, so that, when the proportion is reduced to
i4sth part the weight of the iron, the quality resulting is
nearly analogous to the fusion of iron perje, or that obtained
by the fusion of iron and earths.
     It will appear evident from the result of these and former
experiments, that crude iron and steel only differ from each
other in the proportions of the carbon they contain.         In the
details now before us, charcoal alone is used in addition to
the malleable iron as pure as is ever made, to effect every
principal stage or modification of the metal. Hence we con

   Although this is the quantity of charcoal necessary to form
these various qualities of metal by this mode of synthesis,
yet we are by no means authorized to conclude that this is
the proportion of real carbonaceous matter taken up by the
iron, seeing that in experiments No. I. to No. VI. inclusive,
the weight gained by the iron was upon the average equal
only to   —j-th     part;   whereas      the charcoal which disap-
           2ITij
peared in the different fusions amounted to 61.1 per cent,                 of
the original quantity introduced along with the iron.

are remarkable :

   From this   we fee that when a proportion of charcoal equal to
^th    part, and above, the weight of the iron is used, the latter
always gains in weight; but when a more sparing proportion
is introduced, room is left for the exertion of another affinity
upon the metal, and it consequently and invariably loses in
weight proportioned to the diminution of the carbon.                  I have
here further to remark upon the foregoing experiment, and
upon the nature of experiments by synthesis performed in
this way in general, that the results as to quality will differ
materially when different portions of matter are used.                     So
that art operator repeating     " the above experiments either in
   Vol. XIII. No. 50.                  L                            crucibles

1$           On the different Proportions of Carbon, &e.
crucibles smaller or larger, or with a greater or less weight ot
mixture, would not obtain the fame results.
   The formation of cast steel in the large way, founded upon
the results of the foregoing experiments, affords an incontesta
ble proof of this.      In fusions of ]8, 22, and 25 lbs. of iron
each, we are obliged to increase the dose of carbon considera
bly beyond that requisite in small experiments. To form
steel equal to that obtained in experiment XIII. wherein ,'-0th
of charcoal was used, T-Sth part is requisite to be introduced.
For steel similar to that in experiment XIV. Tyh and 7'^th
part are used.      For softer steel ^th, whereas in the small
experiment Ti-tth part was sufficient.         If in the manufac
turing    a   small extra  quantity of  carbon  is requisite, this is
saved by the comparatively small loss sustained in the trans
mutation of the iron into steel.
    Many instances have occurred in the first fusion from a
cast steel pot in the large way, where 25 lbs. of iron, and its
requisite proportion of carbon, not exceeding 7\th, have af
forded an ingot of cast steel weighing 24 lbs. 12, 13, 14, and
15 ounces, being a loss equal to no more than x-ristn, j^-0th,
 r^Tjth, -^i.th part the weight of the iron, whereas in expe
riments No. XIII. and XIV. the loss of metal amounted to
— j th, and —j-th part the weight of the           iron.
    I shall conclude this paper with a few        remarks upon the
state in which carbon exists in steel and in crude iron.
    When malleable iron is fused with -rf^th or 1 ^th part of
its weight of carbon, the resulting product is considerably
(teelisied.    The fracture is lighter in the colour than it for
merly was in the state of iron. When fused with an 80th
 to T'-.tri, steel of an ordinary quality is produced, the frac
ture of the metal still becoming whiter.          When the dose of
carbon is increased beyond this, the steel becomes so hard
and dense as to be unfit for hammering.           The fracture now
will be found approaching to the colour of silver, and losing
its granulated appearance, assuming, however, a crystallized
 form.      In this state the metal will be found to resist the
 hammer and file, and to be unfit for any purpose.           Increase,
however, the quantity of carbon to T'tth or -.^th, the result
ing product is no longer destitute of grain, nor possessed of
 the fame degree of hardness.          The fracture will be found
 gray, and the surface easily reduced bv the pile.           A further
increase of the carbon is accompanied by an increase of these
properties.      At i-8th or i-6th, the filings of the metal,
when thrown into water, leave a carbonaceous pellicle co
vering the whole surface, and of a considerable thickness.
                                                                 Thus

        On   the  Moon's Influence on the Atmosphere,             &c.     149
    Thus   we find that carbon hardens iron           till it  arrives at the
highest pitch of density, which is indicated                  by the metal
losing grain, and assuming a crystallized silvery fracture. At
this point or maximum we may conceive that the respective
proportions of mixtures are so nearly balanced that the affi
nity exerted by the iron is just sufficient to deoxidate the
charcoal, and that hitherto nothing but pure carbon similar
to the diamond has combined with the iron.                      If, however,
the equilibrium is destroyed by a larger portion of charcoal,
then we find the affinity 'too weak to deoxidate the whole,
and part of it unites in the state of an oxide of carbon ; at
first constituting a mottled fracture, and afterwards, as the
dose is increased, all those deepening blueish gray shades pe
culiar to soft cast iron.         Hence carbon or Us oxide again
softens iron.      It never, however, restores the properties of
forging or of hammering.            One invariable law, however, is
maintained, that the fusibility of iron under every circum
stance and modification is in the ratio of the quantity of car
bon united.

    The opinion of this influence is founded upon a prejudice

means of researches and combinations of facts, established
on the basis of observations contained in our registers, to dis
cover, not a complete system, but the proper data to conduct
us, by degrees, to the solution of the problem.

  servations made in 1798 at Plaistow in Essex, about five miles
 east of London, and on ten years of similar observations made
 at London, and recorded       in the Transactions of the Royal
 Society from 1787 to 1796.
     In order to be more readily understood by speaking to the
 eye, Mr. Howard has given a plate divided into lunar weeks
 according to the four principal phases of the moon, on which
 are engraved two curves which represent the course of the
 mercury in the barometer.       One of these, which is dotted,
 represents  the course of the barometer as observed at Plaistow
 in 1798; the other is a line indicating the variations of the
 barometer at London, corresponding to each of the principal
 plans on a mean often years*.
    M.  Begnelin at Berlin, and M. Maret at Dijon, have long
 since adopted  charts of this kind to represent the course of
 the barometer and thermometer. M. M. A. Pictet mentions
having drawn out one in 1774, in order to compare the con
temporary movements of the barometer at Geneva and Bor
deaux.
   I likewise prepared a large one lo obtain a parallel view of
tbe course of the barometer in two corresponding years of the
lunar period of nineteen years, from 1768 to 1797. It were
to be wished that the use of such charts could be universally
introduced, and that they might be always to be had ready
engraved, so that there should be nothing to do but to trace
the curve upon them, as is now the cafe at London.
   Mr. Howard remarks, and the inspection of his plate de
monstrates      that at the approach of the new and full moon
               it,
the barometrical line experiences       depression, and, on the
                                            a
contrary,   it  elevated on that of the quarters.
                 is                                 The greatest
depression of the year 1798 corresponds        to about twelve
hours after the new moon on the 8th of the eleventh (lunar)
month, and the greatest and truly extraordinary elevation
   -' The first
                part of this statement is correct, except the mention of two
curves and an error of the press  in  the original (91 for 9S).   The latter
part c/intains
             a   mistake, which the author must have committed by writing
rrom memory.       The line here mentioned serves merely to connect the
several points at which the barometer stood at the rime of each phasis, and
thus w stiow the change of level more distinctly —    Edit,
                                                                 occurred

               and on the Variations        of the Barometer.                 15 r
 occurred the 7th of the second (lunar) month at the time of
 the last quarter *.
   The greatest depression of the mercury that had been ob
served at Paris for forty years happened January 20j 1791,
on the day following the full moon.
   This coincidence appears to be most regular in fair and
moderate weather; and, in general, when the barometer fell
during the interval between the new or full moon and the
quarter, an evident perturbation in the atmosphere accom
panied.    I have remarked the same anomalies in the diurnal
variations of the barometer; they are regular in settled wea
ther, and are disturbed in changeable.
   Mr. Howard draws this general conclusion, that the gra
vity of the atmosphere as indicated by the barometer may be
subject to certain periodical changes, effected by a cause more
steady and regular than either change of temperature, cur
rents, or solution and precipitation of water, to which the
whole variation has been heretofore attributed.
   On comparing the mean height of the barometer at each
phase of the moon with the general mean of the year, he
found that the mean at the new and full moon was constantly
lower, and that at the quarters higher than the general mean.
The fame result attended the same examination of the ten
years observations   made at London.       The barometer, ac
cording to the latter, is depressed at leasts four-tenths of an
inch (English) while the moon passes from the two quarters
to the conjunction and opposition, and rises in the fame pro
portion in her return to the quarters ; an effect which the
author attributes to the attraction of the fun and moon for
the matter of the atmosphere,     which ought to have its tides
as well as the ocean, but less considerable in proportion to
    * It appears that the author has here mistaken the numerical distinc
tion of the months, as if it were applied to the lunar and not to the calen
dar months, as the chart (hows it is.       As the elevation here mentioned is,
perhaps, almost without a parallel in the records of science, it may not be
uninteresting to add a few particulars respecting    it,   of which we were   in
formed    by  Mr. Howard. The latter part of the preceding month had1
been stermy, and solar halos had appeared on two successive days, followed
by   rain, snow, and hail, amidst which the barometer began rising rapidly
on the day before the full moon.        This elevation went on for forty-eight
hours, with the wind mostly south-west, and blowing very hard.           It    af
terwards apparently went round      by   north to east, with frosty nights. The
highest temperature observed on the day of the maximum was 390, with
a  still atmosphere anda    fog. The depression which followed began with
the wind at south-east, and thence    it   veered to the westward, most proba
bly  by   south, as the frost went off with rain. — Edit.

   XXVI.     Description   of a new Gas-boldcr.        By W. H.
 T
                            Pepys inn.*
   A. H E combustion and deflagration of inflammable sub
 stances, metals, and various compounds in oxygen gas, form,
 some of the most beautiful and interesting experiments in
 modern chemistry.       The intense splendour of the liberated
 light and the variety of its colours astonish the spectator, and
 become a pleasing addition to our rational amusements, while
 the experiments serve at the same time to elucidate some of
 the great laws of nature.
    Many people, however, have complained that, notwith
 standing the simplicity to which the apparatus for such ex
 periments has been reduced, something was still desirable to
enable those who have not had many opportunities of ac
quiring habits of experimenting to enjoy this interesting sci
ence without the inconvenience of being obliged to use 2
pneumatic cistern for the purpose of transferring the gas.
To accommodate some friends of this description, I contrived
 a gas-holder, which not only obviates the above inconveni
ence, but is capable of being employed to transport the gas
 from place to place, and to preserve it from being contami
nated, and of being used for experiments with the blowpipe.
    This apparatus is in some respects similar to that recom
mended by Mr. Watt.           A small circular cistern is added at
top, which is connected with the gas-holder by means of
two pipes furnished with cocks. It has also a brass cock on
the fide, and a glass gage or register tube showing the quan
tity of included gas by the level of the water. The follow
ing is a description of the different parts :
    The gas-holder G (Plate IV.) may contain from two to
ten gallons.

ders or a blowpipe may be attached.

 dered at such an angle, that when all the uppermost cocks
 are shut no water can possibly escape.     But when a conduct-
 ing-pipe, from a retort or other apparatus generating gas, is
 introduced into this opening, then, as the gas passes up into
 the gas-holder, an equal quantity of water will be discharged
 at O into any vessel sit to receive it.

 bark of charcoal, sugar, camphor, &c.
     B, a blowpipe, with a gum elastic tube E, capable of join-
 ingthe cock Ck.
     To make use of this apparatus, first fill the gas-holder with
  water, by closing the opening O with a cork, and also the
  cock Ck, and keeping the circular cistern full of water, while
  the cocks 1 and a are both open. The air is driven out of
 the gas-holder through the cock 1, by the water descending
  into it by the cock a. When full, the water in the register
  will be on a level with the top of the gas-holder. Then
  shut the cocks 1 and a. You may now remove the cork from
  the opening O, which is then prepared to receive the con-
  ducting-pipe from any apparatus from which the gas is ge
  nerating.    As the gas is delivered the water escapes, and
  should be caught in any convenient vessel.      The register will
  then show the quantity received : when full, close the open
  ing O with a cork wrapped in leather, which prevents the
  communication with the atmosphere.         It mav now be easily
  removed or conveyed where it is wanted.
     When it is required to fill a glass receiver, as Re, with
  the gas, having previously filled the circular cistern wiih
  water, place it in the cistern, put in the adopting cork A,
  and, with the mouth applied to the cock, exhaust the re
  ceiver, in which the water will rife till full. Then close the
                                                              cock

cock   A, and open the two cocks 1 and 2, and the ga3 will
ascend into the receiver, while the water will take its place in
the gas-holder.   The substances to be experimented upon
should be mounted with wires passing through corks covered
with wetted leather, like the watch-spring S, or the defla
grating pan D, in which the substances intended to be ex
posed to the action of the gas must be ignited.
    It is not here necessary to enter into a particular account
of each process, as they are in general well known even to
the young experimentalist.        It may be necessary, however,
to add as a caution — that, after the deflagration, the gas-holder
and receiver should be removed into an open place or under
the chimnev, that the acid gas, or any other injurious air,
mav be sufficiently changed before the receiver is again ex-,
baustedby the mouth.
    When the blowpipe is used it should with its elastic pipe
be screwed on to the cock Ck; the cistern should be kept
full by reversing a large receiver of water over               it,
                                                        or any other
simple   method,  and  the cock  2, only opened   for the  admission
of water.
    Bladders mounted with cocks may be filled with gas by
first emptying them of atmospheric air, then screwing them
to the cock Ck, filling the cistern with water, and opening
the cock 2.     In all these instances the quantity used may be
ascertained from the register, which has           scale of pints or
                                                           a
cubic inches attached to it.
    The numerous experiments in which the gases, particularly
oxygen, are used, will,  I  conceive, be     sufficient apology for
                                                  a

 XXVII.       Experiments     on    Charcoal.         By   Clement   and
                            Desohmes.

                       SECOND METHOD.
                     ASlion        of   the Sulphur.
h,-AD     we begun our labour as we have related, we should
probably have been satisfied with the proofs before established,
ihat there exists no hydrogen in charcoal        and we should
                                                           ;
not have had recourse to the action of sulphur. But an ex
periment having made known to us particular combination
                                              a
of charcoal    and sulphur, we resolved to continue our labours.
                                                                     We

 156                   Experiments on Charcoal.
     We (hall here observe, that as this combination appeared
 to us to be the liquid hydrogenated sulphur of Scheele, men
 tioned in the memoir of C. Berthollet on sulphurated hydro
 gen, we were strongly inclined to acknowledge the presence
 of hydrogen in charcoal ; and we did not change our opinion
 till after an examination on a large scale, ana the most de
cisive experiments.
     Sulphur and charcoal combine at a high temperature, and
probably in different proportions.        One of these combina
tions is liquid at the usual temperature and pressure of the
atmosphere. It is this combination in particular which we
shall examine.
     It is transparent and colourless when pure, but in general
of a greenish yellow colour ; has a disagreeable odour some
what pungent, but not insipid like that of sulphurated hy
drogen : it produces on the skin a considerable degree of cold,
and evaporates as speedily as ether, without any residuum if
colourless, and leaving sulphur behind it if yellow.      Its sa
vour is at first cool, but afterwards exceedingly pungent like
that of ether.
     It is heavier than water, and keeps at the bottom of that
fluid without mixing with           it,
                                   in the fame manner as heavy  a
oil.
   As this combination      results from the union of sulphur and
charcoal,   it   may with propriety be called carburated sulphur.
                  Preparation      ofcarlurated Sulphur.
   This substance     is  obtained        by
                                          making sulphur pass through
an ignited porcelain tube in which charcoal in fragments and
in powder has been previously heated.              It      must be heaped
up   alittle in  order  that  the  sulphur    in vapours may be obliged
to come into full contact with it.
   To operate exactly, we adjusted to one extremity of the
porcelain tube which contained the charcoal                a    long glass
tube, pretty large, containing           file of small sticks of sulphur
                                          a
which could be successively pushed into the porcelain tube by
an iron spike pasting through           cork with which the tube was
                                        a
closed.     At the other extremity was an adaptor of glass ter
minated     by  abent tube immersed in         a  glass flask which com
municated with the pneumatic tub.
   With little care, an apparatus of this kind may be easily
            a
constructed      soas to lose nothing.
   Before the sulphur            introduced, all the gas the charcoal
                           by is
is capable    of  giving        heat  must be suffered to escape: the
sulphur     must   be  introduced     slowly.      When it    acts on the
charcoal,   a  yellowish liquid, having        the  appearance of an oil,
is seen   to condense    itself in  the  adaptor. By continuing the
                                                                    heat

                        Experiments on Charcoal.                     tjy
heat it evaporates, and is condensed in the water of the flask;
it traverses it in globules which in appearance do not dissolve,
and which are collected at the bottom.
    The complete success of this experiment is very uncertain.
The regular manner in which sulphur acts when heated in close
vessels, is one of the principal obstacles. It is well known that
if suddenly exposed to a great heat instead of being volatilized,
it becomes fixed in some measure, and forms a kind of paste.
It often happens that sulphur exposed to a strong heat in a
porcelain tube is not volatilized, and that no carburated sul
phur is formed. In that cafe more sulphur is introduced, to
 bring the other to such a low temperature that the whole
 may be volatilized ; but it then passes too rapidly over the
 charcoal to be united with         it,     and the sublimated sulphur,
 by    condensing      in  the  adaptor,    often makes    it burst. It   is
 much better to urge the sulphur very slowly, and, in parti
 cular, to incline the tube towards the adaptor to make the
 sulphur run upon the charcoal.
    During the production of the carburated sulphur, no gas
is  disengaged.        The air in the vessels only receives an ex
 pansion       by
                its  mixture    with the carburated sulphur, which        is
 exceedingly      volatile,   and
                                a    little which has become inflam
 mable escapes.
     Notwithstanding the difficulty of succeeding in this expe
 riment, we made one in which ten grammes of charcoal en
 tirely vanislied.       It  appeared to us thatit    formed nearly one-
 third of the combination.              When any bits of charcoal re
 main they are visibly corroded and of            a     paler black colour
 than before, being subjected to the action of the sulphur.
     When more iulphur than          is      necessary for the production
 of liquid carburated sulphur passes on the ignited charcoal,
 the result     is
                a    solid, which crystallizes in the adaptor.        These
  crystals  seem    to  resemble those of sulphur, but they contain
  charcoal, for they evidently leave some of          it  after their com
  bustion in the open air. This solid carburated sulphur may
  contain little of the liquid, and in that case

  which in the air soon loses its odour and its consistence.
      It  appears that to produce     a      combination of sulphur and
  charcoal they must be both exceedingly warm              ;  for, bv heat-
  in<r in  a retort  a   mixture of sulphur and charcoal well united,
a    fittle gas only       is obtained of a      bad odour, insoluble in
  water, and which Scheele called insoluble hepatic gas.
      We burnt      a   gas nearly similar, which may be procured iu
                        a by
  large quantity,          means we shall describe hereafter; and We
  had for product          great deal of carbonic acid and sulphurous
  acid, but apparently no water.

      Whether this was a gaseous combination of charcoal and
   sulphur, or gaseous oxide of carbon, holding in combination
  sulphur, we will not venture to determine.              Oxygenated
   muriatic acid gas, however, when brought into contact with
   this substance, the nature of which is not perfectly known
  to us, destroys it almost entirely, and sulphur is deposited,
  which is the cafe also when carburaied sulphur is evaporated
  in the air.
      Beautiful carburated sulphur may be obtained, but in small
  quantity and after long exposure to the action of the fire, by
  heating sulphuret of antimony with charcoal.           Sulphuret of
  mercury treated in the fame manner gives a very small quan
  tity, but those of copper and iron do not produce a single
  atom.
      When sulphuret of strontian is prepared by sulphate and
  charcoal, if there be a great deal of the latter, carbonic acid
  is obtained ; carbonous gas, mixed probably with hydrogen ;
  and, in the last place, a fetid gas, partly soluble and partly
  insoluble in water. This second portion seems to us to be
  the gas above mentioned.           In this experiment a very large
  quantity   of  strontian  was   disengaged : the union of the sul
  phur   with  the  charcoal  is the  cause, perhaps, which makes it
  abandon its base.
      By exposing a mixture of charcoal and sulphuret of potash,
  carefully made to a strong heat, there is obtained a prodi-
         quantity of this gas, which, we have already said, may
    e only gaseous carburet of sulphur, and which by combus
 fious
 tion gives a great deal of sulphurous acid and carbonic acid.
     The distillation of calcined sulphate of alumine and char
 coal gave also a little of this gas.      Sulphuret of lime, treated
 in the fame manner, gave none of it.
     By distilling wax with sulphur a great deal of sulphurated
 hydrogen is obtained, and at last liquid carburet of sulphur,
 but stained by the undecomposed oil aud an empyreumatio
 oil.
         Examination     of the  Liquid Carburet of Sulphur.
     We   have already observed that on the first view we sus
 pected    this substance to be the hydrogenated sulphur of
 Scheele, but the following experiments showed this opinion
 to be false.
     C. Berthollet assigns to this substance the property of suf
 fering sulphurated hydrogen to be disengaged, and of deposit
ing sulphur. But the combination which we call carburatd
sulphur does not contain sulphurated hydrogen.

Tinder a bell filled    with water under a receiver, and if the
air be exhausted       till the remainder forms an equilibrium
with      a   column of mercury of about 20 or 25 centimetres at
the mean temperature, the carburated sulphur is then seen
to afliime the state of gas ; it rises in large bubbles through
the water without being dissolved in it: and, if the pressure
be restored, the gas is immediately condensed, and reappears
under a liquid form.
   Sulphurated hydrogen which traverses water at the fame
pressure, dissolves in it ; water saturated with sulphurated hy
drogen, at the pressure of the atmosphere parts with but a
very small quantity of          when the pressure

sulphurated hydrogen.
   2d, If carburated sulphur be introduced into            barometric
                                                                    a
tube, in which the mercury maintains itself at 76 centimetres,
it  immediately falls to 50 centimetres.           The temperature

tub, the whole gas which made the mercury in the baro
meter fall, becomes condensed, and the tube                 filled withis
mercury.      This gas,  then,     not    is
                                        sulphurated   hydrogen, for
without the contact of an absorbent the latter would nave re
mained gaseous.
   This experiment ascertains nearly the elastic force of car
burated sulphur at the mean temperature. That, indeed, in
                                           by by
troduced into the barometer           making the mercury descend
to 50 centimetres, supplies,         its elasticity, the place of                    a
column of 26 centimetres, which            the measure of it. That
                                                   is
of ether at the same temperature          somewhat greater.
                                                   is
   If the pressure of the atmosphere were only 26 centimetres,
no carburated sulphur would exist but in the gaseous state.
   3d, If liquid carburated sulphur be put into             vessel with
                                                                    a
acetite of lead over       andit, this vessel be exposed in
                                          if                       com      a
plete  vacuum,   the  carburated   sulphur    will be seen   to  assume
the elastic state, and to traverse the acetite of lead without
blackening         it,
                  which sulphurated hydrogen would not fail to
do.    If the carburated sulphur be stirred with solution of
lead,      at length becomes turbid, and assumes
          it                                               brown anda a
not  a  black colour.
   We tried, but in vain, to combine sulphur with sulphu
rated hydrogen to obtain hydrogenated sulphur; we, how
ever, made this gas pass with sulphur in vapours into             warm      a
receiver.    There was no very sensible action            the sulphur
                                                                   ;

                                                                                     By

    j6o                   Experiments on Charcoal.
        By pouring, according to the advice of C. BerthoIIet, a
   little of hydrogenatid sulphur into an acid, we obtained a pre.
    cipitate of sulphur of an oily appearance, but similar to a
   paste, and which soon lost all the sulphurated hydrogen gas
   it contained : it then became solid like common sulphur,
   which is very different from carburated sulphur, as the latter
   has no smell of sulphurated hydrogen, and when pure scarcely
   leaves any residuum.
       These experiments seem to us sufficiently decisive to con
   clude that carburated sulphur contains no sulphurated hy
   drogen.
       The specific gravity of this liquid must varyj we found it
   once to be 13, that of water being ten.
       Carburated sulphur inflames with great facility.              It emits
   a strong odour of sulphurous acid ; deposits a little sulphur,
   which then burns ; and there remains black combustible
   charcoal as usual.
       This body, on passing into an ignited glass tube, experi
  ences no sensible alteration.
       It evaporates at the usual temperature, and greatly in
  creases the volume of the air —nearly as much as ether.                   It
  exercises the fame action on oxygen, azotic, hydrogen, and
  nitrous gas.       It renders them all inflammable, but does not
   seem to produce on them any particular alteration *.
       The oxygen which holds carburated sulphur in gas, deto
  nates with a prodigious force — incomparably greater than that
   produced with hydrogen.            We hoped to be able to employ
   this method to dose the constituent principles of this body,
  but we did not think it prudent to operate this detonation in
  close vessels.      These vessels ought to be exceedingly strong,
  and even then, if of glass, the experiment would be attended
  with danger.
       The air which       has   dissolved   carburated sulphur suffers it
  to burn quietly.
       A3 we have mentioned the differences between carburated
  sulphur and hydrogenated sulphur, we must not conceal a
  resemblance which we have found between them.
       Nitrous gas which holds in solution carburated sulphur
  gasified by it, is inflammable like the other gases; but the
  colour and beauty of its flame are peculiar, they can be com
  pared only to that of zinc, which burns with rapidity.
      • This
              evaporation of carburated sulphur takes place exactly in the
  fame manner as that of ether ; it is proportional to the volume of the gas,
  and does not depend on the nature of it : this affords a new reason for be-
'
  lieving it probable that the case is the fame with the evaporation of water.
                                                               Sulphurated

                     Experiments on Charcoal.                    l6i
    Sulphurated hydrogen mixed with nitrous gas produces a
similar effect.
    This is the only experiment in which carburated sulphur
did not exhibit the same phænomena as if it contained sul
phurated hydrogen ; and this fact cannot certainly destroy
the opinion which we formed, in consequence of all those we
have compared and repeated, in order to prove the difference
of these two bodies : besides, it is possible that the colour
and vivacity of the flame may have arisen from the sulphur,
which is a principle of both.
     If a piece of rag be dipped in liquid carburated sulphur
and wrapped round the bulb of a thermometer, and if the
evaporation be assisted by the wind of a bellows, it will make
the thermometer descend to the freezing at least, that is to
fay, lower than ether under the fame circumstances.
     This substance unites with phosphorus, and dissolves with
great facility; but this solution is not more inflammable
 than phosphorus alone.
     It unites also to a small quantity of sulphur without chan
ging its state, only it becomes more coloured.
     It seems to have no action on charcoal.
     The water in which carburated sulphur condenses during
 its preparation acquires a greenish-yellow colour, which in the
 course of time becomes white and milky.         At first, this solu
 tion precipitates lead of a reddish-brown colour, and then
 black, as sulphurated hydrogen does ; and at length, after a
 considerable time, white, like the sulphuric acid. It 13 to be
 presumed that the water rn this cafe is decomposed.           If this
 action of carburated sulphur on water is not very visible,
 it is the more so when the water contains a fixed alkali ; the
 union takes place with difficulty even by heat ; the carburated
 sulphur traverses the alkaline solution in vapours without
 uniting speedily with it : however, if heated in a vessel almost
 close, in order to prevent the escape of the carburated sulphur,
 it dissolves almost entirely, and nothing remains but a little
 charcoal in the form of a black powder. This solution, when
  recently made is of a dark amber colour, and disengages only
 a very little sulphurated hydrogen by the addition of an acid ;
  but at the end os some time, and particularly when evapo
  rated, there is formed a great deal of sulphurated       hydrogen
  and carbonic acid.      The latter is so abundant that the alkali
  crystallizes very easily. This phænomenon takes place in par
  ticular with soda. The rest of the solution is hydrogenated
  fulpburet, which precipitates solutions of lead of a beautiful
 Ted colour.     This precipitate, which becomes browner in the
<                                                                  air.

 lir, is  a hydrosulphurated oxide of lead.       Carburated sulphur
unites also with ammonia, but the alkali does not become
 cry stall izable: the whole is volatilized by heat.
    The nitric, muriatic, and sulphuric acids do not attack
 carburated sulphur cold. When warm, the nitric acid bums
 a part of it.
    Liquid sulphurous acid does not attack it sensibly.          The
 case is the fame with the gaseous.        Carburated sulphur is vo
latilized in it as in the other gases, and there is no precipi
tation of sulphur ; which would not fail to be the case if there
were sulphurated hydrogen.
    Liquid oxygenated muriatic acid burns it slowly, and it
appears that it attacks the charcoal rather than the sulphur,
 for the latter becomes solid.          This will probably afford the
 means of analysing that substance when it becomes necessary
to ascertain exactly its constituent principles.
    Carburated sulphur dissolves very well in olive oil, but
better when hot than when cold : it deposits a little char
coal, and crystallizes regularly and very soon by cooling.
    Alcohol makes it pals almost instantaneously to the soft
state.
    A  portion of that which is dissolved is precipitated by the
¦water, and    still retains charcoal.
    Ether mixed with carburated sulphur makes it crystallize
regularly and immediately another part is dissolved.          A crys
tallization better determined is obtained almost as speedily by
the action of a warm solution of potash placed in an open
vessel, where the too elastic carburated sulphur has an oppor
tunity of escaping.        The crystals, the moleculæ of which we
might almost fay we saw arranged, are elongated octaedra,
pretty large, very regular and complete, because they are
formed in the middle of the liquor.
    It might have been believed that the charcoal united itself
to the phosphorus and gave birth to a new compound ; but
here, as in many other circumstances, analogy is in fault,
and we were not able to obtain, by similar means, this com
bination.
    This account of our experiments is already too long, if its
direct utility be considered.      It is very probable that when we
found this carburated sulphur, had we not supposed it to pos
sess some useful principles, we should have paid less attention
to it.      But, since, we were not so fortunate as to find any
other effects produced by it than that of occasioning a consi
derable degree of headach, and disposing us to sleep, by in
fecting the air which we inspired. The labour, however, is
                6                                               done,

sulphur presents nothing very interesting *•  It    however,            is,
possible that in abler hands this substance may be the mean
of leading to new discoveries.
                        CONCLUSIONS.
  1st,  The nature of the gas has no influence on the evapo
ration of the liquids   that
                           ;   to fay, the respective quantities
                                         is
of ether, alcohol, carburated sulphur, and very probably wa
ter, evaporate equally in equal volumes of oxygen gas,                             hy
drogen, azote, carbonic acid, and atmospheric air, when the
temperature, pressure, and other circumstances are similar.
   ad, Charcoal of whatever kind          "may be gives no water

therefore contains no hydrogen, and          there be oxygen

                          it

   3d, Sulphur and charcoal can combine at high tempera         a
ture.   The result       is,
                        1st,   transparent and highly volatile

tions no trace of hydrogen can be observed.
   4th, The gaseous oxide of carbon, obtained         dried char    by
coal and carbonic acid, or other analogous means, does not
contain hydrogen.              Itsimple combination inflammable
                                    is   a
per fe.
   The Journal de Pbyjique et de Cbimie, published        C. Van              by
Mons for the month of Pluviose last, contains memoir, by            a
the Dutch chemists, on the supposed gaseous oxide of carbon.
  It  contains experiments which to us do not seem conclu
sive.   These chemists did not even observe the presence of
oxygen in that gas.      Had they dosed the quantities on which
they operated, they would have seen that the carbonic acid
in passing on the charcoal almost entirely disappears, and
shows itself again under an inflammable form.              formed             It
part then of this new gas, which then became mere carbo
nated hydrogen       :   itvery probable that what they obtained
                               is
was united with hydrogen only, because the charcoal had
not been sufficiently heated and well protected from the action
of humidity.
   Of this we have proof   a   the experiment in which these
                                             in
chemists,     making azote pass upon the charcoal instead of
              by
carbonic acid, rendered   inflammable.
                                    it    We long ago made
this experiment with charcoal well burnt, and the azote ac

   The same chemists, to prove their assertion, state, that
copper does not decompose the carbonic acid, as iron does in
the experiment of Cruickstiank.    But it may be said in an
swer, that as the former metal does not decompose the water,
it may not have the property of decomposing carbonic acid.
   In a word, the combination of inflammable gas with sul
phur, obtained by the Dutch chemists, and which they took
to be sulphurated hydrogen, was only a mixture of that gas
with the gaseous oxide of carbon a little sulphurated, of which
we have already spoken.
   Carburated sulphur is not a discovery entirely new : since
our labour we have learned that it had been announced in

                      Sinclair,       Bart.
                           Introduction.
         HE means of preserving health, and of attaining great
age.  are  subjects which seem to be well entitled to the pecu
liar attention of every thinking man. In regard to the for
mer, there is no question : the pleasure that arises from the
possession of health, and the distress which sickness occasions,
are perpetual mementos that health cannot be neglected.
But as to the latter, the propriety of aspiring to long life has
been doubted ; and it is said, after a person has lived for
50 or 60 years, and has fulfilled his duties as a man, that he
had better retire to make way for others, and that the sooner
he quits these sublunary scenes the better.     Such sentiments,
however, ought not to be indulged.         If
                                            persons lived only for
themselves, and for the gratification of their own passion?,
and to promote their own interests alone, this might be the
cafe.   But if we live, as we ought to do, to promote the hap
piness of others as well as our own, and if by living long
we can be of more service, from the knowledge which greater
experience    and longer observation must necessarily furnish,
the result    is,
                that we ought to live as long as we have health
and strength to perform good actions to others, and that the
power of doing good ought to be the proper limit            by
                                                            which
our wishes for existence ought to be bounded nor ought
                                                   :                it
to be omitted, that there   isan evident and necessary connec-.
tion between good health and longevity, as        it   is
                                                        impossible
to possess the one without its contributing to the enjoyment of
the other.
   In sketching out some observations on this important sub-
                                                                 ject,

                         An Ejsay    on   Longevity,                               1

jcct, it is my intention to state, 1. The circumstances which
 tend to promote longevity,      a. The rules which have been
 adopted by   those who  have  attained great age. 3. The pe
culiar description of countries most remarkable for long life.
And, 4. To add some tables of longevity and the duration
of human life.
            I.   Circumstances   tending   to promote    Longevity.
   The circumstances tending   to promote longevity may be
considered under the following general heads: — 1. Climate,
a. Form of the individual.   3. Parentage.  4. Natural dis
position. 5. Situation in life.         6. Professions.      7. Exercise
or labour.     8. Connubial connections.          9.  Sex.     And, 10.
Renewal of age.
    1. Climate. — In the first place, climate seems to be of con
siderable importance; and it may be laid down as a general
rule, that the moderate, or even the coldest climates, are the
most favourable to long life.          Heat seems to relax and en
feeble, cold to strengthen and brace, the human frame. The
diet also of hot countries is not so nourishing as that of cold *;
and there is in general a greater disposition and greater op
portunities to indulge in various excesses in the former than
in the latter.     But if the climate be cool, a rainy atmosphere
seems to be less unfavourable to longevity than could well be
imagined; for Ireland, which is a wet country, boasts of a
great number of old people.            And a very large proportion
of the aged who have lived in England and Scotland, have
resided in the western, and, consequently, the rainiest counties
in the islands.
   a. Form. —The next circumstance to be considered                   the    is,
form and size of the individual.              It
                                              generally
                                                   is    admitted    that
persons of       compact sliape, and of
                 a                             moderate stature, are
                                                    a
the most likely to live long.          Height often originates from
the disproportioned growth of some particular part of the
body, which necessarily has          tendency to engender weakness
                                     a
and disease.     Tall persons also are apt to acquire habit of         a
stooping, which contracts the chest, and               great enemy to
                                                        is   a
free respiration     ;whereas the short-sized      find little difficulty
in keeping themselves erect, and are naturally much more
   * In coll countries they live more
                                      upon animal, in hot countries upon
vegetable, food, and fruits.     A judicious mixture of both the best plan
                                                                  is
to pursue   ;  but, of the two, animal food   isthe molt nourishing.
f       Moillure.  it would appear, is not prejudicial to health,       dees net
                                                                       if
                                                                        it
affect the purity of the air.    Even stagnated water,  if   inprat bogs or mc-
raisus,is   not unwholesome,    as the water,      by
                                                   the astringency of the peat,
n prevented from becoming putrid.         Lincolnshire also, and several of the
marshy counties of England, can produce        3  number of instances of great
age, but p'obably they were from the more elevated parts of these districts.

 active, by which the animal functions are retained in a state
 of much greater perfection. The only disadvantage attending
 a short stature   is,that    it
                              isfrequently accompanied with cor
 pulence, which     is rather unfavourable to long life.
    3. Parentage. — Being born of healthy parents, and ex
empted from hereditary disease, are circumstances evidently
favourable to longevity. A puny frame, like Cornaro's, may,
 by the greatest care and anxiety, be preserved in existence          ;
 but those who inherit health and strength, and are born with
 robust constitutions, can alone expect not only to live long,
but to enjoy the pleasures and comforts of life, whilst they
 continue to possess it.
    4. Natural disposition.
                              — Longevity also seems to depend
 much upon gooa temper, mixed at the fame time with a
 cheerfulness of disposition or good spirits *.            Neither the
irascible,   nor  those  who,   from   despondency,     fink  under the
crosses of life, can expect to live long. Even those who suffer
their strength and spirits to be exhausted            by
                                                       severe study, or
other mental exertions, seldom reach great age.             In the long
list of 171a persons who lived about             century, Fontenelle
        did  not  quite  reach   100  years,) is athe only author of
 (who
any   note    and
               ;   his great age    isascribed to   the tranquil ease
of his temper, and that liveliness of spirits for which he was
much distinguiflied      ;for he retained to the last the youth       of
eld age, as the French happily express it.
     5.Situation in life. —   It   iscommonly observed, " that        it
is  not the rich and great, not those who depend on medi
cines, who become old, but such as use much exercise, are
exposed to the fresh air, and whose food             plain and mode
                                                     is
rate f."    And    it     certain that persons of that description,
                         is
in general, stand the best chance of living long.                At the
same time, though instances of old age in great and noble
personages arc not often to be met with, yet they may be as
many, in proportion to the smaller number of such persons, as
those in the lower but more numerous classes of society. Nor
is  there any thing inconsistent in power, rank, or wealth,
being accompanied with        a long period of existence, provided
other circumstances are favourable to longevity.
    6. Professions. — In the next place,     it is evident that long
life must depend much on the manner in which the indivi
dual     employed. Unhealthy occupations generally become
          is
fatal. Yet Peter Prin,        glass-blower,     said to have attained
                                              a is

    Hence the great    age to which many of the French nobility
particularly before the regency of Orleans.

                                                                     m

  in Scotland,       is supposed to have reached even 132 years*.
  His    age, indeed, could not be proved by direct, but it rests on
  very strong circumstantial, evidence; and a person of the most
  undoubted authority (Dr. Walker, professor of natural history
  in the university of Edinburgh,) informs me, " that in his
 muscles, joints, and in his whole conformation and aspect,
 he wore the appearance of more remote antiquity than he
 had ever seen in any human creature."                  But on the whole,
 farmers, gardeners, and labourers in the country, are in ge
 neral the longest lived. Foot soldiers also, who have survived
 the dangers of war, are remarkable for long life.                 They are
 generally stout and vigorous men, and the regularity to which
 surviving soldiers must have accustomed themselves, whilst
 the careless and disorderly drop off, the erect posture to which
 they have been trained, and being of course men well formed
 by nature, and habituated to march and walk well, (which
 familiarizes them to a natural and healthy exercise,) all com
 bine in their favour.
      7. Exercise or labour. — It is also proper to remark, that
 not only moderate exercise, but even labour, if not too se
 vere, contributes to good health and old age.                  In many in
 stances, persons have worked at threshing, and other labo
 rious occupations, exposed to a current of tresli air, after they
 had passed beyond the age of 100; and, if accustomed to them,
 they do not appear to have suffered any inconvenience from
 such exertions.
      8. Connubial connections. —Nor ought it to be omitted, that
 a large proportion of the long-lived Thave
                                                        preferred a married
 to a single state, and in general have left behind them a nu
 merous family. Whether a life of celibacy occasions disease,
 or leads to irregularity, or sours the temper, or to whatever
 other cause it ought to be attributed, may be a subject of dis-
  Dute, but it is certain that the number of single persons who
I  ive long bear no proportion to the married f.
      9. Sex.
                — Further, though a greater number of males arc
 born than of females, at least in European countries, yet
 there is reason to believe that of the two lexes, women reach
old age in the greatest proportion.                  For this various causes
may be assigned, as the greater regularity and temperance of
their mode of living, their being less exposed to dangers and
     • It is said that          of these instances ought much to be wondered
                       neither
at, as a glass-blower    is constantly exposed  to frclh and dry air, and the
labour of    miners under ground is not for many hours, and they generally
reside in hilly districts.
     t This applies to both sexes, in particular to the m?.le. Dr. Rusti, of
Philadelphia, asseits, that he never saw but one unmarried man exceed
fourscore years.
                                       M  3                       hardships,

l68                      An EJsay   on  Longevity.
hardships, less subject to violent agitations, and generally en
dowed with more cheerfulness and gentleness of disposition.
      IO. Renewal ofyouth. — In the last place, among the sym
ptoms of longevity, none is more striking than when nature
seems to renew itself, by producing, even in old age, new teeth,
new hair, &c. ; but the instances of this are extremely rare.
               II.  Rules tending   to promote long Life.
      We    shall now proceed to state such rules as have been fol
 lowed by those who have attained great age, as they may
 furnish some hints that may be serviceable to others.
       The plan laid down by the celebrated Cornaro is well
 known, and the abstemious manner in which he lived has
 often been recommended to the imitation of others; but I
 question much whether many would wisli to lead the fame
 life for the fake of mere existence.         Life is no longer desira
 ble than whilst it can be enjoyed with some degree of satis
 faction,     and it is of little consequence, isa person merely ve
  getates, whether he lives or not.
       Without entering therefore into various particulars, fitter
  for the discussions of experimental philosophy than for real
  life, (as weighing the food taken, &c. &c.) we shall proceed
  to mention the rules which have been found the most effec
  tual, and which are the most likely to be carried into prac
  tice. They may be classed under the following heads : —
  I.    Food.    2. Clothing.     3. Habitation.     4. Labour or ex
  ercise.     5.  Habits  or  customs.    6. Medicine.    And, 7. Dis
  position of mind.
        1. Diet. — The importance of wholesome food for the pre
   servation of health and long life, and the avoiding of excess,
   whether in eating or drinking, need not be dwelt upon.
   Some instances, indeed, are mentioned of persons who have
   continued to commit excesses and have lived long; but these
   are to be considered in no other light than as exceptions from
   a general rule; and it may reasonably be contended, that if
   such persons lived to a great age notwithstanding their intern^
                they would have lived much longer had they sol-
   fierance,
     owed a different course.
        2. C/otti/ig. — It is equally unnecessary to detail at anv
   length the necestity of warm clothing, more especially in
    advanced life, and during the coid seasons, as the best mode of
                    number of diseases to which old men areparticu-
    fireventinga
      arly exposed, and which by no other means can be avoided.
        3. Habitation.
                        — The health of every individual must greatly
    depend on the place where he resides, and the nature of the
    house which he inhabits; and as it has frequently been re
    marked that the greatest number of old people die in winter,
                                                                     and

 and that many individuals, in a weak and consumptive state,
 are obliged to    to warmer climates as the only means of
                           fly
 safety,   has thence occurred to Dr. Pearson that
            it                                       would                   it
 be   of
       service both to the aged and to the consumptive to have
 houses  erected of such     peculiar construction that the air
                                           a
 could always be preserved, not only pure, but nearly of the
 same, and     of rather an elevated temperature,       that the in     so
  valids who resided in them should never be affected             the             by
  vicissitudes of the seasons.   Such an idea,      must be admit
                                                               it
 ted, cannot be        general remedy or resource
                           a                           but       well
                                                                    ;        it   is
 entitled to the attention of those who are                    in
                                                   affluent circum
 stances,        by
                some of whom,         to be hoped, an hospital for
                                               it   is
 the aged and the consumptive will be erected, and the expe
 riment fairly tried, both for their own fakes and for that of
 human nature in general.
     4. Exercise and labour. —That either exercise or moderate
 labour     isnecessary even to aged persons, for the purpose of
 preserving the human frame in order, can hardly be ques
 tioned, provided any great exertion          avoided, than which
                                                         is
 nothing     ismore likely to destroy the springs of life, particu
 larly when these become feeble.         Travelling in moderation
 also, from the change of air and scene, has been found of
 great use.
      5.   Habits and                      — In
                                the next place, good health,
                                customs.
and consequently longevity, depends much on personal clean
liness, and  variety of habits and customs, or minute atten
                  a
tions, which      impossible here to discuss.
                      it   is                    were much          It
to be wished that some author would undertake the trouble
 of collecting the result of general experience upon that sub
ject, and would point out those habits which, taken singly,
appear very trifling, yet when combined there every reason          is
to believe that much additional health and comfort would
arise from their observance.
   6. Medicine.        —   common faying, that every man,
                            It     is
                                   a
after the age of forty, should be his own physician.      This
seems, however, to be       dangerous maxim.
                                       a         The greatest
physicians, when they are sick, seldom venture to prescribe
for themselves, but generally rely on the advice of their me
dical friends.   Persons who pretend to be their own physi
 cians are generally much addicted to quackery, than which
nothing can be more injurious to the constitution.              es           It   is
sential to health that medicines should never be taken but
when necessary, and never without the best advice, in regard to
the commencement, which ought not to be too long delaye                                1,

also with respect to nature or sort, quantity, and continuance.

      At  present, the powers of physic, it is generally acknow
 ledged,      are extremely bounded.           The medical art, however,
is probably still in its infancy, and it is impossible yet to fay
 to what perfection it may reach, not only in consequence of
 the new improvements which chemistry daily furnishes, but
 also of those which may be made by the discovery of new
 and valuable plants in countries either already known or hi
 therto unexplored, and indeed the new uses to which old me
  dicinal plains may be applied.              Perhaps such discoveries will
 be much accelerated, when, instead of being left to the zeal
  and industry of individuals, they shall meet with that public
  encouragement and protection to which they are so pecu
 liarly well entitled.
      7. Dispojition of mind.
                                   — In the last place, nothing is more
  conducive to longevity than to preserve equanimity and good
  spirits, and not to fink under the disappointments of life, to
  which all, but particularly the old, are necessarily subjected.
  Indeed this is a point which cannot be too much inculcated }
  for experience sufficiently demonstrates that many perish from
  despondency, who, if they had preserved their spirit and vi
  gour of mind, might have survived many years longer.
                III.   Countries remarkable        for Longevity.
      The countries the most remarkable for long life are those
  of   a hilly nature.       We are informed by Pallas that the in
  habitants of the mountainous districts of the province of
  Isesk, in the northern parts of Siberia, live to a great age ;
  that people of 100 years are very common, and that he saw
  an invalid soldier aged 120.             The inhabitants of the plains
  in their neighbourhood are, at the fame time, by no means
  so healthy or so long lived.            Buffon places the mountainous
   districts of Scotland at the head of a list containing those
   parts of Europe the most distinguished for longevity ; and,
   indeed, there is no country in Europe where, in proportion
   to its population, a greater number of individuals reach to
   60, and thence to 80, and even 90 years of age, in full pos
   session of all their faculties, both personal and mental, than
   is the cafe in that part of Great Britain *• There is also
                                                                            every

longevity whenever any particular inquiry is made regarding
that interesting circumstance.

    Having thus discussed the subject of longevity in general,
it may not be improper to lay before the reader the following
table, explaining the shortness of human life, and pointing
out how few there are, in proportion to the number born,
 who reach even the period of 60 years *.
     Of a hundred men who are born, there die, according to
 Hufeland,

     Such is the substance of the observations which have oc
 curred to me on this interesting subject.               I shall conclude
 with remarking, that on the whole it is more than probable,
 by proper attention and good management, persons in gene
 ral might not only live longer, but might enjoy life with more
 relish, than is commonly the cafe at present ; and it is to be
hoped, in respect of this, as well as of many other particu
lars, that human nature is still in the threshold of acquire
ment, that it will yet obtain greater and more important ac
quisitions of knowledge, and may reach further improvement
both with regard to the extent of personal and mental grati
fications, which our species may be found capable of enjoy
ing, and also the means of possessing them, with more satis
faction and comfort, and for a much longer period of time.

  JL HERE are two kinds of tubes,              the great and the small.
    Art. I. Of the large tubes. — The          large tubes during the
first period  of their formation are not, as might be supposed,

and  they exist only because there is a lacuna in the mem
branes.   Such is the extreme simplicity of the organization
of vegetables, that all the difference observed in them is
merely confined to some modifications in 'he cellular tissue.
But the sides of these large tubes, being continually moistened
by the fluids imbibed by the plant, gradually assume more
consistence, and separate from the rest of the tissue when their
solidity surpasses that of the surrounding membranes. I could
never observe large tubes in mushrooms, lichens, and fuci,
even when I employed a microscope; but it is sufficient to
have good fight to be able to distinguish the aperture of these
canals on the transversal section of the stems, the branches,
and roots, of several monocotyledons and dicotyledons.         In
the former, they are always sound in the centre of the lig
neous filaments, and sometimes they compose the major part;
in the second they are distributed often, as it were, at ran
dom in the wood ; sometimes also they form groups placed
very regularly at certain distances, or they are ranged in con
 centric zones. They are exceedingly numerous, in particu
lar around the medullary canal. They are found also in the
 bark.    If their progress be followed they will be seen to have
 their origin in the root, to enter the trunk, and to rise pa
 rallel to each other : then to unite, to separate and deviate
 from their vertical direction, to penetrate the bud which is
 formed at the surface of the bark j to lengthen with         and             it,
 to distribute themselves throughout all its ramifications, to
 pass from the branch into the ligneous filaments the bundle
 of which composes the petiole, and to divide themselves
among the large fibres of the leaves as the arteries and veins
distribute themselves          in
                         the human body. They may be ob
served also in the fibres of the perianthes, the filaments ot
some stamina, the pistils, and the ligneous filaments which
traverse the pulp of fruits.   Scarcely    the embryo formed
                                                       is
when these tubes are observed.    In this infancy of the vege
table they are not concealed                   by
                                    the wood, which does not
 yet exist   :   the substance      destined
                                      to produce          then   ita  is            in
 state,   of fluidity, which permits the observer to examine the
 parts which       covers.

                                    It   is

                                                     :
 tubes, false trachcæ, and trachea:. These are modifications
 of the fame organ.

 1^4               On the Anatomy of Vegetables.
     1st, Simple tubes. — The sides of these tubes are perfectly
 whole, neither pores nor fissures are observed in them : they
 generally contain resinous or oily juices, known under the
 denomination of proper juices.       These tubes are very re
 markable in green trees, in euphorbia, periploca, and, in ge
 neral, in all plants the juices of which are thick.    They are
more numerous and more visible in the bark than in any
 other part.
    sd, Porous tubes. — The sides of these tubes are perforated
 with small pores similar to those mentioned in the article on
 the cellular tissue, with this difference, that they are much
 more numerous, and that, instead of being disseminated by
 chance, and without order, as is often the cafe, in the cells,
 they are distributed in regular and parallel series around the
 tubes. These tubes do not appear to be so peculiarly destined
as the preceding to contain resinous or oily juices.    They are
very numerous in hard wood, such as the oak.
    3d, The false trachea. — These tubes are intersected in a
transversal direction with parallel slits, which from their ap
pearance might induce us to believe that they are formed of
rings placed one above the other, or of filaments twisted in a
spiral form; but they cannot be unrolled, or separated into
distinct rings ; and besides, with a little attention, one may
discover the continuity of the membrane, and consequently
the place where the slits end. These, then, are porous tubes,
but their pores are much larger than those of the preceding.
I  must even observe, that the edge of the slits is furnished
with a roll similar to that which surrounds the small pores.
These tubes are destined for the fame purposes as the porous
tubes; but in general they are found in those kinds of wood
which are less hard and compact, and even in herbaceousplants:
I  have observed them in a great number of the monocotyle
dons. The centre of the lycopodia presents a thick cylinder
composed, in a great measure, of vessels of this nature. Ferns
contain also a great many in their ligneous filaments. Dico
tyledons are likewise provided with them.       They are exceed
ingly numerous in the viue, the wood of which is soft and
porous.
    4th, The trachea. — Want of experience has assigned to
these tubes, which have not been sufficiently observed, a de
nomination consecrated by custom.        The tracheae of plants
have a resemblance in their form to the tracheae of insects,
and it has thence been concluded, on too slight grounds, that
these tracheae in the former as well as in the latter must be
the organs of respiration. The vegetable trachea is a tube
formed of a filament twilled into a spiral form from right to
                                                            left.

                   On the Anatomy of Vegetables.                 1 75
left.    This filament is opake, brilliant, argenteous, and thick.
Its   transversal section presented to me sometimes a flat plate
or an ellipsis, and sometimes even two filaments united by
an intermediate membrane; but           I never could observe the
aperture of a tube, as several authors have asserted. The
surface is sometimes      smooth, sometimes unequal, and some
times porous.       The spirals of the tracheae are often so close,
that when their arrangement is not disturbed, on breaking or
cutting, without precaution, the parts which conceal them,
they appear to be continued tubes slightly striated. Malphigi
and Reichel say that choked parts have been remarked in
the length of the tracheæ; and at first I believed that I ob
 served the same, but I have since found that this was merely
an optical illusion.      These tubes exist in great numbers ia
the herbaceous monocotyledons and dicotyledons, but espe
cially in the aquatic kinds, the tissue of which is weaker :
they occupy the centre of the ligneous filaments in the mo
nocotyledons ; in trees with two cotyledons they are seen
around the pith : in these they are often mixed, and con
founded with the false tracheæ.         I never saw them in the
hard parts of vegetables, unless these parts had long been in
 a state of softness, which permitted the tracheæ to expand :
this is what takes place in branches and twigs from which
 the pith has disappeared.        These tubes have formed them
 selves when the medullary substance existed.           The tracheae
 are not found in the length of the bark ; they penetrate into
 the petioles and leaves in the fame manner as the false tra
 cheæ ; they every where act the same part as the latter, and
 do not contain thick juices but in plants where they are very
 abundant, some as of the lily kind.       It is well known that, to
 fee these organs with the naked eye, it is necessary to take a
young, green, and soft branch, to twist and break it without
 violence, that the tracheæ may be unrolled without rupture :
 if the two parts of the branch which have been divided be
 then opposed to the light, one can distinguish the half-un
 rolled filaments which proceed from the one part to the other,
 and the spirals arc close or at a distance, according as the parts
 are brought near to, or removed from, each other.              They
 unroll themselves or contract in the fame manner in leaves
 which have been torn.        The leaves, however, of the butomus
 vmbellatus exhibit a contrary phænomenon;              the tracheæ,
 which in this plant are exceedingly numerous, when once
 unrolled no longer contract themselves.
     Let us now return to the large tubes in general. The di
  vision into simple tubes, porous tubes, false tracheæ, and
                                                            trachea?,

tend to assign immutable laws of nature;      have had occasion     I
to observe that     often deviates from them. Thus the bu-
                          it
tomus umbcllatus exhibits in the fame tube the pores of the
porous tubes, the flits of the false tracheæ, and the spirals
of the true tracheæ       that one' tube comprehends three of
                               ;     so
the modifications      have described.
                           I              These tubes   call the              I
mixt.     Other vegetables exhibit something analogous or in
similar situations, there are found in them one of the four
varieties of the large tubes.    It not uncommon to fee all
                                                          is

their spirals are torn.   Let us conclude then that these dif
ferences, which on the first view appear of     much import              so
ance, are only flight (hades in the vegetable economy.      But
the large tubes, considered in     more general manner, pre

which    compose the cellular tissue; but in the cellular tissue

 especially  at the time of the sap, it abounds with an aqueous
 fluid.
    The embryo, still inclosed in its teguments, has few or no
small tubes : all its parts are soft or almost mucilaginous.
This tissue is never found but in the expanded plant. It is
observed in the centre or at the circumference of the rami
fications of certain ramified lichens, and in the stems of moss :
in monocotyledons, this tissue distributed around the large
tubes forms the ligneous filaments ; in dicotyledons, placed
around the pith, and the large surrounding tubes, it forms
the ligneous strata. The small and large tubes are generally
united: the existence of the former depends on the presence
of the latter. The bond which connects them is nothing
 else than that which unites the effect to the cause.         Large
tubes, however, are sometimes found without the small, and
the small without the large; but it is to be recollected that
the latter are the creative organ, and consequently their exist
ence is independent of that of the others. So much for the
first cafe.   And it must be considered that there is an epoch
for many vegetables at which the large tubes are filled up
with the tissue to which they gave birth. So much for the
 second case.
    The prominent parts of the grooves and striae which cover
the surface of the vegetables are bundles of small tubes. This
tissue is observed also in the most delicate ribs of the leaves
and petals : it penetrates the stamina and pistils, and reaches
to the extremity of the stigmata ; but in these delicate organs
it loses its rigidity, and is nothing but cellular tissue very
much elongated.

                             Of Lacuna.
    Nature,    which   effects  expansion  without   violence,  and
which conducts organized beings,          by insensible gradations,
from non-existence to life, and from life to death, seems here
to deviate from her usual progress : stie destroys to create, and
from the annihilation of organs gives birth to a new organic
system.     Lacunae are regular and symmetric vacuities formed
in the interior of vegetables by the laceration of their mem
branes.
    Lacunae, in general, exist only in plants, the tissue of which
is soft. They are very numerous in most of the aquatic herbs.
They are, however, found sometimes in vigorous trees the
wood of which is very hard ; but in all cafes they are formed
Only by the destruction of the cellular tissue, which is the

weakest part of the membranous tissue.           If lacunae occur
more frequently in the monocotyledons, it is because these
vegetables in general have less vigour, and an organization
left perfect; or, if I may venture to fay, less vegetative power.
A phænomenon which deserves the attention of physiologists
is, that these lacerations instead of hurting the vegetable
serve only to increase its strength by concentrating it more.
Plants the texture of which is flaccid, and those in particular
immersed in water, receive juices in abundance; but they
cannot assimilate them, because the organs are not sufficiently
vigorous in proportion to the volume of these plants, which
have more size than real strength. But if by internal rup
ture the organs which have become useless are destroyed and
the useful organs are retained ; in a word, if one part of the
organization is sacrificed to the other, the part which main
tains itself receiving the whole nutritive substance will acquire
more strength, and the vegetable may still grow with new
vigour; for its strength will not be diminished, and its im
pediments will be less.
   No lacunae are observed in the embryo, because its lacera
tions are a real disorganization, which cannot take place in
beings that begin to live. They are formed therefore only
in the course of time. They show themselves in the petioles
of fern, in the stems of the potamogetons, and in a multitude
of other vegetables like longitudinal tubes interspersed through.
out the cellular tissue. In the equiseta they affect a disposi
tion exceedingly regular ; one greater than the rest forms a
tube in the centre of the stem ; around this tube there are
other very small lacunae arranged circularly, and some larger
and closer to the circumference are disposed in alternate order
with them. The lacunae of the leaves of the monocotyledons
are intersected by frequent partitions, which are only the cel
lular tissue collected at certain distances, and which closes the
tubes by membranous diaphragms.             This organization, or
rather disorganization, appears through the transparent tissue
of the typba, and a multitude of other monocotyledons with
sword-formed leaves.      The fame phænomenon may be ob
served in the tissue of the sheaths of which the stem of the
banana-tree is composed.
   The rejl'to has longitudinal lacunae, and also transversal
apertures in the thickness of the bark : it does not appear
that the latter kind of lacuna occurs often in vegetables.
   One might suspect that the large tubes of plants always
begin by being lacunae, and that the internal vacuities,
where a new tissue, which increases both the volume and
tiensity of the vegetable, is developed, are only lacunae also.

                          Of    the Glands.
    Whether plants have glands analogous to those of animals;
that is to fay, organs proper for giving to the fluids the qua
lities necessary for the development and preservation of the
being by making them undergo new combinations, and by
separating from them the useless or prejudicial qualities, is a
question not easy to be determined. In so delicate a subject,
facts and reasoning are equally obscure : however, it appears
to me beyond a doubt that we do not catch with our best
microscopes but the coarse part of the vegetable organization.
I  cannot conceive that the transfusion of the fluids of one cell
into another is sufficient to modify these fluids so far as to
change them into organized matter, and to render them sus
ceptible of giving a new increase and new vigour to the plant.
I  cannot conceive either that the common Taws of chemistry
could alone effect this phænomenon, because, in either hypo
thesis, nothing could prevent labour or chance from unveiling
to man the secret of nature : but this consequence is repug
nant to reason.     It appears, then, to me more judicious to
admit secretory organs in which the fluids are assimilated.    It
must, indeed, be supposed that the membranes are not im
penetrable to the fluids, since they dilate, unfold themselves,
and change their nature; but they must necessarily modify
the fluids, since the latter, by penetrating them," become ca
pable of increasing the membranous tissue in all its dimen
sions : it is in the membranes, then, that we must search for
the vegetable glands.  It might be supposed, with some ap
pearance of truth, that the opake and irregular rolls with
which the pores and apertures of the large tubes are bordered
are glandulous bodies.   The filaments of the tracheae, the
thickness of which greatly surpasses that of the membranes,
seem also to discharge the same functions ; and what gives to
these probabilities more weight        is,
                                   the consideration that the
mucilage, which     istransformed into organized tissue,     is   al
ways accumulated around the small and large tubes, which
are all covered with these opake bodies.

bits the perfect resemblance of the bill of a duck engrafted
on the head of a quadruped. So ltrong, indeed, is the simi
litude, that, when the stuffed animal was first brought to Eu
rope, some naturalists were inclined to suspect that the bill
was a deceptive preparation produced by artificial means;
and it was not without the moll rigid observation that they
could persuade themselves that the beak or snout of the qua
druped was real.
    The length of the whole animal from the tip of the beak
to that of the tail is 18 inches; that of the beak is 1] inch.
The body    is depressed, and has some resemblance to that of
an otter.    It is covered with very thick soft fur, of a mode
rately dark  brown  colour above, and of a somewhat ferruginous
white beneath : the head is slattifli, and rather small than
large : the mouth or snout, as already mentioned, has so
striking a resemblance to that of some broad-billed species of
cluck, that it might be mistaken for such : round the base of
it there is a flat circular membrane rather wider, below than
above, that below being nearly the fifth of an inch, and that
above an eighth.       The tail is flat, and covered with fur like
the body; it is rather fliort and obtuse, and has an almost;
bifid termination : it is broader at the base, and gradually
decreases to the tip: it is about 4^ inches in length, and its co
lour is similar to that of the body. The legs, which are fliort,
terminate in a broad web, which in the sore-feet extends to
a considerable distance beyond the claws, but in the hind-feet
it reaches no further than the roots of the claws.      The fore
feet have five straight, strong, and sharp-pointed claws; the
two exterior ones somewhat shorter than the middle ones.
The hind-feet have six claws, which are longer and more in
clining to a curved form than those of the fore-feet : the ex
terior toe and claw are considerably shorter than the four
middle ones: the interior or sixth is placed much higher
up than the rest, and resembles a strong {harp spur.          The
legs are all hairy above; the fore-sect are naked both above
and below. The internal edges of the under mandible, which
is narrower than the upper, are lerratcd with numerous (iriæ,
as in a duck's bill.      The nostrils are small and round : they
are situated about a quarter of an inch from the tip of the
bill, and are about the eighth of an inch distant from each
other. The ears are placed about       i'f  inch beyond the eyes;
they appear like  a   pair of oval holes the eighth of an inch in
diameter, without any external ear.           On the upper part of
the head    a little beyond the beak there     is   on each side
                                                               a

XXXII.      Extras} from the Resort made       to the French Board
    of Longitude   by C.  Lagrange, Laplace, Mechain,
   and   Delambke,        on the  Lunar Tables sent    to the Board
    to compete for  the Prize   proposed on that Subject.
T.HE        public will recollect with what interest the National
Institute received, two years ago, the memoirs of the astro
nomers Burg and Bouvart respecting some of the elements of
the lunar tables. Struck with the importance and immensity
of their labour, the class of the mathematical and physical
sciences, the president of which at that time was of all its
members the one who could best ensure the eclat and success
of its deliberations, decreed that the prize to be offered should
be doubled.      By doing much more than was required of
them, the competitors gave birth t0 a question far more diffi
cult than that which they had solved.         The same mean mo
tion was not capable of satisfying the epochs which they had
established for the commencement, the end, and the middle
of the 18th century.
   This irregularity, so alarming for the future precision of
the tables, could not be explained but by supposing, either
that the inequalities already comprehended in the tables were
not sufficiently well known, or that there were still wanting
some equations which had hitherto escaped the researches of
all geometricians.
   The terrible labour which these new considerations required
did not permit us to hope for so speedy a solution as was ne
cessary to the wants of astronomy and navigation.             It was
requisite that an appeal should be made to all astronomers, in
the hope that some of them might have collected a series of
the necessary materials. The board of longitude applied with
confidence to a government composed in such a manner as to
be sensible, much better than any other that ever existed, of the
value of the sciences aud of the utility of their application.
With its consent, the ministers of the interior and marine
contributed in equal portions towards an extraordinary prize
of 6000 francs (240I. sterling), which they hastened to pro
pose to the emulation of the astronomers of all countries.
Twenty months after this prize was announced, the board of
longitude received the new tables of which we are going to
give an account.
   To verify the tables constructed from the whole mass of
the good observations publistied till that period, it was ne
cessary to have other observations,        equally good, but more
recent.    Chqice was made of 150, both from the registers of
                                 N   3                           the.

1 84           ' French Report   on (be Lunar Tables.
the national observatory of Paris, from the last publications
of the astronomer royal in England, and from the correspond
ence of the director of the observatory of Gotha.             It is suf
ficient   to sav, that  it was  impossible  to  find  any deserving of
inore   confidence,    either on  account  of  the   excellence  of the
instruments with which they were made, or the known merit
of the observers.
     We shall describe in a few words the difficulties which the
author of the tables had to surmount, and the precision to
which he has attained.
     By thousands of comparisons he has proved, in the first
place, that the periodical inequalities before determined were
susceptible only of very small amelioration.            He introduced
 some equations imperfectly indicated, and afterwards neg
 lected, by Mayer and Mason ; and some others much more
important, indicated in the last volumes of the Connoiffance
 des Terns by C. Laplace: they rendered the tables much
 better, but did not correct the inequality of the mean motion.
     It remained to try equations of a long period. As theory
 had not furnistied any, the author endeavoured to determine
 empirically the law of the anomalies observed : he lost him
 self in an inextricable labyrinth ; but, at the time when, fa
 tigued with so many vain efforts, he had renounced all hope,
 he learned that Laplace had discovered the form and argu
 ments of two new equations, the determination of which he
  deferred till he could obtain a more precise observation. With
 this aid, almost unhoped for, our author undertook a new
  labour, and was able to six the value of the two equations,
  which explained the whole in the happiest manner. The
  result was, a more exact knowledge of the mean motion; a^
  more perfect agreement between calculation and observation ;
  and a well-founded hope that this agreement will be main
  tained, and that we stiall no more, fee, as of late years, errors
  increase in a rapid and alarming manner.
      This is not the place for entering into numerical details-;
  they will be found in a p;ipcr and tables submitted to the
  board.     To give an idea of the precision of the new tables, it
   will be sufficient to say that the errors which can be ascribed
   to them very seldom amount to 12" : whence it follows, that
   the astronomer who observes the moon will rarely find be
   tween the real and the calculated place a greater difference
   than the thickness of the verv delicate thread which is in
   the focus of the telescope ; and, to show of what importance
   this exactness is to navigation, we shall say, that as these 12"
   of motion do not require above a minute of time, the navi
   gator will never err eight minutes in his longitude, at least
                                                                       for

for the want of tables ; so that, if he is able to introduce the
fame exactness Lnto his observations, he may consider the pro
blem of the longitude as sufficiently solved for practice.
    The commissioners conclude that the new tables, by the
immensity of the labour which they suppose, the intelligence
which directed the labour, the great superiority they have
over other tables, and the utility they will daily be of to astro
nomers and navigators, are altogether worthy of the prize.

    This report having been adopted by the board, the secre
tary produced a proof that the new tables are the work of
M. Burg, adjunct astronomer of the imperial observatory of
Vienna, already so advantageously known by the prize which
 he participated, in the year 8, with C. Bouvart.     The presi
dent, therefore, in name of the board of longitude, adjudged
the prize to M. Burg, and it was agreed that a deputation
 should be named to present the above report to the consuls
of the French republic. This deputation, consisting of C. La-
 lande, Bougainville, Fleurieu, and Chabert, were admitted
on Friday, Messidor 6, to an audience of the first consul ;
who, after having heard the above report, and asked several
questions, in regard to the labour and the author of          it,
                                                              was

                                         doubling the promised
sum.
    Dr. Maskelyne, the astronomer roval of England, being
informed of the correctness of the new tables, has requested
a  copy of them, that he may employ them in his calculations
for the Nautical Almanac.       The board of longitude congra
tulates itself on thus having an opportunity of giving to this
distinguished man of letters, one of the foreign associates of
the National Institute,    mark of its high consideration, and
                           a

                           it

vegetation."    As two memoirs only were transmitted on this
subject, neither of which was thought worthy of the prize,
and as the class apprehend that the extent of the question
may have discouraged those capable of examining it with the
best success, they now confine it to one of its elements, and

opinion, may lead to great discoveries.
                                (Signed)       "Bonaparte."
    The National Institute, which has taken an active part in
the grand discoveries with which the theory of electricity has
been enriched, will be fully sensible of the importance of the
subject indicated by the first consul.        Of all 'the physical
forces to which natural bodies arc subjected, electricity ap
pears to be that the influence of which is oftenest manifested.
It not only acts on inorganic substances, which it modifies or
decomposes, but organized bodies themselves experience from
it the most astonishing effects. What to the antients was only
the simple result of some attractive properties, has become for
modern philosophers the. source of the most brilliant disco
veries.
    The history of electricity may be divided into two periods,
which are diltinguiflicd as much by the nature of the results
as by that of the apparatus employed to obtain them.               In
one, the electric influence is produced by the friction of glass
or of resinous matters ; in the other, electricity is put in mo
tion merely by the mutual contact of bodies.          We must re
fer to the first of these epochs the distinction between the two
kinds of electricity, resinous and vitreous, the analysis of
the Leyden flask, the explanation of thunder, the invention
                                                                   of

          for  Discoveries   in EL'Elricity and Galvanism.     189
of conductors,      and the exact determination of the laws ac
cording to which the repulsive force of the electric matter
varies according to the distance.          The second comprehends
the discovery of the muscular contractions excited by the
contact of metals, the explanation of these phænomena by
the motion of metallic electricity ; and, in the last place, the
formation of the electric pile, its analysis, and its various pro
perties. Volta has done in this second period what Franklin
did in the first.
     The sciences are now so connected with each other, that
every tiling which tends to improve the one advances the rest
at the fame time.        Under this point of view, galvanism, in
the history of them, will form a memorable epoch ; for there
are few discoveries which have given to philosophy and che
mistry so many new facts, and facts so remote from those
before known. The aggregate of these facts has been referred
 to a general cause, which is the motion of electricity : it re
 mains to determine accurately the circumstances by which,
 they are accompanied, to follow the numerous applications
 they suggest, and to discover the general laws which, per
 haps, are contained in them. The greater part of the che
 mical effects presented by the new kinds of apparatus are not
 yet completely explained; and it is of the more importance
 that they should be well known, as they furnisti to chemistry
 means very powerful for decomposing the most intimate com
 binations.     It is also interesting to examine whether the elec
 tric properties which certain minerals acquire in their varia
 tions of temperature do not depend on a disposition of their
 elements analogous to that which constitutes the Voltaic pile.
 In a word, it is to be desired that the theory of electricity
 augmented by these new phænomena stiould be completely
 subjected to calculation in a general, direct, and rigorous
  manner; and the progress already made in this path has
  proved that this difficult subject requires the sagacity of the
  most ingenious philosophy and the aid of the most profound
  analysis.
      But it is in its application in particular to the animal eco
  nomy that it is of importance to consider the galvanic appa
  ratus. It is already known that metals are not the only sub
  stances the contact of which determines the movement of
  electricity.    This property is common to thim and- some
  liquids, and it is probable that it extends, with divers modi
  fications, to all the bodies of nature. Do not the phæno
  mena exhibited by the torpedo and other electric fillies depend
  on an analogous action exerciled between the various parts
  of their organization ? and does not this action exist with a
                                                             degree

 degree  of intensity  less sensible, but no   less real, in a number
 of animals much greater than has hitherto been believed ?
An exact analysis of these effects, a complete explanation of
 the mechanism which determines them, and a comparison
 of them with those exhibited by the Voltaic pile, would, per
haps, afford a key to the most important secrets in the ani
mal economy.        By thus considering the aggregate of these
phænomena, one foresees the possibility of a grand discovery,
which, by unveiling a new law of nature, may conduct them,
to the same cause, and connect them with those which the
motion of electricity has presented us in minerals.
    Of these considerations the class was, no doubt, sensible ;
and if it did not propose a prize for the improvement of this
part of philosophy, it was for this reason that, as the extent
of the subject teemed to require more than one competition,
it could not devote to it exclusively encouragements which it
owes to useful knowledge in general. However, each of its
members, and all the learned of Europe, ardently desired
that the researches of philosophers might be directed to
wards this important object, and they ought to congratulate
themselves on seeing their wish accomplished in the most
complete manner.
    To fulfil the intentions of the first consul, and give to the
competition all the solemnity which the importance of the
object, the nature of the prize, and the character of the
founder require, the commission unanimoufly propose as
follows :
    The Class of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences of
the National Institute opens the general competition required
by the first consul.
    All the learned of Europe, even the members and asso
ciates of the Institute, are admitted to the competition.
    The class does not require that the memoirs should be im
mediately addressed to it. Every year it will crown the au
thor of the best experiments which shall come to its know
ledge, and which mall have advanced the progress of the
science.
    The grand prize will be given to the person whose disco
veries shall form a memorable epoch in the history of elec
tricity and galvanism.
    The present report, containing the letter of the first consul,
shall be printed, and serve as a programme.

1stof November 1803 :
      1   ft,   What     have we been taught          by   the latest observations
in regard to the influence of the oxygen of atmospheric air
in changing colours, whether aided with the action of light
or not; ana what advantages can be thence derived                          ?
   2d, What have we learned from the discoveries respecting
the decomposition of water and atmospheric air in regard to
the manner in which plants obtain their nourishment     and                     ;
what conclusions can thence be deduced for improving the
culture of useful vegetables?
   3d, What has experience taught us in regard to the puri
fying corrupted water and other impure substances          means           by
of charcoal      How far can the manner in which this done

further advantages can be derived from                     it?
   The society have extended also to the 1st of November 1802
the three prizes, proposed in 1799, respecting the chemical
discoveries in regard to the physiology of the human body                             ;
also the question proposed in 1796, and repeated in 1799,
respecting the whale fishery; the question, proposed in 1800,
respecting Chladni's vibration figures     and the two questions,

       XXXIV.     Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
r_,                       AEROSTATION.
  A   HE attention of the public has been lately directed to
this art, almost forgotten in England, by the arrival of
M. Garnerin from Paris with two aerostatic machines of
considerable size, and a parachute, which have been exhi
bited for some time past in the Pantheon. As this art, how
ever little it may promise in other respects, has been found
beneficial in military tactics, and might be employed with
great advantage in making meteorological and statical ex
periments, it is well worth the notice of scientific men :
we therefore hope that the following particulars respecting
M. Garncrin's two aerial excursions in England, on the 28th
of June and 4th of July, will be gratifying to our readers,
and particularly to those who had not an opportunity of seeing
him ascend. In a suture number we intend to give a concise
historical view of the progress of aerostation, with an engrav
ing of M. Garnerin's balloons and his parachute.
                          The first Voyage.
   In this excursion M. Garnerin was accompanied by cap
tain Sowden, who paid him a sum of money to enjoy the
gratification.   They ascended from Ranelagh gardens ; and
the particulars, as detailed by M. Garnerin, were as follow :
   The morning of the 28th (the day of his ascent) appeared
to promise weather sufficiently favourable for the purpose,
though it was rainy.       At eleven o'clock, therefore, he began
the chemical operations necessary for the production of the
inflammable gas.        The balloon silled rapidly, though consi
derably agitated by the wind.
   From one o'clock to half past four, the wind continued to
increase, and at length blew so violently, that, had he made
                                                              any

                          Aero/lation.                        193
any previous experiment in this country, he should have
yielded to the earnest solicitations of the brilliant and nume
rous company with which he was honoured, and fliould have
deferred his ascent to a period less tempestuous.
   M. Garnerin, however, though he determined not to dis
appoint the public expectation himself, felt it to be his duty
to press captain Sowden not, for the fake of curiosity, to ex •
      himself to the perils attendant upon such        journey in
  fiose
                                                    a
 uch weather. The captain, however, relisted all these solicita
tions, and resolved to accompanv him. From         a  quarter past
four to five some showers of rain fell, which only allayed the
fury of the wind for short time, for after they had ceased
                      a                                         it
blew with more violence than ever.
   At five o'clock Messrs. Garnerin and Sowden took their
feats, the cords were cut, and the balloon ascended.         Each
held    flag of the nation to which he belonged, which he
          a
waved to the company present.         The balloon first made the
tour of the place where the spectators stood, and, after being
greeted with the loud plaudits and good wishes of every per
son, ascended majestically and rapidly into the regions of the
air. The wind blew from the south-west. The balloon,
therefore, proceeded over St. James's park, the Thames, and
Westminster and Blackfriars bridges.
   M. Garnerin then found that the balloon began to de
scend     he threw out some ballast, aud
          :                                   itrose immediately
with great rapidity, and carried the travellers over the cathe
dral of St. Paul's.
   During all this time, the whole metropolis was distinctly
seen      by
          the aeronauts, whose balloon was equally visible to
the inhabitants of the metropolis.         When U was over St.
Paul's, M. Garnerin asked captain Sowden how he felt him
self? The captain replied, that he was perfectly enchanted
with his situation, and with the superb expanse os sky, and
with the earth, now fast lessening to the view, and soon to
be seen no more.        The temperature of the atmosphere now
began to change very sensibly, and to be fifteen degrees colder
than when they began to ascend.          It  was extremely cold.
The balloon continued rapidly to ascend, was soon above the
clouds, and the earth was visible no more.        When the tra
vellers were above the clouds, the climate became sensibly
milder    :the inflammable air began to dilate, and M. Gar
nerin gave      all possible means of vent proper for their safety.
               it
   They now dined with good appetites, and very comforta
bly, above the clouds, at an elevation of upwards of 10,000
feet above the earth.       During the dessert, M. Garnerin told
captain Suwden that the pleasantest part of their journey was
                                                           passed,

*94                         Aerostation.
          and that they must now prepare for a very disagreea*
   le descent, on account of the continued violence of the wind.
Eassed,
     About half an hour had elapsed since their ascent. M. Gar-
nerin now opened the valve, and the balloon descended through
black and cold clouds; they then descried land again, and
also the sea, towards which their course was fast carrying
them : indeed they were nearly over that arm of it into
which the Chelmer empties itself.
    As soon as they had approached sufficiently near the earth,
they threw out their anchor and cable. When the balloon
fisst touched the ground, it rebounded with considerable vio
lence; this rebound was followed by about twenty more,
more violent than the first. The gusts of wind dragged them
over fields and hedges, which tore their hands and clothes ;
their anchor touched the ground several times, but dragged j
and it was not till some minutes had elapsed that it took a
steady hold in a thicket near a house.    Here they conceived
themselves to be released from all peril : but the inhabitants
of the house, alarmed at the balloon, would not assist them;
nay, actually offered to fire on the adventurous travellers. In
the mean time the cable of the anchor broke, and they were
dragged through trees and branches, the balloon being           agi
tated^ to an extreme degree, and rebounding very violently.
At length they were driven against tree, and captain Sow-
                                      a
den received   asevere blow on the back part of his head. The
balloon was now torn in the lower part, the cords broke, the
boat broke the travellers had hold
           ;                               of tree, from which
                                                a
they  were torn    by
                    the violence of the wind.    At last, bound
                                                       a
which the balloon made, enabled them to jump out. The
balloon, abandoned to itself, and much torn, fell about 200
paces further.
   The place where M. Garnerin and captain Sowden landed
was on a  common, four miles beyond Colchester, and sixty
miles from Ranelagh.     The time that elapsed from their de
parture to their landing on the common was three quarters
of an hour.
   M. Garnerin's hands were much torn, and his legs and
thighs considerably bruised.   Captain Sowden received      a   se
vere blow on the back part of his head, and was much bruised
and torn in other parts of his body        by
                                           the bushes and trees
against which they were driven.
   M. Garnerin pays the highest tribute to the courage and
coolness of his companion, who, after the balloon had first
rebounded, could several times have jumped out of      it  with
great ease and safety   but he persisted in sharing the fate of
                        :
nis companion, till they were both enabled to land in safety.

    Mr. Editor,
   As numberless questions            have beenput to me respecting
the sensations I experienced              in the upper regions, I
                                        while
think it a duty incumbent on me to inform the public, and
to set them right as to the erroneous           ideas they have of an
aerostatic voyage. On our first ascending, we felt a few drops
of rain. After we had gained the height of about 3000 feet,
I desired M. Garnerin not to ascend any higher till he had
passed the metropolis, that the inhabitants might be gratified
with a fair view of us. When we had got at a small distance
from London, we ascended through some very thick clouds,
of which I could perceive three distinct rows, at the lower
one of which we found the quicksilver of the thermometer
at 150, and I was obliged to put on my greatcoat; but on.
ascending still higher we found the air more temperate, and
the quicksilver rise gradually to 5^ above summer heat.           We
then seemed to be stationary, and felt no more motion than
one would feel in sitting in a chair in a room.            1 then pro
posed to M. Garnerin to overhaul our lockers, where we
found a ham, a cold fowl, a cake, and two bottles of orgeat,
 ¦wines or spirits being dangerous to take, owing to the rarefac
tion of the air. The chill of the clouds having given us an
 appetite, we made a table on our knees with the feats of the
 car, and ate a very heartv meal. The clouds then dispersed
 from under us, and we had a delightful view of the country.
     Whether it is owing to the rarefaction of the air, or to
 the strong light thrown on the earth, I cannot determine,
 but I found that my sight, which at all times is rather weak,
 became so strong, that I could easily distinguish the minutest
 objects on the earth : it appeared like a vast panorama, or
 map, of about fifty miles in circumference, where we could
 not only follow with our eyes the different cross roads and
 intersections on       it,
                         but even distinguish the ruts on them,
 and the very furrows         the field.
                              in           The fense of hearing was
 stronger here than on earth       for, at the height of 15,000 feet,
                                      ;
 we could distinctly hear the rattling of the carriages on the
 roads, the lowing of cattle, and the acclama! ions of the people
 who saw us; though, at the same time, we could hardly hear
 ourselves speak    : and    am persuaded that
                              I                         person on the
                                                         a
 earth, with    a   strong voice and        speaking trumpet, might
                                                a
 make himself perfectly understood                  by
                                                   any person at that
  height in the air.        have observed that almost everv sensa
                              I
  tion experienced while in the upper regions was exactly the
     I
  contrary to what       the general opinion of the public.
                         is                                   I    was
  assured bya   number of the moil celebrated literati, who pre-
   Vol. XIII.       No. 50.               O                   tended

196                                Aerojlalion.
tended to be very learned on that subject, that              I  fliould find
the cold increase, the higher I ascended ; instead of which                 I
found the heat increase to that degree, that I was obliged to
take both my great coat and jacket off. It is also the general
opinion that looking down from so stupendous a height ren
ders a person so giddy as not to be able to keep his feat: oil
the contrary, I found that I could look down with a vast deal
of pleasure, and without experiencing that inconvenience;
whereas looking round on the vast expanse that surrounded
us, rendered my eyes so dim, that I was- sometimes a few mi
nutes before I could perfectly recover my fight.                   I experi
enced no difficulty of breathing, or inconvenience from the
motion of the balloon ; for, though we moved with immense
velocity, we felt not the least wind or pressure of air, it being
so perfectly calm, that the flags in our hands, and those with
which the balloon was decorated, hung supine, nor did they
stir.
     I observed,     that between every row of clouds, not only the
atmosphere, but the wind, varied several degrees ; for, on our
 passing through the first cloud after leaving London, the wind,
which had before been nearly south-west, changed to south-
south-east, by which means we found ourselves over St. Al-
ban's, in Hertfordshire.              On ascending still higher, the wind
became nearly west, which drove us over lipping forest, which
 I distinguished very plainly ; it appeared like a gooseberry*
 busli.      1 thcn'pointed out our course to M. Garner in on the
 map, and observed lo him that we fliould soon perceive the
 sea, which in a short time we saw very plainly.              M. Garnerin
 then told me we had not a moment to lose, and must descend
 with all possible speed ; at the same time pointing out a very
 heavy cloud to me, nearly under us; and said — II fautque
                                                              "
 nous passions k travers         tie  ce drole la; accrochez-vous ferme,
 car nous allons nous easier le col."              I answered — " De tout
 mon cœur."            We    then    opened the valve, and we descended
 with rapidity. On rustling into the cloud, I sound, as he had
 conjectured, it contained as violent a squall of wind and rain
 is ever 1 experienced.            The attraction of the water, the force
 of   the   wind,   and  the   constant emission of gas from the valve,
  hurled    us  with  such   velocity towards the earth, that I expected
  to fee   his  prediction verified ; though, I can assure you, my
          at that time did not coincide with the answer 1 made

      M. Garnerin       still retained all his coolness and presence of
  mind    ;   and,  while     we were descending with that extreme
  swiftness,    desired  me, the moment I should find the car about
  to touch     the  earth, to catch hold of the hoop which was fast
                                                                        ened

                                   A'irostation.                                197
ened to the bottom of the net, to which the car was suspend
ed, and lift myself up into the net ; by which means we saved
ourselves from being dashed to pieces.     The balloon did not
reascend immediately, but dragged us along the ground, with
astonishing swiftness, for the length of nearly three fields, be
fore the grappling-iron took good hold : and then we thought
ourselves fare, being close to a farm-house, from which se
veral persons came out to fee us : but though we threw out
ropes to them, and called for help, they were so consternated
that neither threats nor entreaties could prevail on them to
come to ourassistance ; for, as I afterwards heard, they took
us to be two sorcerers, it being rather an unusual thing to see
two men coming down post haste from the clouds. We were
for about three minutes in that situation, till another gust of
wind broke our cable, and we ascended again nearly 600 feet.
   In the bustle of preparing the ropes for the farmers,
M. Garnerin had let the rope belonging to the valve flip out
of his hand, by which means the bottom of the balloon was
pressed   upwards by the wind.        M. Garnerin desired me to
try to regain it ; which I at last effected by climbing up into
the net, though the force of the wind struck the tin tubes
fastened at the bottom of the balloon, and through which the
rope led, with such violence against my face, that it had
nearly stunned me.       Having recovered                it,
                                                 we redescended,
but were borne with such violence across the country, some
times along the ground, sometimes in the air, that several           I
times proposed to M. Garnerin to abandon the balloon, and
to save ourselves: but he continually objected to          and re   it,
minded me of my promise not to quit him. In the mean
time we were dashed against several trees, one of which had
nearly destroyed us being with my back towards
                               :                               re         it,
                                                                           I
ceived a   blow on the head, which threw me at full length at
the bottom of the car.      M. Garnerin, in attempting to assist
me, was nearly thrown overboard         two of the cords that held
                                             ;
the car broke, and at the fame time some of the branches
tore the balloon     upon which M. Garnerin cried out, "The
                       :
balloon    is torn, and we are saved." Another gust of wind
disengaged us from the tree, and we touched the ground
once more, with       less violent shock than before.
                           a                             We then
both got out, but so exhausted with our numerous exertions
that we had hardly strength to follow the balloon, which fell
again about 200 paces further; when we completely mas
tered  it,   by throwing ourselves upon        and it, that means
                                                               by
pressing out the remainder of the gas.
  It  rained      very hard, that
                  so                 proposed to M. Garnerin to
                                         I
leave the balloon in the field, and go in search of some house

for flielter and refreshment. We accordingly made the best
of our way to a house, which we espied about half a mile off,
belonging to a Mr. Kingsberv: and here a very curious mis
take took place.     When we inquired for the master of the
house,   Mr.  Kingsbery appeared : but, seeing two persons of
so strange an appearance, (M. Garnerin having a French hat
on with the national cockade, bearing the tri- coloured flag,
and myself being in a sailor's dress, with the union jack in
my hand,) he imagined we came on account of the election ;
and, before we could address him, said, " Gentlemen, though
I  am a freeholder, I have made a determination not to vote
for one fide or the other." So much was he impressed with
this idea, that it was some time before we could make him          ,
sensible that we had nothing to do with the election, but that
we came in a balloon, in three quarters of an hour, from
London ; that we were very much bruised and tired, and that
we required his assistance and shelter.     He then received us
in the most hospitable manner, not only providing us with
refreshments and dry clothes, but even offered us beds, the
use of his house and horses, and sent immediately some far
mers with a cart to carry the balloon from the field and con
vey it to a place of safety ; and, as we expressed a wish to get
to Colchester that night, he sent for a post-chaise to convey
us thither, where we were received with loud acclamations
by the inhabitants.     The next day we returned to Langen-
hoe, where we had left the balloon, and, after drying it on
the grafs, packed it up, and made the best of our way to
 town, where we arrived about four o'clock the next morning.
    I cannot help admiring the coolness and presence of mind
 M. Garnerin preserved even in the most imminent danger; and
 I am so confident of his great talents and skill in conducting
 a balloon, that I would venture to go to the end of the world
 with him.
    This is as near a statement as I can recollect ; and I mould
 take it as a favour if you would insert it in vour Publication,
 as you will thereby save me a great deal of trouble, having
 hardly breath enough to answer the numerous inquiries con
 cerning our aerial excursion. I am, Sir, yours, &c.

                        The second Voyage.
    M.    Garnerin  was accompanied     in this voyage   by   Mr.
 Locker, who gives- the following account of it ;
    Although the world has been already presented with an ac
 count of a late aerial excursion, I flatter myself so much in

                              Aerostation.                       199
terest is still entertained by the public for the safety of M. Gar-
nerin, that the following particulars of his second ascent will
prove acceptable.        The very unfavourable weather, attended
with a heavy gale at south and south-west, induced M. Gar-
nerin to give up his intention of ascending to display the pro
mised experiment of the parachute.            In this event, it had
been arranged that Mr. Sowden should once more accom
pany him ; but some misunderstanding having taken place
between those gentlemen, and having had some previous
conversation on the preceding day with M. Garnerin on the
subject, I ascended with him yesterday afternoon at ten mi
nutes before five o'clock from Lord's Cricket-ground.           The
strong assurances of my companion, added to what I had read
on the science of aerostation, and the experience of former
aeronauts, had so fully persuaded me of my perfect security,
that I enjoyed rhe wonderful and enchanting prospect which,
now presented itself with unmixed pleasure.           Although the
dense state of the atmosphere obstructed the light of distant
objects' in so great a degree that our horizon was somewhat
limited, the unusual concourse of spectators, which gradually
diminished to an undistinguished mass, and the view of a
great part of the metropofis, together with the surrounding
country, afforded me an entertainment well worth the pur
chase of any supposed danger.           After throwing out some
part of our ballast we ascended very rapidly, and oy the in
tervention of some thick clouds (which had much the
appearance of a sea of cotton beneath us, as described by
Mr. Baldwyn, of Chester), we entirely lost sight of the earth.
We moved with much rapidity, although our motion was to
me perfectly imperceptible ; and at length the clouds di
spersing, we again saw the country below us.            I attempted,
in vain, to ascertain our situation, by calling to my recol
lection the appearance of the country, which appeared to me
more like a prospect seen in a camera, when placed in a very
elevated situation, than any thing to which I could compare
it ; I think a map is an incorrect comparison, as the various
objects are not, as in nature, delineated with sufficient mi
nuteness to bear such a resemblance. — About this time M.
Garnerin looked at his watch, and, observing we had been
five minutes on our voyage, proposed to descend in about the
fame time.
    The perusal of Mr. Sowden's narrative led me to observe,
with much attention, the power of hearing noises below.
Neither M. Garnerin nor myself could distinguish sounds
above the elevation of 3 or 4000 feetj though M. Garnerin
                                 03

   imagines a very confused sound, but totally undistinguish-
    able, may be heard considerably higker.         We never at
   tained a greater height this day, by M. Garnerin's computa
   tion, than about 1200 French toises, or 7800 feet, as M.
"
   Garnerin, being desirous to return the fame evening to town,
   did not choose to lose a favourable opportunity of descending.
   At length we saw at a distance what afterwards proved to be
   Epping forest, with a range of distant hills beyond ; and ob
   serving an open champaign country, M. Garnerin opened the
   valve, and we began to descend. He directed me to call to some
   persons employed in a field, as we approached the ground,
   to take hold of the ropes which we had thrown out for the
   purpose, and recommended me to hold fast by the cords, to
   avoid the (hock on the balloon's first touching the earth.
  This precaution proved very necessary, as the force with
  which we descended was verv considerable, from the force of
  the wind rather than by our specific gravity, and the rebound
  bore us up again with velocity to the height of 150 or 200
  feet.   In  redescending we struck against a tree, the shock of
  which    gave M. Garnerin a severe blow on the back; and he
  observed that this was the onlv occasion, during a period of
  twelve years in which he had been in the habit of aeronavi
  gation, and the 27th time he has ascended, that he ever suf
  fered such an inconvenience.      Several of the peasantry being
  now at hand, we were prevented from any further ascent,
  and alighted from the car with perfect safety.     We immedi
  ately inquired   our situation, and found we had fallen in a
  field of Mr. Owen's, at Chingford, in Essex ; and, referring
 to our watches, observed we had made our voyage exactly in
  one quarter of an hour.        We dispatched a messenger to
 Woodford for, a post-chaise, and, having expressed the in
 flammable air, packed the balloon in the car, and had it
 conveyed to a small inn at Chingford-green, adjoining which
 we had descended; from whence, after a slight repast on some
 provisions we had brought with us, we set off for London,
 and arrived at M. Garnerin's, in Poland-street, a quarter
 after nine in the evening.
     Although the mob, which surrounded us on our descent,
 were, as usual, both troublesome and officiously impertinent,
 we received great attention from Mr. Hughes, of the Stamp-
 office, London, and several other gentlemen, who beheld our
 arrival. Attention would have been, however, insured to us,
if necessary, by the paper put into the hands of M. Garnerin,
signed bv his royal highness the prince of Wales, the duchess
ol Pcvonfliire, lords liefborough, Catlicart, and other persons

    "We left the Isle of France on the 25th of April last. Our
passage to Lewin's Land, New Holland, was thirty-two days.
Scarcely had <ve arrived on the coast, when the currents drove
us to the distance of more than ten leagues.        We, however,
succeeded in approaching                 it,
                                 and coasted along      for several    it

when we reached the latitude of Point North, we discovered
a   vast bay, the entrance of which appeared to be at least fif
teen leagues in breadth, and which penetrates more than ten
leagues inland.        was called the Baye du Geograpbe*.
                          It
    " We anchored in this bay on the 28th of May. The

  tion at the bottom of the bay. A great part of the crew went
  on shore; and here, for the first time, we had an opportunity
  of seeing the natives of the country.
     " The shores of this bay, those at least which we were able
 to explore, present in general only downs, or small hills of
  sand accumulated by the wind.            Some shrubs grow here, but
 thinly    scattered,  and  the   largest are not six feet in height.
 Beyond these are low grounds covered with thick woods.
  Among these, in particular, is distinguiflied a kind of juni
 per. These beautiful trees retain their foliage throughout the
 whole vear, grow very clore to each other, and, as their tops
  all rife to the fame height, they appear to the eye which views
 them from the top of the downs like large sheets of verdure
  extended horizontally and attached to different trees which
 surround them.         Their bark, which is exceedingly thick,
  and five or fix lines in thickness, is employed by the inhabi
 tants for covering their huts, to make dresses to secure them
 from the cold, and as beds to sleep on.
     " The upper part of the soil consists of a stratum of vege
 table earth, of the colour of turf, at least fix inches in thick
 ness.     Below is found very black moss earth. 1 collected
 some of it as a specimen.
     " This day I obtained several beautiful plants, among
 which were a gvapbalium, with large flowers as white as
snow ; and an atriplex, with larger and longer leaves than
 those of the bay laurel.            I met with others which were
 not new to me, and I even saw some which grow in the
 neighbourhood of Paris.           Our excursion ended with the day,
 and it was ni^ht-fall when we returned on board.
     " It was intended that we should fail from the bay next
morning ; but the officers of the Naturali/ie *, who had
 landed on a different part of the coast, having reported to the
 commodore that they had discovered a kind of river, it was
determined that the long boat and a canoe should be sent to
 explore it. Every body wished to be of the party: the botanist,
 the mineralogist, the doctor, the commodore's secretary, and
myself, were admitted.
     " This day was a day of misfortune. I had made a rich
collection of plants, and was returning loaded with them to
the landing-place, when I learned that the boat had run
aground, and that it was impossible to get it afloat again.
The canoe set out alone at ten in the evening, and the officer
who had charge of it promised to use the utmost dispatch to
inform the commodore of our disagreeable situation.

an intreochment around us, lighted a large fire, and ap
pointed a guard of three men to keep watch during the
night.     Next day passed away without hearing any news
from the (hip. The day following still nothing was seen.
The sea, however, appeared to be visibly rougher, and to
become more and more threatening.             We began to be in
want of provisions and water. At last, on the third day, we
saw a boat coming from the Geograpbe, which brought us
all the assistance we stood in need of. We learned, that the
one which carried to the commodore the news of our distress
had been thirty-six hours in reaching the vessel, having had
to struggle against a very hollow sea ; that the barometer had
fallen more than fix lines in the course of a very short time;
and that every thing announced a violent storm.         The com
modore requested us to hasten our embarkation ; and to leave
on shore our arms and ammunition, together with all our
baggage, and even all the plants which I had carefully col
lected, and for which there was no room in the canoe.            It
was just time : two hours laler we should not have been able
to reach tie ship : it would even have been impossible to
embark.
    " A canoe having been dispatched from the Naturalijle to
recover the effects we had left on more, one of the sailors, an
 excellent swimmer, threw himself into the sea to tow it on
shore; but, being thrown down by the waves, he funk and
disappeared.      The canoe returned without landing, and
brought    back nothing but the melancholy intelligence of the
loss it had sustained.
    " We were three days in getting from this bay. The
day after, the Naturalijle separated from us ; and we did not
fee her again till she reached Timor, a month after our arrival
at that island.
    " After we left the bav, and when the bad weather was
over, we approached the land, and stretched along the coast
as near to it as possible.    Never in my life did I fee a country
more arid or barren: not a drop of good water to be got;
little or no vegetation ; and the land inaccessible, and sur
rounded by reets and deep water. Sometimes, when at the
distance of six leagues from the coast, we had thirty-six fa
thoms water, and in a few minutes we found only five.
    " In this manner we reached the Baye des Cbiens Marinst
where the vessel anchored.       During the time we staid here
I had an opportunity of visiting two islands, which may be
each twelve or fourteen leagues in extent.       I traversed them
nearly   in every  direction,  observing with great care their na
tural productions, particularly the plants, several of which

204                    Voyages and Discoveries,
were unknown to me. I collected seventy species.        Tt was
then I regretted that I had not been able to land on different
points of the immense coast along which we had sailed.
Notwithstanding    its appearance of sterility, what a store of
hidden curious and unknown productions it would have pre
sented to me     !
    "   On our   departure from the Baye des Cbiens Marins we
discovered a new island, which we marked on our chart. We
called it I'ljle des Am'iraux, because we saw a great manv birds
of that name upon it. This island is about three leagues
from the land. Notwithstanding the good intentions of the
commodore, it was not possible for any of the naturalists to
go on sliore ; but the officer ordered to reconnoitre it brought
back several beautiful sttells and plants. He observed also a
quadruped of the size of a shepherd's dog; and discovered a
spring of excellent water.
   " We continued our voyage along the coasts of New Hol
land, but no where went on shore.              At length, after a most
dismal navigation, we anchored, on the 23d of August, in the
harbour of Coupant, in the island of Timor. On ihe 25th we
took up our lodging on shore in two houses provided by the
governor for the commodore : the latter resides in one of
them, and the naturalists in the other.
   <( How
              great a contrast this fertile and woody country,
especially  in  the part which we inhabit, forms with the coasts
we have just sailed alung ! The plants, indeed, are not so un
common as those of New Holland.                  A great many of them
are cultivated     in  the  Isle de France.       I have seen the wild
bread-fruit tree, mango trees,         and   tamarind     trees of a pro
digious height,     areca  trees, cocoa-nut     trees of different  kinds,
the maringa, sophara,         &c.    The   whole     country   around   the
harbour    of  Coupant    is  covered  with   these   beautiful  trees.    I
have seen       figtrees thirty feet in circumference, shading the
ground to   a   great distance with their branches, and capable
of sheltering from the rain       a   whole battalion of soldiers.      I
found the rizofbora mangas, which              I had before observed in
America; but the tree which appeared to me most remarkable
was the cafuarina, the trunk ot which grows to the size of
ten feet in circumference, and rises to the height of fifty.
   " This island      is   watered    by   a  multitude of streams:      it
contains   beautiful    plains,   which   are  easily laboured with the
plough.     The   principal objects    of  cultivation   aie rice, maize,
yams,    and   tobacco.

Timor, to which we intend to return when we have explored
the south part of New Holland. I have little hope of bring
ing back many from that strange country. The commodore
has already informed me that it is almost impossible to carry
on board living plants on a coast so dangerous, and to stow
them in a vessel where so much room is required for perform
ing the multiplied manœuvres rendered necessary by the in
creased danger.
    " I think we (hall leave this place about the end of the
month in order to explore the south coast of New Holland."
   The court of Madrid has determined to fend out two sga-
vans to make discoveries in the interior of Africa.      They are
now at Paris, but are to visit this country for the purpose of
purchasing mathematical and astronomical instruments. They
wish also, previous to their departure, to have an opportunity
of conferring with the African Society, and of seeing Mungo
Parke, who is so eminently qualified to give them that pre
vious information which may enable them to prosecute their
researches with success.
                         ANTIQUITIES.
   The  prefect of the department of the C6tes-du-Nord having
ordered   some researches to be made by digging in the village
of Courseult, two leagues from Dinan, the workmen employed
came to the ruins ot a buried city, respecting the existence or
destruction of which no traditionary accounts are preserved.
Several antiquaries are of opinion that it was the antient ca
pital of the Curiosolites, the name of which is still preserved in
the corrupted appellation of Courseult. Several highways, the
            of which is in good preservation, end at this vil-
 age, and proceed in the following directions: one towards
[>avement
Rennes, another towards Vannes, a third towards Cou-
tances, and a fourth towards the sea.      A quantity of walls,
of greater or less thickness, have been found, which, no
doubt, formed the houses and streets of the town; cisterns;
the half of an oitagon temple; a great many medals of
Nero, Tiberius, Faustina, Constantine, and others, with small
bronze figures.    There is reason to hope that more important
discoveries will be made to decide the uncertainty which pre
vails among the learned in regard to the existence of this
antient town.

                                     MAMMOUTH.
   The following     an extract of
                            is        letter on this subject from
                                                    a
C. Roume, private agent of the French government at Saint
Domingo, dated Philadelphia, January 4, 180a:
    " Mr. Peale, that indefatigable naturalist, whom the Ame
ricans have the happiness to possess without knowing his me
rit, has discovered several skeletons of the mammouth, one of
which     entirely complete except
         is                             few of the double parts
                                                        a                        ;
but drawings of the parts which are wanting have been made
from those that remain.       He has taken the greatest care to
mount this skeleton, and yesterday    was publicly exhibited.
                                                        it
   " The first day, however, was destined only for the mem
bers of the Academy of Arts and Sciences at Philadelphia                         ;
and  I should not have been able to pay   visit to this antient
                                                             a

Mr. Peale, who admitted me into the exhibition-room, with
                                                                            several

several    Frenchmen    who accompanied me,       and particularly
C. Foussenguy.
     "  The latter, then, can tell you, that the skeleton of the
mammouth does not sensibly differ from that of the Asiatic
elephant but by some particularities in the teeth and tusks.
The maxillary teeth of the elephant touch each other in sur
faces not very unequal ; while the upper surfaces of the teeth
of the lower jaw, and the inferior surfaces of the teeth of the
upper jaw, in the mammouth, are furnished with very pro
minent and pretty sharp tubercles.
     "  The tusks of the elephant have only one curve, while
those of the mammouth have a double curve.              They first
issue from the upper jaw more divergent than those of the
elephant ; they then turn so as to form part of a spiral, devi
ating more and more to the left. Tn a word, setting aside the
double curve, and considering each tusk in profile as if it were
 traced out on the fame plane, the whole of the curve of the
tusks of the mammouth is rounded much more ; that is to
 sav, presents an arc of a great many more degrees than that
 of the elephant.
      " Had a skeleton of the elephant been placed by the side
                         \
 of the present one, should, perhaps, have been able to re
 mark other disserences ; but these were the only ones it was
 possible for me to observe.
      " Mr. Feale is going to mount a second skeleton of the mam
 mouth, but much less complete: he intends to commit it to
 the care of his son, who will exhibit it in the principal cities of
 Europe, in order to obtain money to maintain his family, and
 to enable him to continue his researches, which may lead to
 other discoveries no less interesting, since it is now fully
  proved that there existed formerly in America another animal
  still greater, perhaps, than the mammouth.        This proof re
  sults from some maxillary teeth and boney fragments, which
  have nothing in common with the fame parts in the mam
  mouth, and which are formed oil a much larger model.
       " I bee you will communicate these details to the Na
  tional Institute.     Ciet Mr. Feale chosen a corresponding
  member.       You will not repent it. I have already prevailed
  on him to send his son first to France ; and I have promised
  that you will give him a good reception, and present him to
  the Institute, who certainly will not fail to induce the first
  consul to purchase the skeleton which Mr. Peale jun. will
  bring with him, either that it may be deposited in the Na
  tional Museum immediately, or after he has been allowed to
  exhibit it in disserent parts of Europe,     The skeleton which

    C. Chaptal has    sent the following letter to M. Otto, mi
 nister plenipotentiary of the French republic at London, in
 consequence of receiving, through his hands, a copy of Sir
John Sinclair's paper on longevity, a part of which has been
given in the present number of the Philosophical Magazine:
    " I  beg you will thank Sir John Sinclair for the work he
 has sent me : it is worthy of a man who is constantly em
ployed with what is useful, and who has directed his attention
 to one of the most curious and most interesting points in the
 study of man. Answers to the questions proposed by Sir John
 Sinclair would, no doubt, throw great light on the causes,
 hitherto obscure, in regard to the difference in the duration
of the life of man. We see some placed in circumstances
which might be considered favourable, carried off at a very
early age; while others, surrounded by all the apparent causes
of death, reach the utmost term of human life.          I shall cir
culate the questions proposed by Sir John Sinclair, and             I
have given orders that the tables of mortality drawn up by
the government shall be tranfmiltcd to him every year, with
the particular observations which accompany them.            I shall
be very glad to know his opinion on this labour as it reaches
him. 1 t>eg you will assure him of my esteem, and that
I  wish a correspondence may be established between us."

    In a letter which came to hand a few days ago from our
friend Dr. Mitchell, of New York, whose political engage
ments (having been again elected member of Congress) have
not lessened his ardour for science, we have received several
important communications, which sliall appear in our next.
We sliould, however, feel ourselves culpable if we delayed the
publication of the following cafes of pulmonary consumption
cured by a salivation ; communicated in a letter from Dr. Rush
to Dr. Miller, dated Philadelphia, May 6, 1802:
    "  I have great pleasure in informing you that Dr. Parke
has lately discharged a patient from the Pennsylvania hospital
perfectly cured ot a pulmonary consumption by means of a
salivation.    I have likewise been again made happy in seeing-
the triumph of that remedy in the case of Mr. James Hunter,
a young gentleman of respectable character in this city.        He
had been afflicted for several years with weak lungs; and, in

diseased with all the usual symptoms of a confirmed consump
tion.    The salivation was advised by Dr. Physick and myself,
and was continued to a severe degree for several weeks.         His
cough and fever left him with the cessation of the discharge
from his salivary glands.        I saw him on the second of this
month in good health, and with a considerable increase of
flesh since bis recovery.
           DEAFNESS RELIEVED BY GALVANISM.
    Professor   Pfaff, of Kiel, in a letter to Dr. Friedlander,
at Paris, fays     :
                     " There is an institution for the deaf and
dumb at Kiel.        For three weeks past I have employed the
electric pile of Volta as a cure for deafness.       It produces its
effect very slowly.      The letters which the deaf and dumb can
hear, as we may fay, serve as a measure to determine the
degree of their deafness.       They hear the letter a the soonest,
then e, and in the last place i.        They often change o into u.
One of them heard ou for some days as u.          Of all the conso
nants, r is that which they hear first. They are soon able
also to hear ss and cb ; but they do not hear /and * till very
late. The same phænomena are observed in several indivi
 duals at the fame time. It appears, however, that the Voltaic
pile produces only a momentaneous irritation of the auditory
 nerves during the time it is employed, and that this irritation
is followed by a weakness and relaxation of the parts.          The
patients became deaf as before when I ceased to electrify
them, for the effect is nothing else than that produced by
electricity.     I propose to continue my experiments for two
 months at least.
                                 DEATH.
    On   the 28th ult. at his house in Marlborough- street, in his
 35th year, Thomas Garnett, M. D. of a fever of the typhous
kind. Without anticipating the account of his life, whish,
we understand, is to accompany his lectures, many of which
 he left ready for the press, we may observe, in general, that
 he possessed all the essential qualifications of a public teacher,
 in an eminent degree.         Having been early initiated in clas
 sical and  mathematical learning by a gentleman of uncom
 mon ability, especially as a geometrician, he was thus re
gularly prepared for his subsequent course of study at Edin
burgh; where his application was such, that we have heard
him fay, he allowed himself, for several years, only four hours
 sleep, and very little relaxation during the day.      What must
 have been the progress of a penetrating genius, combined with
                                                                such

3i»                           Death
such industry, and under the conduct of able teachers, (whom,
by   the way, he always mentioned with the greatest respect,)
our philosophical readers will easily conceive.    In fact, when
the doctor left that university, he might be said to have been
accomplished in all the essential parts of medical erudition,
and thoroughly initiated in every collateral branch of know
ledge. He had made himself well acquainted with the theory
of the celebrated Brown; and the ability with which he sup
ported that theory is well known to the readers of his Lecture
on Health, and will be still more apparent when his Lectures
on Zoonomia, of which he left a correct copy, come to be
laid before the public.     He gave a decided preference to the
modern chemistry, which he treated with all that perspicuity
and precision, which might be expected from a teacher who
 had been early habituated to the close and accurate reasoning
which distinguishes the mathematical sciences.         We have
 heard him (everal times fay that, in point of evidence, che
 mistry, in its present state of improvement, is not inferior
 to the Newtonian philosophy : and although we might not
 be prepareJ to give our unqualified assent to this opinion ; yet
 we cannot but acknowledge that such a declaration, from so
 able a judge, is highly creditable to the science.        As an
 experimenter, Dr. Garnett was at once dexterous and cau
 tious ; so cautious, indeed, that we never knew or heard of
 any material accident happening at his lectures. His audi
 ence attended him with a fense of perfect security, and his
 apparatus suffered little or no damage in his hands.       Many
 of the articles were improved by the alterations he had occa
 sion to make in them ; and, upon the whole, his apparatus,
  as it now stands, is extremely valuable. We apprehend it will
 be disposed of by private sale, which, however judiciously
 conducted, cannot be expected to return any thing like its
  original cost.   This is the more to be lamented, as upon
  that apparatus, the lecture- room which he lately built, and
  the many contingent expenses attending a new establish
  ment, the doctor had expended so much money, as to have
  left little or no provision for his orphan children.     A sub
  scription, we understand, is to be opened in their behalf,
  which, we hope, will place them in a situation in some de
  gree suitable to the prospects thev might reasonably have en
  tertained, if their father had lived to reap the fruits of his
  labours.

u,PON          mature consideration it will appear as if our in
quiry   should  be after the beautiful itself; or, in other words,
that which makes every thing beautiful by its presence. For,
 should any one assert that beauty is purely external, he
must never have considered the subject. For, were it asked
from whence a man is wife, should we not answer, From
possefling wisdom ? And should we not say the same of good
things, that they were so from having good in them, and
that an object is beautiful from posseflingueauty ? or (hall we
pronounce those things mere non-entities, and the words of
Ho import ?
    Perhaps any two persons in opposite hemispheres, who
should begin or invent a science (geometry for instance),
would proceed in their discoveries nearly in the fame way.
Now, to invent is to find ; and to find something presupposes
its existence somewhere, internally or externallv, scattered or
in a mass. Or shall We say there is not any such thing as
science ? that it is only a knowledge of externals ? But how
couki they assert the power of that Being who operated
prior to all externals?      If our knowledge is of externals, we
must certainly labour under a deception ; for it is not exter-
nals but their images only that we are acquainted with, the
objects themselves not becoming the subject of speculation.
So we shall not possess truth itself, but only certain images of
truth, and of course possess what is false; while truth will
abide in the externals.        Hence should we not rather con
clude that science cannot be taught by man, or be obtained
through the means of externals only, but lies, as it were,
latent in every mind, till excited and brought to light by dili
gent and deep inquiry ? For, were the inquiries of art after
visible objects, the point would soon be settled by diligently
copying the images painted to sense: on the contrary, the
artist, recurring to the reasoning energy, aims at a perfection

beyond matter. But some, having no knowledge of internal
beauty, are constrained to seek it in the objects of fense, and
or course present us with all the imperfections of an individual
model.       Hence, was beauty to remain external to the foul, it
could never affect; but, being well and perfectly conceived,
we are moved by it with the most exquisite delight.
    Painting depends on two powers, the mind and the hand ;
or, in other words, refledtion and practice.' We mould there
fore, by an early application to drawing, particularly regular
forms, qualify ourlelves to embody our ideas with facility
 and ease when the mind has attained to maturity.
    As the Great First, or that which is in the most exalted
 degree, contains all things in the immensity of his being ; so
 all things being referred to and subsisting by him, he is con-
iidered as the good of the universe. Hence all desire the pos
 session of good, as thinking thereby they shall become suffi
 cient to themselves *. But all do not think the possession of
 beauty will be the completion of their wishes; not that the
 good can be destitute of beauty, as in the First must necessa
 rily abide all things: so it will be superior to beauty, as not
 requiring the assistance of the senses.
     The beauty of intellect is superior to that of matter, and
appears to have had a previous existence ; just as the con
 clusion will remain indubitably certain, whether the syllo                      f.

    Again, as beauty argues perfection, it were in vain to seek
it in sensibles, the objects of fense being imperfect. For,
 though we mould grant it is rendered in a certain degree vi
 sible in matter, yet the higher degree of perfection is im
 plied in the Venus Urania.
    To carry on our inquiry, works of art cannot derive their
 beauty from the materials of which they are composed, but
 from the reasoning energy; not because the artist possesses
 hands and eyes, but that he is endowed with art. For it is
    * The   Supreme Ai thor of our being has so formed the soul of man,
 that nothing but himself can be its last, adequate, and proper happinels.

 had not then a being.     Jt may be further necessary to remark, that the
 wife of all nations have thought that the sciences have vaniihxd and ap
peared again under the various revolutions of the universe.

the duty of the artist to fashion beautiful forms ; as of a man,
not any particular one is to be taken as a model, but he \s
bound to enter into the reasons of art, and produce a perfect:
assemblage      of beauty.
    Something further than manual labour is necessary, other
wise we may mistake seeing and hearing for understanding.
    Some ignorantly mistake magnitude for greatness; but if
bulk is beautiful as bulk, it must follow that active reason,
which is not bulk, is not beautiful. But the contrary is the
fact, and sine works of art derive their excellence from reason
infused and existing in matter.
    It is from mistaking the true end of art that many fall into
painting large pictures, supposing what is big must also be
great in art; whilst others, from an excess of vanity, give
their figures a gigantic proportion — highly improper in what
may be termed chamber pictures.                  Wrong or bad tastes de
light in things monstrous. The excess of Nero was shown,
in his ordering a picture of himself to be painted on cloth.
 1 20 feet high,     which was set up in the gardens of Marius;
in his golden palaces; and in his gildingTome fine statues*.
    The love and admiration of beauty is implanted in our na
 tures by the great First Cause, and we are carried to it by
 an impulse irresistible ; its influence is powerful ; it transports
 the fenses beyond what is usual, and, if its continuance be
 long, is accompanied with melancholy, and a silent sadness.

    Though the above is one of the effects caused by beauty,
 yet we wish to be understood as distinguishing between the
 satisfaction we feel upon contemplating any thine beautiful^
 of whatever kind it may be, and that passion of the mind
 arising from desire or lust.
    Many definitions of beauty have been attempted.                   Johnson
 calls   it "  that   assemblage      of   graces   or  proportion cf parts
 which pleases the eye." Locke, " a certain composition of
 colour and figure, causing delight to the beholder." A third,
 "  perfection.        The two former appear to come much nearer
 truth than the latter ; for, if beauty was perfection, the toad
 must be beautiful, it being equally perfect with the rest of
 creation.

    Fancy or opinion will go but a little way towards illufl ratings
a subject that seems to influence on Tome universal principle^
and to affect all persons, and at all times.
    It appears pretty generally admitted that beauty (or the
beautiful) is that which moves us with pleasure through the
fight or hearing, as by the eye we are delighted with pictures,
statues, or buildings; and in music, with the harmony of well
measured sounds ; also in poetry, with sentiment and mea
sure" : but as whatever is produced by nature or art is the ef
fect of a certain wisdom, hence it follows that wisdom be
comes one of its qualities, and the fascinating power of beauty
will appear to arise from an union the most delightful — wis
 dom and pleasure*; which will affect all persons, and at all
 times, and will equally apply to painting, statuary, poetry,
 ethics, and laws.
     We mull Hot consider apparent beauty as a simple idea, ot
 as existing in proportion, shape, softness, &c. only; one con
 stituent is colour, and, in a more abstract way, light and
 shade; for on the latter being well disposed depends much
 of the general good effect of the picture, as from a bad dis
 position of the Trght and dark a sine form may be defaced and
 broken.
     Many imagine the arts operate by imitating nature merely r
 the fact       is,
               they de not simply copy such objects as are seen*
 by the eyes, but, recurring to thole reasons from which the
 energy of nature subsists, add something where any thing             is
 wanting to the perfection of the whole. Those beautiful forms
 of the Greeks which happily exist among us are not imitations
 of any spectacle proper to the senses, but are the result of
              contemplation.      Phidias, when he fashioned his
    upiter, conceived the idea of the god such as he would ap

 captivates   the fenses. The Platonists believed our delight

•rose from its producing a recollection of those beautiful vi
sions we had enjoyed in a previous and more perfect state of
existence. Burke calls it       "  some quality in bodies acting
mechanically upon       the human    mind by the intervention of
the lenses."
    That   there   is a beauty superior to form and colour is un
questionable,     as light, which, though in itself formless, isa
source of form, and is perhaps the only thing visible : light
as life, its opposite is darkness and death.
     Ignorance of beauty and taste argues a defective anima
tion, whilst a wrong or bad one proceeds from a weakness
cf judgment: hence some mistake deformity for beauty, and
continue in that error through life.       The young artist should
¦therefore   learn as early as possible to avoid gross and vulgar
habits if he proposes to elevate the character of his works :
if his apostles appear as if strayed from Rag-fair, and his he
roes and princes possess the vulgar air of prize-fighters, they
can never be expected to interest 1beyond people of similar
habits, and will never attract the attention of those whose
sentiments are delicately just : coarse intelligence may sur
prise the unthinking, but will not satisfy the discerning.
     Mild, affable, and gentle, are qualities of beauty, and these
 we admire when we see them united (in temperance) with
the three principal signs of life — heat, motion, and voice j
 but excess of either destroys.
    There are three distinct characters of beauty, two of which
 may be considered as earthly ; as the common, which de
pends on fashion, and satisfies common sense ; the uncom
 mon, as selected by judgment; and the perfect, which, as
 before observed, subsists in imagination.
     If we diligently attend to the progress of -the arts in Greece,
 or after their revival in Italy, we shall observe three distinct
 periods : first, when they went no further than merely copy
ing an object; secondly, when they selected their object;
and lastly, which marks the ¦highest point of excellence,
 when they produced works of pure imagination.
     The beauty of the naked requires several qualities to its
 perfection; as, that the form be in proportion, and well
 fliaped ; that it possess a free and easy motion, and be of a
 sound and fresh colour.      The two latter will be treated of in
 their proper places, while here we shall content ourselves with
 offering the proportions found in De Piles, as some guide in
 the search of truth: besides, as the painter deals in fore
 shortening, they are not altogether of that importance as to
the statuary.

    The measures of the antient statues by Audran will be
 found highly useful, as they are accompanied with outlines
 of those the most distinguished for correctness.
    The proportions of children differ from the adult as follow :
 The child of two years old has about live heads in its whole
 length, three of which go to the upper part, and two to the
 lower : one of four or five years old, has near six heads ; and
 at fifteen or sixteen, seven heads are the proportion.
    In infants, the centre or middle part between the two ex
 tremities of the head and feet, is the navel ; in the adult it is
 the os pubis.
    It is the character of the man to be broadest on the shoul
 ders; the woman on the hips. This will be found to hold
good in the male and female in most of the animal race.
    It has been premised that the proportion of the figure
must vary according to the character, as what would suit an
Hercules would by no means agree with Apollo.
    By proportion, we wi(h to be understood a correspondence
and agreement of the measures of the parts between them
selves and with the whole.
    Much insrenious argument has been used by the author of
** The Sublime and
                       Beautiful'' to prove that proportion is not
the cause, or rather one of the causes, of beauty.       In his in
quiry     that  author  appears   to have  expected,  the  propor
tion of one animal being laid down, admitting it beautiful,
that it ought to serve as a general standard for the whole of
creation.      "Examine the head of a beautiful horse; finci
what proportion it bears to his body and to his limbs, and
what relation they have to each other ; and when you have
settled these proportions as a standard of beauty, then take a
dog or cat, or any other animal, and examine how far the
fame proportions between its head and its neck, between
                                P 4,                          those

*l8                        On Painting.
 those   and the body, and so on, are found to hold."          That
 they   differ in every animal  is beyond   all question,  but  that
 there is a general standard of proportion for each is equally
 unquestionable ; for, were there not some such standard, na
 ture would in time produce such a jumble of fliapes, that it
 would be impossible to distinguish an ox from a greyhound;
 to the confusion of all order and symmetry.         Besides, from
 the proportion laid down as rules of art, though an indifferent
 artist cannot insure beauty, yet he will be almost certain of
general character.
    The author before mentioned goes on to observe, with a
view to establish his point : " It seems amazing to me that
artists, if they are as well convinced, as they pretend to be,
that proportion is a principal cause of beauty, have not by
them at all times accurate measurements of all the beautiful
animals, to help them to proper proportions when they would
contrive any thing elegant, especially as they frequently assert
that it is from an observation of the beautiful in nature that
they direct their practice."    Those measures the artist has by
him as far as he can obtain them, the value of which is
known to him from their great utility. Even the vulgar
appear sensible of proportion ; hence the nick name of long
/banks, from those parts wanting the customary proportion.
The " smoothness" of the skin of a dropsical person will never
be pleasing, any more than that of a person over fat, from
the want of proportion, the parts appearing too thick for the
height.
    That smoothness in painting is not one of the causes of
beauty is apparent from the pictures of Vanderwerf, the ex
cess of which gives the flesh the appearance of ivory : be
sides, the smoothness must depend on the size of the picture
in a great degree. It is true, we sometimes fee a large picture
highly finished, and a small one crude and flight ; but such
a practice is contrary to common fense : large ones require a
boldness of handling, not a Jligbtnefs or indication of form
only; and small ones greater delicacy. It must also be evi
dent that the style of execution must be governed bv the na
ture of the subject : if it be dignified, the handling should be
bold, as what would add a grace to a low subject would de
tract from a great one, as much as a common and vulgar idea
would debase what is lofty-
    It is not a single sensible quality that can constitute an
object beautiful, but a combination of them, as we shall find
by a recapitulation of the foregoing remarks.
    We wish to be understood as confining ourselves to the

XXXVI.       Experiments and Observations on certain Stow and
    Metalline  Substances which at different Times are said to
    have fallen on the Earth ; also on various Kinds of Native
    Iron.       By   Edward Howard,                          Esq.         F.R.S.

                Examination           of    the Stone       from Benares.
        HIS      stone, as the Count de Bournon has already re
marked,         has the most distinguished characters. Indeed it is
the only one of the four, sufficiently perfect              may be         (if  I         al
lowed that expression) to be subjected to any thing approach
ing to regular analysis.
           a
   The crust, or external black covering,          the first substance
                                                                    is

                     ;
nitric acid, which was presently decomposed; but, owing
to  a strong adherence of some of the interior and earthy parts
of the stone,      did not disentangle the coating or metalline
                     it
part without     some   difficulty.     The acid being sufficiently
neutralized,   the  solution  was   passed through      filter, and        a              sa
turated to excess with ammonia.            An abundant precipitate
of oxide of iron was produced          and, when this oxide was fe-
                                                ;

St20                 Experiments and Observations
with pruffiate       of ammonia, it yielded a whitish precipitate,
inclining to     a    violet colour; and, by various properties, I
 was soon confirmed in the opinion that nickel was present.
 Since I shall have occasion more than once to treat of the
 triple compound, and since it has been only mentioned by
Mr. Hermstadt, it is necessary now to detail some of its di
 stinctive characters. The fame chemist informs us, that the
 three mineral acids, with ammonia, enter into similar com
binations with nickel; and I have observed that oxide of
nickel can be dissolved by nitrate and muriate of ammonia.
The muriate stems to take up the largest quantity. The co
lour of this salt is by no means uniform : it is sometimes grafs
green, violet, rose colour, inclining to purple, and I have seen
it almost colourless.    It seems to be purple, and to incline to
rose colour and violet, when all the oxide of nickel is not
united to both acid and alkali, but, from the deficiency of
salt, is held in solution by an excess of ammonia.         In this
cafe, evaporation, of course, precipitates the nickel in the state
of oxide, which is of a whitish green colour.
    The nickel cannot be precipitated from a perfectly formed
triple salt by any reagent I have tried, except by a pruffiate,
or a hydrogenized susphuret of ammonia.         Potash and lime,
as well as,I   presume, other bodies, standing in the order of
affinities before ammonia, decompose the salt ; but the nickel
is then continued in solution by the disengaged ammonia.
    As it may be imagined that I have occasionally met with
copper, when I describe a violet or purple ammoniacal solu
tion, it is right to observe, that to avoid this error, I have
either reduced the liquor to a neutral state, and endeavoured,
without success, to obtain from it a precipitate, with a solu
tion of sulphureted hydrogen gas ; or, by adding an acid to
flight excess, and immersing a piece of iron, I have not been
able to detect a trace of copper.      These, and many other
trials, when they do not appear to be made before the esti
mation of the quantities of nickel, have been constantly made
afterwards.
    But, to return to the incrustation or coating of the stone,
the decomposition of the nitric acid showed the presence of
matter at least nearly metallic, although not attractable;
and the examinations made of the liquor, from which the
iron was precipitated, ascertained the presence of nickel be-
vond dispute.     The difficulty of obtaining the coating of the
stone, either distinct from matter not belonging to       it,or in
sufficient quantity, induced me to relinquish the idea of at
tempting to give the proportions of its constituent parts.
    The tune being deprived of its covering, the shining par-

    tides irregularly             disseminated    next demand        examination.
    I  first examined the pyrites.               Their
                                             very loose texture made
    it. exceedingly difficult to collect   the weight of 16 grains,
    which      was however effected by the dexterity of the Count de
    Bournon.
         Idigested these, at a low heat, with weak muriatic acid ;
    which    acted gradually, and disengaged a trifling but sensible
    quantity of sulphureted hydrogen gas.      After several hours,
    1 found the acid discontinued its action.     The whole me
    talline part appeared in solution ; but sulphur and earthy
    particles were observable.    The sulphur, from its small spe
    cific gravity, was suspended through the solution ; whilst
    the earthy matter, which could not be separated by mecha
    nical means, was fortunately left at the bottom of the di
    gesting vessel.   I decanted off the solution, holding suspended
    the sulphur; and, by repeated washing, separated every
    thing belonging to. the pyrites from the insoluble earthy
    matter, the subtraction of which reduced the weight of real
    pyrites to 14 grains.    I next obtained the sulphur, by filtra
    tion. When it was as dry as I could make it, without fear
    of its being sublimed, its weight was two grains. To the
    filtrated liquor I added nitrate of barytes, by way of detecting
    any sulphuric acid which might have been present ; but no
     cloudiness ensued. I then separated, by sulphate of ammonia,
    the barytes thus added, and precipitated the iron with am
     monia.     The liquor, on the subsidence of oxide of iron, ap-
      eared of a violet purple colour: it contained nickel, which
    f   threw down with sulphureted hydrogen gas, there being
     already a sufficient excess of ammonia in the saline liquor to
     form an alkaline hydrogenized sulphuret. The oxide of iron,
     after ignition, weighed 15 grains ; and the sulphuret of
     nickel, reduced to an oxide, weighed, after the fame treat

     ment, something more than one grain.          The proportions of
     the substances contained in the pyrites of the stone from Be
     nares may therefore be considered nearly thus :

                                                                         phur

phur could not be reduced to the same state of dryness ia
which it existed when in combination with the iron 5 not to
fay that it was, in a small degree, volatilized with the hy
drogen gas disengaged during the solution.
    The weight of nickel is a mere estimation. We are not
yet sufficiently acquainted with that metal to speak of it with,
accuracy, except as to its presence.         Upon the whole, how
ever, it may be concluded, that these pyrites are of a very
particular nature; for, although Henkel has observed that
sulphur may be separated from pyrites by muriatic acid, it is
by no means the usual habitude of pyrites to be of such easy
decomposition.
   The other shining particles immediately seen, when the
internal structure ot the stone is exposed, are the malleable
iron. Before I state the examination of this iron, I must
remark, that preliminary experiments having shown me it
contained nickel, I treated several kinds of the most pure
irons I could obtain, with nitric acid ; and precipitated the
oxide from the metallic salt by ammonia.              The quantity of
oxide I obtained from ioo grains of iron was from 144 to
146. I may consequently inter, that 100 grains of pure iron
acquire, by such a process, 43 grains of oxygen ; and that,
whenever a metallic substance, supposed to be iron, does
not, under the fame circumstances, acquire the fame pro
portionate weight, something is either volatilized, or left in
solution.     Hence, when a metallic alloy of nickel and iron
presents   itself,  a judgment may, at least, be formed of the
quantity   of  nickel,    by the deficiency of weight in the preci
pitated   oxide  of  iron.
   This mode of treatment was not allowed me in the exami
nation of the coating of the stone, because it was impossible
to know in what state of oxidizement the iron existed.           But,
as the particles disseminated         through   the whole  mass    are
clearly   metallic,     a  very tolerable  idea  of the quantities of
nickel contained in them will be obtained, by noting the
quantity of oxide of iron separated, as above described.
25 grains of these metallic particles were therefore heated
with a quantity of nitric acid, much more than sufficient to
dissolve the whole.          Some .earthy matter, which, as in a
former cafe, was not separable by mechanical means, re
mained after a complete solution of the metal had been
effected.    This earthy matter, after being ignited, weighed
two grains.        The real matter of the present examination
was therefore reduced to 23 grains, and was in complete so
lution.    1 added ammonia         to a very sensible excess.    The
oxide of iron was thereby precipitated, and, being collected
                                                                  aud

          en Certain Stony and   Metalline SubJIaners.           32   J
and ignited, it weighed 24 grains ; whereas, according to
my experiments, 33 ¦ grains should have been produced from
the solution, had it contained nothing but iron.        I examined
the saline liquor, when free from ferruginous particles, aud
discovered it to be the triple salt of nickel.    Hence, allowing
for loss, the quantity of nickel may be estimated, by calculat
ing the quantity of iron contained in 24 grains of oxide.
Thus, if 145 grains of oxide contain 100 or iron, about i6J-
are contained in 24 of oxide.         This would suppose the 25
grains of alloy to consist of 16^ iron and 6' nickel ; which,
if the usual loss be added to the i6[- grains of iron, and de
 ducted from the nickel, may not be very remote from the
 truth.
     I (hall next examine the globular bodies, also irregularly di
 spersed throughout the stone.       A number of them were re
 duced to fine powder ; but nothing metallic could be sepa
 rated by the magnet.       As a preliminary experiment, I sought
 for pyrites, by digestion with muriatic acid ; but no hepatic
 smell was in the least perceivable, nor was white carbonate
 of lead at all altered by being held over the mixture. I there
 fore conclude these globular bodies do not envelope either
 iron or pyrites.     By way of analysis, I treated 100 grain*
 with potash, in a silver crucible ; and, after the usual applica
 tion of a red heat, separated as much silica as possible, by
  muriatic acid and evaporation.       The silica being collected on
  a filter, carbonate of potash was added to the filtrated liquor j
  by which a precipitate almost wholly ferruginous was pro
  duced. This' precipitate was collected in the common way ;
  then boiled with potash, to extract alumina; and, by super
  saturating the alkaline liquor with muriatic acid, and preci
  pitating by carbonate of ammonia, an earth was gathered,
  which I afterwards found to be partly, if not entirely, sili
  ceous. After redissolving, in muriatic acid, the portion of the
  ferruginous matter rejected by the potash, T precipitated by am
  monia, what I took to be entirely oxide of iron ; but, after
  igniting it,   and again attempting to redrssolve the whole in
  muriatic acid, more silica was left.        The non-existence of
  lime was proved,    by  the addition of carbonate of ammonia,
  immediately after the fame alkali, pure, had thrown down
  whatI     took wholly for oxide of iron.  I     had now obtained
   every thing in the subject of my analysis,       except magnesia
   and nickel.     The former, and a   trace of the latter, were held
   by carbonic acid in the liquor, from which the ferruginous
   precipitate was, in the first' instance, thrown down    by   carbo
   nate of potash; and the latter was found in the last-named
   muriate of ammonia.     1   disengaged the magnesia,    by  the as
                                                                sistance

       Under all circumstances,          I  am induced to state the pro
  portions     of constituent    parts  thus  :

      The   excess of weight, instead of the usual loss, is owing to
  the   difference    of oxidizement of the iron, in the stone and in
  the   result  of  the  analysis ; which will be found to be the cafe
  in   all analyses   of  these substances ; indeed it is always neces
  sary to reduce the oxide to the red state, as being the only
 one to be depended upon.              To avoid future repetition, I shall
  also observe, first, that by preliminary experiments I could
  not detect any other substance than those mentioned.                     Se
 condly,      that   the  earth  obtained   as  alumina      appeared   to me
 to be mostly, if not entirely, siliceous; because, after it had
 been ignited, and again treated with potash and muriatic
 acid, I found it was very nearly all precipitated by evapora
 tion. Thirdly, I examined, and judged of, the silica col
 lected from the oxide of iron, in the Tame way.                   Fourthly,
the weight of the magnesia is given, not immediately, as ob
tained by evaporation, but after a subsequent solution in an
acid, and precipitation by potash.              And, fifthly, the propor
tions are taken from the mean of two analyses.
      Nothing remains to be examined, of the stone from Be
nares, except the earthy matter, forming a cement or ma
trix for the substances already examined,                too grains of thi9
matter were, by mechanical means, separated as perfectly as
possible, from the pyrites, iron, and globular bodies, and ana

  X. HE pores are small apertures formed in the membranes ;
they favour evaporation, absorption, and the motion of the
fluids.     There are three kinds of them.
     1st, The insensible pores. — These are apertures which can
 not be perceived by the eye even when assisted by the most
 powerful microscopes. Effects, however, do not permit us to
doubt of their existence. Every vegetable tissue is full of them,
 as is proved by insensible transpiration.       What shows at the
 fame time their extreme fineness isthephænomenon exhibited
 by an apple, or any other pulpy fruit, when placed below the
 receiver of an air-pump : the highly dilated air escapes only
 by bursting the skin.
    2d, The elongated pores. — These have been observed by se
 veral naturalists, and particularly Decandolle, who gave them
 the name of cortical pores.         I shall endeavour to complete
 his description, by uniting      under  the same point of view his
 observations and those which I have since made myself.          For
 a knowledge of the principal facts I am indebted to his re
 searches; but, as he considered this subject rather in a phvsical
 than an anatomical light, his labour does not supersede the
 necessity of publishing mine.
    The elongated pores exist only in the epidermis of the her
 baceous parts exposed to the air and the light. If the exterior
 membrane of the vegetable be skilfully removed, and if you
 then'examine it with a microscope, you will see the interior
 fides of the epidermis still adhering, and which form as it were
 a hexagonal net- work ; but here and there instead of a hexagon
 you will observe an ellipse, and the part of the epidermis cir
 cumscribed by that elliptical area is cleft in a longitudinal di
 rection : the aperture is sometimes free, and sometimes ob
 structed : the latter case, in my opinion, arises from the lips
 of the pore, longer than is necessary to shut the aperture, being
 applied one to the other, and intercepting the light. The elon
 gated pores are found commonly in the stems, the branches,
 the leaves, the bracteæ, and even the herbaceous pericarpia. In
 herbaceous plants the two surfaces of the leaves are covered
 with pores; in the fat plants they are less numerous than in
 the other vegetables.      In trees and shrubs the inferior surface
 only is in general pierced with these pores. The stems when
                                                                they

they become ligneous are destitute of them. These pores serve
 for the sensible and insensible transpiration and for the ab
sorption of the fluids.   They each correspond to a small cell,
which, according as the air is moister than the cellular tissue,
or the cellular tissue than the air, absorbs the fluids dispersed
throughout the atmosphere, or throws off those which the ve
getable contains.     When the parts become stiff, and the li
quors contained in the vegetable have no longer the fame
fluidity, these cells become silled with thick gum and resin ;
which not being able to escape through the pores, nor to re*
turn into general circulation, become entirely hard; and are
at length thrown out, when the state of the vegetable, by not
permitting tjie epidermis to dilate itself further, forces it to
burst.
  3d, The glandular pores. — These are apertures bordered
with thick opake and unequal rolls. These pores serve for the
movement and communication of the fluids in the interior of
the vegetable.  They are observed sometimes indeed in the
epidermis, but this cafe is exceedingly rare.     There are two
kinds of glandular pores, the small and the large. The former
are excessively small. To the most powerful microscopes they
appear only like the small holes made in a sheet of paper with
the point of a needle: sometimes they are scattered, and few in
number; at other times they are very numerous, and disposed
in regular series, always accordingto the breadth, and never ac
cording to the length of the tissue. The large glandular pores
are only a modification of them : one might even suppose that
the union of the small pores of one series produces the large
ones, the direction of which is the fame as that of the series.
The reader must here call to mind what I have already said
of the porous tubes, the false trachcæ, and even the tracheae.
There are some very striking relations between these different
tubes, and the plan of nature is not equivocal.

                        Of   the   Epidermis.
   This name is given to the exterior membrane formed by
fidesof the outer cells; or rather the epidermis is only the
term of the cellular tissue itself.
  To   relate every thing that authors have said on this mem
brane,   would sill a volume.        No part in the organization of
plants has   given  rife  to more   researches, nor perhaps has led
into more    errors.     The  first  faultis,  to have compared it
                  to the epidermis of animals. When this
without restriction
idea was once adopted, every thing else was considered as
analogous. The epidermis, said some writers, exists in all or-
          5                                           ganized

  ganised beings ; it covers the nascent embryo,          and the indi
  vidual which has arrived at the state of decrepitude ; it fol
  lows all the sinuosities of bodies, penetrates into their cavities,
  and protects the most delicate parts : thus in animals, after
  enveloping all the external parts, comprehending even the
  globe of the eye, it is seen falling back on the lips, penetrat
  ing into the intestinal canal, into the nostrils, and the au
 ditory passage ; and in plants, it covers the stems, branches,
 leaves, flowers and fruits.      The epidermis (add they) is not
 similar in every part of the fame being : sometimes it is exceed
 ingly fine, and sometimes it assumes more consistence; but in
 alicases it is colourless and transparent.     If it appears white on
 the trunk of the birch-tree, and brown on the young branches,
 ash-gray on the plum-tree, red and argenteous on the cher
 ry-tree, green on the young shoots of the almond-tree, and
 ash-coloured on the old ones ; this difference depends merely
 on the colour of the substances it covers, in the fame manner
  as the white, black, and copper colour of the white, negro or
 caffre depend on the colour of the mucous body.             By follow
 ing  this comparison,     a new  point  of  similitude   is thought to
be observed in thedilatability of the epidermis of animate and
 plants : it yields to all development, and extends in propor
tion as the being grows : it embraces only a small surface in
the foetus of the animal, but it dilates insensibly and covers
 a much greater surface when the animal attains to its utmost
growth.      It is thus that the epidermis which covers the feeds
of plants dilates and yields to the increase of the fruit, and
that the epidermis which covers the embryo yields also to the
increase of trees.       The extension of this membrane will be
found to be prodigious, when we consider what the gourd was
before its flower withered, and what the oak was when con
cealed in the acorn.        But, as there are certain animals the
old epidermis of which detaches itself, and at the end of a
certain time gives place to another; in the fame manner there
are certain vegetables which throw off their epidermis in or
der to assume a new one.         It is observed that the epidermis
of the trunk and branches of the plane-tree detaches itself in
scrolls like that of oviparous quadrupeds.*
    These comparisons, no doubt ingenious, are far from being
exact in every point.         It may even be said that they are
founded on imperfect observations.          To be convinced of this,
it will be sufficient to reflect on the definition we have given
of the epidermis of vegetables.         This membrane is nothing
but the exterior union of the cells of the circumference, and
differs from the membranes which form the other fides only
by the changes occasioned by its position.           If it is less trans-

parent, drier and firmer, it is because it is continually ex
posed to the influence of the light and the air, and to the
contact of all those bodies which float in the atmosphere :
but it is not in reality a distinct part; and it may be said,
strictly speaking, that vegetables have no organ analogous
to the epidermis of animals.      When vegetables grow large,
the exterior membrane seems to dilate ; but if this membrane
becomes extended, it is because the number of the cells is
multiplied at the circumference as at the exterior, and that
consequently the sides which compose it are multiplied in
proportion, and increase its capacity.
    One objection -remftins to be combated.       It may here be
said, Why is it so easy in the spring time to detach the epi
dermis from the young branches, if it does not really form a
distinct organ ? This may be explained in the following
manner: — All causes which have an external action on the
vegetable alter its surface, and detach from it the interior
parts: but this separation becomes more apparent when the
vegetation is more vigorous, and when the fluids moisten the
 cellular tissue, and sill the tubes; for, as the disorganized
surface cannot then develop itself with the rest, it ceases to
adhere, and often comes off in fragments, or is insensibly
 destroyed.    This is exactly what takes plaoe in the spring.
    In a word, this exterior stratum, which so many circum
stances tend to destroy, and which almost always exhibits
 traces of its disorganization,    is not composed of the last
 membrane only : the interior part of the cellular tissue is
 found in  it,   is
                as   evident in the plane tree, and still more in
 the green oak, which produces cork.        What has been here
 said is applicable only to the stems and branches, which do
 not die in the course of the year for in herbs, and the annual
                                  ;
 parts of ligneous plants, such as the leaves, flowers, bracteæ,
 &c. the surface does not detach itself from the rest of the
tissue.
   But the epidermis of vegetables has no resemblance to that
of animals and, though

                            it

when all the parts are soft and mucilaginous,        opposes at

protects it against all external causes which might hurt it.
Besides this, it serves for sensible and insensible transpiration,
and the absorption of gas, and of those fluids dispersed
throughout the atmosphere.         For this reason it is often
pierced with very visible pores : I fay often, because it is not
indeed a general law ; and the epidermis of pulpy fruits, for
example, has no apparent pores.         I must add, also, that
these fruits transpire very little, as Dr. Hales has shown in
his Vegetable Statics.

   All the parts of the vegetable have, at first, been mucilagi
nous and fluid; and it is only in the succession of time that
the tissue becomes firm and solid.      This state of feebleness is
visible in the feed.    The embryo at first is but a drop of mu
cilage, in which the most powerful microscopes discover no
organ. This substance has a vitreous appearance.               It is
speedily dried and destroyed by the contact os the air.        Pro
perly speaking, it is not a fluid; it is an organized substance,
similar to the white of an egg.       The organizing substance is
formed during the whole time of the increase, and it deposits
itself in that part of the tissue where the vegetable ought to
acquire the greatest vigour.       In the monocotyledons it is
placed   around   each  ligneous filament; in dicotyledons it is
at  the surface of the sou part of the wood and the medullary
canal.    Every day, therefore,     the ligneous filaments of the
cotyledons are seen to assume more volume, and the con
centric strata of the dicotyledons to be multiplied, and their
pith to be converted into wood. The organizing substance is
the more abundant, and is renewed with more facility as
the individual is younger and sounder ; as it is in a more
favourable situation, and as the season is better fitted for ve
getation. This substance insensibly assumes determinate forms,
whether the fluids develop in         it,   by
                                           their impulse, the cells
and the tubes, or whether an unknown              power acts in       it

 thicker.    To explain the two phænomena of lengthening
 and becoming thicker, the action of which is simultaneous,
 we must acknowledge that the expansive force acting in the
 membranous tissue newly created is modified by the nature
 of the tissue itself. It is composed, as we have already seen,
 of two organic elements, one of which is cellular tissue,
 formed of the cells, whose diameter is nearly equal in every
 direction ; the other is the tubular tissue, formed of the small
 and large tubes contiguous to each other.          Let us suppose,
 for a moment, that the fluids imbibed by the vegetable are
 the cause of this dissimilarity in the tissue. We may do so the
 more, as this system is not void of probability.        By way of
 example,    let us employ   the embryo  : let us take the feed be
 fore fecundation : it is attached to the mother plant by the
 umbilical cord, the organization of which no doubt varies
 according to the species.      By the help of the vessels which
 unite this organ to the feed, the fluids penetrate into the or
 ganizing substance ; and their impulse being determined by
 the canals which afford them a passage, they then trace out
 the route which the fluids will afterwards pursue, and deter
 mine the order of the future developments. Being vigo-
 roufly pushed in different points, which vary according to the
 species, they open the longitudinal tubes, and then filter
 flowly through their fides, deposit themselves in the organiz
 ing substance, and favour the development of the cells. In
 the first cafe, the fluids are pushed by the force which gives
 motion to the sap j in the second case, they issue forth and
 penetrate the organizing substance only, because they tend to
 assume an equilibrium.       These two forces, balanced by each
 other, produce a multitude of intermediate shades between
 the longitudinal tubes and the perfect cellular tissue.       But
 this theory is still far from explaining the phænomena of ve
getable organization.       There doubtless exist a thousand other
 physical causes, the influence of which cannot be calculated;
 and above all these causes ought to be placed the organizing
power, the principle of which is totally unknown to us.
    However, the cells and tubes being once formed, they in
 crease till the inspissation and induration of the membranes
present an obstacle to their development.       During the growth
of the membranous tissue, the fluids carried into the tubes,
by several forces combined, determine the direction of the
elongation by the impulse which they give to the organic
moleculæ.       But the cells suffer themselves to be penetrated
by the fluids only in a flow manner; and, being subjected
to no force wnich determines their development in one di
rection rather than in another, they grow and dilate them

 cells grew equal in number to the tabes, that the cells ought
to serve more for extending the thickness than the length of
the vegetable, and that the inverse would be the case with the
tubes; but when the latter are greatly multiplied, their
number compensates for the small thickness which each has,
and they then contribute no less than the cells to the sen
sible thickening of the vegetable.          Nay more, the mass of
the tubes is continually increased in trees, while the cells are
not multiplied in the fame proportion.           In a word, several
other causes, which I shall explain hereafter, contribute to
disorganize them, and even to transform them into tubes,
so that at the end of a certain time the mass of the latter is
far superior to that os the cells*

    THE apparatus I used for this purpose consisted of a gold
leaf electrometer (hung in a phial, which had had the bot
tom cut off, that a conducting communication might be
made between two flips of tinfoil, which were stuck on the
inside of the phial, and the earth,) and a tin dish made in the
form of the fiustum of a cone. The top diameter of it is
about a inches ; the bottom diameter is about         ii inch, and
its depth is about \ inch. This dish, about half still of water,
is placed on the electrometer, and the red-hot substances
dropped into it from a pair of tongs, at 3 or 4 inches above it.
 (See Fig. a. PI. V.)      In relating the experiments I (hall put
P. and N. to denote the two states, commonly denominated
positive and negative.
    1. Cinder of pit-coal about the size of a walnut, dropped
into the water, made the electrometer diverge N. This was
repeated five times with the fame result.      Sometimes the gold
leaf would beat against the side of the bottle four or five
                                 Q 3                         times.

 23  i               Experiments   on  EleBriclty
  times.    I  next made the electrometer diverge P. with an ex
  cited glass-tube, and while it was divergent dropped a hot
  cinder into the water : it immediately closed, and opened
  again N. The electrometer was then made N. with excited
  wax, and a cinder dropped into the water made the electro
  meter open wider, and strike the side of the bottle.
      3. I made fourteen similar trials with coals of burnt wood,
  but could not find that any electricity was produced.
     3. In sixteen trials with tobacco-pipe the electrometer di
 verged N. eleven times, and five times it did not diverge at
  all.   In five out of the eleven, after the electrometer had di
 verged, it closed again without touching the fides of the
  bottle; but not so much as to lose all its divergence.
     4. In twenty-four trials with common white marble, the
 electrometer diverged P. twelve times, and ten times the gold
 leaf beat the fides of the bottle so violently, that I could not
 determine which state was produced ; (but, because it was P.
 in all those wlien it could be determined, I suppose it was so
 in those that could not) and twice it did not diverge at all : the
 pieces in these two wer,e very small.
     5. In twelve trials with mother of pearl, (sub as common
 pearl buttons are made of) the electrometer diverged P.
 seven times.      Three times I could not determine for the
 violent beating of the gold-leaf against the tides of the bottles
 and twice, when the pieces were very small and not very hot,
 the electrometer became slightly N. It is probable there
were some small fragments of cinder thrown into the water
with the pearl; for it was heated in a common sire, and
taken out with a small pair of tongs.
     6. In eight trials with common white coral, the electro-         .
meter diverged P. every time.
     7. n six trials with oyster-shells, the electrometer diverged
P. five times, and once it did not diverge at all : the piece
was not hot enough to raise much vapour.
    8. 1 made thirty-one trials with periwinkle-shells ; and in
the first seventeen trials the electrometer diverged P. six times,
five times N., and three times it did not diverge at all ; and
twice it diverged and closed again directly, before I could
determine which state was produced.            In the other fourteen
trials it diverged P. everv time.         It is to be observed, that
the shells used in the first seventeen trials were as they were
when the fisli was boiled and failed in them ; they were
therefore foul with fait, &c., and also had their outside
skins on : but in the fourteen last trials the shells were such
as had been burnt,         and thrown into water while           red-
hot, before they     were  made  hot  for  the  experiment,  and   by
                                                                 this

this treatment they were cleansed from their skins and other
foulnesses.
    9. In six trials with unprepared muscle-shells, the electro
meter diverged P. three times, onceN.; once the gold leaf
beat the sides of the bottle so violently, that I could not de
termine; and once it did not diverge at all.         As these shells
were in the fame state as the periwinkle-shells were in the
first seventeen trials with them, I therefore suppose the dis
agreement to arise from the same cause.
    to. In nine trials with chalk, I could not find that there
was any electricity produced.
    11. In twelve trials with bones, I could not find that there
was any electricity produced.
    12. In eight trials with gravel-stones, the electrometer
diverged     N. fix times, and twice the gold-leaf beat the
fides of the bottle so violently, that 1 could not determine
which    state was  produced.
    13. In five trials with clinkers, the electrometer diverged
N. very gradually every time.
    T4. In eight trials with small pieces of iron, the electro
meter diverged N. six time?, and twice not at all.
     15. In six trials with some rusty nails (that had lain in the

carefully washed the dirt, &c), the electrometer diverged
N. four times, and twice it did not diverge at all. Seeing
this rusty iron did not produce P., agreeably to Cavallo's
 experiment, 'I suspected that, notwithstanding all my care,
 the nails were not free from foulness.        I next procured some
flakes of    rust which    had fallen from  an   old anchor, which
lies in Perry's     dock -yard  at  Blackwall;   and supposing these
 flakes to be pure rust, I expected to find the electrometer
 diverge P., but in seven trials it was N- every time.

 could determine which state was produced.

diverged N both times.

XXXIX.         Experiments and Observations        on  tie ManusaBure
     of Malleable Iron direSlysrom        the Ore.    BjD. MtJSHETj
     Esq. os the Calder Iron Works *.
 I    N a former communication I took occasion to remark
that a variety of processes had been followed out, endeavour
ing to form a good quality of bar iron with coak-pigs and
pit-coal; but as these had been attended with little or no
 alteration of principle, the results had been nearly similar.
In no cafe has an uniform quality of bar iron been produced,
 able to cope for all uses with the superior marks of Sweden
and Russia.
     At this day, assisted by a variety of facts chemical and phi
 losophical, we yet remain in comparative ignorance of what
 constitutes the real difference in point of quality betwixt home
 made iron and that imported from foreign markets. We
 acknowledge with pain and humiliation our dependence on
 other countries for our steel-iron, and it is with regret that
 we fee every industrious exertion made to obviate this depen
 dence foiled by the nature of our fuel, or the defective qua
 lities of our ores.
      Those who have voluntarily made an offer of their time
  and abilities for the service of their country, in promoting
  a thorough knowledge of the principles of our manufactures,
 could not engage in a subject fraught with more important
                      f  Communicated   by the Author.
                                                                  con

             to   ManufaQuK of Malleable Iron.
                  the                                  435
consequences.   An acurate chemical analysis of the various
states and qualities of British manufactured iron, accom
panied by a similar development of the component parts of
the foreign fabrics, would prove an interesting contrast, and
could not fail ultimately of producing infinite advantage to
that department of labour.
    I  (hall not, at present, enter into an investigation of the
probable reasons which constitute this difference, but con
fine myself to a succinct account of several processes in which
I  have obtained malleable iron, often superior to the common
run of British manufacture.            In contemplating these mani
pulations followed out in the large way, I uniformly found
that, although some fabrics possessed comparative excellence,
Vet that all were deficient in obtaining a quality of iron equal
in appearance and fracture to the foreign.
    In all these processes it was evident that if the contact of
pit-coal, considered as a more impure fuel than wood, was
hurtful to the quality of the iron, then all our bar-iron
would be so injured, as all of it is manufactured either in
contact with such fuel, or the flame of              it,  or both.    The
point therefore wished to be gained was the making of bar-
iron without bringing the metal, while in fusion, in contact
either with the flame of pit-coal, or with the ignited coaks.
My first crude attempt was in 1794 with crucibles and roasted
ironstone.   I       conceived that   by    introducing just as much
charcoal of wood as would remove the oxygen of the ore,
that malleable iron would be the result.                 Experiment, in
 some measure, justified this conjecture: but              awant of uni
formity in the result proved the fallacy of this mode of ope
 rating.     When the temperature was moderately raised,              I
 sound    the  iron partially separated, and, in     a    malleable state,
 entangled amongst the        earths of  the  ore:   but, when a    higher
 degree    of   heat  was brought on,     the   greatest part of the iron
 was found precipitated in the form of button.
                                             a               The iron in
 this  state  was  malleable :   but so  excessively   red-short  as to be
 incapable of drawing        at any  made    of heat   beyond faint red.
     In varying these experiments, and using greater propor
                                                      a
 tion of charcoal than usual,    I    was surprised to find, that after
a   long and violent heat no part of the iron had entered into
 fusion.     The pieces of iron-stone were firmly connected to
 gether, possessed of the original acuteness of angle and frac
 ture. Their appearance and surface was dark and metallic,
 and, upon attempting to part them,          I      found them attached
 to each other      by   a
                            species of metallic fibre, which twisted
 repeatedly before breaking.         This was    a   species of welding
                                                                      I
 had never before witnessed.       I      found the whole mass suffi
                                                                   ciently

ciently metallic upon the surface to receive a considerable de»
gree of polish from a file.    The interior of each piece, from
the want of a sufficient dose of heat, remained in a soft, easily
pulverised form, perfectly magnetic, and burning with great
rapidity when strewed in the name.
   The apparent advantages which seemed to result from this
chance discovery were sufficient to induce me to perform,
during the course of three or four years, several hundred ex
periments.     In the prosecution of this subject, I soon aban
doned the use of iron-stones.     It was found requisite to use
them in a roasted state ; and even afterwards, when heated in
contact with charcoal for three or four days, it was with the
greatest difficulty that the process of malleability could be
made to penetrate to the centre without a general and pre
mature fusion, which was always carefully to be avoided.
"When raw iron-stone was used, it was difficult to pre
vent it from entering into fusion, and separating its iron in
the state of minute globules of crude iron.        Having thus
satisfied myself of the precarious results obtained in this pro
cess by the use of iron-stones, I had recourse to Cumberland
ore, as a fit substitute, and my expectations in it were not
disappointed.
   I shall simply state the methods which I ultimately followed
to produce bar-iron in this process with the use of pit-coal
and charcoal of wood.        Having prepared a small furnace
with an oblong cavity, surrounded with a sufficient number
of holes to admit the heat all round, I introduced 50 to 60 lbs.
of Cumberland iron ore reduced to pieces of nearly 3 ounces
weight each. This was mixed with a sufficient quantity of
clean dust produced in the charring of coal. The ore was
surrounded by a layer nearly %\ inches thick, and this last of
all was covered with a layer of moist sand a to 3 inches thick.
The sire was maintained at a temperature of nearly ioo° of
Wedgewood for 36 to 48 hours, according to circumstances.
It was then allowed to cool gradually. Upon examination,
the pieces of ore were frequently found attached lo each
other so firmly as to require considerable force to part them.
They filed, and were, when the cementation was continued
long enough, malleable throughout. The ore, thus prepared,
was piled up in a flat broad {hallow crucible with a loose
top, and placed in a furnace heated with the flame of pit-
coal.    A welding heat was brought on the whole mass,
which was then carried to the hammer : the first blow de
stroyed the crucible, and the ore was sliingled into a bloom at
the first heat.
   In this way excellent iron was produced. Its fracture was
                                                            light

               on the Manufa&urt of Malleable Iron.              337
light blue, fibrous,      and tearing considerably in groups.      It
possessed,    however, a flight degree of red-shortness when
very highly heated.         It formed with equal facility horse
shoes and nails of the most delicate structure.        The produce
of the raw ore never exceeded 47 per cent., and commonly
was from 43 to 45.            Iron of a more pure fracture was
obtained by piling the ore upon a flat cake of fire-clay or
 sand-stone. As the welding heat penetrated the mass, part
of the earth and unmetallizeu particles of iron were reduced
into fusion, and run off into the furnace. The produce,
 however, in iron was reduced as low as 37 per cent. This
 reduction of metal, no doubt, arose from the greater surface
 exposed in this way than when the balling pot was used.
     To obviate this, and, at the fame time, insure an equal
 quality of iron, the piles were heated in the fame furnace
 with the gas of coaks, and the flue of the furnace nearly shut
 up ; so that the circulation of air was much smaller, and the
 heat, though equally great, yet more attenuated.         This pro
 duced a better quality of iron than any of the former ways,
 but at a greater expense of fuel.
     However suitable this iron was for the common uses of the
 smithy, it was found to form but a very indifferent quality of
 steel by cementation.       The whole of it became in tome de
 gree laminated, and incapable of standing great fatigue ; and
 the red-shortness, which before faintly marked the Dar iron,
 was now considerably increased when in the state of steel.
     In varying this process of making bar iron, quantities of the
  prepared ore were thrown upon the top of a small finery
  fire, charged with soft coal coak, and funk to the bottom.
  The metallic mass was found connected, and so much puri
  fied as to afford iron of a clear fracture, but the produce was
  diminished to 28 and 30 per cent, from raw ore.
      The same ore, however, sunk in a small fire of wood char
  coal, yielded a very superior quality of the metal to any of
  the former.      In point of quality and fracture, it was deemed
  no way inferior to many of the best Swedifli marks.           Still,
  however, it must not be denied, that this iron formed com
  paratively but an inferior quality of steel.    In this state I left
  this process for making bar iron, and have not yet found
  time nor sufficient opportunity to resume it. Of late years I
  understand a process, somewhat similar, has been established
  near Whitehaven, in the neighbourhood of the Cumberland
  iron-mines, but abandoned, not because the quality of iron
   was inferior, but 1 believe from a want of œconomy in the
   proctfs itself.
     'A thousand unforeseen difficulties occur in striking out a
                                                                  new

 new line of manufacture, before a good quality of product is
 obtained.    These are seldom diminished, but often increased,
 in transferring it from the scale of experiment to that of ma
 nufacture.
    In the present process followed out at the bar-iron forges
in this country, the greatest drawback upon the profits and
 correctness   of the business is the immense loss of metal.
This is called waste, and it is generally believed that the more
the waste the better the quality of the resulting iron.     This
circumstance I conceive is owing to the following facts-—
the combustibility of the metal, the high temperature requi
site, and the tedious length of the process.      The puddling
process invented by Cortes avowed a degree of simplicity,
which promised to lessen the waste by diminishing the va
riety ot operations, and the length of the exposure.       Expe
rience however has proved, that, in general, what was gained
in weight was more than lost by the inferior quality of the
iron produced.
    With a view to produce a quality of iron from coak pig
equal or superior to what is obtained in the best processes
now in use, it occurred to me that an operation which would
unite the properties of the finery fire and of the puddling fur
nace would be productive of -a. good quality of iron, and with
little comparative loss. With this view a small furnace was
contrived, somewhat similar in shape to an iron-founder'9
air furnace. The depth of the grates below what is called
the bridge of the furnace was more in proportion.        A shal
low cavity was formed in the middle of the furnace with
sand, about two inches deep, fifteen inches long, and eight
broad. The furnace was heated to a bright white heat with
raw pit-coal : a small door was then opened, and nearly 84.1bs.
of fragments of while crude iron introduced. The grates of
the furnace were then charged with coaks, and a femifufing
heat brought on, and continued for ten hours after.      During
this operation the metal continued to boil, and discharge a
blue vapour, frequently accompanied with hissing explosions.
At last, when the metal exhibited no further signs of ebulli
tion, nor of fusion, the fire was allowed to die away. When
cold, I found the whole, without stirring or agitation, re
solved into a mass of malleable iron, which, even in this
state, was broken with great difficulty.    The lump, or plate,
was divided into three pieces, one of which was drawn into
a stout bar, and weighed i81bs.       The quality of this iron
was excellent for every purpose, steel-making excepted.       In
this process it disjoined, aud formed laminæ; which rendered
|t unfit for any steel purpose.     This experiment was fre-

cumstances not here necessary to be mentioned, I never ascer

what is experienced in the common processes.

Of such    Rules and Habits as may contribute to the Preserva
               tion of good Health and long L'J'e.
   If  persons were to live with the simplicity of ancient times,
it is probable that they would attain long life, without expe
riencing any material illness, merely by a proper attention to
air, exercise, clothing, and diet. But in the present state of
society, the great bulk of the community must follow, not a
natural, but an artificial mode of life, and thence are perpe
tually exposed lo various temptations, which they find it dif
ficult always to resist, and to dangers which they cannot al
ways avoid.     In luxurious times, therefore, persons in gene
ral cannot expect to live long, at least with any degree of sa
tisfaction, unless by great care, and by an attention to a
variety of minute particulars, which they either learn from
others, or acquire by their own experience. The mass of
useful facts and observations    thus accumulating every day,
and perisliing daily with those who had acquiredthem, must
be very great.      Unfortunately, hitherto, no individual has
taken the trouble of collecting them.          Such a collection
would certainly be a most acceptable offering to the public,

contributing to so useful a work, 1 (hall proceed to state such
observations as have been either communicated to me by
others *, or have occurred to myself on that interesting sub
ject.
                                                                                    The
    *   Among other communications I received from a friend in the coun
try,    a number      of rules of diet and regimen, w it ten in Latin as far back
 as the year 1648, in answer to the general question ; " By what means a
 " person might be enabled to prolong life to the latest period ?" The fol
 lowing is a literal translation of that Paper :
     A   person    will be enabled to prolong     life to the latest period,   by observ
  ing the following salutary rules.
     1.  The     stomach ought never to be over-loaded with food, otherwise
            the body will be rendered unfit for exertion.
     I. Moderation in exercise, food, drink, sleep, and venery.
     3. No fresh food should be taken, unless the preceding meal has been
             properly digested.
     4. The meals should not be uniform ; but supper always lighter than
             dinner.
     5. Excess in former meals must be corrected by a subsequent abstinence
     6. All food should be duly masticated before it be swallowed.
     7. The quantity of drink should always be proportioned to that of solid
             food.
     8. No drink sliould be taken until a due portion of solid food has been.
             swallowed.
     9. A variety of dishes ought not to be eaten at the fame time.
     10. It will be advisable to refrain from a meal (dinner) once a week,
             particularly when the body appears to require less food.
     II. Bodily exercise sliould be so managed once a day, as to excite the
             natural heat (glow) ; and before a meal.              The advantages re
             sulting from such practice arc thus described by Fulgkntius :
             '* Exercise,"
                               says he,
                                         " contributes to the preservation of human
             '* life; it
                          dissipates all superfluous humours of a plethoric habit;
             " it invigorates our faculties ; it is a gain of time ; the enemy of
             " idleness, the duty of the young, and the delight of the aged.
             "   For exercise disengages and expels, through the pores, all su-
             " perfluuus humours ; while .the greatest injuries may ensue from
             <• a contrary conduct : hence the Poet observes,             ' Ease is not to
             " be acquired unless it be combined with toil: for indolence is
             " generally attended with dissolution.' "

              of a dry and solid nature.
     11. Between meals, both solid and liquid food should be avoided.

   The particulars connected with food, clothing, habitation,
air, and exercise, are so universally known, and the prin«
ciples regarding each so fully established, that it is surely un
necessary to dwell upon them at any length.
   In regard to food, experience will point out those articles
which are best adapted for the constitution of each indivi
dual ; and there cannot be a better general rule than to ad
here to them as closely as possible.      It may be observed,
however, that people in general, especially those who do not
labour, eat much more than nature requires; that a little
abstinence or self-denial may often be or use, either to pre
vent or to cure disease * ; and at any rate, that none but
hard-working people, or those who are in the very prime of
life, or growing fast, or travelling about, should eat more
than one full meal each day.
  18. Violent exercise, shortly after a meal, ought never to be undertaken.
  19. When the body is in a languid state, all the limbs should be vigo
        rously stretched.
  30. Drink should never be taken on an empty stomach ; as, in that
        state, it cannot fail to prove exceedingly hurtful by agitating the
        nerves.    Galen fays, in the second Aphorism, 11,             If
                                                                   a hungry
        person drink wine before he eat, he will speedily be attacked with
        spasms and delirious symptoms.      Nor should wine be taken (ha
        bitually) after meals; because it unnaturally accelerates the di
        gestion, propels the food before it is properly digested, and lays
        the foundation of obstructions and putridity.
  XI. Wine should never be taken immoderately ; and it would be ad.
        visable, as much as possible, to abstain from its use, because it
        affects the brain :     hence, no person of a weak organization
        should venture to drink             it,
                                         unless    small quantities, or di

had reaped much benefit from it.

   As   to clothing, much must depend on situation and cli
mate ; but, on the whole, it is generally found a useful
practice to wear woollens next the (kin.          It is remarked in
many parts     of  Scotland,  that  since the  use  of flannel shirts
has been given up by the lower orders, the rheumatism,
and other diseases formerly unknown, have become very fre
quent, and are dailv increasing. In the West India Islands,
if care be taken to make the Troops wear flannel shirts, tftey
are likely to be exempted from various disorders, which other
wise would probably have attacked them.            Even the negroes
themselves,     I understand, prefer flannel to cotton or linen,
and find it a much more comfortable and useful dress. In re
gard to clothing suited to the climate of Great Britain, there is
reason to believe that we use furs much seldomer than we
ought to do.       Nothing can be more absurd than to consider
the use of fur as a mark of effeminacy, and on that account
to suppose that it is merely calculated for delicate women.
In the piercing cold to which we are often subjected, furs
might be worn with much advantage by the stoutest and
hardiest men.
    The nature of the house where any individual resides, is a
very important consideration.        Formerly they were very ill
fitted up, and were what would now be considered extremely
uncomfortable.       It was said of old, that no house was whole
some " where a dog could not get in under the door, or a
bird through the window."         There was then no use for ven
tilators.    The cafe is now much altered.        The art of finish
ing houses closely, and the management of fuel, have been
brought to such perfection, as greatly to exclude a free circu
lation of air, and to overheat that which the room contains.
From the great expense of building and fitting up houses, also,
 the apartments in them are in general much smaller and less
 lofty than they ought to be.      As it is impossible to make any
 great alteration in these particulars, more especially in the
metropolis, and in large towns, which contain ib large a pro
 portion of the population of the kingdom, the only remedies
 are, to ventilate the houses whenever the weather will admit
 of   it;and for the inhabitants of towns to be as much in the
open air, aud as frequently in the country, as circumstances
 will permit \.

    In regard to exercise, it cannot be too much recommended \
and as, from various circumstances, persons in large towns,
and engaged in various sedentary occupations, cannot take all
that exercise abroad that may be necessary for their health,
they ought as much as possible to accustom themselves to be
walking about even in their own house, instead of fitting so
much as is usually the case. This rule is peculiarly necessary
to be attended to bv literarv men ; and though such a practice
does not make up for the want of exercise abroad, yet it cer
tainly is the best substitute for it.
     But the principal object of anv extensive paper on this sub
ject should be, to point out those habits, or minute particu
 lars, which contribute to good health and old age.          We fre
 quently ice persons living luxuriously, and keeping even irre
 gular hours, without being much troubled with disease. It is
 not improbable, were the truth known, that this is owing to
 trifling attentions, the result of observation and experience,
 which prove of infinite service to them, and which might be
 of equal advantage to others, were they collected by some
 public-spirited individual, and universally disseminated.
     I believe there is no habit that contributes more to good
 health and good spirits, or rendersa man fitter for going through
 a great deafof business, than that of taking a sufficient quan
 tity of sleep, from fix to eight, and even nine hours, if nature
 requires it.    I understand that the late lord Mansfield fre
 quently inculcated the advantages to be derived from a rigid"
 adherence to such a system; and it is well known the quantity
 of business he went through, and the good health and good
 spirits he enjoyed tor a great number of vears.          To continue
 long in bed without sleeping, is weakening and injurious; but
 a person may take all the repose that nature requires, and will
 have time sufficient, during the remainder of the day, to go
 through all the neceflary ousinefs, and to enjoy all the real
 pleasures of life.
     It is generally supposed, that early rising is also essential to
 good health *. Without being an advocate for what are called
 fashionable hours, which are carried to so preposterous an ex
  cess, converting night into day, and dav into night, some doubts
 may be exprelled regarding the propriety of earning the op
 posite system to too great a height.         In antient times, when
  people depended almost entirely on the fun for light, they
 were under the necessity of rising with that luminary, and of
 going to bed when it disappeared.          Hence a prejudice arose
                * The old maxim was,
                     Early go to bed, and early rife,

 in favour of that practice ; but the case is greatly                   altered
 since the means of obtaining artificial light to lo great              an ex
 tent    have been discovered.         I question much, whether the
 morning air is so wholesome as many imagine.                    The fun must
 necessarily extract front the earth, when it first appears, a va
 riety of vapours, which strong constitutions may withstand,
 but which mult be injurious to weak ones : even in large
 towns, it is some time before the morning fogs arc dissipated.
 On the whole, late riling Cannot be approved of, but very early
 rising is not probably To essential for health as is commonly
 imagined.
     There is nothing that can tend more to long life than for a
 person to obtain a complete command of his paflions, and in
 particular to preserve his mind from being ruffled.                   Perhaps
 there is no maxim more likely to promote good health, than
 that of paying a proper attention to temper, temperance, and
jhep. By good temper, the mind is preserved from disease;
 and by temperance,            the body ; and both the mind and the
 body,    when    exhausted, are again recruited and restored to their
 former strength 0y a sufficient quantity of repose.
      In so variable a climate as that of the British Isles, it is of
  the utmost importance to contrive the most effectual means of
  preventing various disorders arising from checked perspiration,
  as colds, coughs, consumptions, fore throats, rheumatisms,
  &c. by which lo many thousands are cut off every year. The
  following hints are the result of some attention to that parti
  cular subject.
      t. It is generally acknowledged that the use of flannel next
  the skin is a great preservative against catching cold, and all
  the disorder? connected therewith.              This is a point so well
  established that it is unnecessary to dwell upon it*.
      2. There is not a better mode of being able to withstand
  the variableness of our climate, than to adopt the Spanish
             of wearing an under waistcoat made of thin fhamoy
   eather, which tends to preserve the body in an equal tempera
  !>racticc
  ture. This is particularly useful when persons are in a weak
  state after indisposition, or are likely to be affected with rheu
  matic complaints.
     3. Many persons are apt to be frequently attacked by com
  plaints in the throat, which may, in general, be prevented by
  attention to the following circumstances.                It is usual for per
 sons to make use of hot water for thaving, the consequence of

  great perspiration in bed ; but this is easily obviated by wearing a flannel
 wltcoat with buttons at the shoulders, so that it can be taken off at any
 fime without inconvenience.

 also be applied with much advantage to the outside of the
 throat.

than to make this use of it.
    The next particulars which         may be proper to advert to,
                                          it
are the skin, the teeth, and the eyes.
  It      well known that the health of the individual depends
         is
much upon the state of the skin, and that good health can
never be enjoyed unless when            performs its functions pro
                                          it

in clean state.
     a                The attention paid to this subject       antientby
lawgivers, and founders of religious systems, cannot be too
much recommended. They actually madethe keeping the body
clean,       frequent washing, part of the sacred duty of each
              by
individual.     The use of linen, and the custom of throwing off
the dress of the day, when going to sleep, (which              not theis
cafe with Asiatic, but fortunately        now so general with Euro

the practice      too much neglected in this country
                    is                                          and in;

   to be credited, how few pay such attention to their teeth as
   will preserve them in any tolerable order for a lung period.
   This     is the more surprising, as a good set of teeth is so orna
   mental, so essential for distinct pronunciation, and so necessa
   ry for a proper mastication of the food. In a paper of this de
  scription, it is only possible to touch upon this important sub
  ject. It may be proper, however, to observe a common mis
   take, that tooth-brushes, as they are called, are intended for
   rubbing the teeth, whereas their proper business is to rub the
  gums, and to excite a circulation there.                It is diseases in the
  gums that principally occasion the destruction of the teeth,
  and preserving the one in good order materially contributes to
   the safety     of the other*.
       The little attention that is shown to the preservation of the
  eyes, is fully as blameable as the negligence above alluded to
  in regard to the teeth. Any imperfection in the fight is such a
  calamity, that every person of common prudence would cer
  tainly wish to prevent it bv every possible means ; and there is
  certainly no mode more likely to be effectual, than that of
  bathing them night and morning in a bason of cold water,
  and opening the eyes in the water. Any disorder that attacks
  the eye itself, from the pain and uneasiness which it occasions,
  must be attended to.           But the eye-lids become often diseased
 and ulcerated ; and though there are various ointments which
 would cure this disorder at the commencement, yet, as it is
 not very bad or troublesome, people are too apt to put it off
 from time to time, until the eye itself is affected, and a cure
    ecomes hardly practicable.
       It is imagined by some, that taking of snuff is a useful prac
 tice in preventing disorders in the head, and in the eyes in
 particular; and in the list subjoined of the In-pensioners in
 Greenwich Hospital who have exceeded the age of 80 years,
 a very large proportion use tobacco in some (hape or other.
 The taking os snuff is certainly refrefliing, and loaded as it is
 with a heavy tax, it still is a cheap luxury for the poor; and
 the evidence from Greenwich Hospital sufficiently proves, that
 the use of snuff and tobacco, though not lo be universally re
 commended, yet is not incompatible with long life.
      In a book published on the subject of longevity f, some cir
cumstances are occasionally mentioned regarding the food and
habits of persons who lived to a great age.                    Among these,
the following seem to be the best entitled to notice; " 1. John

Hussey, osSydenham, in Kent, who lived to be 116. For
above 50 years his breakfast was balm tea sweetened with
honey, and pudding for dinner, by the use of which he ac
quired long and regular health.             3. Judith Bannister, aged
108 She lived upon biscuit and apples, with milk and water,
the last 60 years of her life. 3. Jahn Riva, of Venice, aged
116, always chewed citron-bark.            4. Elizabeth Macpherion,
of the county of Caithness, aged 716. Her diet was butter
milk and greens.         5. Francis Confit, of Burythorpe, near
Malton,     Yorkfliirc,   aged 150, occasionally ate a raw new-laid
egg. 6 Fluellyn        Price,  of Glamorgan, aged 108. Herb teas
were his breakfast,     meat   plainly dressed his dinner, and instead
of a supper     he refreshed   himself with a pipe of tobacco. 7.
Val. Cateby,     of  Preston,  near Hull, aged 116. His diet for the
last twenty years     was   milk  and biscuit.    8. Edward Drinker,
of Philadelphia, aged 103. He lived on very solid food, drank
tea in the afternoon, but ate no supper.            9. Lewis Morgan,
of Radnorshire, aged joi . He lived chieflv on vegetable diet,
and drank frequently of the famous rock water of Llandrindod .
10. Mr. Smith, of Montgomeryshire, aged 103.                     He was
never known to drink any thing but buttermilk.               1 1. Willi
am Riddle, of Selkirk, in Scotland, aged n6.               For the last
two vears of his life, his chief subsistence was a little bread
infused in spirits and ale.       12. Honourable Mrs. Watkins, of
Glamorganshire, aged          110.    For the last 30 years stie sub-
fisted entiely on potatoes.          13. Rebecca Joseph, of Mon-
mouthfliire, aged 100.         Her chief subsistence, tor the last two.
years of her lite, was brown sugar and cold water. ) 4. Charles
Macklin, Esq. of London, aged 107. For the last 40 years
of his life, his principal beverage was white wine and water,
made pretty sweet; and after sic had lost his teeth, his food
               consisted offish, eggs, puddings, and spoon-meat,
frincipally
   laving  been   attacked bv a severe tit of the rheumatism, he
 discontinued the use of sheets, and slept in blankets. He used
 to be frequently rubbed all over with warm brandv or gin,
 (which seems to be a good practice for aged people,) and occa
 sionally steeped his feet in warm water.            It was his custom
 not to steep on a feather bed, but on a mattress, on a couch
 without curtains, placed in the centre of the room, upon which
 he reposed whenever he sound himself sleepy.            Instead of at
tending to regularity, he observed the dictates of nature, ate
when hungry, drank when thirsty, and slept when nature
seemed to require repose.
     Among practices which might be of service to aged peo
 ple, I sliould imagine that rubbing the bodv with oil would be
particularly useful.       It might tgnd to preserve the slein in a
                                                                     oft

 soft and healthy state, and to furnisli the body with that
 unctuous matter, which very old people seldom have to the
 extent that is necessary ; and hence those wrinkles which are
 so peculiar a characteristic of old age.
    I am also persuaded, that in regard to various disorders,
 particularly those with which the aged are apt to be afflic\ed,
 a great source of benefit still remains to be explored, in the
 practice of electricity, by the use of which, not through the
 medium of violent shocks, but by gradually diffusing that im
 portant fluid throughout the whole frame, the body is re
animated with fresli vigour, and rendered sitter to go through
its various functions with renewed spirit and strength.
    There is certainly nothing that would tend more to pre
serve health and longevity, than improvements in the medi
cal art, which, though it has made considerable progress in
some particular departments, yet continues deficient in many
others.     When it is considered the number of able men who
are employed in the medical profession, the importance of
the objects to which their attention is directed, and the mul
titude of cafes which are daily and even hourly coming un
der their review, one would think that hardlv a circumstance
could possibly happen that might not be foreseen and guarded
against.     Perhaps one mode of improving the art would be,
requiring all physicians to communicate to the College an ac
count ot any cafe that seemed to throw light upon the mode
of curing anv particular disease. Honorary premiums might
be given to those who make any useful discovery ; and it is
to be hoped that the munificence of Parliament to Dr. Jen-
ner will show what may be expected by medical men who
make any improvement of real and essential importance.
    I (hall conclude with observing, that man has been com
pared, and with some truth, to a machine;         but he ought
not to be considered as a machine that wears out by mere
use, without the possibility of being repaired; but like one
whose movements may be improved, whose wheels, after
being disordered, may be again put into their former, and
           even an improved state, and whose frame may be

  On the Longevity     of the Pensioners in Greenwich Hospital.
   Being convinced that much light would be thrown on the
subjects of health and longevity, were accurate returns made
from hospitals aud other public institutions, of the diet, age,

and other particulars regarding the persons who resided in
them, 1 was thence led to apply to Greenwich and Chelsea
Hospitals for such information ; and it is with much pleasure
that I subjoin the following important facts with regard to
Greenwich Hospital, which Dr. Robertson, at the desire of
the respectable Mailer os that molt excellent institution,
(lord viscount Hood,) transmitted to me.
      shall insert the Tables as prepared by Dr. Robertson, and
shall offer such observations as may occur on the results to be
drawn from each of theni respectively.
                 Observations   on the annexed Table.
    Doctor Jameson, of Bloomsbury- place, has made the fol
lowing remarks on the Table :
    " Dr. Robertson ccrtainlv deserves much praise for his at
tention in transmitting so particular a (la lenient os the longe
vity ot Greenwich Hospital; and if something similar could
be procured from other public institutions in Great Britain
and Ireland, it would not be difficult to form an arrangement
of facts, that would afford important conclusions concerning
the lives of mankind.
    " The Table communicated by Dr. Robertson favours an
opinion, that the watery element is not unfriendly to the
human frame, especially when it is aided in advanced life by
the comforts of Greenwich Hospital.
    " The list of ninety-fix men in that Hospital still alive, in
extreme old age, is uncommonly great; and it appears from
the table, that there is one man living above a hundred years
old, and 13 above 90 years of age.
    " That the greatest number are natives of Scotlaud, and
 a large  proportion from Ireland.
    " That one half belonged to aged families, many of
whom had both parents very old.
    " That more than two thirds had been upwards of 20
 years in the king's service, and in various climates ;
    " That they were almost all married, and four of them
 after 80 years of age.
    " That they almost all used tobacco, and most of them
 acknowledged the habit of drinking freely.
    " That the parts of the human body which had most gene*
 rally failed, were the teeth.      Some of them had no teeth for
 30  vears,   and  14 only   had  good teeth.
    " That the organ      of vision was impaired in about one half,
 and the or«an of hearing in about a fifth part of them."
    As Dr. Robertson proposes publishing anew edition of his
interesting work on the Diseases incident to Seamen, it was

has very obligingly,   however, communicated the following
additional observations, connected with the subject of longe
vity in general.
   1. The number of In-pensioners being 2,410, and the
number of those who are from 80 years of age and upwards
being 96 ; the proportion of the aged to the whole is only as
£f less than T'T-
   2. Some use tobacco for particular complaints, which they
think are relieved by the use of    it,
                                      or use snuff; and the rest
say that they cannot do without it.
   3. John Moore (the oldest man in the house) says, that
he has had four new fore teeth within these five years; one
of which he has lost he knows not how. This        is   commonly
counted  a  great mark of old age.

number of persons above 80 years of age, in the Hospital.
   5.  The number of Out-pensioners        about 2,500, to whose
                                          is
ages  when   they were admitted, the number     of years they have
been on the list being added, it appears  there  are only 23 from
80 years of age and upwards    ;   asufficient proof of the great
attention paid to the health of the In-pensioners at this excel
lent institution.
   6. The number of ruptured men among the In-pensioners,
on the  3d  of May, was 161, or t't> the number being 2,410.

   The following observations have occurred to Dr. Jameson
•n the two preceding tables.
   That during the space of twenty years, the number of an
nual deaths was very similar, varying very little in any year,
or in any month of these years.           And as it appears no un
common incident occurred during that time to alter the natu
ral order, we have a tolerably certain estimate, which may be
said to be 303 annual deaths out of 3400 pensioners.
    That these men, who were mostly in advanced years, died
in greatest number in the three winter months, reckoning
December the first ; and in the smallest proportion, in the
three summer months, reckoning June the first, and that the
spring was more mortal than autumn.

 importance in the construction of chemical apparatus,
 stall make no apology for recommending to your readers a
 Jess expensive alteration in the air-holder of Mr. Watt, than
 that described by Mr. Pepys in your last number.           I contrived
 it upwards of two years since, and find it answers every purpose
 for which it was intended. A stop-cock, soldered to the shorter
 tube in the top of the gas-holder, and a rim sufficiently deep
 to permit the water to rise an inch above the stop-cock, will
 enable those fond of pneumatic experiments to transfer oxygen
 (or any other) gas with the utmost readiness to any vessel they
 please. (See Fig. 3. Plate V.) The stop-cock has no screw,
 the blow-pipe having a socket fitting the tube with sufficient
 accuracy to prevent the escape of air.         A perusal of the com
 munication of Mr. Pepys will render a more minute descrip
 tion unnecessary.      Those persons to whom expense is of no
 consequence     will most likely prefer that contrived by Mr.
 Pepys, which is in some respects, perhaps, more convenient
 than that of which I have sent you a sketch ; but of this every
 one must judge for himself.         1 remain, Yours, &c.

cellatus  bears in several respects to the      Phallus      impudicus

the arrangement of them all under one genus, although not
so considered by Linnæus,          and I have ventured to form ge

   For good figures of the C. cancellatus, Micheli may be re
ferred to, and for the two latter, Curtis's Fl. Lond. and Sower-
by's Englisli Fungi, called in both publications Phallus.
   I am not aware that any other Fungus will arrange with
the above three species, although some have been placed un
der the genus Phallus, by Linnæus and other botanists,
which have very little agreement with the P. impudicus and
P. caninus of those authors.

             is
   Let the wheel touch in G and G' two equally large and
solid inequalities of the road, and for the fore-wheels let the
angle GOG7 = 29, but for the hind-wheels GOG'= 2^.
Now as apart of the moving power OV, which we shall call
OU= K, must be employed to overcome            part of the power  a
of gravity acting in direction perpendicular to AB, which

     After a series of similar experiment! with somewhat coarser
and very moist red sand, I found # = 430 19', and c = T5T
inch at a medium. But it is to be observed that the impref-
fious made by immersing the steel rod did not disappear as from
the above dry sand, but remained after it was drawn out; and
therefore after each experiment I was obliged to make the sand
even and soft bv shaking                             it,
                                   and to render its surface smooth
by   a flight pressure proportioned to the exact measurement
of the depth         ;       by
                      which means      lost   little of its natural

                     it                  Hence follows what
we are taught      experience in general in regard to moist

of physic, he was placed under the care of Mr. Ludlow, an
eminent surgeon at Sodbury,             alarge market-town between
Bristol and VVotton under Edtre.               After remaining with
this gentleman some time, during which he applied with
•jfliduity, and made rapid improvement, he repaired to
London to complete his medical education, and became                      a
house-pupil to the celebrated John Hunter.             In this situation
he continued two years, and availed himself with great suc

practice, and met with considerable encouragement.                 In the
mean time he still kept up his intimacy with Mr. Hunter
 by    regular correspondence; and the frequent mention which
       a

his family    in London during the winter, but the summer
season   he general spends at Cheltenham or Berkley.            For
some years past he has devoted himself chiefly to researches
and observations in regard to the vaccine inoculation, one
of the most important discoveries of modern times, as it
gives reason to hope that the small-pox, so fatal to the human
race, ma) at length be totally eradicated.     But as this subject
has been sufficiently illustrated by various publications, and
particularly those of Dr. Jenner, Dr. Pearson, Dr. Wood-
ville and others, to whom the world is much indebted for
the introduction and propagation of this practice, it is need
less here to fay any thing sorther respecting        it. In 1800
Dr. Jenner published a continuation of Facts and Observations
relative to the Variolas Vaccinæ, or Cow-Pock, which was
soon followed by an Appendix to the Treatise on the Cow-
Pock.     The facts relating to this discovery have been so fully
established by unquestionable evidence and authority, that
every friend to mankind ought to use his utmost endeavours
to promote a practice attended with such valuable benefits to
the human race.        It must give pleasure to every benevolent
heart to find that, in consequence of the prevailing persuasion
of the useful tendency of this practice, those at the head of
the naval and military departments of government have lent
their sanction to     it,
                        and given orders Tor the general intro
duction of       into those branches of the public service
                it                                                    ;   so
that it   isnow practised with the fullest success         in
                                                          the naval
and military hospitals, and in the regiments and ships of
war upon service; and        can be said, as an additional recom

                                      it
are under       from doing their duty. Nations even which,
               it
in  consequence of their ignorance, have long been under the
wretched influence of the most childish superstition, and who,
on that account, have been hostile to many valuable im
provements received and established among more enlightened
states, have begun to open their eyes to the advantages of
this new practice; and hence          has been adopted in Spain,
                                      it
Russia and Italy, and even made its way into the Ottoman
dominions, and among the American Indians.              But, not
withstanding the importance of this discovery, like all others
that have benefited mankind,          has had violent opponents.

XLV.      Description os the different Methods of blowing up
    Rocks     under Water,          by A. Bail let, lnfpeUor of
    Mines*.
ist,   X HE operation of blowing             up rocks, which the French
call tirage     des  mines,   is  not   in  general attended with much
difficulty, when     the  hole   of the   mine  is pierced in dry compact
ground      without    any  fissure   or  cavity.    When the ground is
cavernous     or  hollow,   or   when    water   oozes  through its pores,
it becomes        more   troublesome,       and  requires particular care.
When      it is  necessary  to   blow   up   rocks  at the bottom of the
water the difficulties are increased.             In that case the usual
processes must be abandoned, and others must be resorted to.
    2d, The method of blowing up rocks in the latter cafe is
little known, and not much practised : it may, however, be
of great utility in many cases, not only in the working of
mines, but in the execution of public works of importance.
These motives have induced me to give a description of the
three principal methods of blowing up mines under water.
    The first is that used in the mines in the northern part of
the republic : it is proper to be resorted to when the depth
of the water which covers the ground intended to be blown
up is not above 15 or 18 decimetres.
    The second has a great resemblance to the process usual
in mines when the ground suffers the water to ooze through
it. It is simpler and less expensive than the preceding, and
appears to me to be very proper for cafes when there are only
a few decimetres of water above the ground.
    The third is suited to great depths of water, such as 4, 5,
or 6 metres : it is that employed al Carlscrona.                 It is very
ingenious, and seems hitherto to have been unknown to
the French miners.
    3d, But, before I begin to describe these methods, it
may be of some use to mention here an interesting memoir,
printed in the Journal de Physique for the year 1779, on the
construction of air-boats proper for facilitating the execution
of all sorts of works under water, without employing pump
                  * From the Journal     des Mines,  No. 56.
                                                                       ing.

                   of blowing   up Rods under Water.             269
ing. C. Coulomb, the author of this memoir, after describing
the method of constructing the air-boat, (hows in what man
ner it is to be used.        He points out the means by which it
may      be    made  to  sink  at pleasure, of placing the workmen
under the box, of continually renewing the air, of removing
the rubbish and laying a foundation of mason- work at the
bottom of deep water.          He then calculates the time neces
sary for removing a metre in height from the bank of Quille-
bceuf, which interrupts the navigation of the Seine; and fore
seeing the cases in which mattocks or pick-axes would be in
sufficient for clearing obstructions from the bottom of the
water, and where the hardness of the rock might require the
use of gun-powder, he proposes two methods of blowing up
 rocks under water.
     In one, the workman placed under the box bores the rock,
 and introduces into the bottom of the hole a box of tin plate
 filled with gun -powder, to which is soldered a small tube,
 also of tin plate, which rises above the water at ebb-tides,
 and which is stopped with some greasy matter, after having
 been      filled with a very weak composition to serve as a
 train.      The sea, as it rises, makes the air- boat stoat; and
 when its lower edge has risen higher than the extremity of
 the tube it is then removed, and when the ebb-tide uncovers
 that extremity a person goes in a boat and sets sire to it.
      In the other method, which the author proposes for
 the Mediterranean, and rivers where the assistance of the
 tide cannot be employed, the tube of tin plate which con
 tains the train rises only 3 decimetres above the rock, but is
 terminated by a leather pipe covered on the outside with
 some water-proof substance, and in the inside with an in
 combustible varnish, and secured from the pressure of the
  water by a spiral winding made of wire.          Its extremity must:
  be carefully closed, ana a buoy attached to it carries it to
  the surface of the water when the air-boat is afloat.
      4th, I shall say nothing further of these methods, which
  suppose, as may be seen, the assistance of the air-boat.           I
  only wislied to point them out, because they may be useful
  in many cases, and may, besides, give rise to new ideas,
  and serve to modify the three particular methods which are
  the object of this memoir.
  I.   Method of blowing up Recks at the Depth of 1$ or 18 Cen
                           timetres under Water.
      5th, This method consists in the following operations;
      First, bore the hole at the bottom of the water by the
  help of borers, and instruments of proper length.
                                                                 Then

   270               Description    of the different Methods
       Then place in the hole a tube of tin plate closed at the
  lower extremity.            The exterior diameter of this tube is of
  such a fize that, when introduced into the bore, it may fill
  it; and its length must be such as that it (hall rife some cen
  timetres above the surface of the water.
       Then send down to the bottom of this tube the cartridge
  filled with powder ; introduce the priming rod, and ram
  round it clay or plaster according to the usual process, and
 only to the height corresponding to the summit of the hole.
       In the last place, draw the priming rod and introduce the
 train, and set fire to it with all the neceflary precautions,
 that the workmen may be sheltered from danger at the time
 of explosion.
                                   Observation.
       6th, This method has been often employed with advan
 tage in several mines of the republic : it may serve either for
 deepening wells, or making other excavations, when the
 means uied for keeping the ground and bottom of wells
 constantly dry are insufficient.
II.     Method proposed         for blowing        up Rocks some Decimetres
                                   below Water.
      7th, When the ground or rock to be blown up is covered
only by some decimetres of water, the miner can fee the rock
 which he bores, and the hole to be loaded, with as much
ease as if there were no water, and can work with the fame
 facility.      In this cafe, to save expense, the tube of tin plate
 may be omitted, and a cartridge of pitched cloth, such as that
employed in ground through which the water oozes in every
 part, may be employed, adapting to it a rod of hollow wood *
destined to contain the train that conveys the fire to the
powder.          The diameter of the aperture of this rod may be
only      a few   millimetres, and its length must exceed the upper
level by some centimetres.
      8th, If this method be adopted, first construct a cylindric
cartridge of cloth or pasteboard, and fill it with gunpowder;
insert into it the rod, which must descend to the middle of
the length of the cartridge without approaching the interior
surface of the wrapper ; pinch closely the upper part of the
cartridge- around the rod, and cover the cartridge and whole
rod with pitch or some kind of varnish t. Then send down
the cartridge furnilhed with its rod into the hole of the rock,

and drive in strongly two plugs ot dry wood to serve as wad
ding. These plugs must have a longitudinal groove, that they
may glide along the rod and suffer the water to escape.
                                       Observation.
   9th, Instead          of    a   rod   of hollow wood you may employ,
with   advantage, either a tube of tin plate about four milli
metres in diameter, terminating at the lower extremity, which
mutt be inserted in the cartridge in a truncated cone, and ao.
orifice of two millimetres; or a leaden pipe drawn in the
manner of wire-drawers, having the fame dimensions as the
above, and whose resistance may be sufficient, if you take
care to introduce into                 it,
                            while you drive in the wadding,                           a
rod which may exadtly fill the interior vacuity.
   If   you have at hand any kind of composition capable of
acquiring hardness in little time at the bottom of the water,
                                                      *

you may substitute tor the rod and metallic tubes flexible                 a
tube of cloth done over with pitch or gum.       In this cafe,                        it
will be necessary to introduce the priming rod into the tube,
while you drive      the wadding to prevent its depression. The
                         in
cloth of the tube, the upper extremity of which          destined          is
 to rife above the hole in the nick, mult be sufficiently thick
 and strong that the pressure of the water, which     suppose to      I
 be some centimetres above the ground, may not flatten                                it,
 even      the liquid should introduce itself between the tube
             if
 and the composition.
 III.        Method      blowing up Rocks under Water at any Depth.
                        of
     10th, This method, on the first view, has            resemblance to
                                                                  a

                                                           it
 instead of wadding above the charge, according to the usual
 method, you employ an inflexible (hank charged with                                      a
 weight at its upper extremity, and terminating at the lower
 in segment of an iron cvlinder, which performs the office of
        a
 a  wedge, and          applied exactly upon another similar wedge
                         is
  inverted and resting on the upper end of the cartridge.
     The effect of this disposition, as may be readily conceived,
     to force the wedge which adheres to the cartridge to ascend
 a is
    little at the time of the explosion, and to squeeze itself closely
  against the upper wedge           as to close the hole
                                             so                       in

   IV. New      Method of blowing up Rocks under Water,                 by
                             Daniel Tbunberg.
     A profile of the rock which has been bored, and into which
the charge is introduced, is represented PI. V. fig. i.
     The charge is contained in a tube of tin plate impermeable
to water, a vertical section of which is represented in the same
figure. The lower extremity of this tube must be adjusted
properly to the hole which has been bored in the rock.
     The charge consists of a paper cartridge filled with gun
powder, andattached to the iron wedge b with a thread such
as that used for sewing sails.
     To this first wedge b is applied another c, which adheres
to an iron rod that rises above the tube.
     On the plane face of these wedges is a groove made with
a file which reaches to the powder : this groove is continued
throughout the whole length of the tube oftin plate by means
of a wooden rod d, hollow on the fide turned towards the
iron rod, to which it is made fast with strong packthread.
     Before this rod is attached to the iron one, a match, which
proceeds from the upper extremity and communicates with
the interior of the cartridge, is placed in the groove.
     e is a train applied to the end of the match.
     B, C, are two rafts which enable the workmen to bore the
rock and blow it up.
     D is a weight which prevents the iron from being repelled
too far when the explosion takes place.
     E F G H I are different pieces necessary for charging.
E is the cartridge furnished with its wedge, seen sideways ;
F the wedge seen in front ; G the wooden rule and its groove;
H the upper wedge and its iron rod ; I the tube of tin plate.
     When the rock has been bored according to the usual
method by employing a borer pretty strong and of such a
length as the depth of the water may require, introduce into
it the tube into which the charge has been put ; then apply
the train e, and, having placed the weight D above the rod,
set fire to it. The explosion will immediately take place : the
wedge b would be expelled but for the wedge c, which can
not give way; and the two wedges being thus united confine
the charge, the effect of which will never fail, as has been
proved by experience.
    * Details respecting this process may be found also in a large work, en
titled Description da  ^rat/aux  executes a Carlscrona, far Daniel Thunherg.
                                                                       Four

   Four feet of the tube and the lower wedge are in general
lost; but the upper wedge may be employed for new charges,
because it is never damaged.
                            Observation.
    lath, This method, the success of which is proved, de
serves, no doubt, to be known by all those engaged in great
undertakings, and who have frequent occasion to apply it *.
It       is,
       perhaps, susceptible of being modified and        appears        ;            it
to me that, without employing the impermeable tube,          var                          a
nished cartridge might be used, with      flexible tube proceed
                                                             a
ing from               it,
               lodged in the groove between the two wedges,
and then rising above the water.
    Fire also might be conveyed to the powder below the wa
ter          by
        means of       strong discharge of electricity
                                      a                 but little               ;
can be expected from this method in the hands of workmen.
    In the last place, the lower wedge might be made of hard
and very dry wood.
    13th, But in whatever manner this method may be em
ployed      will not require great expense, and
                  it                                 may be used            it
with great advantage for deepening ports, rendering certain
harbours more convenient and safe, and for freeing rivers
and streams from those rocks which obstruct their course and
impede the navigation of them.

    in the south-west, and proceed thence to windward at the
    rate sometimes of about one hundred miles an hour.        has                         It

                                  Dr. Franklin, that storms from
    the north-east, on the eastern fide of this continent, begin in
    the opposite point, or to leeward.    Whether this rule uni
    versally obtains may perhaps as yet admit of some doubt                                      :

274             Of Me   Winds in the Region between the
but during the uncommonly mild winter of 1801 — 2, there
was a strong confirmation of it.
   On the 21       22d, and 23d of February 1802, there was
                  st,
one of the most remarkable and Ion i-continued snow-storms
that had been known for twenty years.           raged with ex
                                                  It
treme violence on the land, and was the cause ot several ship
wrecks along the sea-coast.    Manv lives and much property
were lost.   The movements in the atmosphere were felt first
to the southward, and gradually progressed northward,       as    so
to be sensible there   but not until after some hours.
                        ;
   The facts were collected      Dr. Mitchill, at Washington,
                                       by
the seat of the national government, during the session of
congress, when they could be ascertained with the greatest
expedition, correctness, and ca're, and are as follow     :
   After   a fine, warm, and clear morning, the air toward
evening grew cloudy, and          became rainy and stormy.
                                  it                              The
time of its commencement near the capitol, on the banks of
the Potomack, as observed          by
                                    general Smith, was about half
an hour past five in the afternoon         and before eight the rain
                                            ;
was excessive, and the wind boisterous. Here the weather did
not become cold enough for snow until towards morning.
   The city of New- York, which           situated rather more than
                                            is
340 miles to the north-east, did not feel this commotion of
the atmosphere until about eleven.        Then the city watchmen
observed that the weather was changed from clear to cloudy,
and that snow began to fall          and at twelve Mrs. Mitchill,
                                       ;
who opened       a window and looked out, observed that the
ground was already white with snow.                 The tempest was
brewing, and, properly speaking, was formed at two.
   That night Mr. Humphrey Wood was on board stoop            a
bound from Newport (R. I.) to New-York. The tempest
drove the vc0'el afliore before morning on Mount Misery
Neck, upon Long Island. They sailed from Fisher's Island,
where they had been waiting for            fair wind, at ten o'clock
                                            a
at night, with    a wind at east-south-east, and warm and plea
sant weather.      But       by
                             midnight        hauled east-north-east,
                                             it
and  blew  a gale,  with   snow.    Fisher's   Island may be com
puted  to be  about   140  miles  east-north-east    of New-York.
   Mr. Webster observed some of the phænomena of this
change of weather, in its beginning, at New-Haven.               This
place is   89miles  from   New-  York,   or  331   from  Washington.
Here the weather was clear in the early pan of the evening,
but was overcast        bynine.    The stormy commotion of the
atmosphere    seems   to have   begun about twelve. At Boston
it was rather more than an hour later.
   Mr. Blair, ah officer who was on board one of three ships
                                                                from

           Gulf Stream   and Great Range     of Mountains.     275
from Salem, in Massachusetts,        that were lost on Cape Cod
during     the storm, related, after  his escape, that the weather,
on the day of their (ailing, Sunday, Feb. 3J, was remarkably
fine and favourable. At fun-set they were about four leagues
from Cape Ann light-house, with a light breeze from south
east.      After midnight the weather grew very threatening;
and at half past two in the morning of the 22d the wind
veered to the north-east, and it snowed so fast that the. ships
 could hardly discern each other.          The shipwrecks during
this storm were numerous and dreadful.          Many persons were
 frozen to death. Salem is distant from Washington 499
 miles, or 257 from New-York ; so that this latter place is
 about midway between the two places.
     At Portland, in Maine, distant 603 miles from Washing
 ton, the snow began between daylight and sunrise.           It was
 observed by young Mr. Vaughan, who was travelling on the
 morning of the 33d. At 8 A. M. the wind blew violently.
      The storm began still later at Hallowell, on the Kennebeck
  river. This place is 683 miles from Washington.             There
  the sun rose clear on the morning of the 22d. The air be
  came cloudy in about a quarter of an hour.        The snow began
  about eleven, and the storm had become furious within two
  hours after. Professor Waterhouse and Benjamin Vaughan,
  eso. have particularly attended to these curious meteorological
  facts.
      At Poughkeepfie, 82 miles north of New-York, and situ
  ated beyond the first range of mountains, the storm began
  about four o'clock on the morning of the 22d. And at Al
   bany, 165 miles north of New-York, it did not begin until
   a little before day-break on the morning of the 33d.
      At Providence (R. I.) Dr. Wheaton observed the evening
  of the 21st to be clear and pleasant. The watchmen informed
   him " the weather changed before 13 o'clock, and continued
   cloudy, with variable winds, until the violence of the storm
   began, which was at half past three on the morning of the
   32d." Providence is 439 miles from Washington.
       Accounts from Charleston (S. C.) state that it began there
   on the Sift, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon.
   The distance of Charleston from Washington is 550 miles.
   By the newspapers it appears to have been felt in the Bahama
   islands.
       It will be found, on calculation, that between Charleston
    and Cape Ann, along the coast, this stormy movement pro
    ceeded to windward at the rate of nearly one hundred miles
    an hour : for, as it began at Charleston, fay at three o'clock,
    at New York at eleven, and off Cape Ann at two the next
                                                            morning,

  37<S        Note on Clement and Desorme's Memoir,
  morning, there is a difference of eight hours between Charles
  ton and New-York, and of three hours between the latter
  city and Salem, making in the whole eleven hours. Now,
  computing the distance from Charleston to New- York at
  about 800 miles, and from New-York to Cape Ann more
 than 200, there will be a sea-coast of almost i too miles
 swept over by this storm in somewhat more than eleven hours.
 But this computation applies only to the sea-coast ; for, if we
 take any given point, as the city of New-York for example,
 and instead of north-east reckon due north, it will be found
 that the progress is considerably slower : for it took all the
 time between eleven at night and day- break next morning to
 reach Albany, only 165 miles distant in that direction.
     Now, these remarks explain some meteorological facts,
 which, though of common observation, have hitherto seemed
 paradoxical or unaccountable : for mariners know that, to
 form a good judgment of wind and weather, they must keep
 a look-out for clouds and changes of atmosphere to leeward.
 In New-York, the rain or snow which accompanies a north
 east storm can be seen by labourers along the docks and
 wharves in the south-west at Staten island, ten or eleven
 miles distant, for some time! before it begins in the city, so
 as frequently to break off work, and put away their tools.
 And it is confirmed by long observation among the farmers
 in that vicinity, that snow-banks, as they term them, are to
 be seen in the south-west many hours before the atmosphere
 where the observers are is clouded in the smallest degree, or
 any current of air perceptible. They remark further, that a
judgment can be formed of the weather by noting whether
 the gathered clouds lowering in the distant horizon are visible
 to the northward or southward of the setting sun.            If at sun
 set they are to the south of the sun, they predict a north-east
 storm, with snow ; if to the north, a south-east storm with
 sleet or rain.

by direct experiments, which he made known when at Paris,
and which are already old ; and Priestley announced, that all
gases dissolved    the fame quantity of ethereal gas, except a
small difference exhibited by the carbonic acid, which may
 be easily accounted for.
    If the experiments described by Clement and Desorme
had been exact, they would have found in a cubic foot of sa
 turated atmospheric air, at nearly 7 degrees of the thermo
meter*, the fame quantity which they obtained at 12 or 13
degrees of the thermometer.
    The elastic vapour of water has a specific gravity, which is
to that of air, at the fame degree of compression and tempe
 rature, as 10 to 14 ; but, besides this, there     in some gaseous  is,
substances, water combined and more condensed, which has
no influence on hygrometric phænomena             distinction which
                                                                ;   a

marked long ago              by
                          Withering: hence       happens that the

acid of this carbonate cannot be disengaged            heat, though       by
it  may be disengaged       from artificial carbonate, which has
retained enough of water to give some of            to the carbonic  it
acid  ;  but, by employing very dilute nitric acid, the carbonic
acid      disengaged from the former as well as the latter, as
          is
has been also remarked               by
                                Withering.
    Priestley has sliown, that,               by
                                       making the steam of water
to pass upon native carbonate, carbonic acid         easily obtained    is

    It    isonly     this water that we can explain the quantity

of hydrogen gas which           obtained

 drogen gas.

ject with which     I am not yet acquainted, it appears that we
 cannot refuse to acknowledge in it the existence of hydrogem
 In my opinion, its great volatility cannot result from two
substances, such as charcoal and sulphur, which not only are
 much more fixed, but which contain no other substances dis
posed to aflunie the elastic state.
    I shall here remark, by the bye, that they say, that by
 heating in a retort a mixture of sulphur and charcoal, no
 thing is obtained but a little gas, of a bad odour, insoluble
in water; and that Kirwan, on the contrary, says, speaking
 of hepatic air, that having treated with fire, sulphur ana
 charcoal which he had before kept a long time in a red
 heat, he obtained hydrogen gas in great abundance.
    It is not exact to fay, " that an experiment proved to
 them, that ioo parts of carbonic acid are composed nearly
 of 28 parts of charcoal and 72 of oxygen ;"- — a result given
 by Lavoisier.     This great man, in the conclusion of his me
 moir, in which the results presented differences, expresses
                         "
 himself as follows : — The experiments made since incline
 me to believe, that the proportions in charcoal are forced;
 and I am of opinion, that the quantity of carbon contained
 in a quint.il of carbonic acid does not exceed 24 pounds,
 and that of oxygen is at least 76 pounds."
    His opinion would be very different from that of C. Cle
 ment and Desorme, if they should still prove that charcoal
 is an oxide which contains already 32 per cent, of oxygen,
 though it is more inflammable than the base to which it is
 indebted for its inflammability, carbon, or the diamond.
 XLVIII.      Memoir on the tenth Planet discovered by Dr.
    Or.BERS.      Read in the Public Sitting of the French Na
    tional Institute, July 5th, by Jerome Lalande.
   VV HEN         we announced, in the last public sitting, the
 discovery of a planet by M. Piazzi of Palermo, we were far
 from thinking that, in three months, we sliould have to make
 known a discovery of the same kind.          It was also by a for
 tunate accident that this tenth planet was discovered ; but
 accident could favour none but an intelligent and indefati
 gable astronomer.
    On the 28th of March, at nine in the evening, Dr. 01-
 bers of Bremen was observing Piazzi's planet, with which
 astronomers have been engaged for a vear.'        He was examin-

ing with his   telescope all the small stars in the Virgin's wing,
to ascertain their positions,   that he might be better able to
establish the place of the planet, and had come to the 20th
star of the Virgin, near which he had observed the planet
in the month of January. He was surprised to see near this
star, which is of the Cth magnitude, another smaller of the
7th magnitude.        He was very certain that it had not been
there at the time of his first observations : he therefore has
tened to determine its position ; and, having continued to
view it for two hours, he perceived that it had changed its
place in the course of that interval.         The two following
nights afforded him the means of being certain of its mo
tion, which was 10 minutes per day. On the 28th of
 March, at oh 25^ mean rime, at Bremen^ it had 184° 56'
 right ascension, and n* 33' north declination.
    Astronomers have been accustomed to consider as comets,
 all stars that have motion.     This was the cafe wilh the pla
 nets of Herschel and Piazzi at the time when they were dis
 covered.     That of Dr. Olbers had no more resemblance to
 a  comet  than  the rest.   With an achromatic telescope, the
 magnifying power      of  which  was 180, it could not be distin
 guished   from  stars of  the
                               7th magnitude.     It was better de
 fined than the planet of Piazzi ; and, with a telescope of 13
feet, which magnified 288 times, it seemed to have a diameter
of 4 seconds : hut this was an effect of irradiation, or of the
dispersion of the rays of light, which always makes the dia
meters appear too large; for the satellites of Jupiter appear
much larger than the new planets, and yet we know that
their apparent diameter is not a second.
   Dr. Maskelyne, by means of diaphragms placed before
the object-glass of his telescope, ascertained thai the light of
Piazzi's planet is stronger by one half than that of the new
planet.
      Dr. Olbers havingobserved the new star for four days, he
sent  notice to different astronomers; and on the 10th of
April, C. Burckhardt, when he received his letter, went im
mediately to the military school to search for         it,
                                                  and next day
sent his observation to the Institute.
   He began to calculate its orbit, trying first circle, and a
then the parabola known to be that of comets        but, at the
                                                         ;
end of three days, his elements were found to err 30 seconds.
He tried also ellipses of different dimensions.
   On the 15th of May we were informed,                by
                                                    letter from

baron von Zach, the celebrated astronomer of Gotha, ihat
Dr. Gauss, an astronomer of Brunswick, had found an                   el

                  Memoir on   Dr, Otters' Planet.            281
22d we     received the details.    He found the involution to be
four  years   seven   months,  and    the inclination 350. This
great inclination   seemed to  remove    it from the order of pla
nets,  and  some  astronomers   called  it a comet; but its proxi
mity,   and continual appearance,  will not allow of its being
         among the number   of those stars of which we often
 ose sight for so long a time, and which go to enormous di
f)laced
stances.
    C. Burckhardt, on his part, made similar researches ; he
made several trials with ellipses very much elongated, which
gave him a result very near that of Dr. Gauss.
   Oa finding that this planet, like that of Piazzi, was be
tween Mars and Jupiter, and that its motion must be affected
by the attraction of Jupiter, C. Burckhardt undertook to
calculate these perturbations.     The calculation is long and
difficult, but it is indispensably necessary to obtain the orbit
 with more exactness.
   Al last, on the 4th of June, he finisiied these laborious
calculations, and found the following elements :
   Distance 2.791, or 95,890,000.
   Revolution, 4 years, 8 months, and 3 days.
   Eccentricity, 0.2463 ; equation of the orbit, 28^ 25'.
   Epoch of 1802, 4' 230 50'; aphelion, 10s 2° 3'; node, 5"
      22328'; inclination, 34°5o'4o".
   These elements corresponded to five observations of the
4th, 16th, and 27th of April, and the 7th and 20th of
March ; the last two made by C. Burckhardt, and Lalande
the nephew, who, as well as C. Mechain, Messier and De-
lambre, continued to observe it as long as it could be seen in
the meridian, because such observations are the surest.      Aftef
the 21st of May, other instruments and other stars were ne
cessary; but it still passed through some included among the
 15003 (tars which we have pubhstied.       On the 15th of June
these elements corresponded,      within a few seconds, with the
observations of Mechain and Messier ; which confirms the
exactness of the elements found by C. Burckhardt,          and as
sures us, that the motion of the new planet is already known.
Baron von Zach has published a great many observations re
specting it in his Journal.
   C. Cabrol de Mural has calculated for us an ephemeris,
which gives the situation of this planet to the 21st of Octo
ber, on which day it will have 2270 7' of right ascension, and
6° 8' of declination.      It will then set at  7!l 51': there is
therefore reason to think that    it   may be still observed.  It
will be above Libra near the Serpent, after passing the legs
of the Cow-herd. He finds that,        in 1806,it  will have 33J.0

of south declination, and that it will then be difficult to see
it at Paris: but C. Vidal, who has already observed it this
year, will then be better able than we to follow it.
   Its greatest northern declination will not exceed a6y de
grees, a term at which it will be a year hence.          It will be
easier to be seen, but its distance will be double, and its light
four times less than the present year. In the month of
March 1804, it will beat th-ee times the distance; its light
will be nine times less, and, in all probability, it will be
difficult to observe it.
   As the orbit of this new planet intersects that of Piazzi,
I  was curious to know whether the two planets might
not meet; but I found that, when they are in the fame
plane, there will be an interval of about J 9 millions of
leagues between them.
   The planet of Dr. Olbers is very small. If we suppose its
apparent diameter to be half a second, 1 find that its real
diameter cannot be more than 100 leagues.            Dr. Herschel,
in a paper which he read before the Royal Society on the
7th of May, makes it to be four times less. He fays, that
on the 22d of April Piazzi's planet was only 2% hundredths
of a second, and that of Olbers 13 hundredths; but it ap
pears to me, that we have no means of determining, with
certainty, quantities so small.
   Dr. Olbers calls his new planet, Pallas ; but, as I fee no
sufficient motive for this fabulous denomination,           I prefer
givine      it  the name of  the person to  whom   we are  indebted
for this valuable discovery.
 1 Dr. Olbers distinguished himself in
                                             1797 by an excellent
treatise on comets, and was worthy of the good fortune with
which his labours have been crowned.

T,HE        inoculation of the cow-pock having always ap
peared   to  us to be interesting, not only on account of the
improvement of the practice of medicine from         but also         it,
asa  very curious fact    natural history, we have noticed
                                in                                              se

                                         ;
an early account, as, no doubt, many of our readers will be
eager to know what       the objecl of the present examination,
                            is
which the author states to be —
   " I. In order to submit to the judgment of the public,
whether or no more honourable and just grounds might not
have been asserted for the remuneration of the petitioner.
   " 2. In, order to osser evidence for the manifestation of                    se

facts; the detection of ill-grounded assertions     and for labour,

expenditure of time, and other sacrifices, in introducing and
maintaining the vaccine inoculation."
   The author, in the very first pasje, sets out with declaring
to the public that Dr. Jenner        the discoverer of the vaccine
                                         is
inoculation, and in this point of view he considers him as
entitled to the remuneration                 by
                                        prior right to every other

perlbn  ;  but in the course of the work he brings out great                a
variety of facts in evidence, to show that neither the neces
sary facts    for the present practice were discovered                           by
Dr. Jenner, nor were the facts which he published even
estabiistied    by sufficient number of experiments. The au
                     a
thor brings out great number of extracts from publications,
                      a
 to (how that he had no small sliare in investigating the vac
cine inoculation practice; but- that the petitioner claims, or
rather the committee in their report affirm, the whole prac

                                    him. To, shuw the contrary,

    the author exhibits the amount of Dr. Jenner's experience,
    the value of which he allows to be great, and that it was the
    direct occasion of all that has been done since his publica
    tion.
        I He states that the whole amount of Dr. Jenner's ex
          ft,
    perience was but seven or eight cafes of inoculation of the
    cow-pock.
        ad, That he gave no description of the cow-pock          that,;    so
    after the practice was begun, mistakes on this     account   were
    made,    which  were   rectified          by
                                       the characters of the eruption
    ascertained           by
                     the author and Dr. Woodville.
        3d, That they brought out the evidence of several hundred
     cafes     two or three months time, which before were, as
                in
     above asterted, only seven or eight.
        4th, That Dr. Jenner in giving plates of the cow-pock
    did not mention what dav after inoculation, which made them
1    of little use, and misled bv affirming that the inoculated
     eruption was      like the small-pox that the most experienced
                              so
     inoculator could not distinguish them from the small-pox.
     To show the inexperience of Dr. Jenner, the author gives                      a
     plate of the two inoculated diseases, from which        appears, it
     Dr. Pearson says, incredible, on account of the difference,
     how Dr. Jenner could ever have spoken of such             resem-  a
     hlance,     his experience had not been confined to
                     if                                            few         a
    cafes   ?
        5th, That Dr. Jenner's experience must have been very
    limited, from his recommendation of applications of caustic            a
    nature, found to be subsequently unrequired. — from his de
    riving the cow pock from the grease of horses-^-from his af
    firming that      person could, again and again, have the vac
                          a
    cine disease; and even after the small -pox — from expecting
    so much      inflammation     that the safety to infants was
    dreaded— from his not knowing that very commonly there
    is   no sensible constitutional disease    and yet not describing
                                                         ;
    the cow-pock to know when          really takes place, the prac
                                                  it
    tice was not understood, and mistakes were committed which
     have been set right                by
                                other persons.     Partly from these
    errors disgusting      the public,  and from the deficiencies
    not leaving foundation to practise upon, Dr. Jenner's claims
                          a
     to ample and exclusive remuneration are rejected        this au  by

     of the new inoculation, and very happily quotes two verses

   The author scrutinises the several claims of the petitioner,
and endeavours to show that those given to the house of
commons, as found valid by the committee, are not true
according to history.     But, fays he, a very just and dignified
ground might     have  been  taken, equally favourable for remu
neration, as follows : " That the petitioner had proposed a
new kind of inoculation, and actually furnished some instances
of the success; of    it,
                       founded upon facts     of which some were
                                                :
brought   to  light   and   use,  which  heretofore had been only
locally known to      avery   few  persons  ;and,  that in conse
quence of considerable subsequent investigations,     the au by
thor and others, such   body
                            a of evidence had   been obtained,
and such further facts had been discovered, as demonstrated
the advantages of the new practice." —    i6<j.  p.
    Although    itappears, according to the evidences, that ino
culation was practised even from human subject to human
subject before Dr. Jenner, yet the author neither considers
Dr. Jenner nor the public as under any obligations to them,

    The author appeals to the public, whether or no he has
not proved     by evidence that exclusive claims of credit were

and the remaining seven cases in 1798.             The author was
asked by the committee whether he thought Dr. Jenner got
his information from any preceding inoculator, and he an

     It appears that Dr. Pearson, having had no credit allowed
 by the committee of the house of commons, submits his
 evidences to the public, to determine in what light he is
 to be considered, as well as Dr. Woodwille, by posterity.

  The         reading of Mr. Chenevix's paper on the chemical
  analysis  of corundum was finished on the 27th of May.
      On the 3d of June a description of the anatomy of the or-
  nilhorhynchus hystrix, by Everard Home, esq. F.R.S. was
  laid before the Society.        This animal is a native of New
  South Wales, and several specimens Have been brought over
  in spirits : its length is about 1 7 inches ; it is covered with
  hair and with quills. Its bill somewhat resembles that of the
  ornithorhynchus,        but wants the lateral lips.       Its teeth are
                                                                  horny,

horny,     and confined to the tongue and the palate   : the hind
legs are furnished   with a spur.    The  stomach  has a number
of    horny papillæ near the pylorus: it is much larger than
that of the ornithorhynchus paradoxus : the animal appears
to swallow a considerable quantity of sand with its food. The
second branch of the fifth pair of nerves is extremely small,
so that this species has probably no peculiar fense of feeling
on its bill; that of smell appears to compensate the deficiency.
The small bones of the ear are only two, corresponding to
the malleus and stapes; the divisions of the cochlea are car
 tilaginous.    The contents of the pelvis agree with those of
 the ornithorhynchus, in greatly resembling the class of birds.
 Mr. Home has examined several other species of manis and
 myrmecophaga, but finds that they all are furnished with
 mammae. 1 he peculiar characters of the genus ornithorhyn
 chus appear to be the spur on the hind legs, the absence of
 nipples, the smooth beak, and the horny teeth.          From all
 these considerations, Mr. Home infers that the genus forms
 a connecting link between        the mammalia, aves, and am
 phibia.
     This animal was described before, by Dr. Shaw, under the
 name myrmecophaga aculeata ; but, from the absence of the
 mammae, and its greater internal resemblance to the orni
  thorhynchus, Mr. Home places it in the fame genus.
      On the 17th an analysis of a pulmonary calculus, by
  P. Crampton, esq. was read.
      Mr. Crampton found in 100 parts of this calculus,^ of lime„
  37 of carbonic acid, and 18
                                 of animal matter and water ; this
  was probably albumen, being coagulable in acids. He thinks
  it probable that this specimen may have been of a different
  nature from those which are described by Fourcroy, and
  which have been supposed to contain phosphate of lime.
  Mr. Crampton thinks it easier to understand how phosphate
  of lime might have been separated from the blood than car
  bonate; but he conceives that even this may be deposited
  in the lungs by a morbid process, similar to the healthy one
  by which it is secreted to form a considerable part of the
  bones.
      The fame evening a letter from Mr. Carlisle to the presi
  dent was read, containing a description of two kinds of eyes
  observed in the gryllus gryllotalpa, with other circumstances
   respecting the structure and natural history of that animal.
      On the 24th of June a method of examining refractive and
   dispersive powers by prismatic reflection, by Dr. Wollaston,
   F. R. S. was read.
      It was suggested to the author by a consideration of the
                                                          prismatic

prismatic speculum employed by Sir Isaac Newton in his
reflecting telescope.        The angle at which the total reflection
of light of any kind first takes place at the surface of a rarer
medium depends on the comparative density of the two me
diums in contact, and hence the measurement of this angle
readily furnishes a determination of the ratio of refraction at
the common surface for the kind of light observed.              Thus by
means of a triangular prism, a drop of each of two or more
fluids being placed side by fide on the under surface, it may
easily be found, by inclining the prism more and more, whicb
of the dark spots first disappears, and it follows that the re
spective fluid has the weakest refractive power.            But when a
solid is examined, it must in general be united by the inter
position of some fluid of a higher refractive density, otherwise
the contact will be too imperfect; and it is easily shown that
this interposition does not affect the ultimate result.              But
for determining at once the numerical ratio of the sines, Dr.
Wollaston has invented an apparatus where, bv means of a
rectangular prism of flint 'glass, the index of refraction of
each substance is read off at once by a vernier, the three sides
of a moveable triangle performing the operations of reduction
of the ratios in a very compendious manner. In this method
it is obviously unnecessary that the substances to be examined
should be of any determinate form; and it is as easy to ascertain
the refractive density of the most opaque as of the most trans
parent bodies, provided they be less refractive than the prism
employed.        It may also serve as a chemical test, for example
in  essential  oils,  which when adulterated are generally ren
dered   less refractive   ; and a very minute quantity is sufficient
for the experiment. Where trie medium is of variable den
sity, this is almost the only mode in which its refractive power
can be ascertained ; hence it is of singular utility in exa
mining the refraction of the crystalline lens. (Philosophical
Transactions, 1801, p. 41.)            A copious table of the refrac
tive powers of various substances is here inserted.              The di
spersive powers      of different substances  are  inferred  from similar
observations      upon the fringes which usually accompany, or
rather constitute, the boundary of reflection : the author ob
serves that they are sometimes wanting, or even reversed,
wh»'n the dispersion is equal at different angles of deviation,
pr when it is greater even with a less deviation, as when oil
of sassafras is applied to a prism of flint glass, as well as in
many cafes of spars with fluids.             Solutions of metallic salts
in general    are  found    to be very  highly  dispersive : by weaken •*
ing the solution till the line of separation became colourless,
and then noting the refractive density, Dr. Wollaston has
                                                                    been

been able to compare the dispersive powers                 of  several such
substances with that of plate glass.             He has also arranged a
number of substances in a table in the order of their dispersive
powers, at a given deviation ; an order materially different
from that of their refractive density.             A very important ob
servation concludes         this  part  of  the   essay.   Dr. Wollafioii
observes, that, by looking through a prism at a distant cre
vice in a window-shutter, the division of the spectrum may
be seen more distinctly than by any other method ; and that
the colours are then only four, red, yellowish green, blue,
and violet, in the linear proportions of the numbers 16, 23,
36, 25 ; and that these proportions will be the fame whatever
 refractive substance be employed, provided that the inclina
tion of the prism remain unchanged.                   In the light of the
lower part of a candle, the spectrum is distinguished by dark
spaces into five distinct portions.
     Another communication from Dr. Wollaston, on the
 oblique refraction of Iceland crystal, was also read the same
 evening.
     It contains a confirmation of the experiments of Huygena
 on this substance, with additional evidence, deduced from
 the superiority of Dr. Wollaston's mode of examining the
 powers of refraction.          He observes, that Dr. Young has al
 ready applied       the    Huygenian theory with considerable suc
 cess to the explanation of several other optical phænomena,
  and that it appears to be strongly supported by such a coinci
  dence of the calculations deduced from           it,    with the results
  of these experiments, as could scarcely have happened to                  a
  false theory.
     On the 1st os July was read paper,
                                     a           by     Dr. Young, F.R.S.
  giving   an  account     of some  cafes  of  the   production   of colours
  not hitherto described.
      A paper on the composition of emery,            by    Smithson Ten-
  nant, Esq. F.R.S. was also read.
      Mr. Tennant finds that emery        is    dissolved with some diffi
  culty   in a   strong     heatby   carbonate     of soda, and, after the
  subsidence of  a    little iron, the earth contained in the solution
 is   almost purely argillaceous.         This result    is  exactly similar
  to Mr. Klaproth's analysis of diamond spar or corundum.
  From 100 parts Mr. Tennant procured 80 of argil, of silex,        3
  and 4     of iron, with an undissolved residuum of parts, and 3
 a    loss of 10, great care having been taken to separate the
   part3 attracted by the magnet      :    some portions however con
   tained almost one third of iron.           The hardness of emery and
   diamond spar appears to be equal. The emery used in Eng
   land       brought principally from the island of Naxos
        is                                                                  it

     A catalogue of 500 new nebulae, nebulous stars, planetary
 nebulae, and clusters of stars, was laid before the Society by
 William Herschel, LL.D. F.R.S.; and the preliminary re
 marks on the construction of the heavens were also read.
     Dr. Herschel takes a very enlarged view of the sidereal
 bodies composing the universe, as far as We can conjecture
 their nature ; and enumerates a great diversity of parts that
 enter into the construction of the heavens, reserving a more
 complete discussion of each to a future time. The first species
 are insulated stars; as such the author considers our fun, and
 all the brightest stars, which he supposes nearly otit of the
 reach of mutual gravitation j for, stating the annual parallax
 of Sirius at 1", he calculates that Sirius and the fun, if left
 alone, would be 33 millions of years in falling together; and
 that the action of stars of the milky way, as well as others^
 Would tend to protract this time much more. Dr. Herschel
 conjectures that insulated stars alone are surrounded by pla
 nets.    The next are binary sidereal systems, or double stars :
 from   the great number of these which are visible in different
parts of the heavens, and the frequent apparent equality of
the two stars, Dr. Herschel calculates the very great impro
 bability that they should be at distances from each other at
 all comparable to those of the insulated stars : hence he in
 fers that they must be subjected to mutual gravitation, and can
only preserve their relative distances by a periodical revolu
tion round a common Centre.            In confirmation of this in
ference he promises soon to communicate a series of observa
tions made on double stars, showing that many of them have
actually changed their situation in a progressive course, ths
motion of some being direct, and of others retrograde. The
proper motion of our fun does not appear to be of this kind,
but to be rather the effect of some perturbations in the neigh
bouring systems.        The fame theory is next applied to triple,
quadruple,     and   multiple systems ot stars, and particular hy
pothetical   cafes  are  explained by diagrams. Some such cafes,
Dr.    Herschel  is  fully persuaded, have a real existence in na
ture. The fourth species consists of cluttering stars, and of
the milky way: the stars thus disposed constitute masses,
which appear brighter in the middle, and fainter towards the
extremities, being, perhaps, collected in a spherical form.
Groups of stars the author distinguishes from these by a want
of apparent condensation about a centre of attraction ; and
clusters of stars, by a much more complete compression near
                                                              such

such a centre, so as to exhibit a mottled lustre, almost resem
bling a nucleus.       The eighth species consists of nebulae*
Which probably differ from the three last species only in being
much more remote ; some of them, Dr. Herschel calculates,
must be at so great a distance that the rays of light must have
been nearly two millions of years in travelling from them to
our system.      The stellar nebulae, or stars with burs, form a
distinct species.      A milky nebulosity is next mentioned,
which may in some cafes resemble other nebulæ, but in
others appears to be diffused, almost like a fluid : the author
is not inclined to consider it as either resembling the zodiacal
 light of the sun, or as of a phosphorescent nature. The tenth
 species is denominated nebulous stars ; these are stars sur
 rounded with a nebulosity like an atmosphere, of which the
 real magnitude must be amazingly great; for the apparent
 diameter of one of them, described in the catalogue, was 3'.
 The planetary nebulæ are distinguished by their equable
 brightness and circular form, while their light Is still too
 faint to be produced by a single luminary of great dimensions.
 When they have bright central points, Dr. Herschel consi
 ders them as forming a twelfth species, and supposes them to
  be allied to the nebulous stars, which might approach to their
  nature, if their luminous atmospheres were very much con
 densed round the nucleus.
      On the 8th of July, the first part of a paper on the rectifi
  cation of the conic sections was laid before the Society by
  the Rev. John Hellins, B.D. F.R.S. It contained nine theo
  rems for the rectification of the hyperbola by means of in
  finite series, one only of which had been before published,
  each having its particular advantages in particular cafes of
  the proportions of the axis and of the ordinates, so that they
  appear to contain a complete practical solution of this import
  ant problem, and they are illustrated by a variety of examples.
      On the fame evening were read observations on heat, and
  on the action of bodies which intercept      it,   byMr. Prevost,
  professor   of  natural  philosophy  at  Geneva.     They consist
  chiefly  of  inferences  from   Dr. Herschel's  important experi
  ments on the- transmission of heat   by  different refracting me
   diums, especially the different kinds of glass.      Mr. I'revost
   sets out with the law of the interchange of heat as ascertained
  by   the experiments of MM. Kraft and Richmaun, that while
   the time flows equably, the differences of the temperature of
   two contiguous bodies flow proportionally, or are in geome
   trical progression.     Hence from three observations of the
   actual temperature of   a    thermometer, at given intervals of
   time, we may determine the progression ot the differences,
   and consequently the actual heat of the medium.          The au
                4                                                the;

  thor applies this method to Dr. Herschel's experiments oil
  the heat of a solar ray transmitted through different mediums,
  and the conclusions are very different from what we should
  at first fight infer : for instance, in Dr. Herschel's 24th ex
  periment, the blue glass intercepted one-tenth only of the
  rays of heat, and not one-fourth, as the thermometer seemed
 to indicate.      But the immediate interception must have been
 somewhat       greater than one-tenth, for a certain portion of
 heat actually communicated to the glass must have radiated
 afresh towards the thermometer, and contributeoVto produce
 the temperature observed ; and accordingly as this circum
 stance took place in a greater or less degree, the thermometer
 must have been variously and irregularly affected.         Of such
 an irregularity almost every one of the experiments shows
 evident marks ; and the apparatus is not minutely enough
 described to furnish data for calculating its magnitude. From
 these principles an experiment of Mr. Pictet on the intercep
tion of heat, is reconciled with Dr. Herschel's experiments.
     In the second part of this paper Mr. Prevost treats of the
 reflection of heat and of cold.       He observes that Bacon sug
gested     the  inquiry respecting   the concentration of invisible
neat by glasses. Lambert attributed the effect of the reflec
tion from a common sire to its invisible heat.        Mr. de Saus-
sure suggested to Mr. Pictet to confirm Lambert's suspicion .
by experiment, and the success is well known.           His experi
ment on the reflection of cold Mr. Prevost has already em
ployed in support of the opinion that the equilibrium of heat
is not a quiescent equilibrium, or an equilibrium of tension,
 but an equilibrium of motion, where the interchanges of heat
on either side are equal ; and this theory has been adopted
by professor Pictet, and by other philosophers.          Hence the
author endeavours to deduce the law already inferred from
Richmann's experiments.            Mr. Prevost observes that this
theory would be equally applicable .to the opinion of those
who consider heat as consisting in the undulations of an elastic
medium ; although he thinks that opinion liable to many
objections, especially on account of the resistance which the
motions of the planets must suffer from it.         In a note added
by Dr. Young, who communicated the paper, the assertion
of Newton is quoted in answer to this objection, vet Dodtor
Youug confesses that Newton appears to have calculated er
roneously ; but he observes, that if the slightest difficulty of
this kind sliould occur from astronomical considerations, it
might be avoided by considering the luminiferous ether as
unconcerned in the phænnmena of cohesion, and iheu its
rarity might be assumed as great as we chose to make it.

     Zoohgy. — C. Cuvier communicated to the class a great
 number of observations, which he made on the worms which
 contain a greater or less quantity of red blood, and similar to
 that which circulates in animals that have vertebrae.         A
fluid more or less red had lonn; been remarked in the earth
 worm ; but, as a fluid of the Tame colour had been seen in
the larvæ of several insects, it was not known whether that
of the earth-worm was real blood. About four years ago
C. Cuvier removed all doubt on this subject, and, after de
scribing the vascular fvstem of the earth-worm and leech,
proved that the red fluid of these two animals is a real san
 guine fluid.   In the course of last autumn this naturalist was
 enabled to extend his researches on this part so interesting
 to the physiology of animals.      He observed phænomena far
 more general, and consequently more remarkable, than those
 he had discovered before. He found that all articulated worms,
such as the naiades, nereides, aphrodites, amphinomes, tere-
bellæ, amphitrytes, and ferpules have red blood ; that this
fluid circulates in a complete svstem of arteries and veins, and
that it proceeds to the branchiæ, or to the surface of the skin,
to assume a red colour, by an operation analogous to respira
tion in man and animals with vertebrae.
     Medicine. — C. Percy, associate, read medical and philoso
phical observations on an universal ancylosis, or immobility of
all the articulations, and exhibited to the class the skeleton
of the unfortunate subject, who lived twelve years in that
state, worse than death, of which, according to C. Percy, it
was a dreadful image aud a long precursor.
    This surgeon in chief of the armies, after quoting instances
of ancylosis observed by different physicians, and particularly
by Real, Colonib. and C. Portal, informed the class that
C. Francois-Maurice Mareieu de Simorre, an officer in
the army, had contracted, during the campaigns in Corsica,
a rheumatic gout which successively deprived him of the use
of his fingers, hands and feet; which, after producing the
most violent pain, made it impossible for him to move any
part of his body, and even his lower jaw; and which at length
put an end to his existence.       He spent several years in an
easy chair, without enjoying a moment's sleep, notwith and-
ing the strongest doses of opium.      Being reduced to such a
state, as to be able to fuck only a little soup or wine through

the small interval left between the upper and lower teeth ; he
caused two of the incisive teeth to be drawn, and by means of
the aperture produced by this operation, he spoke with more'
freedom, and could suck up liquids through a pipe, and even
swallow a little minced meat.
     Hi* body, a kind of animated statue, or living carcase,
 formed only one piece ; all his bones were cemented to each
 other: and notwithstanding this state of extreme misery, Si-
morre often conversed with great cheerfulness, and dictated
 every year an almanack in verse, which the public eagerly
 bought up, to relieve his misfortune without wounding his
 delicacy.    That of the year 5 was distinguished by the fol
 lowing   motto   s

                11 fe rit dc la vie,  ea attendant la mort.
 Simorre's countenance, however, displayed great expression,
  and even hilarity.        The muscles of his face had acquired a
  singular mobility      ;  they were continually in action, either
  to supply the want of gestures, which he could no longer
  employ, or to wrinkle his skin and drive away the insects
  which continually tormented him.
      C. Percy has described the origin and progress of this
  disease, fortunately very rare : he has examined the causes
  and explained the alteration of the bones, and particularly
  those of the articulations of Simorre, whose skeleton, a ter
  rible and at the same time valuable monument of human
  misery, is now deposited in the conservatory of the school of
  medicine at Paris.
      In a second memoir C. Percy has described all the effects
  of a monstrous voracity, to which he gives the name of poly-
  fhagia. A young man, in the environs of Lyons, named
   Tarare, at an earlv period of life, having followed a compa
   ny of mountebanks, had accustomed himself to swallow peb
   bles, large oflals of meat coarse fruits, knives, and even
   living animals. Terrible colics and other violent affections
   were not able to make him renounce this dangerous habit,
   which soon became an imperious want.
       Having enlisted in the beginning of the last war in one
   of the battalions of the army of the Rhine, he fought in the
   neighbourhood of a flying hospital the necessary aliment.
   The refuse of the kitchen, the remains of the-soldiers' allow
   ance, rejected articles and putrid provisions were not suffi
   cient to satiate his appetite.           He often contested with the
   vilest animals for their disgusting food, and he was in the
   continual pursuit of cats, dogs, and serpents, which he de-

Votired alive.    It was necessary to drive him away by force
*>r   threats from the apartments of the dead, and from the
 places where the blood drawn from the sick had been depo
 sited.   Attempts were made, but in vain, to cure this voracity,
by giving him in turns fat bodies, acids, opium, and even
 la coque du Levant.      The disappearance of a child sixteen
months old having excited strong suspicions against him,
he deserted : but in the year 6 he was admitted into the hos
pital of Versailles, in a state of consumption, which had suc
ceeded this horrible appetite, and which, according to his own
account, was occasioned by a silver fork that had regained in
the intestinal canal.
    As he died soon after, C. Tusfler, chief surgeon of that
hospital, had the courage to open the body, notwithstanding
the insupp rtable d tir which it exhaled : but the fork was not
found.     The (I inach was of an extra rdinarv size ; the in
testines, completely ulcerated, exhibited remarkable swellings;
and the gall-bladder was of a very great capacity.
    Tarare was of a small stature, delicate and weak ; his look
had nothing in it savage.       When young, the skin of his
bellv could almost he wrapped round his body, and after
a full meal one might have almost believed him to be drop
sical : a thick vapour issued in torrents from his mouth, his
whole body smoked, the sweat flowed in abundance from
his head, and, like several of the most voracious animals, he
fell afleep to digest.
    C. Percy terminated his memoir by explaining the internal
organization of those wretches condemned by nature to ex
perience this cruel and inordinate hanger : he explained the
greater part of the phænomena they exhibit; and he con
cludes, from numerous instances of pulythagia which he has
collected, that the unfortunate persons subject to      find, for     it,
the most part, an end to their torments                  by
                                             death, before they
attain to the age of forty.

Astronomy. — Observations                    on     the new Vianet discovered

known,      appeared verified for a moment by the discovery of
Piazzi's planet, but   was soon belied in tilt molt formal man
ner by the observation of a new planet verv near the first. Here
then we have an instance of the fall of opinions founded on
deceitful analogies, and on the false ideas which we form of
what constitutes order and regularity in the designs of na
ture. It will doubtless not cure men of the propensity they
have to indulge in vain speculations, which, after making a
noise for a while, soon fall into the deepest and well merited
oblivion ; and notwithstanding the numerous lessons which
 the positive sciences never cease to offer, they will always be
 found searching for the causes of effects when the data ne
 cessary for that purpose are entirely wanting, and even when
 no relations perceptible to our fenses seem to be connected
 with the nature which they assign to the unknown cause.
     The new star of which we here speak, exhibits one re
 markable singularity, which contradicts the systems conceived
 to explain the formation of the planets according to the pro
  bability of a cause in virtue of which their orbits have been
  confined within a very narrow zone, named the zodiac. The
  great inclination of the orbit of this star obliges us to ex
  tend considerably the breadth of the zodiac; aud gives rea
  son to believe that it has perhaps no boundaries : . these re-
t
  flections are founded on the following facts borrowed from
    Delambre.
       "  On the 20th of Germinal, C. Burckhardt having re
    ceived information that M. Olbers, of Bremen, had disco
    vered a new star, which had the- appearance of a planet, he
    communicated this intelligence the fame evening to all the
    astronomers of the Institute, who fought for it the night fol
     lowing.     Next day, C. AJessier, Mechainand Delambiegave
     to the class an account ot their observations : the new star
     had a sensible motion, both in right ascension, and declina
     tion.    It presented no appearance of a tail, nor even of a
     nebulosity, and could be distinguished      bv nothing but its
      movement from liars of the eighth magnitude which were
      in its neighbourhood.     They continued to observe it in the
      meridian till towards the end ot Florea! : it alwavs presented
      the same appearances,    only that its light was (till weaker,
      because it began to recede from the earth.
         " Attempts were made, but in vain, to find a parabola
      which would correspond with the observations.     A circle was
      attended with no better success. An ellipse was necessary, and
      one even very eccentric. In this respect the new planet dissers
    . very little from Mercury ; but what is more extraordinary in
      regard to itis,  that its inclination   about 350, while that
                                              is
                                                                   of

of Mercury   is only 7, and that of the planet Ceres disco
vered in 1801 by Piazzi, io"J 37'.  Thus we shall be obliged
to enlarge considerably the zodiac, if we continue to denote
by that name the zone of the heavens in which the planets
              their revolutions.       Another very remarkable pecu-
fierform
  iarity is,   that the mean distance of this planet differs very
little from that of Ceres.          We are not yet acquainted in the
solar system with two planets the orbits of which are so
near.
    " So many singularities render this new planet highly                 in
teresting to astronomers     ;    for
                                   it   is    besides so small, thatit can
have no sensible influence on the neighbouring planets          :    while,
on the other hand,    it    must experience very considerable pertur
bations from Jupiter. C. Burckhardt has kept an account of
the principal of them, in order to determine an elliptical orbit.
We have indeed great need of pretty correct theory, to be able
                                   a
to find this planet when     it    fliall issue from the solar rays, into
which    it
         is     about to enter; otherwise its small size would render
the search for  it     very uncertain.  It   is even highly probable that
it  would have remained still     a
                                         long  time  unknown, had    it not
been found exactly      in    the place which Ceres'had quitted, and
quite close to stars which had been much observed               by   astro
nomers for several months.          It      was   a curious union, that of
three new planets with which astronomy has been enriched
in our days, they were all three seen to pass the meridian
in   a few minutes of time.           M. Olbers has given to his planet
the name of Pallas."
    The perfection to which instruments and methods are now
carried, has enabled astronomers to deduce from small num  a
ber of observations,        the determination of the elements of the
planetary      orbits,  which   they were formerly obliged to leave to
future ages. One of these liars         is     no sooner dilcovered, than
its motions are assigned with remarkable precision, as                     is
proved    by     the opposition of Ceres, or Piazzi's planet, ob
served at the military school          by    Lalande junior and Burck
hardt.
    They have determined the moment of the opposition, on
the 26th of Ventose, year 10 (March 17th 180a), at                   3h 46'

   strations of the principal Theorems in regard to the Attrac
    tion exercised by Spheroids ; special Determination of the
    Conditions of the Equilibrium of a Body made to balance

    The   result found by Newton for the velocity with which
sound    is propagated   in the atmospheric air, and since con-,
firmed by     various analytical researches of succeeding geome
tricians, differs however about a ninth from that given by
experiment : the former is only     iy]"i  metres, and the second is
comprehended between 337 '2 metres and 350-8.            This point
of philosophy being     one  ot those to which analysis applies with
the greatest rigour, it was impossible to ascribe to the errors
or imperfection of calculation, the difference between theory
and observation      Newton therefore himself and some of the
philosophers     who  wrote after him on this subject have formed
different hypotheses, in regard to the constitution of the at-'
mosphere, in order to account for the difference in question.
But as none of these hypotheses, which explained the fact
only in a very vague manner, could accord with the discover
ries of the modern chemistry, respecting the nature of the
air, it has since been ascribed to the influence which the va
riations of the temperature that accompany the dilatation and
condensation of the air resulting from its vibrations may have
on the velocity of found.
    C. Biot, associate, has endeavoured to determine by cal
culation, the effect which these vibrations that cannot be
doubted, produce on the velocity of found.          He has proved
that it might be very sensible, and even sufficient to carry the
velocity of sound beyond the term fixed by experiment. For
this purpose he set out from some experiments on -the dilata
tion of the air, and of gas, made under the direction of
Berthollet, by C. Guy-Lussac, and he has combined them
with a plausible hypothesis on the quantity of caloric disen
gaged by the compression of the air, viz. that this fluid,
under these circumstances, abandons as much of it as is ne
cessary to be taken from it by simple cooling in order to re
duce it to the bulk it is made to occupy.
                                                                 As

   Ab this hypothesis gives a result too great, C. Biot then
resumes the question in an inverse order, and, from the ob
served velocity of sound, endeavours        to find what ought to
be the quantity of caloric abandoned by the air, when it is
reduced by compression to the half of its volume; and he
finds that the fame quantity would raise Reaumur's thermo
meter to about 6g°.
   C. Biot has communicated also to the class researches on
the attraction of spheroids.   This subject, treated first in a syn
thetic manner by Maclaurin, was a long time the quicksand
of analysis, which, however, in the hands of'Lagrange, Le-
gendre, and Laplace, has successively assumed a superiority over
synthesis, and conducted to results which could not have been
obtained without its assistance.     But there remained in the
analytical demonstrations of the principal theorems on this
subject, a complication which C. Biot made to disappear
in a very happy manner, bv combining' a theorem, for which
we are indebted to Lagrange, with a partial differential equa
tion, found by Laplace, and applying to this equation a pro
cess, which he presented himself some years ago to the class,
to integrate by series partial differential equations.
   The equation to which we allude is among three of the diffe--
rential co-efficients of the second order of the (unction which
expresses the sum of the moleculæ of the spheroid divided by
their distance from the point attracted; its integration gives
for this quantity a series containing two arbitrary fun6ttons
arranged according to the powers ot one of the co-ordinates
of the point attracted. By successively taking, in regard to
each of these variable quantities, the differential co-efficients
of the series which expresses the attractions exercised by the
spheroid in a direction parallel to the axes of the co-ordi
nates, C. Biot obtained developments of these attractions, de
termined entirely by three quantities, independent of the va
riable one, according to the powers of which the develop
ments are arranged.
   It thence results, 1st, that to have the attractions of any
spheroid on anv point of space, it is sufficient to take at pleasure
a plane, and to calculate the attractions of the spheroid on the
points situated in that plane: those which are within the
spheroid will determine the general expression os its attraction
on the interior points; the other will determine those which
belong to the exterior points.
   ad, That if two spheroids are such that their attractions
on all the pointsof the fame plane parallel to three rectan
gular axes arc to each other in a constant ratio, the attrac

tions of these spheroids on any point of space will preserve the
same ratio.
    These general theorems, when the question relates to re
volving spheroids, are modified in the following manner :
    To have the attraction of a revolving spheroid on any
point of space, it will be sufficient to know these attractions
on any point of a right line perpendicular to the axis of re
volution, and drawn through a point, taken at pleasure, in
that axis.
     If two revolving spheroids are such that their attractions
 on any point of the fame straight line, subject to the pre
 ceding conditions, are to each other in a consiant ratio, the
attractions exercised by these spheroids on any point of space
will retain the fame ratio.
     C. Biot applies in succeffion various theorems to any
 elliptical and revolving spheroids, and thence deduces the
 well-known theorems; then transforming, in a general
 manner, the variable quantities of his formulae, he con
 cludes, that to have the attraction of any spheroid on any
 point of space, it is sufficient to know, for the points of any
 surface that may be assumed at pleasure, the two first terms of
 the development of the function which expresses the sum of
 the moleculæ of the spheroid divided by their distance from
 the point attracted; and that, if there are two spheroids, the
attractions of which on the fame points of that surface are to
 each other in a ratio independent of the primitive co-ordi
nates, the attractions of the two spheroids on any point of
 the space whatever will be to each other in the same ratio.
 He concludes his memoir by the application of these last
theorems to revolving spheroids.

            VACCINE     INOCULATION IN WALES,
    The following account has been communicated from the
 learned  Dr. W. Turton, being an extract from a printed paper
 distributed in Swansea.
    "   Having very nearly lost my son in the small-pox from
 inoculation, I was naturally uneasy about the event of it in
 my daughter; and went to London, anxious to make the
 most minute inquiries concerning the success of the cow-pock,
 then lately established.   I examined the different hospitals
and institutions where it was practised, carefully watched
the progress of the disease, and attended Dr. Pearson to the
villaces near Oatlands, where upwards of three hundred
people, who never had the fmall-pox, were inoculated for
the cow-pock by the recommendation of the Duke: all of
these were again inoculated for the fmall-pox,      and without
                                                           effect.

Dr.    Pearson to send me, in a letter, some of his genuine
matter on a thread, that I might inoculate both uiy own
children,    for the satisfaction of all who might wish to have
evidence       of
                its effects: and (June 29, 1799) in the presence
of Mr. J. Collins, Mr. Braine, and the late apprentice of
Mr. Sylvester, I inoculated them both. The boy, who be
fore had had the small-pox, did not take it; but the little
girl, who never had either, went well through                     it,
                                                             without
any previous preparation, without any alteration in her food
or manner of living, and with only about two hours ill
ness.    She has since Deen inoculated for the small-pox, and
exposed in every manner to its infection, but                 certain

                      I
were two of Mr. Ayrton's           each of which

    *' After a lapse of three years, the author of these observa
tions cannot but congratulate himself and the public on the
unequivocal success which has attended his introducing the
cow-pock into this country.              Upwards of a thousand per
sons in the various towns of South-Wales have been ino
culated, without the smallest accident or interruption to
their health ; and the usual ravages from the fmall-pox are
manifestly diminisliing every year.

       "  MT DEAR SIR,                          Swansea, August 6, 1801,
    "  You will see by the inclosed, how      I from  time to time pro
mote the good cause.          1 have overcome all difficulties, and
manv     thousands     have   been   inoculated without one accident
or the   least apparent danger.         In some towns the whole o
the inhabitants,       not   having previously had the fmall-pox,
have confidently       taken   the cow-pock.       The fmall-pox has
not appeared here for some time, and I hope the day is not
far distant when it shall be declared criminal by the legislature
to introduce it. Whatever may be the opinion of any in
dividual as to the comparative safety of either, no map can,
now be justified in contaminating his neighbourhood,

                   INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS.
   On the 27th of August the magnificent docks at Black-
wall, which, in size and accommodation to shipping, ex
ceed every thing that now exists, were opened for the recep
tion of trie shipping in the West-India trade.
   By eleven o'clock the various avenues and roads leading to
the Isle of Dogs were crowded by multitudes, some on horse
back, others in gigs and curricles, but the greatest number
were pedestrians.        The   bustle apd confusion in     repairing ta

                        Internal  Improvements.                  305
lilackwall     were astonishing.     A little aster twelve o'clock,
ropes     were thrown    to  the  people on shore, in order to tow
 the Henry Addington-, a West-Indiaman lately launched,
 into the dock. The people laid hold of the cords; but the
 vessel    being large and heavy, it was some time before she
 could be moved, notwithstanding the Echo, a vessel from the
 West Indies deeply laden, had entered the great bason soon
 after eleven o'clock.         By the strenuous exertions of the
 people on shore, aided by a windlass on each side of the great
 floodgate, the vessel was at last brought near the entrance of
  the dock.      She was greeted by the populace on each side
  with loud and reiterated huzzas, and by the band of music
  belonging to the first regiment of guards, who played
                                                               " See,
  the conquering hero comes !"
      The vessel being by this time very near the great flood
  gate, a considerable delay took place before lhe was intro
  duced to the dock.        This, however, having been overcome,
  the people once more " gave way," and the ship came in
  amidst the shouts of the spectators, the band playing " God
  save the King," " Rule Britannia," &c. &c.               We never
   witnessed any thing more striking, and at the fame time so
   very picturesque,    as the passige of this vessel into the dock.
   She was decorated in the most splendid manner by the flags
   of all nations displayed in various parts of her rigging.
  Having come to her moorings at the first ring-bolt-buoy,
   stie fired a royal salute, which was answered by the shouts
   and huzzas of the spectators.
       The Echo, a vefiel, as we have mentioned above, deeply
   laden from the Wist Indies, was next towed in. She is a
   very handsome fliip, and was received with the loudest ex
   pressions of joy.      Upon this vessel reaching her station, an
   other salute was fired from the Henry Addington, which con
   cluded the business of the docks.       In the afternoon the com
   pany on board the vessels, and the various proprietors and com
   missioners of the docks, repaired to the London tavern, where
   a most elegant dinner was provided for their entertainment.
       The whole of the scene must have been highly gratifying
   to every well-wisher to the greatness of this country.       In the
   ihort space of two years, by the energy, the spirit, the
    wealth, and the perseverance of individuals, this imperial
   work, the proof ot past and the pledge of future prosperity,
    has been begun and almost finished.        New facilities to com
   merce are thus created from its former acquisitions, and a
   fresh activity is given to industry and to enterprise.       While
    property is thus rendered active, by liberty, and maintained
   secure by law (and what other source has commerce had in
                                                                   this

 this country but liberty and law?) it is impossible to set
 bounds to its operations and to its successes.
    At a public meeting held at Horsliam in Sussex on the
 18th of August, it was resolved, That acts of parliament
having been already obtained for making a canal navigation
from the Thames at Rotherhithe to Crovdon in Surry, it is
desirable that a canal should be made, to commence at the
termination of that canal at Croydon, and to pass from thence
to Portsmouth.        A subscription was immediately set on foot
to carry   the  design into execution.           /
    A very numerous and respectable meeting of gentlemen^
merchants, bankers, and others, was held at the Crown ami
Anchor in the Strand, on Thursday the 5th of August, to
 consider of the expediency of applying to parliament for an
 act to make a navigable canal from the grand junction canal
at Paddington, round the north of London, to communicate
with the London Docks at Wapping.                     Sir Christopher
Baynes, bart. was called to the chair, and laid before the
meeting a very satisfactory statement, not only of the plan
proposed, but of the means by which it may be accom
plished, together with estimates of the expense likely to at
tend its completion ; after which a committee of subscribers
was appointed to take the necessary measures for carrying the
plan into effect.       We forbear, in this early stage of so im
portant an undertaking, to prognosticate the various benefits
that may arise from          it,
                               although there seems an universal
opinion in its favour.
   We hope also to he able, at no very distant period, to an
nounce that the iron bridge of one arch over the Thames,
projected    by   Mr. Telsord,     isto be undertaken.      A perspec
tive view of the bridge has been published on very extensive       a
scale.  It   is   an admirable production, especially          the en
graved part*.     It    has received the approbation of the most
eminent mathematicians, as Dr. Mafkelyne, Dr. Hutton,
Mr. Robertson of Oxford, Mr. Atwood of London, Dr. Ro-
bison and Mr. Playfair os Edinburgh, and Mr. Coupland of
Aberdeen; which         is   sufficient justification of the principles
                             a
of   the  design.    Among the great, the king, the prince of
Wales,     the  duke   of York, and the duke of Kent, have flood
foremost     in  their  approbation.      The plate     now dedicated
                                                                  is

port of London would be the most perfect in the world. The
citv would be accommodated with wharfs and warehouses in
its centre, and the bridge would be a feature to distinguish it
from other cities. The completing the work of peace, the
intended dissolution of parliament, together with the neces
sary absence of Mr. Telford in making surveys in Scotland,
prevented the business of the bridge from being brought for
ward during the last session ; but it will probably in the
course of the next, or at least as soon as the scheme can be
fully matured.
     The Scotch surveys relate to improving and extending the
fisheries; establishing or improving harbours on the east and
west coasts for commercial and naval purposes ; opening an
 inland navigation from the Murray-frith to the bottom or the
 Sound of Mull, with a depth of water sufficient to carry the
 largest Baltic men, West- India men, and frigates; improv
 ing the land communications in the north by means of roads
 and bridges ; inquiries into the cause of emigrations, and
 modes to prevent them ; and improving the communications
 between Ireland and the west of Scotland and the north of
 England.      The surveys are still going on.
     These are certainly objects of national importance, and
  ministers deserve credit for bestowing attention upon them.
  They embrace a great portion of our internal improvements,
  on a scale which promises to promote the prosperity of the
  British empire.
      The opening the Caledonian canal would admit of the
  whole of the trade from the west of England and Scotland,
  and the whole of Ireland, passing in a direct and easy man
  ner to, and from the Baltic, instead of being exposed to the
  stormy and dangerous navigation of the Pentland-frith, the
  Orkneys, and northern parts of Scotland, which are parti
  cularly exposed in the time of war : and a naval station at
  Cromarty, Peterhead, or Aberdeen, would afford ready con
  voys, and guard the entrance of the Baltic; while the bay
  of Oban, on the coast of Argyle, would afford a safe ffielter
  on the west coast.      Nature has pointed out this line of
  country as particularly suitable for a canal of this magnitude,
  the distance between sea and sea being about 60 miles, in a
   direct line, out of which upwards of 37 miles are now navi
   gable locks capable of admitting ships of the largest dimen
   sions ; and the greatest height above the level of the sea does
   not exceed 100 feet.    The locks on and above the summit-
   level form reservoirs of about 30 miles in length ; and the
   waters of a large district of rainy country fall into the locks
   which form this reservoir.

     This inland navigation would also open a ready passage for
 the fishers of the East coast, to pass to the fishing-grounds on
 the West coast, and of course for those who reside on the
West to pass to the East side of the island ; so that the whole
would be as it were under one establishment. The execut
ing the works connected with the inland navigation, the
harbours, and bridges, would employ the people of the coun

for future employment, and be the best means of preventing
 emigration.

LTI.     On the Virgula Divlnatoria, or Divining Rod.           By
    William Phillips,            Esq. Read before the AJkesiav
    Society in the Session 1801.
      HE    virgula divinatoria, or divining rod, is a forked
branch,    or two {hoots or young branches of a fruit-bearing
tree, tied together at one end, and held by the other ends
one in each hand.         When held in a certain position, and
under certain circumstances, which I (hal| endeavour pre
sently to describe, it is said to discover the situation of metals,
&c. in the earth, by dipping as it approaches the place be
neath which they immediately lie.
    It is not known who was the discoverer of it ; but Agri
cola, in his Treatise De Re Metallica, supposes that it took
its rife from the magicians, who pretended to discover mines
by inchantment : others are of opinion that the discovery is
of later date, and that the inventor was hanged in Germany
as an impostor.      Be that as it may, no mention is made of
it earlier than the nth century; and though it has occa
sionally occupied attention for so long a time, yet the nice
ties attending its use according to the prescribed directions,
and probably, too, the difficulty of accounting for the effects
said to be produced by any plausible theory consistent with
the admitted laws of natural philosophy, may have retarded
its progress ; for it is now almost totally neglected.
    About the middle of the i8ih century it was ably sup
ported in France by De Thouvenel, who published a book
upon the subject, in which he endeavoured to substantiate
the virtue of the divining rod by the recital of about six hun
dred instances of its successful employment, principally by
himself or within his own knowledge ; and soon after by a
               of unimpeachable veracity, and a chemist, Wil-
  iam Cookworthv, late of Plymouth. The favourable opinion
J>hilosopher
he entertained of it was grounded, according to his own ac
count, as became a chemist, upon actual experiment.              It
appears that his experiments were frequently repeated, and
that the ease which he attained in using the virgula was the
means of his satisfying many intelligent men of its virtue, by
experiments for the discovery of pieces of metal hid in the
earth, as well as by the discovery of a copper mine near
Oakhampton, which was worked for several years.             Thus it
became introduced into Cornwall, where the discovery of
several mines is attributed to it ; and there are yet a few

$%%                  On the Vtrgula DivinaMia^
among the most intelligent practical miners in the county
who continue to believe in its virtue. The first knowledge
he procured of the rod was from a captain Rebeira, who de
serted the Spanish service in queen Ann's reign, and became
captain commandant of Plymouth garrison; and as Cook-
worthy's" veracity and abilities were unquestionable, and as
it undeniably appears that he made many experiments with,
the rod, it seems as if his account demands some degree of
confidence.      But the earlier writers who mention       appear             it,
to have supposed that its operation was the effect of magic;
and thence the cutting of          was, according to their direc
                                   it
tions, to be attended          the utterance of certain cabalistic
                              by
words and the performance of certain ceremonies they di                      :
rected      to be cut on
           it                certain day, and at
                              a                     certain hour,  a
from      atree of   acertain description, before sun-rise, about
the day of the annunciation of the Virgin Maty, but espe
cially with an increasing moon.            has, however, of later
                                                 It
times been agreed, that forked hazle rod, or two straight rods
                              a
of one year's growth, being most pliable, cut          the winter   in
and kept till they are dry, answer best     or,   these be not at
                                                      ;        if
hand, suckers of the apple or currant-tree, or shoots of the
peach-tree, willow, or oak, though green, will do tolerably
well, but those of the fruit-bearing trees are preferred. If the
rod be made of two separate shoots, they are tied together at
their larger ends with some vegetable substance        and these,      ;
it   issaid, answer better than those which grow forked, the
shoots of which, being rarely of equal size and length, do not
handle so well. The length of the rod         from %\ to  isfeet.                 3
   Upon         nice observation of the mode of holding the
                a
rod, prescribed          by
                       Cookworthy,     much seems to depend.
Having,    as has been observed, tied the larger ends of the
sticks together, the smaller are to be held one in each
hand, with that part of          which
                                   it       grasped   is  the hand      by
so turned as to be brought parallel to the horizon, and the
tied ends pointing upwards at an elevation of about 70 de
grees.    The more strongly the rod        grasped, the livelier
                                                     is                                      is
said to be its action   but

                                 peculiarly necessary to observe
                                  it   is
that     be grasped steaclilv and equally

movement or attraction of the rod          commenced, there be
                                                 it is
the least imaginable opposition to               jerk,

                    appears that    due   observance

much importance, and that the operation of the rod has in
many instances been defeated            jerk or counter-action

and thence, fays Pryce, in his Mtneralogia Cornubienfis, who
was " well convinced of its absolute and improveable vir
                                                                                    tues,"

tues,"        it
        has been concluded that there is no real efficacy ia
the rod. It must, he fays, be particularly observed, that as
our animal spirits are necessary to this process, so a man
ought to hold the rod with the same indifference and inatten
tion to, and reasoning about                        it,
                                         or its effects, as he holds
a  fishing-rod, or    walking-stick
                             a           for,    the mind be occupied
                                                     ;             if
by    doubts, reasoning, or any other operation that engages the
animal spirits,      will divest their powers from being exerted
                         it
in the process, in which their instrumentality                  absolutely         is
necessary: hence, he observes,                that the rod constantly
                                                     it       is
answers in the hands of peasants, women, and children, who
hold       simply, without puzzling their minds with doubts
          it
or reasonings.     Whatever, adds he, may be thought of this
observation,            very just one, and of great consequence
                        it   is   a
in the practice of the divining rod.
    Equipped as has been described, and duly observing the
foregoing directions, the person in search of metallic lode                   a
is   to walk steadily and flowly forward              and when he ap     ;
proaches      lode a   nearly as its semi-diameter, the rod,
                              so                                                               it    is
said, will feel loose in his hands, and be sensibly repelled to

         it
it  will continue to be repelled till his foremost foot            over the             is
edge of the lode and when this             the cafe,      the rod be held

rod back towards the face.            When the rod has been drawn
down, the hands must be opened, the rod raised                           the                  by

              it
     Pryce, at     123 of his Mineralogia Cornubienjis, informs
                        p.
us that many mines have been dilcovertd                     means of the      by
rod, and quotes several; but            must  be  observed that,
                                                   it                    his                  by
own account      of  the adventures, not       one   of them   turned   out
a  profitable concern and hence he takes occasion to observe,
                                      ;
that     it   isno means
                   by         disadvantage that the rod dips equally
                                          a
to poor as to
     a                rich lode, which he allows to be the cafe;
                             a
otherwise the great prizes in the mining lottery would soon
 be drawn, and future adventurers be discouraged.
     But though the rod          said to dip equally to
                                           is                 poor as to          a                  a

3H                    On the Virgula Divinatoria,
rich lode, it is not found to clip with the fame force to all
metals ; nor, indeed, does it appear to be confined to metals
alone, but that it is also attracted by coals, bones, lime
stone, and springs of water, with different degrees of strength,
m the following order: — I. Gold: %. Copper: 3. Iron:
4. Silver: 5. Tin : 6. Lead: 7. Coals: 8. Limestone and
springs of water.         The mode directed by Cookworthy for
proving this is the following : With the rod held according to
the prescribed rules, stand with one foot advanced, put under
it a guinea, and a halfpenny under the other, and the rod
¦will   oe drawn down forwards : if the pieces of money be
 shifted, it will still be attracted towards the gold, *. e. towards
 the face; which proves that the gold possesses the stronger at
 traction : and, by thus varying all the forementioned sub
 stances, the strength of their respective attractions will be
 found to correspond with the order in which they are placed.
      According to captain Rebeira, the virtue necessarily resi
 dent in the human body for the discovery of metals, &c. in
 the earth by means of the divining rod, is confined to but
 few persons; and Agricola very shrewdly insinuates, that
 where it does not act, it must be owing to some singular
 occult quality in the person.          Cookworthy and Pryce, how
 ever, assert that Rebeira was mistaken ; for that the virtue,
 as he calls    it,   residesin  all rods and in all persons, though
 not in every rod in the hands of every person.               Willow and
 other rods, fay they, not of fruit-bearing trees, that are not
 attracted     in the hands of those in which the fruit-bearing
 rods are attracted, will answer in the hands of those in which
  the fruit-bearing rods are not attracted;          so   that all persons
 possess   the  virtue.
      Isa piece of the fame wood as that of which the rod               is
  composed be placed under the arm,         it    will totally destroy the
  operation of    it,   except  in  the  instance  of water, for which
  any   rod,   they  say,  in any   hand    will  answer  ;  orif the least
  animal thread, as silk, or worsted, or hair, be placed on the
  top of the rod,     itwill prevent its operation but isa piece of
                                                    :
  the fame animal substance, or of the same wood as that of
  which the rod       ismade, provided the rod does not answer, be
  placed under the arm,       it   will ca-ise the rod to operate.      Isa
  piece of gold be held in the hand and touching the rod,               it
  will prevent its being attracted        by   that metal or by copper,
  for the rod will be repelled towards the face or   ;        ifiron, lead,
   tin, silver, limestone, bone, or coal, be held in like manner,
it     will also be. repelled, and vice versa.          If person with
                                                          a
   whom the rod does not naturally operate hold piece of gold

thus with respect to the other metals and substances; and
upon these properties of the rod depends its power of distin
guishing one metal or substance from another.                Another
mode however, grounded upon the same principles, is pointed
out as being much more ready and certain, viz. by preparing
rods that will only answer to some one of the aforementioned
substances.     The mode of preparing them is by boring a
small hole in the top of the rod, and by putting into it a
very small quantity of each substance except that aster which
search is to be made : the hole is then to be stopped up with
a piece of the fame wood of which the rod is made.              These
are the directions which Cookworthy has given for the use
of the divining rod.
   It is now but little if at all practised in this country : the
few among the curious, or among practical miners, who con
tinue to assert that it possesses an influence in the discovery
of ores, seem so far to have yielded to its opponents as to
have given up the use of it.       Two with whom I became ac
quainted in Cornwall still assert their belief in            it,
                                                           and that           it
has been the means of discovering mines there; and               third

which     isnow working under the town of Redruth               but:          it
must be acknowledged that there are many more among the
most intelligent miners who ridicule the rod, than believe in
the influence of minerals upon it. Taking                for granted,
                                                             it
however, that metals do act upon the rod to the fullest extent
of Cookworthy's belief,     it  still remains    question, notwith
                                                    a
standing the accommodating opinion of Pryce, whether                          it
would prove    a benefit to the miner, as      itallowed that

derived from   it, therefore, with regard to metallic veins seems
by   no means  a  counterbalance to the niceties and uncertain
ties attending its use;    for the projector, implicitly depending
upon the information of the rod, might, at ruinous expense,

not, and being desirous of annexing to this account of the
divining rod any little testimonial of my own experience,

afford,

and laid them by till they became dry; when, having tied two
together with a vegetable substance, I proceeded to endeavour
the discovery of some pieces of metal : but repeated trials,
both by others and myself, afforded us no opportunity of
becoming convinced by experience that metals possess any
influence upon the rod; aud we were obliged, in giving up
the trial, to acknowledge that we possessed those " singular
occult faculties" which, according to Agricola, in some peo
ple prevent its action. It would, however, be an absurd and
unwarrantable conclusion, to assert that the accounts which
have been handed to us have been fabricated merely to excite
our wonder, because those effects which have been asserted
to accompany the use of the rod occasionally have not, in
these few instances,    been observed.  Yet it has so long been
 considered the prerogative of human reason to deny what
 cannot be explained, that it is with much difficulty we can
 admit as fact, however respectable the authority, that of
 which we have no ocular or sensible testimony, or for which
no physical cause has been assigned. Two centuries ago who
 would have believed in the existence of the electric fluid ? or
 who, if ocular demonstration were wanting, would not deny
 the incomprehensible attraction of the magnet ? Philosophy,
 like fanaticism, has its prejudices, and has often rejected as
 impossibilities what have afterwards been confirmed by experi
 ence.    But so stronglv does the respectability of its advocates
 claim a favourable opinion as to the real existence of the
 virtues ascribed to the divining rod, that, though it seems
 impossible wholly to admit their testimony, it seems eqaally
 so wholly to reject it.
   The faculty of subterraneous discovery has been referred to
the theory of effluvia, cr to the corpuscular philosophy, for
explanation   ;  but it seems onlv to have been hypothetically
 referred to an hypothesis.    For, in the first place, although
 the asserted effects of the rod have been copiously described,
 a definition of its modus ageridi, where it will act, has been
 wanting, nor have we been told what particular constitu
 tional defe£ts have in most cafes prevented its acting at all j
 and secondly, the theory of the corpuscular philosophv, though
 perhaps it may be impossible wholly to reject            it,
                                                        has never
 been completely admitted.       Rebeira permitted persons to fee
 him use the rod, but would discover no more and neither
                                                      ;
 Cookworthy nor Prvce has said whether, as the practiser in
 the divining art approaches        spot under which springs or
                                    a
 metals lie hid, he feels any internal sensations: but Thouve-
 nel has more completely provoked doubt,             by
                                                    asserting that

                      or   Divining Rod.                      327-
are felt, at the same time that an external motion is commu
nicated to the rod.   These singular emotions, none of which
were observed to take place, when he was above stagnant wa
ters were followed by head-ache, fatigue of body, debility of
mind, and other symptoms of nervous irritation.     The dry
state of the atmosphere, also favourable to electric experi
ments, was observed to render him more active and lively ia
his prognostics; but a full meal evidently diminished the ca
pacity ; and an inflammatory fever, which confined him a
fortnight to his bed, deranged or destroyed the miraculous
power for the space of three months.         From these circum
stances it should seem that its action is dependent on some
peculiar nervous sensibility ; that our faith or our imagination
should be prepossessed in its favour, according to Pryce ; and
that much depends on an harmonious distribution of the
animal spirits, devoid of anxiety or reasoning respecting the
event : but that a state of doubt is an obstruction to its opera
tion.   These, perhaps, may be the principal difficulties ia
using the divining rod ; but we arc assured by Cookworthy
and Pryce, that, regarding these and other essentials in its
use, a rod may be found adapted to the peculiar system of
every person.
   Difficult, however, as is the admission of belief in the as
serted virtue of the divining rod, and little as it has been un
derstood by those who have most ably espoused its cause, it
may not be amiss just to trace the outlines of that theory to
which it has been by them referred for explanation, that of
the corpuscular philosophy, which is a mode of accounting
for the phænomena of nature by the motion, figure, rest,
position, &c. of the corpuscules or minute particles of mat
ter. Boyle sums up the chief principles of this hypothesis
in the following particulars: — J ft, That there isbut one ca
tholic or universal matter, which        an extended, impene
                                        is
trable, and divisible substance, common to all bodies and ca
pable of all forms.      2d, That this matter, in order to form
the vast variety of natural bodies, must have motion in some
or all of its assignable parts; and that this motion was given
to matter  by  the Creator of all things, and has all manner of
directions and tendencies. 3d, Matter must also be actually
divided into parts, and each of these primitive particles, frag
 ments, or atoms of matter, must have its proper magnitude
or size, as also its peculiar figure or shape.   4th, It is sup-,
posed that these differently sized and soaped particles may
 have different orders and positions, whereof great variety may
arise in the composition of bodies. (Encyclopædia Britannica.)
 Pryce, ia his Mineralogia Cornubienjis, gives the. following
                               X4                        account

     account of the mode         in which these corpuscules or minuts
     impenetrable     and divisible particles of matter act through the
     medium of       the human body or nerves, or by the assistance of
      the animal spirits, upon the divining rod. " The corpuscules,
      it is said, that rise from the minerals, entering the rod, de
      termine it to bow down, in order to render it parallel to
     the vertical lines which the effluvia describe in their rise.
      In effect, the mineralogical particles seem to be emitted from
      the earth : now the virgula, being of a light porous wood,
      gives an easy passage to those particles, which are very fine
       and subtle : the effluvia, then, driven forwards by those that
      follow them, and pressed at the same time by the atmosphere
       incumbent on them, are forced to enter the little interstices
       between the fibres of the wood, and by that effort they oblige
       it to incline or dip down perpendicularly, to become parallel
       to those little columns which the vapours form in their rife.'1
       If  this jargon, this fabric of unintelligible conclusions, raised
       upon the slender foundation of pre-suppojition, be not suffi
       ciently absurd, I beg leave to refer to page 1140s Pryce's
       work, where he attempts an elucidation or the corpuscular
       theory.
            If an advocate for this theory, as applied for solving tho
       cause of the operation of the divining rod, were to be asked
       •why hazel rods, aud branches of other trees said to be at
       tracted by metals, are not attracted by them in their natural
       growth ; and why, consequently, they do not grow with their
       top declining towards the earth, I seel at a loss to conceive
       what would be the answer.           Would he say that the vis
       inertia of matter is not sufficiently powerful to overcome the
       living principle of the tree? or would he not say that the
       human body is an excellent conductor of those minute par
        ticles or corpuscules, which, according to Hartley, are per
       petually flying off from all bodies, for ever seeking new com?
        binations, and of the fame catholic matter forming an infi
        nite variety of modifications throughout the universe ? Some
        conclusion, equally satisfactory and philosophical, might be
        expected from the hypothetical advocates of this theory ; and
        as, in all probability, this theory cannot be established by
        ocular demonstration, or by any means be made manifest to
        our senses, it seems as if it were better to acknowledge, if
        really there be any virtue in the rod, that, as in the instances
        of the magnetical influence and the electric fluid, it is one
        of those mysterious effects of the mysterious laws by which
        nature is governed, inscrutable to human, wit, and indefinable
        by human investigation.

LIII.     Messrs.   Collard        and   Fkaser's      Process   for pre
                      paring   the  Weld Yellow * .
   JL HERE is not to be found, either in the vegetable or
mineral kingdoms, any other substance which yields so ele
gant a yellow colour as the weld, or, as it is written by some,
         j
would or dyer's weed. The weld is of the resedian tribe, and
is cultivated with care in Kent, Herefordshire, and many other
parts of the kingdom.          The principal consumers are dyers,
calico-printers, and colour-makers.             The plants are dried by
the growers, tied up in parcels weighing from 30 to 50 pounds
each, and are sold, to use the language of the trade, at so
 much a bundle.
     This is a very injudicious practice ; for it is the small feeds
 of the plant only which afford the colouring matter, a great
 portion of which are shaken out in the package, and even in
 moving the bundles from one place to another.                Besides, the
 plant altogether occupies so much room, that the carriage of
 the useless stalks for a hundred miles, by land, amounts to
 more than five per cent, upon the article ; whereas the feeds
 m a quantity occupying a space of six feet square would by
 no means fill a half peck measure.
     The weld yellow is a water-colour, principally used by
          hanging manufacturers for elegant work.               An oil co-
^
   our
1>aper- has never    been prepared     from   the weld.    A   preparation
 of weld yellow in oil would be a valuable acquisition ; for the
 patent oil colour, made from a very old recite, by fusing the
 oxide pf lead with the muriate of ammonia in the proportion
 of about one pound of the former to three ounces of the latter,
  appears as vile as brick dust when compared to the weld
  yellow.
     The weld yellow made in London is sold in hard lumps,
  and must be ground before it is fit for use.            Now it is well
  known that every colour suffers, in some degree, by that ope
  ration.    By the following process the most beautiful weld
  yellow may be prepared, which will fall into a fine powder,
  and will want no grinding.
     Take of pure carbonate of lime (fine washed whiting) any
          quantity, e.g. let it be four pounds ; put it into a copper
    oiler, and add to it four pounds of soft water : put a fire
  fiven
  under the copper and raise it to a boiling heat, and keep stir-
  Ting with a deal stick till the whiting be completely divided,
  anu forms with the water a consistence quite smooth.               Then

330            Process for preparing     the  Weld Yellout.
add for each pound of whiting three ounces of alum previously
pulverized tolerably fine. The alum must be added gradually,
and the operator (hould keep stirring with his deal stick
during the administration; for a double decomposition is
effected, accompanied with effervescence, and carbonic acid
is discharged.       Thus, if the alum were not administered gra
dually, the boiler would overflow with the violence of the ef
fervescence ; and, if the whiting were not well divided previous
to the introduction of the alum, the distribution amongst the
whiting would be unequal, and the colour would be injured.
When the alum is all introduced, and the effervescence has
ceased, the basis is properly prepared.           The sire may be then
drawn, and it may remain for any length of time without in
jury, till the other materials are ready. Having thus prepared
 the basis, take the welds, place them, with their roots upper
most, in another copperboiler, pour in soft water enough tocover
every part containing seed, and let them boil not more than
 fifteen minutes : then take them out, place them, with their
 roots uppermost, in a tub to catch the liquor which runs from
them, and pass the liquor in the copper, with what runs from
 the welds in the tub, through a flannel filter, to intercept the
 feeds and fæcula ; and thus the colouring matter is prepared.
     It is impossible to say what quantity ot welds should be em
 ployed to any given quantity of whiting, for some bundles
 •will contain three times as much feed as others.           It is well,
 however, to know, that if too much colouring matter be
 prepared, it may be kept in an earthen or deal vessel for many
 weeks, without sustaining any injury.
     Having filtered a sufficient quantity of the weld liquor, put
 a fire under the boiler containing the basis, and add the weld
 liquor till the colour be obtained.          When sufficient colour-.
 ing   matter   is added  to the basis,   the fire should be raised to a
 boiling    heat,  and  the  work is  finished.    In order to be satis
 fied when the greatest strength of colour is obtained, for there
 is a ne plus ultra, take a little out on chalk, which will absorb
 the moisture instantly ; when it may be laid on paper with a
 brush, and viewed perfectly dry in a few minutes.
     The contents of the furnace should be then put into a deal
 or earthen vessel to precipitate. The next day the liquor may
  be poured off, and the colour may be placed on large pieces
  of chalk, which in a few hours will absorb the moisture, and
  it will then be sit for use or sale.
     The liquor poured off from the colour may, with the addi
  tion of water, be used again, and the old welds may be boiled
  a second time, and taken out previous to the addition of fresh
  welds, so that no colouring matter will be lost.

    In the preceding process, the greatest care should be taken
that no iron be suffered to come in contact with the colour;
for the gallic acid or astrineent principle, which eminently
abounds in this vegetable, will instantly dissolve iron, and the
smallest particle os that metal is fatal to the delicacy of the
weld yellow.

    Metalltne    Subjlances which at different Times are said to

               Examination         of the Stone   from Sienna.
     ^  HE    external     coating of this stone appeared to have the
 fame characters as that of the stone from Benares.
     The pyrites, although certainly present, were not crystal
 lized in such groups as in the preceding stone; nor could
 they be separated by mechanical means.
     The attractable metal was easily separated by the magnet;
 but 8* grains only were collected. I treated them with nitric
 acid and ammonia, as in the preceding cafe. 'Nearly one grain
 of earthy matter was insoluble ; the weight was therefore re
 duced to rather. less than eight grains.                The oxide of iron,
 precipitated by       ammonia,       weighed eight grains; and the sa
 line liquor gave         abundant      indications ot nickel.      As eight
 grains    of  this   oxide   of   iron  contain nearly six of metal, the
 quantity of nickel in the bare eight grains may be estimated
 between one and two grains.                  Some globular bodies were
 extracted,    but   too  few   to  analyse.
     Since the pyrites could not bs separated, I collected 150
 grains of the stone, freed from iron by the magnet, and as
 exempt as possible from globular bodies. These 150 grain*
  I first digested with muriatic acid, that the pyrites might be
  decomposed,       and every thing taken up which could be dis
 solved by     that    menstruum.          A very decided disengagement
 of sulphureted hydrogen gas was occasioned.                When the acid
  could produce       no   further    action,   I collected the undissolved
  matter   on  a  filter,  and    boiled   it  with   the most   concentrate
  nitric acid,   in   hopes   of   being    able  to  convert  the   sulphur,
  previously liberated, into sulphuric acid : but my endeavours
  were fruitless; for, upon the addition of nitrate of barytes
  to the nitric solution, rendered previously transparent, a very
                                                                insignificant

 33*                 Experiments and Observations
insignificant    quantity of sulphate of barytes was obtained.
The    surplus of barytic nitrate was removed by sulphate of
 potash.    I next completely edulcorated the mass which re
mained insoluble after the action of the muriatic and nitrie
acids; and, adding        the water of edulcoration to the muriatic
and nitric liquors, evaporated the whole for silica. 1 then
submitted the mass, undissolved by the acids and the water,
to the treatment with potash, muriatic acid, and evaporation,
which was, in the first instance, applied to the stone from
Benares.      The first precipitation was, as in that analysis, also
effected with carbonate of potash ; but, instead of endeavour
ing immediately to extract alumina, I ignited the precipitate,
that the alumina or silica remaining might be rendered in
soluble.    After the ignition, I separated the oxide of iron
with very concentrate muriatic acid ; and the earths, which
were left perfectly white, I heated with potash, until they
were again capable of being taken up by the same acid. The
solution so made was slowly evaporated ; and, as very nearly
every thing was deposited during the evaporation, I conclude
all was silica. The proportions resulting from this single ana
lysis, without the weight of sulphur contained in the pyrites

   The mechanical        separation  of   the substances in this stone
being   as difficult   as in the preceding cafe, I was necessarily
fetished   with submitting it to the same treatment.            I col
lected, however, 34 grains of malleable particles; which, by
the process already more than once mentioned, left four grains
of earthy matter; and, by yielding 37 \ of oxide of iron, in

   The probability of never being able to obtain another spe
cimen of the very remarkable fragment of this substance, did
not allow me to trespass more on the liberality of Mr. Gre-
ville, than to detach a small portion.       I sound it of similar
composition to that of the three preceding stones ; and the
count de Bournon has already shown the proportionate
quantity of the attractable metal to be very considerable.

    The  unusual   increase  of weight in the    result  of the three
last analyses, notwithstanding the entire loss of the sulphur
in the pyrites, is obviously owing to the metallic state of the
iron combined with the sulphur, as was shown in a former
instance.
    I have now concluded the chemical examination of these
four extraordinary substances.        It unfortunately differs from
the analysis made by the French academicians, of the stone
 presented to them by the abbe Bachelay, as well as from that
 made by professor Barthold of the stone of Ensistieim.          It is
 at variance with that of the academicians, inasmuch as they
 found neither magnesia nor nickel.          It differs from that of
 Mr. Barthold, as he did not find nickel, but discovered some
 lime, with 17 per cent, of alumina.          With regard to these
 differences, I have to submit to the chemical world, whether
magnesia might not have eluded the action of an acid, when
 the aggregation of the integrant parts of the stone was not
 destroyed by treatment with potash.         As to the existence of
 alumina, I do not absolutely deny it; yet I must observe,
 that the whole of the earth which seemed to have any re
 semblance, however small, to alumina, was at most 3 per
 cent., and there seems good reason to consider it as silica.
  Respecting the existence of lime in the stone of Ensisheim, I
  mult appeal to professor Barthold, whether, supposing lime a
  constituent part, sulphate of lime should not have been formed,
                                                                    a*

3JJ4             Experiments and Observations
as well as sulphate of magnesia, when sulphuric acid was ge
nerated by igniting the earths and pyrites. And, as to the
              of alumina in the fame stone, I would ask, at
  east, whether it would have been so considerable if the solu
f>roportion
tions formed by acids, after the treatment with potash, had
been evaporated to the requisite dryness : not to observe,
that no mention is made of any examination of the properties
of the earth called alumina. In the proportion of magnesia
I   have the satisfaction to find my analysis correspond very
nearly with that of professor Barthold ; and, if what he con
sidered alumina were supposed silica, the stone presented to
the French academy, the stone of Enfisheim, and the four         I
have examined, would agree very nearly in siliceous propor
tions.    With respect to the nickel, I am confident it would
have been found in all, had the metallic particles been sepa
rately examined. But, whatever be these variations, the mi«
neralogical description of the French academicians, of Mr.
Barthold, and of the count de Bournon, all exhibit a striking
conformity of character, common to each of these stones;
and I doubt not but the similarity of component parts, espe
cially of the malleable alloy, together with the near approach
of the constituent proportions of the earths contained in each
of the four stones, the immediate subject of this paper, will
establish very strong evidence in favour of the assertion, that
they have fallen on our globe. They have been found at
places very remote from each other, and at periods also suffi
ciently distant. The mineralogists who have examined them
agree that they have no resemblance to mineral substances
properly so called, nor have they been described by mineralo-
gical authors. I would further urge the authenticity of ac
counts of fallen stones, and the similarity of circumstances
attendant on such phænomena ; but to the impartial it would
be superfluous,    and, to those who disbelieve whatever they
cannot explain, it would be fruitless. Attempts to reconcile
occurrences of this nature with known principles of philo
sophy, it is true, are already abundant ; but (as the earl of
Bristol has well expressed) they leave us a choice of difficulties
equally perplexing.      Itis,  however, remarkable that doctor
 Chladni, who seems to have indulged in these speculations
with most success, should have connected the descent of fallen
 stones with .meteors; and that, in the narrative of Mr. Wil
 liams, the descent of the stones near Benares should have
 been immediately accompanied with      a   meteor.
    No luminous appearance having been perceived during the
 day on which the stone fell in Yorkshire,         must be admit-
                                               it
 teci, rather militates against  the idea that these stones are the
                                                        substances

          e>«   certain Stony and   Metalline   Substances'.    33$
substances which produce or convey the light of a meteor, or
that a meteor mull necessarily accompany them *.    Yet the
stones from Sienna fell amidst what was imagined lightning,
but what might in reality have been a meteor.          Stones were
also found after the meteor seen in Gascony, in July 1790.
And Mr. Falconet, in the memoir I have already quoted,
relates, that the stone which was adored as the mother of
the gods, was a bœtilia; and that it fell at the feet of the
poet Pindar, enveloped in a ball of fire.         He also observes,
that all the bœtilia had the fame origin.
   I   ought not, perhaps, to suppress, that in endeavouring to
form an artificial black coating on the interior surface of one
of the stones from Benares, by sending over it the electrical
charge of about 37 square feet of glass, it was observed to
become luminous, in the dark, for nearly a quarter of an
hour ; and that the track of the electrical fluid was rendered
black.      I by no means wish to lay any stress upon this cir
cumstance ; for I am well aware that many substances be
come luminous by electricity.
     But, should it ever be discovered that fallen stones are ac
 tually the bodies of meteors, it would not appear so problema
 tical, that such masses as these stones are sometimes repre
 sented, do not penetrate further into the earth : for meteors
 move more in a horizontal than in a perpendicular direction ;
 and we are as absolutely unacquainted with the force which
 impels the meteor, as with the origin of the fallen stone.
     Before I close this subject, I may be particularly expected
 to notice the meteor which, a few months ago, traversed the
 county of Suffolk.      It was said that part of it fell near Saint
 Edmundsbury, and even that it set fire to a cottage in that
 vicinity. It appeared, from inquiries made on the spot, that
 something, seemingly from the meteor, was, with a degree
 of reason, believed to have fallen in the adjacent mea
 dows ; but the time of the combustion of the house did not
  correspond with the moment of the meteor's transition.          A
 phænomenon much more worthy of attention has since been
 described in the Philosophical Magazine.         On the night of
  the 5th of April 1800, a body wholly luminous was seen,
  in America, to move with prodigious velocity. Its apparent
  size was that of a large house, 70 feet long; and its elevation
  above the surface of the earth about 200 yards.          The light
  produced effects little short of sun-beams ; and a considerable
  degree of heat was felt by those who saw         it,
                                                     but no electric
  sensation.    Immediately after    it disappeared in the north -

 made either of meteor or lightning.

west,    a violent rushing noise was heard, as if the phænofne^
non    were bearing down the forest before it ; and, in a few
seconds after, there was a tremendous crash, causing a very
sensible earthquake.        Search being afterwards made in the
place   where   the  burning   body fell, every vegetable was found
burnt, or greatly scorched, and a considerable portion of th$
surface os the earth broken up.             We have to lament that
the authors of this account did not search deeper than the
surface of the ground.          Such an immense body, though
moving in a horizontal direction, could not but be buried to
a considerable depth. Should it have been more than the
semblance of a body of a peculiar nature, the lapse of ages
may perhaps effect what has now been neglected ; and its
magnitude and solitary situation become the astonishment of
future philosophers.
    This leads me to speak of the solitary mass of what has
been called native iron, which was discovered in South Ame
rica, and has been described by Don Rubin de Celis.                 Its
weight was about 15 tons. The fame author mentions an
other insulated mass of the fame nature. The whole account
is exceedingly interesting ; but, being already published in
the Philosophical Transactions for the year J 788, it needs
not   be here repeated.
    Mr. Proust    has shown    the mass particularly described, not
to be wholly iron, but a mixture of nickel and iron.               The
trustees of the British Musæum, who are in possession of some
fragments of this mass, sent to the Royal Society by Don
Rubin de Celis, have done me the honour to permit me to
 examine them ; and 1 have great satisfaction in agreeing with
a chemist so justly celebrated as Mr. Proust.

       SIR,                                       Dublin, Aug. 8, 180*.
    F the following philosophic investigation of some curious
 phænomena be adapted to your excellent publication, the
 Philosophical Magazine, it is at your service.
    Os all the phænomena exhibited by nature in her various
 operations, there are none more curious and extraordinary
                                                                  than

than those represented bv the reflection and refraction of light
from fogs and vapours arising from the sea, lakes, and- morales,
replete with marine and vegetable salts.      For such vapours, l>y
means of the said salts, form various polistied surfaces, which
reflect and refract the light of the fun, and even the moon, in
various directions; thereby not only distorting but multiplving
the images of objects represented to them in a most surprising
manner; forming not onlv images of castles, palaces, and
other buildings, in various styles of architecture, but the most
beautiful landscapes, spacious woods, groves, orchards, mea
dows, with companies of men and women, with herds of
cattle, walking, standing, lying, &c., and all painted with
such an admirable mixture of light and (hade that it is im-
poflible to form an adequate conception of the picture with
out feeing : not any scenery represented bv the camera objeura
can be more beautiful, or more like faithful representations
of nature.
    Though these curious and elegant phænomena are not pe
culiar to any age or country, they are more frequently seen
on the sea-coasts; and though in some respects common in
 such situations,   they have hitherto been so liftle noticed by
 the intelligent part of mankind as to be scarce known to exist.
 The only ones which seem at present to have attracted the
 attention of the curious, are those frequently, during the
 summer season, seen on the southern coasts of Italy, near
 the antient city of Rhegium; and even to this attention they
 were directed by the fishermen and country peasants, who in
 their native tongue call xh^m fata morgana, or damajata mor
gana *. They are, however, frequently noticed by the Eng
 lish, Erse, and Irish peasants, fishermen, and manners; and
 denominated in the languages of the two latter feadhreagb
 matretbmbe, or sea fairies, and duna feadhreagb, fairv castles.
 The Erse fishermen among the western ifles of Scotland fre
 quently fee represented on barren heaths and naked rocks
 beautiful fieJds, woods, and castles, with numerous flocks
 and herds grazing, and multitudes of people of both sexes in
 various attitudes and occupations.      These, as they know no
 such objects really exist, they constantly attribute to inchant-
 ment, or the fairies. They are also frequently seen on the
 coasts of Norway, Ireland, and Greenlandf.           On the eastern
 and western coasts of South America, even on the highest
 summit of the Andes, the fata morgana is met with.                Also
 far out at sea, in the midst of the Atlantic and Pacific
 oceans, the adventurous mariner sometimes observes them ;

 and though well known under the name of fog banks, yet
 has their appearance been so imposing as to illude the nicest
 scrutiny, and to promise refreshments to the fatigued and
 sea-worn mariner which he could not obtain.                   The most
 antient account of these aerial castles and islands which
 has been transmitted to us, is 4ie representation of a beau
 tiful island situated nearly in the middle of the Atlantic
 ocean, between the coasts of Ireland and Newfoundland,
 first observed by some Danish and Irish fishermen about the
 year 900, and from that period to the commencement of the
 14th century frequently by the Anglo-Saxon, English, and
 French fishermen and mariners*.
     But, as this island could never be approached, it was called
 the incbantcd island, and supposed by the maritime inhabi
 tants of Scotland, Ireland, France, and Spain, to be the
 country of departed spirits, and consequently denominated in
 Erse F/alb Innis, or the Noble Island; in Irish Hy Brajil,
 or the Country of Spirits; by the Anglo-Saxons, Icockanc,
 or the Country in the Waves; and by the French and Spa
 niards, who supposed it to consist of two distinct islands,
 Brajil and AJJ'manda, or the Islands of Ghosts. And so
 much persuaded were geographers of the 16th and 17th cen
 turies of tfuir real existence, that they have place in all or
 most of the maps ot the Atlantic in those periods; and even
 in the last century De l'Isle, the French geographer, in his
 maps has placed them as follows : Brasil, lat. 51s north, long.
 i°cast of Fcrror; and Assmunda, lat. 46 30' north, lone. 35 6°
 east of Ferror.      Even so late as about the year 1750 an Eng
 lish ship, returning from Newfoundland,             near lat. 30 north
 discovered an island not heretofore known, which not only
 appeared fertile, but covered with verdant fields and shady
 woods, among which cattle were seen to graze ; and only the
 appearance ot a violent surge hindered the captain and crew
 from landing, according to their desires. So well convinced,
 however, were they of its real existence, that, on arriving at
 London, ships were ordered out to complete the discovery :
 but no island could be found, nor has any land been disco
 vered in that track from that time to the present.             Commo
 dore Byron, in his Voyage round the World, mentions a fog
 bank in a high southern latitude, which appeared like an
 island, with capes and mountains, deceiving the most expe
 rienced seamen on board for some time.
     From these evidences of the frequent appearance of the
fata morgana, I (hall proceed to describe some seen near

the town    of Youghal, in     the county of Cork, Ireland, in the
years 1796,     1797, and 1801, according to the annexed views
(fee Plate   VIII.j    drawn on the spot by a young lady, on*
among numbers of the spectators.            The first was seen on the
31st of October 1796, about four o'clock in the afternoon,
the sun clear: it appeared oif a hill, on the county of Water-
ford side of the river, and seemed a walled town with a round
tower, and a church with aspire; the houses perfect, and
the windows distinct.        Behind the houses appeared the mast
of a ship, and in the front a single tree, near which was a
cow grazing; whilst the Waterforil hills appeared distinctly
behind.      In the space of about half an hour the spire and
round tower became covered with domes, and the octagonal
building, or rather round tower, became a broken turret.
Soon after this change, all the houses became ruins, and
their fragments seemed scattered in the field near the walls:
the whole in about an hour disappeared, and the hill on
which it stood sunk to the level of the veal field. The hill
and trees appeared of a bright green, the houses and tower*
of a clear brown, with their roots blue.
    On the 9th of March 1797, another similar phænomenon
 was observed by the same person, in company with several
 others, about eight o'clock in the morning, on the sea, south
 east of the town of Youghal.            It had the appearance of a
walled town situated on a hill.           On one side were houses in
 ruins,   and  the  ruins of a  castle which   seemed to fall into the
 sea.   In the middle were two towers broken, on one of which
 was a flag riving, with houses in ruins between them and
 the castle.     On the south were walls and a round tower with
 windows, which appeared broken in the middle.                The hill
 on which the whole scene was placed was green and brown,
 and the buildings purple and brown, clear and brilliant,
much resembling a transparent painting.               The wall which
 surrounded the town was of a darker brown, with great holts
 as if made by cannon shot.            The sea was calm and serene,
 and the whole together formed a charming view;, but it is
 not known how long the scene continued, as the party was
 obliged to leave the strand before it vanislied.           What in
 creased the beauty of the scene was the fineness of the morn
 ing, and the ships which appeared to pass behind it.
    In June 1801, about five o'clotk on a fine morning, all the
 coast opposite the river of Youghal, on the Waterrord side,
 was covered with a dense vapour : that on the right next the
 sea had the representation      of an alpine country ; the distant
 scarpv   mountains    seemed   covered   with snow, whilst the fore
 ground, of brown colour,
               a                   resembled  woods and a cultivated

J40             Reflection and RefraiTion of Light
country.     Soon the snow was seen to roll down the fides of
 the mountains into the valleys beneath, and left the gray
 rocks of the mountains naked and sharp.          As the fun in
 creased in power, the vapour vanished.        On the left, the
 river and adjacent country were also covered with a vapour,
 but of quite different appearance from the former.          The
 country seemed laid out in lawns and improvements, in
 which were situated three gentlemen's feats; the houses well
 defined, the windows and doors distinct; some of the win
 dows appeared open, and brass knockers were seen on the
 doors.    From the houses were- beautiful shrubberies bordered
 with    white  Chinese paling; behind the shrubberies were
 forests of pines; and distant mountains, in fine perspective,
 closed the scene. Before the houses in the lawns were clumps
 of sine forest trees. In about half an hour two of the houses
 vanished, and the clumps in front disappeared, and in their
 place a fine oak sprang up, which was the last that quitted
 the scene.    The sun becoming powerful, the vapour was ra
 refied, and the entire magic disappeared.
    The two formtr of the exhibitions of {he fata morgana
 were evidently caused by the reflection of some of the build
 ings and other parts of the town of Youghal in a dense va
 pour or fog strongly illuminated by the fun.     But in order to
 have an adequate idea of the nature of the phænomenon, let
 AG (fig. 1.) be a fog bank or dense vapour, whose surface
 next the sun is uneven, and formed of a variety of plane*
 capable of reflecting light, as AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and
 FG.     Let O   be a  house and tree.  Now,  by the laws  of op
 tics, isa spectator be so situated, as at T, that the reflective
 rays proceeding from the incident ones OG, OF, &c. meet
 the eye of the spectator at I, the image of the house and tree
 at O will be multiplied into the town vr, in which, if the
 surface DE is cylindrical and somewhat irregular at the top,
 the image of the house will be transformed into a tower, and
 the roof into a spire, with the chimney a flag.     Also, if any
 of the other planes be imperfect, the images reflected there
 from will be imperfect, and the houses appear in ruins.        If
 the spectator moves from I to L, and during that time the
 air should change any of the surfaces, the representation will
 be somewhat changed ; the image of O, from the plane DE,
 will become a tower with a dome, and the whole will appear
 as at xy.    As the wind changes the form of the fog, or the
  position of the fun or clouds alters the lights, the entire re
 presentation will disappear, or suffer considerable changes ;
 on which account none of those aerial exhibitions continue
 any length of time, and always in calm weather and a clear

fkv, if the picture is brilliant ; for, though those fog banks
often appear in dark or cloudy weather, the reflection is im
perfect, and represents only confused images of rocks, moun
tains, and capes.    Though distant objects are reflected, those
immediately under or behind will be refracted.          Thus in
fig. 2. if a vapour rests upon an horizontal plane AB, the
point B will be refracted to a, when the plane will represent
a hill to a spectator at I.     The scenery may also be repre
sented by retraction only; for, if the fog or vapour should
contain two smooth surfaces opposite to each other, in the
manner of a double concave lens, objects will be seen re
fracted, though much diminished in apparent magnitude;
and if one or both of the concave surfaces should be com
posed of different inclined planes, a finale object will be va
riously multiplied and transformed.       Thus let AB (fig. 3.)
represent a vapour, whose surfaces are concave and transpa
rent, but of different faces, as CD, DE, and EF, the object
M will be seen by a spectator at G small and at a great di
stance beyond M, and multiplied as at PQ.          And this cafe
was exhibited from a bog vapour in the county of Kildare in
the year 1787. About eleven o'clock in the morning, the fun
(hining clear, a hill appeared, about a mile distant, covered
with trees and houses, where it was known there was only
a plain field ; the phænomenon being caused by a house and
garden refracted through a dense and racetwise concave vapour
arising from the bog.
   These phænomena are also frequently caused by the light
refracted through the crystalline parts of the vapour, without
any of the adjacent objects being either refracted or reflected.
For the vapour, being formed into different parts, the light
refracted   through them causes the confused appearance of
ruins, houses, woods, lawns, &c. in the fame manner as a
board covered in an irregular manner with black and white
spots mixed with lines, will at a certain distance resemble a,
landscape with woods, ruins, houses, trees, castles, &c, and
under such imposing forms as to appear real representations.
Of this species of the fata morgana seem lo be those seen at
Youghal in 1801 before spoken of : but in whatever manner
the representations from vapours and fogs are formed, the
weather must be calm and serene, otherwise the vapours will
foe broken and dispersed by the wind.

LVI. An       Essay on the Colours obtained from the metallic
    Oxides, and fixed by Fusion on different vitreous Bodies.
    By Alexander Brogniart, Director of the National
    Manufactory of Porcelain at Sevres, Engineer of Mines,
T.HE         art of employing metallic oxides for colouring by
fusion different vitreous matters, is of very great antiquity :
every body knows that the antients manufactured Coloured
glass and enamel, and that this art was practised in particular
by the Egyptians, the first people who in this manner imi
tated precious stones.
    The practice of this art in modern times has been carried
to a high degree of perfection : but the theory has been neg
lected ; it is almost the only one of the chemical arts in
which no attempt has yet been made to apply the new prin
ciples of that science.
    The very numerous works which treat on the method of
preparing and applying vitrifiable metallic colours, either con
tain no theory, and consequently no general principles, or
give only explanations founded on hypotheses, often ridicu
lous, which formerly composed the theory of chemistry.
    One of the best, because it is the work of an enlightened
artist, is the Traits de la Peintre en Email de Montamy. The
 archives of the national manufacture of Sevres contain also
 simple and excellent processes for the fabrication of colours.
 The authors of them are Messrs. Bailly, Fontelliau, and
 Montigny ; but they are mere descriptions, without any ob
 servation which can conduct to general principles.
    The other works, such as that of Kunckel, and the manu
 scripts of Hellot in the possession of the manufactory of Se
 vres, and the two Encyclopædias, present only an undigested
 assemblage, a compilation without choice and without rea
 soning, of a multitude of processes collected from all quar
 ters.    When some knowledge of the art has been obtained,
 it is casier to invent a process than to discover among that
 variety of recipes the one which ought to be preferred.
     It has been remarked, that one of the most certain signs of
 the progress made bv a science towards perfection is the pos
 sibility it leaves of collecting the facts that compose it into
 one system, from which general principles might be deduced:
 it is at this epoch alone that it deserves the name of science ;
 and it is to an exposition of its principles thus generalized
                  * From the                     No. 67.

        On the Colours obtained from the metallic Oxides.     343
that the appellation, more imposing than correct, of philo
sophy of science has been given.
    The arts, which are often rather a branch of a science than
the mere application of one of its parts, present facts equally
susceptible of being united in a systematic form : to carry
them soon to perfection, it is sufficient that they are practised
by men habituated to distinguish relations, and to deduce con
sequences from them.
    The learned, who by more elevated speculations are re
moved from the practice of the arts, perceive the principles
of them more readily : they can apply their researches in a
more direct manner to the advancement of them ; and their
progress, guided by reasoning,- will be more certain, more
direct, and more rapid.
    I observed that the art of preparing and using vitrifiable
colours was susceptible of the improvement I have pointed
out, and that the facts of which it is composed begin to be
sufficiently numerous and correct to be exhibited in a general
manner. 1 have thought that an accurate knowledge of these
facts, and an exposition of the principles by which they are
connected, and which must naturally lead to an explanation
of a great many of them, might be interesting to chemists,
who, employed in more general and more important re
searches, cannot be acquainted with all the details of an art
which is exceedingly complex.
    I vvas desirous also to give chemists an exact knowledge of
the principles of this art, in order that they may be enabled
to determine with more certainty what novelty there may
really be in the processes submitted to their opinion.
    In' a word, 1 have thought it might be of utility to the
arts, and that it was the duty of the national manufactory
of Sevres to make known the pretended secret of the compo
sition of those porcelain colours which are unalterable in the
fire. It is well known that these colours were presented to
  he Institute, in the year 6, by a porcelain manufacturer
justly esteemed for the beauty of the works which come from
 his manufactory.       I should not have ventured to publish this
secret had it been intruded to me ; but when it is known, I
 hope I shall not be suspected of having in the least abused the
 confidence reposed in me.
     From what has been said it may be readily seen that my
 object is not to give a detailed account of the exact composi
 tion of all the vitrifiable colours; such a labour cannot be the
 subject osa single memoir.                                       t
    It is well known that all vitrifiable colours ' have  for their
                                 Y  4                         basis

344     Oa   the Colours   obtained   from    the   metallic Oxides,
basis  metallic oxides ; but all the metallic oxides are not
  roper for this purpose : besides, as they are not vitrisiable
E y themselves, they can scarcely ever be employed alone.
    Highly volatile oxides, and those which adhere little to
the great quantity of oxygen they contain, either cannot be
employed in any manner, as the oxide of mercury and that of
arsenic, or are employed only as agents.      The colour they
present cannot be depended on, since they must lose it in the
slightest heat by losing a part of their oxygen : such are the
 puce-coloured and red oxides of lead, the yellow oxide of
gold, &c.
    Oxides in which the proportions of oxygen are susceptible
of varying with too much facility are rarely employed : the
oxide of iron, though black, is never employed for that co
lour ; and the green oxide of copper            is,
                                                 under many circum
stances, very Uncertain.
  I    have said that oxides alone are not susceptible of fusion            3
however, as they arc destined to be applied in thin strata on
vitrisiable substances, they may be attached to them
                                                                           by
                                                                           a
violent heat.      But, except the oxides of lead and bismuth,
they would give only dull colours. The violent heat, often
necessary to fix them, would change or totally destroy the
colours.     A  flux then    isadded to all metallic oxides.
     This flux   isglass, lead, and filex ;  glass of borax-, or mix a
 ture of both.
     Its general effect    is,to give splendour to the colours after
 their fusion ;   to fix them on the article which          painted,
                                                            is              by
 promoting more or less the softening of its surface; to en
 velop the metallic oxides, and to preserve their colour by
 sheltering them from the contact of the air: in               word, to
                                                                 a
 facilitate the fusion of the colour at           low temperature not
                                                    a
 capable of destroying it.
     The observation which proves the latter use of fluxes                  is
 taken from the delicate colours, such as carmine obtained
 from gold these colours require much more flux than others.
             :
  Metallic oxides are employed sometimes directly, and merely
  mixed with their flux, without being previously fused with it:
 these colours are those which        astrong heat, or heat too often
  repeated, would alter.         may be readily conceived that
                                 It                                         a

  reds obtained from gold.
      In many circumstances, oxides are fused previously with
                                                                   their

their flux, and afterwards ground.         In speaking of colours in
particular, I (hall point out those which experience this kind
of fusion.
     These general principles are so simple that it is not neces
sary to enlarge on them further.
     I shall speak here only of the application of metallic colours
to vitreous bodies or to vitreous surfaces.
     These bodies may be divided into three classes, very distinct
by the nature of the substances which compose them, the
effects produced on them by the colours, and the changes
 they experience.       These classes are :
      1st, Enamel, soft porcelain, and all crusts, enamels, or
 glass, that contain lead in a notable quantity.
     ad, Hard porcelain, or porcelain which has a crust of
 seld-spar.
     3'1,  Glass in the composition of which no lead enters, such
 US   common window-glass.
      1 shall  here examine in succession the principles of the
 composition of these colours, and the general phænomena
 they exhibit on these three kinds of bodies.
      Colours for painting in enamel are those most antiently
  known : the recipes found in the works 1 have already men
  tioned, all relate to these colours.
      It is well known that enamel is glass rendered opake by
  the oxide of tin, and exceedingly fusible by the oxide of lead.
  It is the oxide of lead, in particular, contained in it that gives
  it properties very different from those of the other excipients-
  of metallic colours. Thus all glass and glazing that contain
  lead will participate in the properties of enamel ; and what
  we sliall fay of one may be applied to the reft with very
  trifling differences.
      Such are the white and transparent glazing of stone ware,
  and the glazing of porcelain called Jo/t glazing.
      This porcelain, which was the first made in France, and
   particularly at Sevres, where it was a long time manufac
   tured almost exclusively, has for its base a vitreous fritt ren
  dered almost opake, and susceptible of being worked with
   clay, and is glazed with an exceedingly diaphanous glass,
   into the composition of which there enters a great deal of
       The colours employed in it are those which serve for paint
   ing in enamel : consequently whatever changes these colours
   experience on enamel they must experience on this kind of
   porcelain, since the causes of this change, which we fliall
   mention hereafter, are the fame.
       Jtnamel or soft porcelain colours require less flux than
                                                               other*,

34^        On tin Colours obtained from   the metallic Oxides,
others, because the glass on which they are applied become!
sufficiently soft to be penetrated by them.
    This flux mav be either glass of lead and pure (ilex, called.
rocaille, or the fame glass mixed with borax.
    Montamy asserts that glass of lead ought lo be banished
from among the enamel fluxes ; and he employs only borax.
He then dilutes his colours in a volatile oil.
    On the other hand, the painters of the manufactory of
Sevres employ only colours without borax, because they di
lute them in gum ; and borax does not dilute well in that
substance. I have found that both methods are equallv good ;
and it is certain that Montamy was wrong to exclude fluxes
of lead, since they are daily employed without any inconve
nience, and as they even render the application of colours
casier.
    I have said that in the baking of these colours, the crust,
softened by the fire, suffers itself to be easily penetrated by
them.      This is the first cause of the change which they ex
perience. By mixing with the crust they become weaker,
and the first heat changes a figure which appeared to be
finished into a very light sketch.
    The oxide of lead which the crust contains is a second but
tnuch more powerful cause of the considerable changes which
colours experience.      1 he destructive action which that metal
exercises chiefly on iron reds is singularly remarkable. I stiall
soon give an account of some experiments which prove it in
a very evident manner.
    It has been already seen, that the two principal causes of
the changes which colours on enamel and soft porcelain arc
susceptible of experiencing do not depend in any manner
 on the composition of thele colours, but on the nature of the
glass to which they are applied.          When it is laid that the
colours of porcelain change in a considerable degree, it ought
to be added that it is those of soft porcelain ; a kind almost
neglected.
    It follows from what has been said, that painting on soft
porcelain has need of being several times retouched, and of
 several heats, in order that it may be carried to the neceflarv
 degree of strength.      These paintings have always a certain
 faintness; but they are constantly more brilliant, and they
 never are attended with the inconvenience of detaching them
 selves in scales.
    Hard porcelain, according to the division which I have
 established, is the second sort of excipient of metallic colours.
 This porcelain, as is well known, has for its base a very whitp
 clay called kaolin, mixed with a siliceous and calcareous flux,
                                                               ¦.aud

         and Jixed      by   Fufion      on   different vitreous Bodies.              34^
and     for its covering           feld-spar fused               without   an atom     of
lead.                                 <
   This porcelain, which is that of Saxony, is much newer
at Sevres than the soft porcelain.   The colours applied to it
are of two kinds : the first, destined to represent different
objects, are baked in a heat very inferior to that necessary for
baking porcelain. They are exceedingly numerous and varied.
   The others, destined to be fused in the same heat as that
which    bakes porcelain, lay themselves flat, and are much less
numerous.
    The colours of painting are made nearly like those destined
for soft porcelain; they only contain more flux.           Their flux
is composed of glass of lead called rocaille, and borax.         I am
not yet acquainted with any work which treats on the com
position, use, and effects of these colours ; so that it has no
where been printed except in one, which might be dispensed
with, that these colours scarcely undergo any change in the
fire, while it has been often written and said, that the colours
for painting in enamel change considerably.
    When porcelain is exposed to heat in order to bake the
colours, the covering of feld-spar dilates itself and opens its'
 pores, but does not become soft : as the colours do not pene
trate     they experience none of those changes which they
        it,
undergo on soft porcelain.             must, however, be said that
                                              It
they lose      little of their intensity

rency which         given to them
                   is                   fusion.   by
    When common articles are manufactured, the retouching
 may be omitted        but       necessary to give to     painting ail

                                is                                         a
                        ;
 the effect that can be desired in word, this retouching does
                                              :    a
not distinguish painting on porcelain from any other kind of
 painting.
    One of the greatest inconveniences of these colours, espe
 cially in the manufactory of Sevres,               the facility with
                                                                  is
 which they scale off when exposed several times in the sire.
    This inconvenience          observed more at Sevres than any
                                    is
 where else, because       depends on the solidity and infusibility
                              it
 of the porcelain manufactured             that establishment.
                                                       in          But
 these are qualities which make          much longer resist alterna

 striking whiteness.     Paris porcelain, on the other hand, being
 more vitreous, more transparent,           and bluer, often cracks
 when boiling liquors are put into it.
    To remedy this defect without altering; the quality of the
 paste,    was of opinion that the crust only ought to be soft

           introducing into        more siliceous or calcareous flu*,

                                                                               succeeded;

succeeded; and for about a year past the colours might btf
epxosed two or three times to the sire without scaling, if not
overcharged with flux, and if not laid on too thick.                     It
has been remarked that soda and potash introduced into
the colours make them scale ; they are therefore never used
as fluxes.    It is found that these alkalies, by becoming vola
tilized, abandon the colour, which when alone cannot form
an adhesion with the crust.
  I   have said that colours are also prepared, which, being laid
on flat, are destined to be fused in a furnace for baking porce
lain.    These colours are not numerous, because few metallic
oxides can stand such a heat without being volatilized and
discoloured. Their flux is sand or feld-spar: as they incor

but it has too direct a dependence on painting in enamel and
porcelain to be entirely lost. Besides, a description of it may
be found in a very great number of works.

              And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art.        Pope.
G,sRACEFULNESS,            which may be termed the beauty of
motion, is an idea not very different from beauty, and almost
inseparable from it. It is an idea belonging to posture and
motion, and will be found to consist in an ease unaccom
panied with restraint or difficulty ; as at all times the most
easy will be the most graceful : it is generally attended with
a flight inflection of the body, unbroken, that          is,
                                                      not inter
rupted with sudden angles      and, in sitting figures, with an
                               ;
cafe approaching to languor.
   Propriety of action      thing of the highest importance to
                          is
                          a
the figure painter, whether he works in large or small.
   Expression does not merely apply to the face, as many sup-

pose, but to the general action and character of each figure,
that it be appropriate to the person described ; as the Hate
and carriage of public officers, heroes, &c, the clownish and
simple attitudes of peasants; and on this being well performed
depends      the very foul of a good picture.
    Much of the merit of Raphael arises from the superior de
gree of dignity observable in his apostles and other great cha
racters : on the contrary, the excellence of Partnegiano re
sults from the elegant turns he gave his female figures.
    As the arts are no longer exotic, we (hall find those graces
rendered familiar in the works of Reynolds, Mortimer, 8tc.*
    The whole power of man           depends on two motions, flection
and extension        : those may be again subdivided into four; the
simple, as in walking, eating, and drinking; the active, as in
carrying, pulling, thrusting or pushing, and climbing ; the
violent, arising from fright, rage, despair, or any other sudden
emotion       :  the fourth sort, which may be considered as a fort
of   passive    action, results from disquiet of mind, as love, ha
tred, sorrow, joy, &c. : the effect of which is chiefly shown
in the extremities, as the face, hands, and feet.
    It will be generally found that violent passions of the mind
»re accompanied with actions more or less angular than the
beautiful or passive : as in a man in the act of striking with a
club or stick, the upper and fore-arm will form a right angle ;
again, in a figure frightened, the arms from being thrown up
will form an angle with the body; in figures pushing or pull
ing, the effect will be the same : on the contrary, elegant or
graceful figures sliake off those violences, and fall into atti
tudes that show a gentle inflection of line.
    We shall find, a standing figure to be graceful must rest on
one leg, and the face incline to the hip it rests on, as in the
Venus de Medicis, and others remarkable for taste and beauty.
    As beauty loves variety, we shall generally observe, if the
figure is presented in front, the head will appear rather in
 clined to the side. (See Plate VI.)
    * If I have cautiously forborne to speak of the works of living artists, it
is not from thinking light of them, but from a nobler motive.           In the
limits I have prescribed to myself I could not do justice to the merits of so
many and aole professors as at present adorn the nation.     The prints from
the works of British artists are circulated over the civilized part of the
world, and copied as soon as they appear on the continent.         Such being
the fact, whatever the ignorant may assert to the contrary, those who wifli
to encourage historical painting in this country should aim at cherishing such
a spirit as would eventually operate to induce buyers not to give more for
works of foreign artists thin, they would for works of equal merit of the
 Britila school.
                                                                         That

350                         On Tainting.
   That beautiful undulating line of     grace  will also be found
in  the moil agreeable sitting figures.
   Notwithstanding what may have been said about
                                                        " smooth
ness, delicacy," &c, yet we stiall find on inquiry much of
the grace and beauty of the painter and sculptor arises from
what Hogarth has termed the " line of beauty," and which
was not only practised but recommended by M. Angelo, as
may be seen in the book on painting, by Jo. Paul Lomatius,
tranflated by Richard Ilaydocke in 1598 : " so that his
meaning is (M. Angelo), that it should resemble the form of
the letter S placed right, or else turned the wrong way, as c/s;
because then it hath nis beauty."
   The graceful parts of the antique statues possess that sweep
ing line of grace : it may be seen too in the figures of Raphael,
Parmegiano, &c. ; and among the more modern artists, as
Reynolds, Mortimer, Cipriani, &c.
   Three things contribute to the beauty of the Venus de
Medicis; its line of grace running unbroken through the
 whole figure, its form, and the variety and contrast of the
parts, as the head with the chest, aud the arms and legs with
each other.
   Those who suppose this character of line affects the general
attitude only, are wrong; it will be found to constitute the
general form of the muscle, if taken detached, and viewed from
its flestiy belly to the tendinous part: this, with its intersect
ing angle, gives much of that variety of character observable
in human nature. We sometimes fee in overcharged figures
the convex lines raised so much beyond the limits of nature,
that the power of re-entering them again is lost, and the
whole form appears heavy and incumbered.                This fault
sometimes attaches to M. Angelo, but by no means in the
extreme asserted by Mengs, who, speaking of that artist,
fays,
        " who seeking to be always great, was always vulgar."
Such language argues great want of either fense or sincerity :
by the way, his favourite Raphael is not entirely free from
the charge of heaviness, in his women in particular.
   The Hercules Farnesc of Glicon is a fine example of the
well-ordered raising and intersecting of the muscles in a figure
possessing the appearance of great passive strength : but few
similar examples will occur to the artist in the course of his
practice.
    That fig-ire forms the extreme point one way, and the
Apollo Belvidere (or Pythons), the other, for beauty ; beyond
 which it is impossible to travel without being absurd : the
mean between those two is the lighting Gladiator (as it is
                                                           called).

called), and which may be eonsideretTas the most natural,
the others more pure.       Those observations must be considered
as applying to the general character of the figures, and not to
the parts; the glarliator being in strong action, the appear
ance of the muscles is altered; those m action being short,
and of course rounded more than those in repose.
     Grace is of so delicate a nature that it cannot exist in the
presence of whatever is rude, vulgar, or excessive : it charms,
captivates, and overcomes, by its beneficence : its motions
are easy, moderate, and lovely, and it partakes more of the
humble than arrogant : it is seen in the Apollo accompanied
with disrnitv, in the Venus of Medicis with modesty, and in
the Antinous in a more human and less elevated degree.
     Parmegiano possessed in a high degree the fascinating
power of grace; Corregio felt it in a certain degree; and the
females of Albano are distinguished by it.           Reynolds's por
traits abound with         andit, will be sought for with success
                                       it
in many of the noble monuments of British art.
     Raphael understood the grace of motion; but his dry go-
thic manner of execution did not associate with            he wanted
                                                                  it  :
that sweet mellow pencil necessary to beauty.
     If painting were an imitation of nature merely, as many
 suppose,      would follow of course that
                  it                               mould be inferior

 to    it,
         as the efficient must always be superior to the effect                     :
 but this subsists conditionally:    as in the power of light, and
its opposite darkness, nature has the advantage: out even
light      subjugated to the powers of art, as in our paintings
             is
 on glass, of which the east window of New College, Oxford,
 stands     most glorious example, and may be justly entitled the
              a
 first work of the kind in the world*; but              the article of
                                                                 in
 beauty, and the just power of combination art has greatly
 the advantage.

                                                is
 amiable, thereby fixing his desires on things worthy.
     By attentively considering the works of the great, from the
 Greeks to the present time, we st.il! find they fixed their at
 tention on the most noble part of the art, and pursued the
 study of     with unremitting ardour on the contrary, inferior

 centred all art; while the little grovelling spirit became in-
 chanted with whatever was minute and trifling, mistaking
 them for principal things.
     If the works of renowned artists are to be used to stimu
 late, we (hall also derive advantage from thole who have sunk
 from the great to the trifling and useless, nav, even to the
 ugly, and from it to the false and chimerical, by considering
 them as so manv rocks and quicksands to steer clear of.
     A well-ordered picture becomes a lesson of polite education,
 by which our manners are amended : on the contrary, dirty
 ragged ruffians, accompanied with trash and common-place
 stuff, are not only beneath the dignity of painting, but may
 corrupt young minds : nav, may not rudeness be justified by
 a reference to pictures exhibiting clownish and hog«ish exam
 ples, or people the most base and corrupt of humanity ?
     It is a poor apology, because a picture is well painted, that
 it stiould be hung up in our apartment, when in the arrange
 ment it may violate fense, and in the choice decency; or the
 people such as one would by no means suffer to approach our
 persons: and >et nothing is more common. Such efforts mav
 please the ignorant, but will not call the attention of learned
 men and philosophers, with whom such men can only rank
 as mechanics, and beings without discrimination.
    What man of taste ever saw a fine picture by Teniers with
 out feeling the heart-ache that so much fine colour, chiaro
scuro, and execution, stiould be bestowed on worthless ob
jects ? Most of the Dutch pictures operate as a libel on their
 country, by the monsters of humanity introduced in them.
 In a note to the Life of Hogarth, by lord Orford, {Vide Anec
 dotes of Painters), is the following just remark on the Dutch
 artists : — " When they attempt humour, it is by making a
 drunkard vomit; they take evacuations for jokes; and, when
 they make us sick, think they make us laugh.        A boor hug
ging    a  frightful frow, is a frequent incident in the works of
Teniers."
    We might justly conclude that artist mad, or silly, who,
leaving in his pursuit the grand or beautiful os nature, should
collect for his pictures objects d'sgujling and unsightly : and
yet this is frequently the cafe; which arises from want of early
good instruction, and from being led astray by people writing on
 the arts, who are perfectly unqualified for so arduous a taste.
    Some have even attempted to separate the picturesque from
 the beautiful, as if that which did not poflefs beauty could
be worthy of painting.         By the word pidturesque the artist
understands the irregular, but ever accompanied with a beau

                                     " rough and irregular,"
or such as are deformed, aged, and ugly.
    We must give up our understanding if we call a landscape
fine which represents dirty rugged grounds, scrubby bushes,
poor scraggy and ill-formed trees, shapeless lumps of anti
quity, and muddy pools; peopled with gipsies and vaga
bonds, dirty beggars clothed with rags, their heads decorated
With filthy drapery, skins like tanned leather, and their em
ploy disgusting; and these accompanied with poor and old
cattle, or nasty swine on filthy dunghills.      And shall those
be the objects with which we are to decorate, or rather de
form, our apartments? Such a choice argues a taste as de
praved, as isa man were to prefer the horrid squeaking of a
cart-wheel, to the finest solo on an organ.
    Such objects, if introduced in pictures, can only be spar
ingly used, to set off and give value to beauty, as a foil, but
should never appear as principals.
    If a man producing such pictures is to be distinguished by
the noble appellation of a genius, we should find lome other
term to bestow on such artists as Raphael, Corregio, Titian,
Rubens, Reynolds, &c. &c. &c; and in landscape, Pouflin,
Wilson, Claude, Barret, &c. One thing we are sure of, that
 is, that there   no mention of such renowned wrong- heads

among the Greeks          *.

serve, the three foremost toes ought to be the longest ; the
small ones close, and turning out; and the great one a little
separated, more or less in proportion to the action of the foot.
   Beauty appears to delight in the irregular or picturesque,
while the grand will ever be accompanied with the regular
and simple.
LVIII.    Notice refpeQ'ing the Manners and           Habits  common to
   the Shark and Pilot-Fi/b.        By C.    Geoffroi-,         Prose/for
   in tie Musaum of Natural Hifiory*.
It    has been asserted that the (harks have subject to their
empire a very small fish of the species of the gadus; that the
latter precedes his master during his voyages, points out to
him those places of the sea most abundant in fish, discovers
to him the traces of the prey he is fondest of ; and that, out
of gratitude for such signal services, the shark, notwithstand
ing his voracity, lives in   good intelligence with a companion
so useful to  him.    Naturalists, always on their guard against
the exaggerations of travellers, and not being able to con
ceive the motives of such an association,             have doubted the
truth of these facts. It will, however, be seen that they were
wrong : the observations even which I have been able to make
are accompanied with circumstances which perhaps never oc
curred with so many details to any one but myself.
    In the month of May 1798 I was on board the Alceste
frigate between cape Bon and the island of Malta. The sea
was tranquil, and the passengers were much fatigued with the
long duration of the calm, when their attention was attracted
bv a (hark which they saw advancing towards the vessel.                It
was preceded by its pilots, which kept at a pretty regular
distance from each other, and from the sliark. The two pilots
directed their course towards the poop of the vessel, inspected
it twice from one end to the other, and, aster having satisfied
themselves that there was nothing which they                           to

 their advantage, resumed their former route. During the
 various movements which they made, the (hark never lost
 fight of them, or rather followed them as exactly as if he had
 been dragged by them.
    He had no sooner been descried than one of the sailors got
 ready a large hook, which he baited with lard; but the shark
 and his companions had already proceeded to the distance of
 ao or 25 millimetres before the sailor had made all his pre
 parations: he, however, threw the piece of lard into the sea
 at a venture. The noise occasioned by its fall was heard at
 a considerable distance.     The travellers were astonished, and
-stopped.   The two pilots then detached themselves, and went
 to explore at the poop of the vessel.        The shark during their
 absence sported in a thousand ways at the surface of the

 dived to a greater depth, but always re-appeared at the fame
 place. When the two pilots came to the poop of the Alceste
 they passed close to the lard, and no sooner observed it than
 they returned to the shark with a greater velocity than they
 advanced to it.    When they reached             the latter continued
                                                        it,

 the other on his left, made every effort to get before him.
 Scarcely had they done         when they suddenly returned, and
                                    so
 then went back second time to the poop of the vessel. They

 L.IX. Experiments       on Charcoal exposed to high     Degrees  of
     Heat in close Vessels.   By  David MuShet,         Esq. of the
     Colder Iron Works * .
 I                                   I
    N a former communication showed that in Stourbridge
 clay crucibles, made perfectly air-tight, a proportion of char
 coal disappeared much greater than could possibly combine
 with the iron in contact with it. This I attributed to causes
 not yet ascertained, but worthy of investigation.         In many
 experiments with diamonds, particularly those of D'Arcet and
 Macquer, it seemed that they disappeared when inclosed in
 balls of porcelain, and where it was supposed no air was pre
 sent to promote combustion.        The facts established by those
 eminent chemists appeared thus at variance with those prin
 ciples by which the nature and properties of the diamond
 and other combustible substances were explained : nor have
 I  yet learned if a satisfactory explanation of them has been
 given.
     Having prepared a parcel of small Stourbridge clay cruci
 bles nearly of the fame size, I performed the following expe
  riments with different proportions of charcoal.
     Exp. I. In one of the crucibles was inclosed five grains of
 well dried charcoal : the crucible was yet moist.      The mouth
 was afterwards brought together and accurately shut. When
 well dried in a temperature from 700 to 80° of Fahrenheit, it
  was placed in an annealing sire, and gradually heated till
  of a bright red colour. It was then placed in the assay
  furnace, and a considerable degree of heat excited for the
  space of 35 minutes.      When withdrawn, and cold, it was
  carefully examined, and found free from cracks.       It was then
  cautiously broken, but exhibited no marks of charcoal : one
  vitrid spot only was observable upon the bottom, which I sup
  posed to arise from the fusion of the alkaline residuum after
  the destruction of the wood.
     Exf. II. In this the crucible contained ten grains of char
  coal.    It was treated in the fame manner, only exposed to a
  more violent and continued heat. When cold, no cracks ap-

peared,    and the interior  of the vessel   presented a solitary spot
of vitrid matter larger than that of No. I. by          the additional
quantity of charcoal employed.
    Ext. III. was performed with 20 grains of charcoal, and
a similar result with the former two was obtained.
    Exp. IV. contained 30 grains of charcoal. This also dis
appeared.
    Erp. V. was performed with 40 grains, when a few minute
flakes of charcoal remained.
    Exp. VI. was made with                -          -         grs. 60
After the usual treatment and exposure, I found that a
considerable portion of the charcoal now remained,
which I found to weigh                  ~              "
                                                                    35
                                               Not taken up          25
    The   first inference I was led to make from these experi
ments was, that the charcoal was consumed by the air in
cluded in the crucible when it was introduced.            This seemed
plausible enough where only five or ten grains were em
ployed, and a considerable space left unoccupied ; but in the
 two last experiments the charcoal was of such bulk as nearly
to fill the crucible.
     Exp. VII. To determine this, I took a piece of well burnt
 charcoal wood of 20 grains. This was introduced into a cru
 cible, and shut up in a similar manner with the former.              It
 was placed, after the fame train of drying and preparation,
 in the assay furnace, where for two hours it received the
 utmost heat that the pot was deemed capable of standing.
 When cold, I found the crucible very entire, and inclosing
 the piece of charcoal, apparently of its former dimensions ana
 shape; but, on closer examination, I found the angles com
 pletely rounded, and the surface covered with very minute
 transparent globules of salt.     The blackness of the charcoal
 had deepened into a degree of lustre and richness surpassing
 any thing of the kind I had ever witnessed.           The mass now
 weighed 17 grains.
     From the result of this experiment I inferred that the
 quantity of included air was not adequate to explain the dis
  appearance of the charcoal powder of the former experiments.
  I was now led to conceive that it might be materially aslisted
  by the expulsion of a certain quantity of water baked in the
  clay, which, by a welt known affinity, might be decomposed
 ©n the charcoal at a high temperature, and carbonic acid gas
  consequently formed.
     Exp. VIII. There were inclosed 20 grains of charcoal in
  a crucible similar to the former.     After ten weeks drying, in
                                  Z 3                           a  tern

35 &              Experiments on Charcoal,      &c.
a temperature frequently beyond that of boiling water, the
 crucible was cut across, and found to contain 18 grains.         It
 appeared, therefore, necessary to the volatilization of the char
coal that a greater heat be urged.
    Exp\ IX. The fame quantity of charcoal was employed,
and subjected to the same treatment. The crucible was then
placed in the annealing furnace, and broken, as it came from
 thence, after cooling. The charcoal had disappeared,and, in
place of the vitrid matter formerly obtained, a few flakes of
alkaline salt were found on the bottom.            The heat of the
 annealing  fire did not exceed 300    of Wedgewood.      The cru
cible was weighed before put in and when taken from the
annealing fire, and was found to have lost £th part of its
weight, which was supposed to be water.
    It appears pretty conclusive, from the two last experiments,
that a high heat is necessary to expel the last portions of
water; and that, as in Exp. VIII., the charcoal nearly re
mained entire where a temperature considerably beyond that
of boiling water was applied : it was in consequence of the
expulsion of this water that the charcoal had disappeared.
   This conclusion will easily explain the evaporation of dia
monds in balls of moist clay, wherein the fame circumstances
would take place as at present.       It will particularly explain
an experiment of Macquer's, wherein he inclosed charcoal in
baked and unbaked crucibles of clay.          In the former, where
no moisture was present, the charcoal remained unchanged;
but in the latter it disappeared, and the ashes were found
vitrid, as in these experiments. This was attributed to cer
tain shrinkages or cracks, which might take place with green
clay, and which afterwards became invisible in cooling.
   It is probable, however, that charcoal of wood may furnish
part of the means of its ow?n disappearance by a considerable
deoxidation at a high temperature, and leave its residuum in
a much purer Itate than formerly.            The following experi
ment will prove this.
   Exp. X. I took 20 grains of beautiful black charcoal col
lected from experiments where it had been exposed to heats
of 1650 Wedgewood.        These were inclosed in an unbaked
pot, which was set aside to dr)-.      In three months the cruci
ble was found to weigh              -           -        grs. 8313
   It was then placed in the annealing fire, and weighed
at a bright red heat          ?             -         -       7403

The crucible       was then placed in a high heat for two hours,
and withdrawn quite entire. When cold, I found a fine im
palpable powde* of charcoal of a deep velvet black which
weighed 1 2 grains.           The treatment in this experiment was
every way similar to the former (No. III.), yet only eight
grains of charcoal were here miffing.

       1 OUR       letter of   the 8th instant, requesting information
of   the precise time the late wide-spreading storm commenced
at this place, came to my hands evening before last.                 I hasten
to gratify you as far as I am able.
    "Sunday, the 21st of February, the day preceding the
storm here, was remarkably calm and pleasant.                    The smoke
ascended from the chimneys in a straight column.                  The ther
mometer at noon was 47. Neither hygrometer nor barome-*
ter indicated, at that period, any disposition of change in
the atmosphere.           As late as half past ten at night, the sky
was clear and star-light.             At about two hours and a half
after this, viz. one o'clock in the morning of the 22d, the
snow-storm began. My information comes from an intelli
gent market-man, who set out from his own house for Cam
bridge at midnight.            Excepting for a few hours on Wednes
day, 24th, we saw not the sun for nine days.                    It was the
longest if not severest snow-storm I ever knew.

   " I can readily conceive several good purposes may be an

nebec and to Halifax, and requested my correspondent at the
last place to extend his inquiries to Newfoundland.         I hope
vou will extend yours to Pcnsacola, and even to Jamaica.
The severity of the storm was from north-north-east ; that
is,  north, two points to the east, being, you know, what
the ancients termed aquilo.      These observations will pro
bably strengthen   the opinion prevalent in this quarter, that
all our severe north-east storms begin first, in point of time,
in the south-west. Franklin was first led to notice this, 00
being prevented,        by
                         stormy sky, from observing an eclipse
                             a
of the moon at Philadelphia, when at Boston, 400 miles
north-east of that city, the hemisphere was sufficiently clear
for that purpose.
    " The ancients had some strange notions of the local ori
gin of winds.     They speak of them as something different
from air in motion, and as       the matter of the winds were
                                    if
a  hot vapour or exhalation from caverns in the earth, where
Æolus kept them in chains, only when his churlish majesty
chose to let them loose, like            so
                                     many bull-dogs, to scare
Juno, and worry her favourites. This fable, however,             is,
like almost all those of the ancients, pregnant with wisdom.
Lord Bacon himself has laboured to teach mankind how to
make Æolus subservient to Juno, and          did Franklin.     The
transition from winds to rain and snow          is so
                                                   and  natural.

in the memorv and learning of mankind have been exercised,
there has not been sound one secretary of nature sufficiently

entire and connected chain of causes. Des Cartes, Nieuwen-

the world with their theories on this subject       but which of

ages,    with grateful admiration ; but, not being an object of
fight, has been ranked among the inexplicaole works of
Deity. The clouds dispensing refreshing ihowers of rain on
the dry and thirsty ground ; the flow of rivers, with their
Jong train of beneficial consequences, could hardly escape
the notice of any thinking being in every age of the world.
We accordingly find the supply of water frequently mentioned
in the oldest book we have, among the most wonderful
as well as valuable of Heaven's blessings.
  "    Seeing the earth annually covered with a rich and beau
tiful carpet of vegetables, and these astonishingly variegated,
and gradually developing ' from seed-time to harvest-time,'
must have led those of ancient days to recognize the proxi
mate causes, the warmth of the fun, and the moisture from
she clouds ; and these again to an acquaintance with that per
petual circulation subsisting between the ocean and the moun
tains, through the instrumentality of the atmosphere, and
by the medium of rivers to the ocean again. But the philo
sophy or explanation of this vivifying phænomenon is spoken,
of as inscrutable and past finding out. They did then, as we
do now, carry our investigations as high as we can, as in the
cafe of gravitation, and beyond that principle fay, with them,
* it is the hand of God ;' an
                                expression denoting the last term
of our analytical results. Unable to investigate the essence
of light and of fire, the Deity was called by the name of
these inexplicable agents.
  "    In those early days, when the knowledge of nature was
confined to narrow limits, they, like our Indians,
               ' Saw God in clouds,   and heard him in the winds.'
Hence they styled the Deity ' the father of the rain,' and re
                   '
presented him as     calling forth the waters of the sea, and
pouring them down according to the vapour thereof.'
Whence we infer, they believed the water rose in the form
of vapour from the ocean, and that it became sr e/b ened in its
passage through the air; and it moreover appears that they
were sensible that this process was regularly and perpetually
performing; for they remarked that 'although all the rivers
run into the sea, yet was the sea not full ; unto the place
whence the rivers come, thither they return again.'      They
seem also to have known that mountains made a part of
this grand apparatus, and to have believed that it was
not a fortuitous or random process, but regulated, as we now
find    it,   by
            weight and measure.     May not this be inferred
from that sublime question of Isaiah—* Who hath measured
                                                           the

3<5»         Observ'tions and Reflections on Storms,          &c.
the waters in the hollow              of his hand, and weighed the
mountains    in scales ?'
    "  Although    they discerned this magnificent apparatus, and
saw its effects,     yet were they restrained by a religious awe
from attempting its investigation, because storms, lightning
and hail, were conceived to be the precursors of the chariot
of   the Deity ! ' who maketh the clouds his chariot' — ' who
watketh on the wings of the wind' — accompanied with
'  bailjhnes and fire !
                          '
                              Or, if you choose to have the spirit of
these passages expressed        in English metre—
               ' On cherubs,     and on cherubims,
                  ' Kull
                         royally he rode,
               ' And on the wings of al! the winds
                  * Came
                           flying all abroad.'
For this     reason, probably, the origin and course of the
          ' whence
winds,               they come and whither they go,' were deemed
m) sterious.     Hence,      instead of investigating the cause, their
pious    minds,  overwhelmed         with awe, funk into undiscerning
amazement      1    Under      such    impressions,    I cease to wonder
that    he  who   wrote     that    ancient    drama,    the book of Job,
puts among       the   most      difficult  of  his questions that which'
 demands an explanation of the ' balancing of the clouds.'
But shall not we, who are happily free from the terrors of
 the Mosaic as well as Pagan systems, and who enjoy the
 encouraging intellectual scheme of Christianity, which, ne
 ver forgetting Deity, postpones every thing corporeal to the
primary mental cause — I fay, shall not we unite our efforts
                            *
 to fill up that dreary blank left in science by the ancients ?
 And ( as man, who is the servant and interpreter of nature,
 can act and understand no further than he has, either in ope
 ration or in contemplation, observed of the method and order
 of nature t,' let us commence a patient observation of the
 ordinary and extraordinary phænomena that occur in this
 scene of wonders, the atmosphere ; and then collect those
 fragments of knowledge, widely scattered through the world,
 On the fame subject.
    " Although much of the operations going forward in the
 atmosphere mav have some links that have hitherto escaped
 the most inquisitive eye, and others, though seen, may not
 be fully understood,       still we ought not to be discouraged.

                                       Section 39.
I      have already shown, in regard to all the three classes of
roads  in general, the conditions under which the one kind of
carriage    to be preferred to the other.
               is                           But as the multi
tude of elements which occur in all these formulae render                              a
general view of them difficult,      may not be superfluous to
                                                  it
collect here    few of the principal results as deduced from
                     a                                                                 a
closer comparison of the general conditions.
                                       Section 40.
     Onroads of the first class, when the axles and wheels are
in the common ratio, the difference between         and R' can          R
never be v.exy considerable. But as the wheels of the two-
wheeled carriages are generally made as high or higher than
the bind-wheels of the four-wheeled carriages, we (hall                               al
ways have       RR' as long as
                         >                   P,

But the road be exceedingly steep, and the load very high
       if
and heavy, we (hall have R<                       R    j     consequently       the four-
wheeled carriages will be preferable.

   Tn the commencement of this essay, sectiqn 2. among roads
of this class,   included those with solid broad ruts, to which
                    I
every thing observed, in general, in regard to solid and smooth
roads     applicable. But
          is                   the solid ruts are narrow and detp,

                         is,                                                           is
for four-wheeled carriages nearly double that for two-wheeled
                                                          carriages                    ;

             iwo and four-wheeled Carriages.                 367
carriages; and consequently on such roads the former deserve
the preference, and the more so the narrower and deeper the
ruts.
                        Setlion 4a.
  When the dimensions of the wheels and axles are in the
common ratio, the difference on roads of the second class be
tween R and R' will beconfiderably greater than for the carri
ages examined section 40, and to the prejudice of the four-
wheeled carriages ; and the more nigged the road the sleeper it
must be, and the higher and heavier must be the load to make
R < R'. On the whole, two-wheeled carriages on roads of
the second class are always preferable in regard to resistance.
                          •Setlion 43.
   But on roads of the third class, the advantage inclines
strongly to the fide of the four-wheeled carriages ; and it
is decidedly so when the surface of the road consists of
soft sand, moist tender earth, tough dirt, &c. so that the
hind-wheels run in the ruts formed by the fore-wheels. For
here we have unconditionally R < R'. But even in the cafe
of dry soft sand or earth, or fluid dirt, where the ruts made
by the fore-wheels immediately close up again, we (ball have
also R < R' when the sum of the semidiameter of the fore-
 and hind-wheels is not much smaller than the diameter
 of the wheels of the two-wheeled carriages without regard
 to P, a and 1.  In the last place, if the road be steep and the
 load heavy and voluminous, the two-wheeled carriages, to
 the prejudice of the necessary strength, must have very large
 wheels to make R < R'.      On the whole, therefore, on such
 roads four-wheeled carriages are better.
                              Setlion 44.
   On   the roads with sinuosities of section 34 we have R < R'
when the angle $ = o, orvanistics; that     is, when the distance
between the excavations        isgreater  than   that between the
fore and hind-wheels, or when they are placed       so   near each
other that the hind-wheel sinks while the fore one ascends, as
seen, figure 7,  atF"   and F.    In both cafes, particularly the
last, four-wheeled  carriages are to be preferred to two-wheeled,
 not only because R   <  R', but because the moving power re
 mains greater in the former cafe than in the latter, where,
 the continued alteration in the direction of the pole, and the
 vibrating of the centre of gravity which thence arises, tend
 greatly to fatigue the cattle.

    In the case also of single excavations and elevations, such
as those considered section 35 and section 38, we shall have,
as already mentioned, R < R' when such occur on any road
whatever. When these obstacles are numerous, but not so
near each other that the fore- and hind-wheels both experi
ence a resistance at the same time, four-wheeled carriages
are for the most part to be preferred to two-wheeled, without
taking into consideration the nature of the road in other
respects.

More      accurate Determination of the Resistance in regard to the
                   Direction of the Pole or Shafts.
                           Section 46.
   In the preceding researches it has been supposed that the
direction of the pole of the carriage is parallel to that of the
road. In general, however, it deviates more or less from
this direction according as the breast leather or the collar of
the team horse is higher or lower than the axles of the wheels.
This deviation depends also, besides the length of the pole,
on the kind of harness, on the height of the cattle and the
method of yoking them, and on the size of the wheels ; and
when this is taken into consideration the resistance R and R'
will certainly be somewhat different from that found in the
preceding divisions.    But though the difference is very small,
to render the examination of this question as complete as the
nature of the subject will admit,                      I
                                      shall take into considera
tion in this division the direction of the pole, and again de
termine the values of R and R' for each of the fuppoled three
classes   of   roads.     ,

TTh        Eprincipal arguments opposed to the authenticity of
what Moses relates in regard to the history of the deluge, and
the period when        took place, are drawn from the supposed
                             it
antiquity  of  our  continents,    which     carried back, without           is
bounds, beyond that epoch. This opinion has its source in
idea rather than in observation         for facts which have been
                                                               ;
carefully observed   show,   on  the contrary,   that the continents
we inhabit have no older date than that fixed           the chrono                               by
logy  of Moses   since  the flood.   For  the  proofs  of  this truth
I  refer to Lettres Physiques et Morales fur i'Hi/loire de la
Terre et de I'Homme, and to those Jar I'Hi/loire Physique de

    The Moniteur or French Gazette Nationale of the 25th of
Pluviose last (February 14, 1802,) contains                   long article, in
                                                               a

among these        is that of two zodiacs          from which      it  " cer

the Egyptians fifteen thousand years before the Christian
æra, and that          ithas been preserved without alteration and
transmitted to all other nations."
    This conclusion, given with             tone of assurance, may easily

they   are   retained       by
                           no   religious persuasions, they follow their
own ideas, without ever inquiring whether they can be recon

    The Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1708 con
tain an engraving of large fragment of an Egyptian plani
                                 a
sphere or zodiac which was sent from Rome to the academy.
This zodiac, engraven on antique marble, was preserved in
the Vatican.           Itrepresents concentric bands or circles                  di
vided into twelve equal portions                lines drawn from the cir
                                                by
 cumference to the centre.            The circle in the centre, which             is
not divided, contains three constellations, the Dragon and
 two Bears. The next circle, which                     divided, contains the
                                                      is
 figures   of  animals,    reptiles,   and   others.      The two following
 circles contain each in the fame order the twelve signs of the
 zodiac, some ot which are             in good preservation.       The fifth
 circle, separated          byband on which are traced out letters or
                                 a
 characters, contains in each division, corresponding to sign,               a
 three human figures, some of which have the head of an
 animal.        And the last circle, which incloses the whole, re-
 piefents the planets repeated under the figure of human heads
 corresponding to certain divisions of the signs, according as
 the imagination, inclined to the chimeras of astrology, sug
gested.
     The         in 1708 were far from assigning to this zodiac
             learned
a       antiquity:
     hii^h            was even considered, and with justice, as
                            it
being rather astrological than astronomical; and therefore                        it
was left    the historical part of that year as
              in                                 mere object ofa
curiosity, not worthy of engaging the time of the academy.

ject as fabulous the chronology of the sacred historian;
 and, by a very remarkable but not novel inconsistency, they
       more faith to the uncertain interpretations of these com-

nerations.
   Fortunately, without going far from the place where these
zodiacs were found,     very remarkable fact of the philosophy
                                 a
of the earth bears testimony against the antiquity ascribed to
them.
    We know, from the accounts of enlightened travellers,
that the coast of Arabia on the Red Sea      incumbered with
                                                         is
banks or reefs of coral, which render access to them difficult
and dangerous.
  These reefs are the work and habitation   of polypes, which
in proportion           labour abandon their first habitations,-

on which they continue to build.     This succession of labour
isseen very distinctly in those marine productions which serve
to ornament our cabinets of natural history under the names
of coral, madrepores, milleporcs, lea organs, &c.
   In warm climates these polypes are always in activity                     ;
they never cease to multiply and to labour; the result of
which           is,
            that in    short time they augment in
                              a                         sensible    a
manner the mass of their habitations, which are not destroyed
 by age, as they are of the fame substance as (hells, and have
the fame hardness.

isles situated between the tropics are surrounded        them in  by
such     manner as renders access to them as difficult as on the
          a
coasts of Arabia.
    Mr. Labillardiere, the author of Voyage la Recherche de  a
la  Perouse, makes on this subject the following reflection, in
consequence of the vessels having been exposed to great danger
among such reefs, which extend around New Caledonia :—
"  These polypiers-," says he,          "
                                    the continual increase of which,
blocks up more and more the bason of the seas, are very ca
pable of frightening navigators; and many stioals which still
afford    a passage will soon form reels exceedingly dangerous."
     If the present state of the seas and continents had existed
for thousands of ages, as pretended                by
                                               those geologues who
reject    the  chronology   of  Moses,        not
                                              is   evident that these
                                                   it
reefs,"   which   continually increase,   would   have  long ago sur
rounded      these  islands with        so
                                     great    number
                                                   a    of thcle walls
of coral, that     it   would have been impossible for the first
navigators so approach even within           considerable distance of
                                                  a
them      ?Nature, then, agrees here with the chronology of the
sacred scriptures.       The labour of these little animals rises up
from the bottom of the sea,            testimony of the truth of its
                                         in
relation.
   These coral rocks appear to be          production peculiar to the
                                              a
present   sea ; for  we find   nothing  similar      calcareous moun
                                                        in
tains, nor    inhills consisting of shells.     Coral and madrepores
are, no doubt, found in them           but they are insulated in the
                                        ;
strata like all other marine bodies. This example stiows how
deceitful the calculations of geometry may be, when applied
to facts in the philosophy of the earth without consulting
nature.
   The celebrated geometrician Delaplace, calculating the
deptb of the sea from the Newtonian               theory of the tides,
has determined that this depth cannot be less than (bur
leagues*.
   The attentive observer of nature has means more certain

for sounding this depth than the result of such calculations.
These are, the numerous volcanic isles scattered in all lati
tudes throughout the bosom of the most extensive seas. These
islands attest, that the basis on which the subterranean fires
have elevated them cannot be at the depth of even a thousand
toises; and if we add to these volcanic isles all the natural
isles which are at a great distance from continents, what will
become of the depth of four leagues, assigned to the sea from
these calculations ?
    Another fact, which opposes this hypothesis, results from
currents.       If the flux and reflux depended on the depth of
the sea, it ought to experience the same libration throughout
its whole mass; which is not the cafe. The currents are not
sensible but at a small distance from the surface of the water.
     This fact, which is well known to navigators, supplies
them with the means of determining whether their vessel be
in a current.        They hoist out a boat, which proceeds to some
distance from the vessel, and then let down a weight attached
to a rope to the depth of. 200 fathoms.             This weight being
thus at a great depth in calm water, observation and experi
ence having shown that currents are not sensible beyond the
 depth of ten fathoms, it produces the effect of an anchor
which retains the boat: they then throw into the water a
 very thin board, that the wind may have no hold of                 and it,
 according      to  the  motion    of  this  board,      has
                                                           ifany,
                                                               it  they
 discover whether there be           current, and determine its direc
                                      a
 tion and velocity.           results then from these facts, that the
                              It
 libration of the sea, occasioned           the moon, which produces
                                            by
 the tide?,     is
                 owing  to its extent,  and     no manner to its depth.
                                                 in
     What then ought we to conclude from all these fads?
 That in regard to the philosophy of the earth we ought to
 consult them, and direct our observations in particular             the    by
 first of all motives, that of attaining, as far as possible, to the
 knowledge of truth.
 I     sliall take this opportunity of making         remark connected

 November last. Since the currents of the sea are experienced
 only at    a  small depth, and as the sea beneath them           calm,is
 the geological systems founded on the formation of new con
 tinents    by   currents at the bottom of the sea have not this
 supposed fact in their favour, since            itproved that they do

LXIII.      Observations refpecling the Aya-Vana.          Read in the
     Class  of the  Physical Sciences  of the  French  National    Insti
     tute on the 14th     of Frutlidor, Year      10.  By C.      Ven-
     TENAT.
 SEVERAL of the journals have lately made mention of
the aya-pana.         They have said that this plant was originally
a native of Brazil ; that it is cultivated with success in the
Isle de France; that it possesses great virtues, and may be
considered as an universal panacea.            I hope, therefore, that
the class, and particularly physicians, will be gratified with a
more complete account of this vegetable, the discovery of
which is a valuable acquisition to natural histoiy, if the vir
 tues ascribed to it are not exaggerated.
      About eight months ago one of my nephews, being about
 to leave the Isle of France, begged citizen Michaud to point
 out to him such plants cultivated in the garden of the state
 as he thought likely to be an acceptable present to me. Our
 friend mentioned to him the rarest articles : he even was so
 kind as to procure them, and did not forget the famous plant
 of Brazil. The information which my nephew obtained re
 specting this plant, being perfectly agreeable to that which
 has been since transmitted to madame Bonaparte as well as to
  C. Juslieu, I flatter myself that I am able to give the class an
 accurate account in regard to every thing that concerns the
 native country of the aya-pana; the properties ascribed to it;
 and, in particular, its botanical characters.
 . The aya-pana grows in South America on the right bank
 of the river of the Amazons.         The inhabitants of that coun
  try have, long considered it as an excellent sudorific, and a
  powerful alexipharmic or antidote against the bite of serpents
  and the wounds made by poisoned arrows.               Its virtues are
  equally    extolled  throughout    all Brazil,   where   it is carefully
  cultivated, and where it is distinguished by the name of the
  miraculous plant.
       In the 7th year of the French republic captain Augustine
  Baudin, brother of captain Baudin so well known to natu
   ralists who is now on a voyage to the South Seas, beine; at
   Brazil, and having heard of the aya-pana, considered at first
   as fabulous, or at least exaggerated,      every thing told him re
   specting the virtues of this plant.      But the relation of several
   cures performed by it during his stay in that country, con
   firmed by the testimony of persons worthy of credit, and par
   ticularly by that of Dr. Camara, a celebrated botanist and
  able physician, who was formerly a pupil of Jussieu, entirely
  removed his doubts.
                                                               Convinced

             Observations     respeftlng    the   Aya-Vana.           377.
    Convinced that he should render an important service to
the French colonies by introducing the aya-pana, captain
Baudin made every effort to obtain it. With great difficulty
he procured some roots, which he caused to be conveyed on
board his vessel, giving orders that the greatest care should
be taken of them.       When about to leave Brazil, being de
sirous to fee in what state his flips of the aya-pana were, he
found that, unfortunately, they no longer existed : they had
been entirely destroyed by some fowls which had escaped from
the hen-coop.
     Captain Baudin was much afflicted at this loss ; and though
his departure had been fixed for the next day, he resolved to
procure the aya-pana again, whatever it might cost : but his
demands were not complied with, and his offers were even re
jected.      A love of science, and the desire of being useful to
his country, induced him then to pass over certain considera
 tions which, under other circumstances, might have checked
 him. He remembered that there was a root of aya-pana in
 the window of an individual, which had been constantly re
 fused to him : he formed the project of carrying it off in the
 night-time. Accompanied therefore by some sailors he re
 paired to the place, and by means of long poles they threw
 down the pot which contained the plant.                 Captain Baudin
 immediately seized     it, returned speedily on board, and at day
  break proceeded on his voyage to the Isle of France.
     Scarcely had captain Baudin landed in that French colony
 when he informed the director of the garden of the state, that
  he had procured this valuable plant, with which he proposed
  to enrich the colony.       As the aya-pana               is
                                                        easily propagated
  by flips, the plant was soon multiplied          ;and at present there
 is   scarcely
             a   plantation where      it   not cultivated.
                                            is
      The properties of the aya-pana,             the information com
                                                  if
  municated to me, and that since transmitted to madame
  Bonaparte and C. Jusfieu        by  captain Augustine Baudin him
  self, can be credited, are not belied at the Isle of France, where
  this plant enjoys as great celebrity as in its native country.
  The garden of government             is continually beset      bydiseased
  persons,   who  come   to  solicita   few  leaves  of  the  aya-pana to
  cure their maladies.'       The colonial gazette daily contains
  some new proofs of its virtues       ;  and     itemployed with suc
                                                       is
  cess not only against the bite of serpents, but also for curing
   the dropsy, syphilis in its most inveterate stages, and all sorts
  of wounds.
       Among the great number of cures effected at the Isle of
   France  by   means of the aya-pana, and announced in the ga
   zette already mentioned,    I     shall select three or sour, which
                                                                       will

will   show the manner of administering this plant> and the
 different doses employed, according to the purposes for which
 it is applied.
    A planter of the Isle of France, C. Cotte, was stung in
 the right hand by a scorpion : a violent inflammation, ac
 companied with acute pain, immediately took place. Cap
 tain Baudin advised him to make use of the aya-pana.          Se
 veral leaves were pounded, and applied to the wound ; the
 pain immediately ceased : at the end of two hours there was
 no more inflammation, and the hand soon returned to its
Yiatural state.
  * C. Ponset, an officer of artillery, brought to captain Baudin
 a negro, who while fishing had been pricked by a lilh known
 under the name of the last.      The prick of this fish is so ve
 nomous that, before the aya-pana was known, amputation
 of the wounded limb was the only remedy. The hand of the
 negro was very much swelled. Captain Baudin recommended
 the applicatidn of the ayapana pounded ; and as he supposed
 that a great deal would be required to effect a cure, he induced
 C. Poncet to send some perion to the garden of the state to
 procure a considerable quantity of the leaves, in order that the
 hand of the patient might be wrapped up in them. But as
 the garden was at the distance of three leagues, and as the
 patient suffered a great deal from the pain of the wound, cap
 tain Baudin resolved to take seven or eight leaves from a
 young shoot which he had at his house.           These he caused
 to be pounded, and then applied to the part affected.       Next
 day the hand of the black was completely cured.
    A black whose belly was much swelled, and exhibited sym
 ptoms of a dropsy, having applied to a surgeon, the latter re
 solved to tap him : he, however, deferred the operation be
 cause he had other patients to visit.        Being urged by the
 master of the black to prescribe for him, he laid, by way of
 derision, "Give him an infusion of aya-pana till I return." The
 surgeon's orders, happily for the patient, were literally com
 plied with.    The dropsy made no further progress ; the sym
 ptoms gradually disappeared; and at the end of a few days
 the black was in a condition to resume his labours.
    Captain Baudin, in going on board his vessel, happened to
 fall and hurt his left leg very much.      It was necessary, on
 his being carried home, to cut off his stocking in order that
 the wound might be dressed.        Captain Baudin ordered some
 leaves of the aya-pana to be boiled ; and when the decoction
 was tepid the wounds were washed with       it,   and the leaves
 used for making the decoction were applied to them.          The
 leg was then wrapped up     in several folds of
                                              a    bandage dipped
          8                                                   in

in the same liquor, besprinkling it anew every ten minutes.
About two hours after the first dressing the inflammation had
so much abated that the patient was able to walk with the
help of a stick, and at the end of thirteen days he was per
fectly cured.
    I could mention a great many more cures effected by means
of the famous plant of Brazil ; but, as it is not prudent to
certify any facts of which one has not been a witness, we
ought, in my opinion, to wait till the virtues of the aya-pana
 have been confirmed by the continued observations of able
 physicians.      The testimony, however, of captain Baudin, and
 that of several persons lately arrived from the Isle of France,
 are entitled to some confidence, and give us reason to hope
 that the aya-pana may increase the number of our vegetable
 productions employed for relieving or curing the evils incident
 to the human race.
     It is to be presumed that this plant will be soon multiplied
 in the gardens of the capital. C. Michaux, who has rendered
 so great services to botany and agriculture, has sent feeds of
 it to C. Cels, and madame Bonaparte has received some
 from the director of the garden of the state : but, as the feeds
 do not always produce plants, it is to be wished that some
 living shoots of it could be obtained : they might easily be
 multiplied from flips, and it might then be possible to form
 some decisive opinion in regard 10 the virtues ascribed to this
 plant.
     Though we are allowed to doubt the virtues of the aya-
 pana, the botanical characters of this plant are so simple and
 easy to be known, that there cannot be the least uncertainty
 in respect to the genus lo which it ought to be referred. The
  examination! have made of several complete plants has proved
  to me that it belongs to the family of the corymbiferœ, and
  that it belongs to the genus eupatorium of Linnæus.
     The stem of this plant, which I have called eupatorium
  aya-pana, is straight, full of branches, of a dark brown co
  lour, about three feet in height, and of the size of a goose-
  quill. Its leaves are alternate, almost sessile, lance-formed,
  and very entire ; the flowers are of a bright purple colour, and
  disposed in corymbi at the summit of the stem and branches.
     The eupatorium aya-pana may be distinguished from other

LXIV.     General Considerations     on Vegetable    ExtracJs.   By
                       C. Parmentier *.
M,lODERN            chemists have denoted under the name of
 extraS, or rather that of extratiive matter, and placed among
 the number of the immediate materials of vegetables, a sub
 stance the distinguishing characters of which, when in its
 state of purity, are : it is soluble in water ; after a proper eva
 poration of the juices, or of the decoction which held it in
 solution, it becomes a solid transparent body, and, when the
 evaporation has been too rapid, an opake mass, more or less
 insoluble ; in both cafes it is coloured, and has a savour al
 ways acid, and more or less bitter, acrid, or harsh.
    They have sound also in extractive matter the property of
 combining with alkalies ; of strongly attracting oxygen ; of
 being precipitated by acids, alum, metallic solutions, and
 oxides; and of being able, with the help of mordants, to
 adhere to stuffs like the colouring part of vegetables.
    The medicines known in pharmacy under the name of
 extracts do not exhibit this extractive matter pure and un
 mixed, as it ought to be in order to be chemically examined.
    Extracts are productions obtained by the evaporation of
juices or infusions, or the decoctions of plants under different
 degrees of consistence, from that of honey to the dry or pul
 verulent state.
    They are often very compound mixtures, which contain,
    i
    ft,  All the immediate materials of vegetables which the
water can carry with     it,whether naturally soluble, or whether
they acquired    that property both    by  the help of caloric and
the reciprocal   action  which   they  exercise  on each other.
    ad, All the  combinations    which   these  immediate  materials
can form with each other during the evaporation.
    3d, All the soluble results of the decompositions they have
experienced.

                  From the Annales dc Cbimie, No. 1*7.
                                                                 We

                  Considerations      on Vegetable           Extra3s.                    381
     We may      give an idea of the variety of the substances which
are,    or may in general be contained in pharmaceutic ex
 tracts, by presenting those which have been found in the sap,
juices, infusions, and decoctions of vegetables.
    Before the interesting analysis of several kinds of sap by
 Deyeux and Vauquelin, chemists were far from imagining
 that liquors so limpid, and in appearance so simple, were so
 much compounded as they really are.
    The above celebrated chemists found in them the carbonic
 and acetous acid ; acetites and carbonates of potash and lime;
 muriate, sulphate, nitrate of potash, &c.
    The sap of the vine and horn-beam tree furnished a vegeto-
 animal matter.
    That of the oak and beech-tree presented gallic acid, tan
 ning principle, and two sorts of extracts.
     1 hat of the birch and maple gave a very abundant saccha
 rine matter.
     Of these different substances discovered in sap, and of those
 which exist in the expressed juices of fresh herbaceous plants,
 in those of fruits, in the infusions and decoctions of dried
 plants, and of all the solid parts of vegetables, we may, with
 sufficient foundation, form the following list:
     1 ft,Mucous matter or mucilage                obtained from feeds
                                                    :   it   is
 infused in water; there are some plants which contain                  in               it
 great abundance, for example the mallows                         :
     It oozes from the bark of several trees under the name of
 gum.
     2d, The acid mucous matter             exists in lemons, oranges,
                                               :   it
 granadillos, &c.

 tained       apples, pears, grapes, &c.

                                           ;   it
it   exists in the gramineous stems, very little in the leaves,
  almost always        the state of nectar, of honey, or mucoso-sac-
                       in
  charine matter.           abounds in fruits, and
                            It                          not perceptible
                                                                      is
  in the feeds until they have experienced germination, and
  particularly in berries. The sugar-cane and maple give                                      it
  pure and crystallized.
     It    difficult to obtain
          is                         itthe dry state from other vege

 38a            Considerations on Vegetable    Extrads.
 distinguished in plants which, like the tithymalli, gtve milky
juices : nature presents us with such a combination in resinous
 gums, such as gum ammonia, assa-fcetida, &c.
    6th, Extractive matter: it is always united with other
 immediate materials of vegetables, and is found in greater
 quantity in plants which have come to maturity, in ligneous
 roots, wood, bark, and dried leaves, than in vegetables ot
 those parts of vegetables where mucous matter prevails.
    yth, Colouring principle : there are two kinds of it.
    ist, That which, combined with mucous or extractive
 matter, is soluble in water ; it is seen in flowers under the
 skins of fruit, in Indian wood, the root of madder, &c.
    2d, That which, when fixed on any resinous substance
united with extractive matter, is rather carried away than
 dissolved by boiling water, and may form part of extracts.
 It exists in the root of the walnut-tree, in sandal wood, in
 the bark of the alder-tree, in the husk of walnuts, &c.
    8th, The tanning principle. This substance has an astringent
savour, which particularly distinguislies the oak, the gall nut,
 &c. The maceration of these substances has the property of
                 and rendering insoluble the animal gelatin, of
 Erecipitating
   ardening it in leather, which by these means can be pre
 served for a long time without alteration.
    The tanning principle is often accompanied with gallic
 acid, which may be distinguished        by the property it has of
 precipitating iron black, and which was thought to belong
 to that principle called astringent, and which bears the name
 of tannin.
    9th, The aroma. This is the volatile and odorous prin
 ciple, which, being differently modified in many plants, gives
 to each of them an odour by which it is characterized.
    It resides, in particular, in volatile oils. Perhaps it is no
thing else than these oils themselves, more or less combined
 with other vegetable principles, which facilitate its solution
 in water, and which, in several cases, give it a certain fixity :
 but some chemists have entertained doubts respecting the ex
istence of aroma distinct from the other materials of vege
tables.
    Extract of opium, indeed, retains the virous odour of the
 poppy, notwithstanding the continued heat which the juice of
 that plant experiences during its evaporation.
    Extracts of rue, savine, and wormwood, retain the odour
of these plants ; and the sugar, carried to a very high tempe
 rature in the preparation of rose and orange flower tablets,
still exhales a very sensible odour of the flowers which have
 been employed.
                                                              And

                 Considerations     on Vegetable           Ex trails.         383
   And in dragees called orangeat, the bark of the orange-
tree, baked in a great deal of water till it loses its odour and
taste, resumes enough of both to be agreeable when it is con
fectioned in sugar.
   iOth, Amylaceous fecula. This is a white, dry, pulveru
lent substance, without savour and smell, insoluble in cold but
soluble in warm water, with which it assumes the gelatinous
 state   of glue.
   It  is extracted     from gramineous feeds, tuberous roots, and
 several fruits.
     11th, Gluten. This is a gray substance, of an insipid taste,
 with    the odour of horn slightly heated, of a soft, gluey, te
  nacious and elastic consistence, which is obtained in a state
  of purity only from the farina of wheat.
     It is dry and pulverulent in the farina; but during the ope
  ration it is saturated with the quantity of water necessary to
  assume the state of softness, elasticity, and ductility, under
  which it appears.
     It is this matter which in the fermentation of bread gives
•
  to the farina of wheat the most decided pre-eminence over
  that of all the other gramineous plants, which contain none
  ofit,   or which, like oarley, rye, and oats, contain only the
  materials of it.
     Some chemists have imagined that they could discover the
  existence of     in several vegetables.
                  it
     12th, Sulphur:       simple, yellow, dry, crystallizable, in
                          a
  flammable, and well known substance, which was thought
  to exist only in minerals, and which        found in several vege
                                                      is
  tables, those plants called antiscorbutic, the root of the pa
  tience, dock, 8tc. and even in animals.
      13th, Vegetable acids. These are very much multiplied,
  though they may be considered as modifications of one and
  the fame acid.
     Their distinguishing characters are that they become de
                                                      :
  composed in the fire, emitting an empyreumatic odour, and
  leaving  a  carbonaceous residuum       that they even possess the
                                                  ;
  property of being volatile,     property which may be employed
                                       a
  with great advantage for obtaining them in greater degree      a
 of purity.
    Those      best   known are    :
    1st,The gallic acid        :   it   exists in the gall nut,         the bark of
 the oak, &c.
    2d, The benzoic acid           :    it   is   found in benjamin and other
 balms and resins.
    3d, The citric acid    :   it   abounds in lemons, eooscberries, &c.
                                                                     4th.

  384            Considerations   on Vegetable   Extract.
     4th, The malic acid : it is contained in apples, strawber
  ries, raspberries, &c.
     5th, The oxalic acid : it exudes from the hair of vetches.
     6th, The acetous acid.        According to some chemists, it is
  not always the product of the fermentation known under that
  name ; it is obtained sometimes by the action of the sulphuric
 and muriatic acids on vegetable substances. C. Vauquelin
  found it in the sap of trees.
     7th, The oxalic acidulum.         This is a non-saturated com
 bination of the oxalic acid with potash : it is furnished by
 sorrel.
     8th, The tartarous acid. It is found crystallized in large
 quantity on the fides of casks in which wine has remained;
  but it exists also in tamarinds, the barberry bush, &c.
     These acids are either insulated in vegetables or combined
 with earths, either calcareous or aluminous, and alkalies.
     To these saline combinations, which with the two acidula
 may be considered as the real essential salts of vegetables, we
 might add other salts which are often found in them : of this
 kind are the sulphates of potasli and soda, the muriates of
 potash and soda, the nitrate of potash.
     These last salts, according to the observations of chemists,
 are products in vegetables merely by the power which resides
 in them, and which have the faculty of composing them
 perfect, of uniting and combining the principles which can
 constitute them, but in different proportions, since it may de
 pend on a pre-existing saline atom.
     Certain plants in which nitrate of potafli is found are
 fonder of earth which contains it : pellitory, in particular,
seems to choose, that it may grow there at its cafe, the bot
tom of a wall well furnistied with saltpetre.
    When the sea, impelled by an impetuous wind, enters
through the mouth of a river at a time when it is less abun
dant in water ; when it penetrates very far into the country
through the small canals by which it is watered, and drenches
with brine the plants that usually grow on their banks ; these
plants cease to have a desire for inhabiting them ; they die ;
and their place is soon supplied by other vegetables to which
this moisture is suited, necessary, and indispensable.
    This is exactly what has taken place at the mouths of the
Nile. One branch in particular of this river, that of Dami-
etta, opposed for some time, by a peculiar circumstance, less
resistance to the waters    of the sea : it received ami still receives
them during that part of the year when it is lowest ; and
since that period several of the plants which grew in the
                                                                 canals

                    Observations   brt     Vegetable    Exlrafls.   385
canals in the neighbourhood of Damietta, and which could
not bear to have their roots imrnersed in earth moistened by
water less fresh than before, have disappeared ; so that the
papyrus, which was very abundant in that district, is now
exceedingly rase.     The papyrus has abandoned Us native
country.
   Instead of this list, it would be more advantageous to be
able to present an exact analysis of each pharmaceutic ex
tract in particular. This would be the means of enlightening
the apothecary in regard to their preparation, and the physi
cian in regard to their virtue ; but the labours of modern che
mists on this point are still very deficient, and the ahtient phar-
macopolists never thought of undertaking this object, which
they would not have been able to accomplish with the neces
sary chemical knowledge. For want of better materials, they
collected very just observations; so that, guided by them, and
authorized by the example            os'
                                  nature, which in resinous gums,
sap, and resins, presented them with products very similar
to the different extracts, they arranged the latter into four
classes   :
   1st, Gummy extracts. They resemble glue and jelly, and
are furnished           by
               the seeds of the flag, mallows, &c.
   3d, Gummy resinous extracts.      These are those which
contain gum and resin united together.     They are obtained
from jalap, aloes, &c.
   3d, Saponaceous extracts. These are those in which the
gummy and resinous principles are           well combined that
                                                       so
they do not separate.     Of this kind are extracts of the car-
duus benedictus, fumitory, &c.
   41I1, Resinous extracts.     These are the resins properly
called, obtained either            by
                               means of alcohol, which gives
them more or less pure, or                 by
                                  means of ether, which fur
nishes them absolutely freed from gummy principle.
   The different extracts have received different names.
   Robe, Japa, defrutum, jelly, extraSt.
   Robe is the juice of any fruit inspissated to the consistence
of honey.
   Sapa     the juice of grapes evaporated to the fame degree.
              is
   Defrutum        the fame juice deprived of two-thirds of its
                        is
humidity, and which being left to ferment in this state givej
baked wine.
   Jelly the infusion or decoction of the mucilaginous sub
              is
stances of vegetables, or the gelatinous parts of animals con
centrated to the proper degree.
   ExtraSl       the product of the evaporation of vegetable
                   is
juices, infusions, or decoctions.

  these different extracts was to concentrate and preserve in a
   small volume the virtues and properties of vegetables, it is
   necessary that we mould give a view of the means they em
   ployed to accomplish this object, such as the extraction of
   the juices of green plants; maceration, infusion, or the de
   coction of dried plants ; and evaporation.

                    account of his life collected from such imperfect
   materials as we could at that time obtain.         As we have since
   learnt that this sketch was incorrect in several particulars, and
    as it always gives us pleasure to rectify any errors into which
    we may inadvertently fall, we are happy to have it in our
               to lay before our readers a more correct life, written
      y a gentleman of distinguished literary abilities, and who,
    Eower
    from his intimacy w-ith the professor, must be perfectly ac
    quainted with the subject. Dr. Gleig, the gentleman alluded
    to, in a letter to the editor of the Anti-jacobin Review, to
    whom this life was lirst communicated, expresses himself in
    the following candid manner :
        In the tenth volume of the Philosophical Magazine are
    Memoirs of the Life of John Robifon, LL.D. &c, Professor
    of Natural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh ; the
    author of which has, indeed, done justice to the professor's
    general character as a man of science and of virtue, whilst
     he has stated inaccurately almost every incident of his life.
    To point out the numerous mistakes into which he has fallen,
     and correct them in a table of errata, would serve no pur
     pose, because to such tables attention is seldom paid ; and
     being an absolute stranger to the conductor of that publica
     tion, I cannot request him to sill, with a second life of my
     friend, pages professedly devoted to the improvement of useful
     arts and physical science.        Perhaps it may gratify curiosity
     to inform the public, that the engraved portrait of Dr. Robi

   John Robison, LL.D. is a younger son of the late John
Robison, esq. of Boghall, in the county of Stirling. |
    Mr. Robison, the father, engaged, at an early period of
life, in commerce, and carried on, for many years, a lucra
tive trade as a merchant in Glasgow ; but before the birth
of the subject of this memoir he had retired from business,
and lived on his estate.     He is remembered both in Glasgow
and in the country with much respect, as a man of great
piety, honourable in his commercial dealings, kind to the
poor, and a good landlord.
    Dr. Robison was in 1739 born at Boghall, where he
passed the early years of childhood ; but there being no school
of any note in the parish of Baldernock, where Boghall is
situated, he received the whole of his education in Glasgow.
His progress through school must have been rapid ; for be
fore he was nineteen years of age he had completed the
usual course of study in the university.
    I have indeed often heard bim regret that he was but a
careless scholar : but his apprehension     is so quick, and his
memory so retentive, that he must have acquired a compe
tent knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages with very
little labour.   His knowledge of these languages now is such
as few men possess whose lives have been devoted to the pur
suits of science ; and this, in all probability, it would not have
been ; had not a solid foundation been laid at school.      Sensi
ble, however, that by greater exertion he might have done
more than he did, he regrets, at present, what most men,
who were clever boys, have cause to regret, that, at school,
he contented himself with barely surpassing his duller class-
fellows.
    In the university he had the happiness of studying under
the professors Moore, Simson, Smith, Dick, and Leechman,
whose eminence as teachers of the Greek language, of mathe
matics, moral philosophy, natural philosophy and theology,
will be long remembered in Glasgow. To mathematics he
had no particular predilection till he perceived the use of that
science when studying natural philosophy under Dr. Dick;
and to algebra he has at no period of his life been partial.
Dr. Simson's lectures were not, indeed, calculated to make
 any of his pupils partial to that branch of science ; and I have
beard Dr. Robison say, that he first attracted the regard of
 that admirer of antient geometry by owning his dislike of
 algebra, and by returning a neat geometrical solution of a
 problem which had been given out to the class in an algebraic
 form.    With this mode of solution the professor was de
lighted, though the pupil candidly acknowledged that it had
                               B b  %                         been

j88                    Biographical  Memoirs   of
been adopted only because he could not solve the problem m
the manner required of the class.
    Of the knowledge which Dr. Robison now possesses of
mathematical science in all its branches I need fay nothing,
since I have beeti the instrument of communicating some va
luable specimens of it to the public ; but I know that, even,
yet, he delights much more in geometry than in any of the
modes of algebra, assigning, as the reason of his preference,
that in the longest demonstration the geometrician has always-
clear and adequate ideas, which the most expert algebraist
 can very seldom have.
    Dr. Dick, who had been conjoined with his father in the
 professorship of natural philosophy, dying in the year 1757,
Mr, Robison offered himself to the old gentleman as an inte
rim assistant ; and, though then not nineteen years of age, he
 had the honour to be recommended as fit for the office by Dr.
Adam Smith, afterwards so well known by his celebrated work
on the Wealth of Nations. Professor Dick, however, thought
him too young; but, acknowledging his merit, he joined with
Dr. Simson in recommending him to Dr. Blair, prebendary
 of Westminster, whom they understood to be in quest of a
 young man to go to sea with Edward duke of York, and read
 mathematics with his royal highness and a young officer who
 was to attend him as a companion.           Though this employ
 ment had been declined by another gentleman, Mr. Robison
 embraced     with eagerness so favourable an opportunity of
 escaping   from    the clerical profession, from which, though
 designed   for  it  by his father, whom he revered, and could
 not disobey, he had acquired an insuperable aversion.      That
 aversion arose not, however, from any determination formed
 by him to devote his life to the advancement of mathema
 tical science, and still less from any dislike which he had
 conceived    to the study of theology ; but from circumstances
 which, though they did credit to his head and heart, were
 such as would not interest the public.        No man, I believe,
 has juster notions of the importance of theological know
 ledge, or a more sincere regard for the faithful ministers of
 religion, than professor Robison ; and certainly no man has
 a more rooted abhorrence of hypocrisy in all its forms.
    Without any very distinct notion how he was to be em
 ployed, or what were to be the emoluments of his office,
 Mr. Robison went to London in 1758. There he soon dis
 covered that the hopes with which he had been flattered, of
 reading mathematics with the duke of York, were built upon
 no other foundation than some vague scheme of Dr. Blair's,
 in cafe his royal highness should go to sea the ensuing sum
                                                            mer;

                   Dr. Robifon, of Edinburgh.                  389
mer; and it is not to be doubted but that he felt the disap
pointment. He acknowledges, indeed, that he felt it severely ;
 out, as he could not think of returning to Glasgow, he em
braced the opportunity of still going to sea as mathematical
tutor to Mr. Knowles, eldest son of admiral Knowles, and the
intended companion of the duke of York.
    With that gentleman he went, in 1759, on board the
Neptune, of 90 guns, bound to Quebec ; aud Mr. Knowles
being on the voyage appointed lieutenant on board the Royal
William, Mr. Robifon accompanied him, and, at his own
request, was rated midshipman.          I have often heard him
say that in the Royal William he spent the three happiest
years of his life.    When he gave me the article Seamanship,
which is published in the Encyclopædia Britannica, he said
it was the superior seamanship of captain Hugh Pigot which
so forcibly turned his attention to that noble art, and gave
him such a love for the profession that it is still a favourite
subject of his thoughts.      Indeed, I believe that, if he ever
formed a determination to devote hislife to the improvement
of any art or science, it was at this time to the improvement
of the art of seamanship.         When captain Pigot took the
 charge   of  the  ship, which    during very stormy weather he
generally   did,  the address  with  which he made her do what
 ever he pleased, after she had baffled the efforts of the officers
of the watch, rilled the mind of Mr. Robifon with delight
 and wonder.      It excited in him an ambition to rival such
skill, whilst he confesses that he despaired of ever surpassing it.
    It was on board the Royal William, in the river St. Law
 rence, that Mr. Robifon first noticed a connection between
 the aurora lorealis and the direction of the magnetic needle.
 Pointing out the circumstance to the gentlemen on the
 quarter deck, he got the remark inserted in the St. James's
 Evening Chronicle, and afterwards in the London Chronicle,
 with an invitation to navigators to pay attention to the sub
ject, and communicate their observations to the Royal Society.
    A reinforcement of men being wanted for the ships lying
 before Quebec, lieutenant Knowles and a hundred seamen,
 with petty officers, were received from the Royal William on
 board the Stirling Castle, where fir Charles Saunders had his
 flag. There Mr. Robifon saw much service both on board
 and ashore, and was sometimes employed in taking surveys
 of different parts of the river. Returning to the Royal Wil
 liam when Quebec was taken, he spent the whole of next
 year and part of the following in the bay of Biscay, and on
 the coasts of Spain and Portugal.

390                  Biographical  Memoirs of
the Peregrine floop of war, Mr. Robison accompanied him }
but those friends soon after parted, never to meet more.         In
 176a  the  subject of  this memoir   was  sent,  by  the admiralty
board, to Jamaica, to make trial of Harrison's time-keeper;
and, on his return, he learned, with grief, that the Peregrine
 had foundered at sea, and that his beloved friend and pupil,
 with the whole crew, had perished.
    His prospects were now not flattering. AdmiTal Knowles
had retired to the country in deep affliction for his son ; lord
Anson, on whole promise of future preferment Mr. Robison
 had gone to Jamaica, was dead 5 in the friendship of Dr. Blair
he had little confidence; peace seemed to be at no great distance;
 and his hopes of advancement in the navy were very small.
   He determined therefore to return to college, being assured
by admiral (then sir Charles) Knowles, that he would fend
his remaining son as soon as he mould have passed through
the forms of Eton school, to complete his education under
his inspection.     Next year Mr. Mac Dowell jun. of Castle
Semple (now of Garthland, and M. P.) was placed under his
care ; and soon afterwards he carried from London to Glasgow
Mr. Knowles, now fir Charles Knowles, and a rear admiral.
    It was when he returned to college from the navy, as           I
have heard Dr. Robison say, that he seriously began to study;
but his helps were gone. Dr. Simson was dead, Dr. Smith
soon left Glasgow to travel with the duke of Buccleugh, and
Dr. Moore was greatly changed. He attended, however, the
lectures of Mr. Miller, the late celebrated professor of civil
law in the university of Glasgow, and those of the still more
celebrated    Dr. Black, on chemistry; and finding in Dr.
Reid, who succeeded Dr. Smith, and in Dr. Alexander Wil
son, professor of astronomy, minds congenial with his own,
he soon formed with these two men a very close intimacy.
He speaks, likewise with great affection of Dr. Wight, pro
fessor of history, and of Dr. Stevenson, professor of medicine,
and in terms of high respect, indeed, of all the members of
that learned body. That the respect between them and him
was mutual is apparent from many circumstances.
   When Dr. Black was called, in 1767, to Edinburgh, the
senate of the university of Glasgow, on his recommendation,
appointed Mr. Robison to succeed him as lecturer on che
mistry.     He read lectures on that science for three years with
great applause, and had among his pupils men who have
since distinguished themselves among the most eminent che
mists  of  the age.
   In 1770    sir Charles Knowles,   being invited to St. Peters-
bur«h by the empress Catharine      II. to assist her in reforming
                                                                her

                      Dr.  Robison,  of Edinburgh.                39I
her marine, requested Mr. Robison to accompany him in
the capacity or his official secretary, with a salary of 250 1.
a-year,      Mr. Robison's attachment to the. navy, and to his
affectionate friend and patron, being as strong as ever, and
a lecturer not having the fame rank in the university of Glas
gow with a professor, the request was cheerfully complied
with.
     It would appear that his conduct al St. Petcrsburgh, and
the knowledge which he had occasion to exhibit in the view
of the admiralty college, had powerfully recommended him
to that board; for ia 177a he was appointed inspector-ge
neral of the corps of marine cadets, — an academy consisting
of upwards of four hundred young gentlemen and scholars,
under the tuition of about forty teachers.            As the person
 who sills this office has the rank    of lieutenant-colonel,  it be
 came necessary, by the customs of Russia, that Mr. Robison
 should prove himself a gentleman, or what is there called a
 dvoranin; and the proofrequired was entered on record.
     As inspector-general he had nothing to teach, nor did he
 ever teach mathematics in any school during his residence in
 that vast empire.       His duty was to visit daily every class of
 the academy ;      to receive  weekly reports from each master,
 fiating   the diligence  and  progress of every person in his class ;
 and twice a-year to advance the young gentlemen into the
 higher classes, according to their respective merits. Of these
 he was constituted the sole judge, and from his sentence there
 lay no appeal.
      In justice to a stranger and foreigner, it is proper to add,
 that, when speaking of this part of his duty, Dr. Robison al
 ways mentions in terms of high respect the enlightened and
 honourable conduct of general Kutuzoff, who was military
 head of the academy, and held the third place in the admi
 ralty college. He represents the behaviour of that general to
 himself as more like the behaviour of a parent than of a su
 perior; for he approved of all his decisions, adopted all his
  measures, supported his authority against intrigue and oppo
  sition, and introduced him to the grand duke as an admirer
  of the Ruffian language, of which his imperial highness was
  the declared patron. This was a very powerful recommenda
  tion ; for, however absurdly Paul seems to have conducted
  himself on the throne, he had taste enough, when grand
  duke, to feel the beauties of that language, and to betriend
  foreigners, who, like the subject of this memoir, had studied
  it with success.
      Dr. Robison had not the honour os being at all known to
  the empress; nor did I ever hear him speak of being con-

                      Biographical     Memoirs of
cemed in any plan for supplying her palace with water}
though I recollect a conversation Between him and me, oc
casioned by the description of a ball-cock * in one of our
newspapers,     which could not have failed to lead to the men
tion of such a plan had he known any thing of it.                 I have,
however, heard him sav, that he presented to the admiralty
college a plan for rendering the magnificent docks at Cron
stadt of some use by means of a steam-engine ; and that the
plan was adopted, and executed with success after he left
Russia. — Tulit alter bonorfs.
    He quitted that empire not because the emoluments of his
appointments were comparatively small, for they were much
greater than those of his appointment in Edinburgh, but be
cause, the academy being at Cronstadt, a dismal solitude, he
sound his situation extremely irksome.           Had it been at Saint
Petersburgh, the society of Euler and Æpinus, to whom he
was known, as well as of many Russian gentlemen whom he
speaks of as possessing British hearts, might have reconciled
him to that capital j Dul to get away from Cronstadt he ac
cepted with pleasure the invitation of the magistrates and
town council of Edinburgh to be professor of natural philo
sophy in their university.        The grand duke parted with him
reluctantly,    and  requesting    him, when he left the academy,
to take with him some young men of talents from the corps
of cadets: he promiled him a pension of 400 rubles (80 1.)
a-year.     That pension was regularly paid only during the
three years that the gentlemen whom he selected resided in
Edinburgh : it was then discontinued, as I think he told me,
because he did not continue a correspondence              with the aca
demy, and communicate all the British improvements in
marine education.
    Much has been said of professor Robison's lectures on na
tural philosophy ; much that is true, and something that is
unquestionably false. It is universally admitted that he gives
 a comprehensive      and scientific view of his subject, and that
he skilfully applies its principles to the acts of life; but com
plaints have been made of the abstrusenefs of his demonstra
 tions. Are the complainers certain that the demonstrations
are abstruse to such as are qualified by a preparatory know-
    * The ball-cock thus Jescribcd was, in fact, the fame with that of
Desaguliers, no: iced in the article Water Works in the EKcyclofttiiii.
Dr. Rubison, after expressing some surprise that the writer in the news
paper Aiou.d have said that it is not noticed in that article, give me an
account of his paving been frequently employed to disengage air from
viier pipts both in England and in Scotland ; but said nothing of his
r-ting so employed at Sr. Petcifburgh.

                     tir.   Robi/on,   of Edinburgh.                £9$
ledge    of mathematics to enter upon the study of natural phi
losophy ? It becomes not me, perhaps, to answer this ques
tion ; but I may surely say that, in conversation, no man
communicates knowledge more clearly than Dr. Robison,
and that a more perspicuous account of" what philosophy can
attain, and how it should be cultivated, will not readily be
found than what he has given in the Encyclopædia Britannica
under the titles Philosophy and Physics. To understand the
demonstrations which he gives in the class, no higher know
ledge is requisite than that of the most elementary properties
of the conic sections; and, for my part, I cannot conceive
how he, or any man, could demonstrate that the moon, for
instance, is retained in her orbit round the earth by a gravi
 tation, such as Newton discovered, to him who knows not
 the nature of the ellipse which she describes.
      Of the estimation in which his talents and his virtues h^ve
 been held, not only by his colleagues in the university of
Edinburgh, but by various other literary societies, the fol
 lowing unsolicited honours conferred upon him by those so
 cieties, afford ample evidence.
     In 1783, when the Royal Society of Edinburgh was incor
 porated by charter, he -was unanimously chosen general se
 cretary ; and discharged the duties of the office to the satis
 faction of the president, vice-presidents, and council, till a
 few years ago, that bad health obliged him to resign it. la
 1798 he was complimented with the diploma of LL.D. by
 the academy of New Jersey.        In 1799 he was created LL.D.
 by    the university of Glasgow,  which  sent to him a diploma
 conceived in terms the most honourable, as well to the senate
                 in it,
 that decreed         as to him in whose favour the decree was
 passed.     And      1800 he was unanimously elected foreign
 member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Peters-
  burgh, in the room of Dr. Black. To the scientific public           it
 may not be unacceptable to add, that, at the particular request
  of the friends of that eminent chemist, he now preparing
                                                       is
  his lectures for the press.
      Though this detail must not be considered as specimen a
  of biography, but merely as correct annals of Dr. Robison's
  life, it would be unpardonable to conclude     without noticing
                                                  it
  his conne6tion with the fraternity of Free-masons, and his
  attack on their higher mysteries.
      As was privy to the composition of his Proofs of Con
        I                                                       a
  spiracy, &c.   I  have his own authority to fay that he never
  was in     mason lodge in Great Britain. Once, indeed, when
             a
a    lad at college, he was carried into  bam
                                            a      by
                                                   two or three of
  kis companions, who, being themselves free-masons, showed
                                                                    him,

394          Hi/lory and Antiquity of    the Cow-Pod,
him, in  a frolic, some mummeries, exacted his oath of secrecy,
and told him that he was now a free-mason ! The whole
appeared so silly that he believed they were playing a trick
upon him. This was, indeed, the cafe; but the scene gave
him such an idea of masonry that be never bestowed a thought
upon it till he was at Liege in his way to St. Petersburgh.
Dining one day with sir Charles Knowles at the table of the
prince bishop, he was surprised to observe that all present,
masters and- servants, had about them some badge or other of
free-masonry; and learning that the chapter constituted a
lodge, of which the bishop was the tres-venerable, he was
easily persuaded by such masons to become a brother.             He
was accordingly received apprentice a few days after, and
has himself published an account of his progress through the
other degrees till he attained the rank of Scotch master.         In
all the conversations which I have had with Dr. Robison on
this subject, justice requires me to fay that I never heard him
once insinuate that there is any thing immoral in the simple
system of British masonry ; and he certainly has not accused
that system of immorality in his book.           Yet I have heard
British masons apply to themselves all that he hath said of the
French degrees, and even of the order of the llluminati, and
represent his Proofs of a Conspiracy as a collection of calum
nies ! Surely such men are not aware that, by holding this
language, they accuse themselves of crimes of which the au
thor or the Proofs has declared them innocent.         I can, how
ever, assure them that     he  considers   their  mysteries as ex
tremely frivolous, though not criminal ; and that, on account
of the superstructure which elsewhere has been raised on.
them, he never advises a young man to become a free-mason.
   Dr. Robison retains an affectionate attachment to the
place of his nativity, and passes a part of every summer amid
the scenes of his youthful pleasures.        What he possesses is
but a remnant of the estate which was the property of his
father ; but he is a man of too much virtue to diminish it
otherwise than as it was diminished before — in making pro
vision for his children ; and too much addicted to science
and literature to set his heart anxiously on increasing it.

LXVI.    Extracls from Foreign Journals respecting the His

noticed in our last Number, the accounts of the fact of the
cow-pock being known among the country people, not only
in England, but in Ireland and Germany ; and even some
instances of intentional inoculation,         we felt humiliation
from the notion of the human intellect excited on this oc
casion.      Although, with partiality to our own country
men, we may even rejoice to find, in the extracts before us,
instances of equally glaring oversight      in other nations ; yet
these further instances, we must allow, afford confirmation
of the humiliating notion just mentioned.

 the oldest known in regard to the history of the cow-pock,
 wijl, no doubt, be welcome to our readers, and particularly
 to the friends of vaccination.
     " A weekly" journal, entitled Allgemeine Unterhaltungen,
 for the year 1769, printed at Gottingen by F. A. Roi'en-
 bufeh, with plates, contains a learned dissertation,            by a
 writer who calls himself ' An old housekeeper,'              without
 mentioning; the place of his abode, ' on the disease among
 the horned cattle ; of quotations fromLivy;' the most re
 markable passage in which is to the following purport:
 ' On this subject, however, I will not venture to decide ;
 but what chiefly excites my attention, is the circumstance
 that such a plague was very common among men and these
 animals, which is not the cafe at present.          I conceived that
 there might be many diseases of this kind, and that perhaps
 it was only some inflammatory fever, accompanied with
 eruption, which was often common to men and animals ;
 and Livy, in one place, calls it expressly scabies.           But it
 afterwards occurred to me that it might be the well-known             -
 cow-pock, not unknown in this country, (Gottingen, no
 doubt, where the journal was printed,) and which is still
 infectious to the girls who milk cows, and to other persons
 who have the care of these animals.         It is true, indeed, that
 few men or animals die of this disease ; but those attacked
 by it may be exceedingly sick, and perhaps it is owing to the
  coldness of our climate that the poison is not more violent.
 1 must, however, remark, that in this country (Gottingen)

have often beard.'

letter from a friend, inserted it in his monthly journal, called
The German Patriot, for January 1802.               When the person
who transmitted this notice, counsellor Faust, found it among

                              " In the month of July, 1800, the
cow-pock was discovered among the cows in the neighbour
hood of Plon, and a physician of Eutin made experiments
 with the matter, an account of which may be seen in Hen-

 1801, No. 182, a piece of very important intelligence, by
 counsellor Hellwag of Eutin, that in Holstein and Jutland
 there are several men who have had the cow-pock, which is
indigenous in that country, both by infection and by being
 purposely inoculated, 13, 29, 36, and even 46 years ago,
 and who have been hitherto preserved from the infection of
the small-pox, though attempts have been made to commu
 nicate the latter disease to them by inoculation."'

                             " A malignant species of the smallT
pox, which, about the time when the first experiments
were made in Germany, prevailed for fifteen months in the
 neighbourhood of Hanover, and swept off a great many
 children, contributed not a little to favour the introduction
 and propagation of the vaccine inoculation.
     "  Matter was immediately procured from Dr. Jenner in
 Gloucestershire, and it was observed that it produced more
 local effect on the place of inoculation, while that obtained
 from Dr. Pearson of London often produced a mild erup
tion. The same thing was afterwards observed in regard to
 the cow-pock matterproduced in Hanover.                  At first it was
 supposed that this difference in effect arose from a difference
in the inoculating matter. But Dr. Pearson, who was con-

that he considered the difference which had been observed
as merely accidental, and not as depending on the difference
 of the matter.        Even experience shows, that in regard to
the principal object, the property of preventing the small
pox infection, the vaccine matter of doctors Jenner and
Pearson, and that produced in Hanover, are entirely the
same."

                               "  That the cow-pock does not infect,
but by the immediate contact of wounded places, has been
confirmed by experience_in Hanover ; as has also been the
assertion of Dr. Pearson, that those who have once had the
common small-pox, or the genuine cow-pock, cannot be
affected a second time by either of these diseases, even though
 the vaccination be several times repeated.              In the last cafe,
however, suppurating pustules, surrounded with a little red
ness, arise sometimes          from the puncture ; but they are not
only unattended with the characteristic form of the real
 cow-pock pustules, but the general re-action on the system
 connected with it."

 able sources, and, so far we know, without communication
 with one another, seems to place the fact beyond the reach
 of doubt.      We state them as they severally came to our
 hands.
    "1. Dr. William Buet, of Sheffield, in the state of Mas
 sachusetts, in a letter to Dr. Miller, dated 20th May, 1801,
 describes the cafe of a lad, in his neighbourhood, affected
 with an eruption on his face and hands, greatly resembling
 vaccine pustules, to whom he was called on the iothof the
 preceding month. With matter taken from these pustules he
 inoculated several persons, and observed the disease to pursue
 a similar course, and to exhibit similar phænomena, to a case
of actual vaccine-pox then under his care. Aud after the
 termination of this new disease, he tested          it,as usual, by
 variolous inoculation, with the fame happy result as in other
 cafes of the vaccine-pox.        Upon inquiry, he found the lad
had sometimes milked cows, that these cows had been ob
served to have sore teats, and that the hands and face of the
lad had been prepared for the reception of the disease, by
having been previously scratched in play by his companions.
    " %. Dr. EHflia North, of Goshen, in the state of Connec
ticut, who has bestowed much attention on the vaccine
disease, has found    it among the cows of that neighbourhood,
and inoculated   it  with success. In     a   letter of the 25th of
May last to Dr. Miller, he announces the discovery, and
that the inoculation of the disease had been tried in num    a
ber of instances with complete effect.
    " 3. Dr. Joseph Trowbridge, of Danbury, in the state of
Connecticut, in   a   letter to Dr. Mitchill, dated 6th of July,
1 801, communicates        a similar discovery which he has made
among the cows of that place. At that time he had inocu
lated three persons of his own family, and the disease pro
duced   by  the inoculation exhibited all the appearances of the
genuine vaccine-pox.
    " Since our last Number, the vaccine disease, apparently
genuine, has been introduced and propagated in this city
(New-York). The present season of the year, which, ac
cording to popular prejudice,   is    deemed unfavourable to in
oculation, has hitherto prevented the disease from being em
ployed frequently or generally  :     and the usual banishment of
the small-pox at    this  time rendersit    more difficult to apply
as  a test of the genuineness of the few cafes of vaccine- pox
which have vet occurred. We hope to be able to offer             a
more satisfactory account of the progress of the disease in
our next Number."

  The           account affords another proof of the little de
             above
pendence    to be placed upon physicians in the application of
facts to practice ; and the more glaring they are, it seems,
the more heedless, or even stupid, they have been in some
instances, as in the present case.    It now appears that the
cow-pox prevails not only in the western counties of Eng
land, where the farmers discovered that their servants or
themselves were exempted       from the small-pox by having
had the cow-pox ; but the same disease and the same fact of
exemption were also known in other English counties; in
Ireland, in Holstein, in Denmark, in many parts of Ger
many, and even near Gottingen, in Switzerland, and in the
 Milanese.     Nay, as long ago as 1769, the German jour
 nalists announced these facts, and the advantages over the
 fmall-pox.
LXVII.            Some curious       Observations  respecting the Crocodile.
  By C. Frank, Physician                 to tbs French Army of the Eaji.
  W         HEN            Egypt and the   Nile become       the subject of con
versation         in Europe, the danger             to which people are exposed
of being    devoured by the crocodile is commonly mentioned.
 It   is,however, not generally known that this amphibious
 animal       never seen in that part of the Nile which traverses

 Thebaide.         never found any crocodiles till

 way beyond Gyrge.           This animal quits its retreats at the
 bottom of the water during the warm days, and when the
 Nile low, and places itself on the sand-banks, which are
            is
  then frequently met with.           was in the months of April

                           I                    The crocodile seldom
  appears on the banks of the river, except when little fre
  quented, or when access to them         difficult.
                                                                     it it It

  the crocodile      aware of the danger to which
                           is                             would be ex
  posed without that precaution.        In general, never goes to
 a   greater distance from the water than about six paces.         The
  least noise awakens it.       never was able to get within musket
                                     I

 shoot any of them, or catch them in snares, they are as pYoud
 as those who, in Europe, kill a wolf.          Of all the crocodiles
           I
 which had an opportunity of seeing, either in going up or
 down the Nile, I never observed any more than eight or
 ten feet in length.       Prosper Alpinus speaks of a crocodile
 thirty ells in length : but it is proper to remark that this
 author never was in Upper Egypt, and that he was probably
 deceived by false reports.       1 rie celebrated Norden fays he
 saw some fifty feet in length. I am, however, of opinion that
he was deceived also ; for I never found any person in the
 country who saw any so large.
     In regard to the danger of being devoured by this animal,
it is much less than is commonly believed. The crocodile,
in general, seems to dread man, for it is not fond of inhabited
places : the nearer, then, that one approaches          to the cata
racts, the more frequently they are met with. The indiffe
 rence with which the inhabitants and their children amuse
themselves in the water and walk on the banks, proves to me
that they are in no dread of the crocodile.
     Isa favourable opportunity, however, occurs, this cunning
animal will seize a sheep, a goat^ or an ass, £nd sometimes a
child, which it drags with it to the middle of the river, and
plunges to the bottom.         In one place, where the women are
accustomed to fill their vessels with water, I saw a semi-cir
cular palisade, made of reeds, destined to prevent the croco
dile from doing mischief.        In that place, one of them seized
and tore off a woman's breast at the time she was stooping
down to fill her pitcher with water.
     It is a very singular observation, that this animal when it
remains out of the water is almost always surrounded by va
rious large birds, among which I could always distinguish
the pelican. What strange relation exists between these ani
mals so different ? It is a well-known fact, that the white
heron has a singular sympathy for the buffaloes, oxen, and
cows. Does there exist a sympathy of the same kind between
these birds, but particularly the pelican and the crocodile ?

experimental           ph ilo soph Y.— Determination of tbeln-
    tenjity of the Atlion which Magnetic Bars exercise on dis-*
   ferent Metals purified by the ordinary Processes.
    In pursuing his researches on the action which mngnetic
bars exercise on all bodies, C. Coulomb has been able to
measure the intensity of this action for the different metals
brought to that state of purity which results from the com
mon operations of refining.
    He formed small cylinders of wax, into which he intro
duced different quantities of iron-filings uniformly dispc rsed
over the whole mass, and, by measuring the action which
they experienced from magnetic bars, has deduced the law
according to which the magnetic force decreases in propor
tion as the quantitity of the iron mixed is lessened.      With
these two data he determined the very small quantity of iron
that remained in an ingot of silver fused with an equal por
tion of iron by C. Guyton, and which in the operation had
appeared to separate itself very exactly from the second metal.
    This silver, dissolved in nitric acid and precipitated by
prufiiate of soda, gave no indication of the presence of iron ;
it however experienced, in a sensible manner, the influence
of the magnetic bar, and in such a manner as to (how that
 it still contained iron.   By comparing this action with that
of the fame bar on the cylinders above mentioned, C. Cou
 lomb has found that there remained in the piece of silver
 of iron. He found by the fame method, that if the action of
 the magnetic bar on a plate of silver purified by cupellation,
 or extracted from the muriate, ought to be ascribed to the
 presence of iron, the quantity of the latter metal present will
 amount only to -rrs's-es part. This quantity, which may be
 considered as infinitely small, would, however, be in such a
 state of division that there would be no molecule of silver
 which did not contain a portion of iron.

    Ai Yes :       I have   been acquainted with the practice sines
January 1799.           I also think it is but justice to Dr. Jenner to
state, that 1 am acquainted with the practice of inoculation
of persons for the small-pox, who on good evidence were said
to have gone through the cow-pox since June 1798 : the re
sult of which wa3, that they could not receive the small-pox
infection.
    Was it from the communications of Dr. Jenner, or any
other source, that you derived your knowledge of the vaccine
inoculation ?
    A. In the first instance from Dr. Jenner : afterwards I got
information from other sources. — [Letters delivered in.]
    Do you imagine that the information contained in these
letters arose from Dr. Jenner's publication of his discovery, or
from a previous knowledge of vaccine inoculation ?
    A. I imagine they were independent of each oiher.
    Did you ever hear that Dr. Jenner had communicated his
discovery to Mr. John Hunter many years previous to this
correspondence ? And is it not known that in his lectures
some years before his death he mentioned it publicly ?
    A. Not the praclice of inoculation; but that Dr. Jenner
had acquainted him that persons who had the cow-pox could
not take the small pox, and that nobody had been known to
die of the cow-pox.
     Had you any other communications with the Rev. Her
man Drew, besides the letters delivered in, upon the subject
of vaccine inoculation ?
    A. None that 1 think relate to the question.
    Does Mr. H. Drew lay claim to the discovery of inocu
lating with the vaccine matter from one human being to an
 other ?
    A. No; that is exclusively* Dr. Jenner's.
    Do you know when the facts stated in the correspond-
 eenc which you delivered              to the committee actually took
 places    ?
     A. Only that they took place, in all probability, earlier than
 the year 1798.
     On what do you ground that opinion ?
    A. Because, immediately upon the publication of Dr. Jen
 ner's work in 1798, I wrote to the gentlemen who furnished
 that information, namely, the Rev.          Mr. H. Drew, Dr.Pulteney,
    * Dr. Pearson, in
                        his book lately pubiillied, finds that this is net strictly
 correct; for vaccine inoculation from the human subject had been previ
 ously instituted.

 sea's work just publislicd.

Mr. Dolling,       Mr. Down, of Bridport. They immediately
                        and
communicated   their cafes of vaccine inoculation, without ap
pearing to be acquainted with Dr. Jennet's works.
   Have you reason to think that Dr. Jenner, previous to the
publication of his first work on vaccine inoculation, was at
all acquainted with the facts contained in the correspondence
delivered      in?
  A. I            I apprehend the parties all performed their
              have said,
inoculations independent of each other. —Withdrew.

 which    coating  I  dare not destroy to examine the materials
of  the ball ; but from its weight it must be metallic, yet it
floats high in the fluid.    Since he took it from this place, I
perceive he has marked it with lines of longitude and lati
tude, like a geographical sphere.       This,  I presume, he has
done on his voyage outward, the journal or which is likely
left in America. But this which I possess begins with the
exact point of latitude and longitude of Philadelphia, and
records the zenith of every day as accurately as if he had
been all along on terra firma.      In bed he told the captain
his distance from the coast of Ireland to a minute, by look

   "  The properties of magnetism are not yet sufficiently
known, and they have heretofore been applied to use only
in the form of the needle.     But it appears to possess, besides
its well known polarity, a propensity to retain its native re
lative position on the earth ; that is to fay, it turns upon an
axis, like the earth, one point always pointing at the pole
star.   Beyond the line, this point upon the ball is below the
horizon ; and on the shores of America the longitudinal
line, which now is its meridian, was far down the fide : so
 that, if he had sailed round the earth, his little ball would
 have made a complete revolution upon its axis."
                               ARTS.
   We mentioned      some time ago that a French artist had dis
covered a method     of soldering glass when broken. This art
we now understand      has been carried so far towards perfection,
that two plates of   the size of eighteen inches may be joined
 together.
   Another artist of the fame country has found out the
means of rolling plates of glass in such a manner as to ex
tend them some inches each time they are pasted through
the rollers, as would be the cafe with metal. The process
has not yet been made public ; but we apprehend that a part
 of it must consist in subjecting the plates, after the first cast
ing, to such a heat as may make them sufficiently plastic to
go through the operation once, and so again fora second and
 subsequent rollings, till the required extension be given to
 them.
    The alloys of gold with platina have hitherto been sup
 posed to depreciate the colour and malleability of the precious
 metal in such a manner as to prohibit their use.      It appears,
 however, from some late experiments made by an ingenious
jeweller, Mr. Francillon, that a mixture, consisting of six
 parts of gold and one of malleable platina, gives a metal of
                               C c 3                   a beautiful

a beautiful colour, great malleability, and capable of receiving
an exceeding fine polish, more unalterable than that of gold
when exposed to the action of sulphurized hydrogen or simi
lar asrents.
                          A   NEW COMET.
   About ten at night, on the 28th of August, C. Mechain,
member of the National Institute and of the Board of Lon
gitude, discovered a new comet in the constellation ofSer-
pentarius : it was some degrees below two nebulous stars
which are on the left side of that figure, and near the equator.
He determined its position, and found that it was rising with
gve.at rapidity towards the north.        He continued to observe
the following days.       The light of this body did not appear to
him lo increase in a sensible manner ; its nucleus did not he-
come more brilliant ; and the nebulosity which surrounded it
did not extend.
    On the 1st of September he made a report to the National
Institute of his first and last observations.
    August 28. Meantime, 9 hours 24' 6"; right ascension,
349° 1 8'; declination south, 6° 11' $1".
    August 31. Mean time, 9 hours 35' 19"; right ascension,
250" 16'; declination south, 0° 29}'.         It is to be remarked,
that, according to the present position of this comet, its di
stance from the fun is neceflarily greater than that of the fun
from the earth.      It rises towards the north pole, following
the left fide of Serpentarius and the opposite fide of Hercules.
Though it is visible only with the help of telescopes, it may
still be observed a long time if its light be not weakened.
    We learn by a letter from Bremen, that on the 2d of Sep
tember, at nine in the evening, Dr. Olbers discovered a small
comet, which cannot be seen but with good telescopes. From
its observed position it seems to be the fame that C. Mechain
saw six days before.       Dr. Olbers' observations are stated as
follows :
    September 2, at one minute past eleven, its right ascension
was 251° 28'; declination north, 40 32'.
     On the 4th, Mean tiirie, 9 hours 7 min.; right ascension,
 251° 28'; declination north, 70 57'.
     There     is,
                however, probably,     a  mistake in the letter re-j
 specting the last-mentioned right ascension.

     One of the French journals contains the following article:-^
 " Snakes     have increased this year so much in number in the
 large commons, that the proprietors of sheep have sustained
 great loss by them.      These reptiles, particularly in the spring,
 suck the milk of the sheep; and when the wound which thew
 inflict is deep, the two teats dry up ; so that the slieep, whicn
 continue to be fruitful, can no longer suckle their young.
 But, when the wound is flight, the wounded teat only dries
 up.     In several of the communes of the department of Landes,
  there are flocks, the sheep of which have been sucked by
 these snakes in the proportion of four to one."              »

     VaiTalli-Eandi, professor of natural philosophy in the
 Athenæum        at Turin, has invented and caused to be con
  structed   a  pneumatic apparatus, with which all experiments
  in regard to the rarefaction and condensation of air, and all
  kinds of aerial mixtures in given proportions, can be per
  formed in an easy and simple manner by means of pistons
  and cocks.      This machine has been deposited in the physical
  cabinet of Turin.

I. A     Reply to Mr.         Playfair's        RefleBions    on  Mr.  Kir-
     WAN's Refutation         of   the Huttonian     Theory   of  the Earth.
     By   Richard Kirwan,                 Esq.     LL.D. F.R.S.          and
     P. R. I. A.
           DEAR SIR,                                  Dublin, Aug. 24, iRoz.
  WHEN            I  first   undertook    to  state   some objections to
Dr. Hutton's Theory, I little imagined I                  should call forth
such indignation and such illiberal personalities as appeared
in   the second edition of that work ; but however hurt the
self-love of an author might have been by an attack on his
favourite ideas, I had still less reason to foresee that the same
style of hostility would have been persisted in by any person
to whom      I  had given no offence whatsoever.              Mr. Playfair's
 Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory, which I have seen
only a few days ago, convince me I was mistaken ; he not
only attempts to justify the asperities, as he calls them, of
Dr. Hutton, but aggravates them by new invectives. You
 need    not fear, Sir, that I (hall pollute the pages of your
journal by the vulgar mode of retaliation ; I shall make no
 reflections on his defence of Dr. Hutton's Theory : enough
 has been said on that subject.              I shall content myself with
 repelling   his  unprovoked       and  unmerited     attacks on myself.
     To effect this, however, I shall be obliged to state his
 abusive paragraphs, and thus expose their indecency.                    It is
 the only vengeance I shall take; he, probably, will account
  it none.

                    " To assert, that in the economy of the world
  we fee no mark either of a beginning or an end, is very dif
  ferent from affirming, that the world had no beginning, and
  will have no end. The first is a conclusion justified by com
  mon fense as well as found philosophy ; while the second is
  a presumptuous and unwarrantable assertion."                   Here I must
  deny   that  the  first  assertion,  namely,     that  we  fee  no mark of
  a beginning, is a conclusion justified by common fense and
   sound philosophy.
      No.  LIII.                       A %                                Mr.

4                    A   Reply      to   Mr. Plajfair's Reflexions                on
    Mr. De Luc, Saussure, and Dolomieu, were not deficient
either in common fense or sound philosophy, yet they all
assert that we may discover evident marks of the beginning
of the world in its present state : nay, Dr. Hutton himself
allows        for he judged the actual world to have proceeded
               it,
from      preceding, and asserts that
           a                                 will have an end. What
                                                             it
Mr. Playfair must then mean                            is,
                                          that we can fee no trace of
the beginning of this succession of worlds. Of such succession,
it    true, we can trace no beginning, because
     is                                                     merely ficti    it   is
tious but while Dr. Hutton asserted the reality of such
          :                                                          suc                       a
cession without assigning any limit,               was natural for me,
                                                                  it
•who was totally unacquainted with him, to infer that he
 really judged        to have no beginning
                           it                      this conclusion was
                                                                  :
 so natural, that      occurred to others long before
                            it                               had written         I
 on this subject.       Mr. Williams, his countryman, who was
 probably acquainted with him, fays,
                                              " That Dr. Hutton aims
 at establishing the belief    of  the eternity of the world,        evi                       is
 dent from      the  whole   drift  of his system, and    from   his own
 words     for he concludes his singular Theory with these sin
           ;
 gular expressions 'Having in the natural history of the earth
                                :

 there     issystem
                a       nature — in like manner as, from seeing the
                                in
 revolutions of the planets,               concluded that there
                                                  it   is                a                          is

 in the origin of the earth. The result, therefore, of our pre
 sent inquiry        that we find no vestige of beginning, no
                          is,                                               a
 prospect   of   an end.'"  — Williams's Natural History of the
 Mineral Kingdom, Preface, lx.
    Now,       alk what can be the meaning of these last words,
                I
it     in vain to look for any thing higher in the origin
      is                                                               the                      of
  earth. Higher than what            Is    not plain that the meaning
                                              ?         it
    is,
      higher than that established succession, of which succession
  we can trace no beginning         And what  ?      succession of which
                                                                  is
                                                                  a
  we can trace, and to which we assign, no beginning                 Now                   ?
  Dr. Hutton, in his first edition, no where mentioned that                                              it
  had      beginning, though such beginning were not apparent
           a
  on bare inspection of the actual world               was not then his:
  meaning at least ambiguous                      ?
     So also Mr. Howard, in his learned work on the Structure
  of the Earth, p. 549, fays " Dr. Hutton rejects all time,
                                                  :
  the operations of his living renovating nature scorn all limits:
  time (fays he), which measures every thing,                  to nature              is
  endless and nothing."            But to return to Mr. Playfair:
  " Mr. Kirwan, in bringing forward this rash and ill-founded
                                                                                           censure,

        Mr. Kirwan'      s
                           Refutation  of the Huilonian   Theory.      5
censure,    was neither animated by the spirit nor guided by
the maxims of true philosophy.             By the spirit of philosophy
he must have been induced to reflect, that such poisoned wea
pons as he was preparing to use are hardly ever allowable in
scientific contest, as having a less direct tendency to over
throw the system than to hurt the person of an adversary, and
to wound, perhaps incurably, his mind, his reputation, or
his peace."      This severe censure appears to me unmerited :
of its liberality I leave others to judge. The mention of pre
paration of poisoned weapons is perfectly risible, when it is
considered that the whole argument is comprehended in ten
or twelve lines.       If Dr. Hutton had lived either in Spain or
Portugal, some hurt to his person might indeed be appre
hended ; but in Britain, where Mr. Hume, with impunity,
trespassed much more on the received religious principles, no
danger could rationally be suspected ; and it were idle to think
that the reputation os an author could any more be wounded
by an inference obviously deducible from his principles, than
by his own statement of those principles.
    Mr. Playfair continues: " By the maxims of. philosophy
he (Mr. Kirwan) must have been reminded, that in no part
of the history of nature has any mark been discovered either
of the beginning or end of the present order." This I denv,
in common with those eminent geologists already mentioned:
clear traces of a beginning are found.              " By attending to
these considerations Mr. Kirwan would have avoided a very
illiberal and ungenerous proceeding'; and, however he might
have differed from Dr. Hutton as to the truth of his opi

quences ;    I had  nothing    to  do with   their tendency in a mere
geological   treatise.

", It is indeed worth while to compare what is said concerning
the degradation of mountains in the above quotations (from
my Geological Essays) with what is advanced concerning
their. indestructibility in another passage of the fame volume,
namely, all mountains are not subject to decay ; for instance,
scarce any of those that consist of red granite, &c.    One can
be at no loss about estimating the value of a system in which
such gross inconsistencies make a necessary part." Mr. Play-
fair then finds a gross inconsistency in maintaining thatybwj*
mountains are subject to decay, though all mountains are
not ; facts proved beyond the reach of contradiction ; but he
can fee none in his own two paragraphs.

                                                                          308
and 309, tells us that anthracite (native mineral carbon loaded
with stony matter) belongs exclusively to primitive countries,
and that the observations           of Mr. Doiomieu prove the exist
ence of carbon independently of animals and vegetables; and
that anthracite was, he presumed, nothing more than pure
carbon, associated,             by
                              accidental causes, with           certain quan

quite original, in the sarcastic sense in which Mr. Playfair ap
plies this word ; but it is evident irritation was his sole purpose.
   Mr. Playfair adds, " We may also object to Mr. Kirwan,
that the siliceous part of the mountain has not been chemi
cally dissolved ; it has only been abraded and worn away.
Mechanical action has reduced the quartz to gfavel and sand,
but has not produced on it any chemical change; the car
bon, therefore, could not be set loose."            Mr. Kirwan has not
assumed,    that  carbon     was  set   loose  from   quartz, though it
might have been from siliceous schisti and other compound
stones and rocks : disintegration is often effected by decom
position ; thus felspar is converted into argil and siliceous
particles in many instances ; but this more frequently hap
pens to stones that contain iron.
   Page 158.      Mr. Playfair, objecting to strata formed by
tranfudation,    asks   what occupied the space of the coal bed
before the tranfudation from the upper part of the mountains.
The question is unfair, and very similar to the numerous dif
ficulties objected to Dr. Black's discovery of fixed air, before
its truth was generally acknowledged.                 A fact is often dis
covered, though      the  mode   of  its  production   be unknown; yet
in this cafe the question is easily answered : the carbonic
part of the coal in the mountain of St. George's here alluded
to was formed before the upper part of the mountain was
formed; it is only the bituminous ingredient that subsequently
transuded from the supervenient superior strata ; and I sup-
         will be admitted that petrol might penetrate and coa-
           it
   [>ose
 esce with the carbonaceous part, without floating the upper
part of the mountain, as Mr. Playfair ludicrously supposes.
This account            much the more probable, as this moun
                              is   so

as Mr. Hassenfraz, the author of this memoir, truly remarks,
p. 266.
   Mr. Playfair concludes            remarking,   by " that such reason

                              a

                 " The Neptunist, who has provided the means
of dissolving the materials of the strata, has only performed
half his work, and must find it a task of equal difficulty to
force this powerful menstruum to part with its solution. Mr.
Kirwan, aware, in some degree, of this difficulty, has at
tempted to obviate it in a very singular way. First, he ascribes
the solution of all substances in water, or in what he calls
the chaotic fiu'td, to their being created in a state of the most
minute division.        Next, as to the deposition, the solvent be
ing, as he acknowledges, very insufficient in quantity, the
precipitation took place (he says) on that account the more
rapidly.     If he means by this to fay, that a precipitation
without    solution   would. take place the sooner, the more in
adequate    the  menstruum       was to dissolve the whole, the pro
position may     be  true   ;  but it will be of no use to explain the
crystallization    of  minerals     (the very object he had in view),
because to crystallization it is not a bare subsidence of par
ticles suspended in a fluid, but it is a passage from chemical
solution to non-solution or insolubility that is required."
    My meaning is clearly stated in pages to and 11 of my
Geological Essays, that the solids contained in the chaotic
fluid were not dissolved by that fluid, but were contained in
that state of minute division to which, if the fluid could of itself
dissolve them, they would be reduced ; and that, if the quan
tity of that fluid were insufficient to hold them in solution,
this circumstance would hasten their crystallization, precipi
tation, and deposition, respectively.         I did not assert that the
solution was effected by the menstruum, but, on the con
trary, denied it. Mr. Playfair's assertion, that crystallization is
a passage from chemical solution to non-solution or insolu
bility, is denied by Bergman : " Sed non tantum vere Jbluta
                                                                      in

to each other.

               " Barytic earth is well known to have a stronger
attraction to fixed air than common calcareous earth has, so
that the carbonate of barytes is able to endure a great degree
of heat before its fixed air is expelled : accordingly, when ex
posed to an increasing heat at a certain temperature, it is
brought into fusion, the fixed air still remaining united to it:
if  the heat be further increased the air is driven off, and the
earth loses its fluidity." And, p. 185,                "
                                             Carrara marble may
require a heat of 63000 of Wedgwood to melt it in the open
air ; but under such a pressure as would retain this gas it
cannot be inferred that it might not melt with the heat of a
glasshouse furnace.     In like manner it may be true that 380
cubic inches of air acting on charcoal cannot effect the fusion
of one grain of this marble after its fixed air is driven off
from it ; but we cannot from thence draw any inference ap
plicable to a cafe where the carbonic acid is retained, and
where the action of heat is independent of atmospheric air."
Now, in no experiment with which I am acquainted has na
tive aerated barytes been fused without the expulsion of its
air, or union with the earth of the crucible.       Dr. Hope, in
deed, fused it in a black lead crucible, but found it lost 23 per
cent, nearly of its weight; which is the whole, or nearly so,
of the air contained, and accordingly it made but a very flight
effervescence with marine acid.           Hence the position laid
down, p. 22, that barolite or native carbonate of barytes
may be fused and still retain its fixed air, is founded on no
experiment; but from all known experiments the contrary
inference is fairly deducible with respect to       as well as with
                                                            it,

any other effect.

   IO         A Reply  to Mr.  "Playsair's Reflections on
  rows nothing from analogy, it admits of no proof and re
  quires no refutation."    I was, however, led into this opinion
  by analogy with Mr. Gadd's experiments in the 32d volume
  of the Memoirs of Stockholm; for he tells us, that if clay
  and calces of iron be plentifully mixed with oil, they will
  form a mass which will harden even under water. If Mr.
  Playfair were acquainted with Mr. Chladni's opinion, that
  these masses were fragments of a broken planet that fell within
  the sphere of attraction of our globe, he might possibly think
 it the most singular ; yet even so, it is probable he would
 not sacrifice the pleasure of bestowing that distinguiflied epi
  thet on mine.     However, as he judged my conjecture, I
 know not on what foundation, inconsistent with the princi
 ples of chemical science, I have mixed rust of iron with pe
 trol, and afterwards with petrol to which sulphur was added,
 and found it disposed to coalesce in a few days.
     P. 432. " One of Mr. Kirwan's objections to the deposi
 tion of materials at the bottom of the sea is thus stated : —
 ' Frisi has remarked, in his mathematical discourses, that if
 any considerable mass of matter were accumulated in the
 interior of the ocean, the diurnal motion of the globe would
 be disturbed, and consequently it would be perceptible.'
 The appeal made here to Frisi is singularly unfortunate, as
 that philosopher demonstrated the contrary to Mr. Kirwan's
 position.    The instance just given may serve as one of many
 to (how what confidence is to be placed in that undigested
mass of facts and quotations which Mr. Kirwan, without
discrimination and without discussion, has brought together
from all quarters."       Mr. Playfair might, however, easily
infer, from the loose manner in which Frisi is quoted,
 (namely, in some of his mathematical treatises, so different
from my usual manner, in which the page I take from is
mentioned,) that I had not that author before me ; and, in
fact, I took it from Mitterpacher's Physical Description of
the Earth, p. 25, who says, that according to Frisi, in the
cafe above mentioned, the velocity with which the centre of
the globe would move would be increased ; omitting the
calculation, and the mention that the increased velocity
¦would not be sensible for a long period of years.         I hope
therefore it is the only one out of the mapy quotations I
have made in which any mistake can be found : if Mr. Play
fair could find any other, he doubtless would have mentioned
it. The attempt to weaken the force of the numerous facts
I collected, adverse to the Huttonian theory, by calling them
an undigested mass, is curious, and, if allowable, would fur
nish a very convenient and expeditious method of getting rid
                                                               of

         Mr. Kirwarfs       Refutation of  the  Hutfonian Theory,        n
of them, but will not, I           presume, appear perfectly satisfac
tory to an impartial public.
     Page 427. The fact relative to the deltas formed in the
mouth of the Bourampouter Mr, Playfair thinks I have mis
apprehended, because major Rennell does not assert that
rivers employ all the materials which they carry with them,
and deliver none into the sea. On the contrary, I think, they
carry many of them into the sea, but not to any great di
stance, much less into its unfathomable depths, as Dr. Hutton
asserts.     The fact relative to the extension of coasts is now so
well known to all modern geologists, that it were time lost to
dwell longer on it: that the deltas themselves are diminished
by particles detached from them, and carried into the recesses
of the deep, is a remark which I do not recollect to have
met with; but in some instances, where they consist merely
of sand, they are often diminished by the winds : that even
the argillaceous particles are not carried far into the sea, may
be seen in Morse's American Geography, p. 49, Irish edition.
      I decline entering into any further discussion of Mr. Play-
 fair's replies to some other objection made by me to the Hut-
 tonian theory.         The intelligent reader will meet with many
 confident     and   arrogant assertions of which he probably will
 require some proof, as in p. 481 and 483; many that are
 perfectly unsatisfactory or even contradictory, as where he
 allows that the impulsive motion of the waves against the
 shores is greater at a small distance from them, and yet as
 serts that the detrites of the shores are conveyed to a great
 distance. He also affirms with great confidence, that as the
 flowing of the tide requires just six hours, and the ebbing of
 it also six hours, the quantity of matter moved, and its velo
  city, must be just the fame : p. 432.             In the abstract this is
  certainly true, and in        the middle   of  the  ocean ; but in most
  harbours the contrary happens : thus La Lande tells us that

   probable that they belonged to antient species of those ani-

never charged it upon it : so far was     I from wishing to make
use of what Mr. Playfair called poisoned weapons, as he un
justly accuses me of having done.
     It is in vain Mr. Playfair seeks to compare geology with
astronomy and zoology; neither of these sciences requires any
notice to be taken of the original constitution of their ob
jects, their actual state being very nearly the fame as their
 primordial state : but, where hybrid species occur, their origin
 never fails of being attended to.
     In geology, the cafe is very different : here we meet with
 objects whose original state must have been very different from
 their actual state. Rocks or stones presenting regular forms
 must of necessity have been originally in a stale from which
 such forms could arise.       Masses now hardened into stone,
 but presenting the impressions either of vegetables or of other
 stones, must have been originally in a soft state.       Calcareous
 stones silled with shells must have been originally in a state
 fitted for the admission of those shells; hence geologists ne
 cessarily recur to a state of inanimate nature prior to the pre
 sent.     This is admitted by Dr. Hutton as well as by Nep-
 tunists ; but he thinks the present state to have originated
  from a gradual destruction of a former, as that did from a
  still more antient: still the most antient of these worlds either
  resembled the present, or it did not: if not, we can say no
  thing of it; if it did, the same difficulties must occur, and
  consequently its primordial 'state must have been different
  from its subsequent state, as this state is supposed to have been
  similar to the present.      The crystallized or soft state of our
  present rocks Dr. Hutton thinks proceeded from an igneous
  fusion of the materials of a prior world : but he cannot sup
  pose this of the first of these worlds; its similarity with ours
  must therefore be otherwise accounted for.
       I shall here conclude my observations on Mr. Playfair's
   observations. Controversies managed as this has been by
   him and Dr. Hutton, whose favourite method of answering
   objections consists in depretiating or sneering at the under
   standing, and undermining the credit of their author, are a
   disgrace to philosophy, and sufficiently expose the weakness
   of the cause that obliges to have recourse to such expedients.

II.      An Illujlration and Confirmation of some PaBs mentioned
       in an Essay on the primitive State of the Globe.       By
       Richard Kirwan, Esq. LL.D. F.R.S. and P.R.I.A.
 J. HERE       is a remarkable fact stated in this essay, with
respect to which the Mosaic account is fully at issue with the
most plausible of the lately devised philosophic theories of the
primitive state of the globe, namely, the emersion of some
portion of land from the primæval ocean previous to the crea
tion offish : Moses expressly affirming, Buffon, the anony
mous author of L'Histoire du Monde primitif, and many
others, expressly denying it. In proof of the Mosaic ac
 count, I alleged that no petrifactions were found imbedded
and incorporated in masses of stone in such countries as were
elevated 8500 or 9000 feet above the actual level of the sea —
for instance, in the great Tartarian platform and the elevated
regions of Siberia — though in all inferior regions of the fame
extent such petrifactions were abundantly found, at least iu
limestones ; hut even in these none were found in those ele
vated tracts, as I proved by the testimonies of all the philo
sophic travellers who have traversed and examined them.
    Bouguer and Don Ulloa* attest the same fact with respect
to Quito and the lofty regions of South America, having
met with none in ninety leagues from a little north of the
equator to Cuenca, between 3° and 3° south of                        it,
                                                                    Quito
being elevated 9374 feet above the level of the sea.                  even
                                                                      I
doubted whether the petrifactions found                   Mr. De Luc on

                                          7800 feet,
in the body of any stony mass; but he has since assured me
that they were        now the shells he found being cornua am-
                      :
monis,       species of those called pelagicee,
              a                                             would thence
                                                           it
appear    that  the sea   had   risen  still  higher, though not above
1000 feet.
   To repel this proof of the Mosaic account,                    has been
                                                                it
replied by     the   laborious,     learned,    and   eloquent writer of
L'HiJloire     du  Monde     primitif,   and   others,   that the keen air
existing   in these  elevated    regions     had  long ago decomposed
and consumed the shells that might have been there depo
         but, as the stones still remain,                 evident that the

limit     at which they could be found, namely 9000 feet, for
that those which 1 quoted as proofs of a subsequent deluge,
found, according to Don Ulloa, at the height of 14,220 feet
in Peru, were in reality petrified. To this account, as it wu
only a hearsay report of Gentil, who had it from Don Ulloa,
I own 1 did not give full credit; at least I thought the cir
cumstance of their having been petrified and imbodied in a
rock not probable : since that time I have met with a work,
composed by Don Ulloa himself, entitled Memoiret Philoso-
pbiques, Hijioriques et Phyjiques, in the first volume of which,
 p. 34 and 364, the fact of the shells being petrified and im
 bodied in a rock is fully stated and confirmed : but 1 shall
 here satisfactorily prove that the height at which they were
 found did not exceed, nor even equal, 9000 sect above th«
 level of the sea; and, secondly, that they were left there by
 a deluge that succeeded the emersion of land from the pri
 mæval ocean.
      First, Gentil tells us, Mem. Par. 1771, p. 439, in 8vo.,
 that these shells were found on a mountain near Guancave
 lica, a small town or village between 120 and 130 south lati
  tude, which mountain, he says, is far from being one of the
  highest of the Cordelieres ; and that on the spot in which
                                              i
  the shells were found, the mercury in the barometer stood at
  the height of 17 inches one line and          = 17,103 inches;
  from which he infers that this spot was elevated 2200I toifes
  over the level of the sea, = 13,869 English feet. This height
 I    shall now show to have been falsely estimated.
       Don Ulloa tells us, p. 34 of the abovementioned work,
   and Gentil repeats after him, that, at the village of Guanca-
   vehea, near but somewhat below this spot, the mercury stood
   at the height of 18 inches one line and half. Now Bouguer,
   Figure de la Terre, p. 36, expressly fays that Quito is ele
   vated from 14 to 1500 toifes only over the level of the sea,
   and is the highest inhabited part of the globe : Guancavelica,
   therefore, which is inhabited, and must hava been well known
   to Bouguer, cannot be lo high as Quito.         Quito was geo
   metrically measured, Guancavelica was not.*
       Bouguer also tells us, ibid, in note, that the mercury at
   Quito stands at the height of twenty inches and one line:
   how then is it possible that it should stand at eighteen inches
    and one line at Guancavelica, which must be much lower, if
    the barometer were not ill  constructed? No difference of tem
    perature between Quito and Guancavelica could cause such
    an enormous difference as two inches in the mercurial height.
    The art and necessity of freeing barometers from air were not
                                                           generally

  IfJ        Dr. Kirwan          on the   primitive State         of the Gloltt

 generally known
 the modifications of the atmosphere, which was not pub
 lished till upwards of thirty years after Don Ulloa's experi
   ments.    The air, then, remaining in his barometer, which
   he probably filled at Lima, in whose territory Guancavelica
   lies, under a pressure of 28 or between 27 and 28 (French)
   inches, must have considerably expanded and depressed the
   column of mercury under it when brought up a mountain of,
   perhaps, 7000 or 8000 feet high ; and hence this mercurial
   column remained so low at Guancavelica as eighteen inches
   and one line.
      That in these circumstances the air contained in the baro
  meter might cause a difference of three inches or more be
  tween the height at which mercury purged of air would
  stand, appears by the experiments of Casiini, Mem. Par.
  1740, sur la Miridienne de Paris, p. 172 ; for he found that
  the mercury, freed from air by ebullition in the tube, stood
  four or five lines higher than in barometers filled without
  that precaution.    Nay, cardinal Luynes found the difference
  betwixt such barometers to amount sometimes to fourteen
  lines; Mem. Par. 1768, p. 490, in 8vo. How great must
 it therefore be in barometers transported to greater heights
  than that at which they were filled ?
      Moreover, Don Ulloa expressly tells us that the mountain
 on which these (hells were found was every where habitable,
 Mem. Philosophiques,     p. 34 and $$ ; which it could not be,
 and would be expressly contradicted by Bouguer, if its height
 were 13,000 English feet over the surface of the sea.    From
 all which I conclude that the height of the mercurial column,
 if the barometers had been properly constructed, would have
 been about 22 French inches, = 23,44 English ; and, as the
 temperature was remarkably cold, this would indicate a height
of about 8200 feet above the level of the sea.
     But, secondly, let the height be what it may, it is certain
that these shells were deposited there after the emersion of
land from the primitive ocean/ and consequently by a sub
sequent deluge; for Don Ulloa expressly tells us, that in the
fame rocks in which these shells arc found, petrified wood is
also found; Mem. Philosophiques, p. 372.       This wood must
have grown on dry land, and must have been Boated when

the advantage of expelling air from the mercury in the tube, in Mem. Par.
1723, and Catiini had followed that method in measuring the heights of
Puy de Dome and Mont d'Or in 1740, yet it was not generally adopted
until Mr. De Luc had proved its necessity, and perfected the method of
performing    it,   in   1771.   See   De Luc,   i.   p.   -y>.

the (hells were deposited, since both are found in the fame

no wood can at present grow there, as Don Ulloa also attests.
The shells are for the most part bivalves, which geologists
allow to form petrifactions of the most modern date.
    Lastly, La Peyrouse mentions that he discovered marine
shells on mount Perdu, the highest of the Pyrenees, at the
height of nearly 10,000 sect. How he ascertained the height
is not mentioned : but that these shells were deposited by the
deluge is certain ; for at the fame height he found also the
bones of land animals petrified.         Journal des Mines, xxxvii.

the first works that contain a pretty complete description of
the art of painting on glass. Those since published, even the
large work of Leviel, which forms part of the arts and ma

    It is very remarkable, that if the processes described in
these works were strictly followed, as we did in regard to
some, it would never be possible to form the colours for which
they pretend to give recipes.         They only put the able artist
in the way, but he must always make amendments or addi

care of preparing the colours at the manufactory of Sevres.
He was obliged, rather from his own knowledge than the in
formation contained in the above books, to make the colours
employed for painting on glass.
    The limits of a memoir will not allow me to enter into

l8      On   the Colours     obtained   from   the metallic Oxides,
composition of the colours employed on glass are, in genera!,
the fame as those applied to porcelain. Neither of them differ
but in their proportions; but there are a great number of
enamel or porcelain colours which cannot be applied to glass,
where they are deprived of the white ground which serves to
give them relief.       When seen by refraction, several of them
entirely change their tone, and assume a dirty tint, which can
be of no use : we (hall make them known when we come to
treat of colours in particular.       Those which can be em
ployed on this body change sometimes in baking, and ac
quire a great transparency.        In general they are not beau
tiful ; but, when placed between the light and the eye, they
then seem to answer the only object that can be proposed in
painting on glass.
     The baking plates of painted glass presents more difficul
ties than might be supposed. Care must be taken not to dis
 figure the piece, or alter the colours : all the works we have
 read recommend a bed of gypsum.          This method has some
 times succeeded j but the glass, for the most part, becomes
 white and full of cracks.       It appears that glass too alkaline
         alkalies are the most common in white glass) suffers it-
   elf to be attacked warm by the sulphuric acid of the sulphate
 !and
 of lime. We were easily able to bake pieces of glass much
 larger than those before painted, by placing them on very
 straight plates of earth or of soft porcelain.
                        Of    Colours   in particular.
     After collecting the general phænomena exhibited by each
class   of vitrifiable colours, considered in regard to the body
on which        they                     I
                                must make Known the moft
                        are applied,
interesting particular phænomena exhibited by each prin
cipal kinu of colours employed on soft porcelain and glafe in
a porcelain furnace.
        Of    Reds,         and Violets, made from Gold.
                       Purples,
    Carmine red is obtained by the purple precipitate of Cafliusr
 it is mixed with about six parts of its flux ; and this mixture
 is employed directly, without being fused.          It is then of a
 dirty violet, but by baking it acquires a beautiful red carmine
 colour : it    is,
                 however, exceedingly delicate      little too much
                                                            ;   a
 heat and carbonaceous vapours easily spoil it. On this ac
 count   it   ismore beautiful when baked with charcoal than
  with wood.
     This colour and the purple, which         very little different,
  as well as all the shades obtained from          it, is   by  with
                                                    mixing            it
  other colours, really change on all porcelain and in every
                                                               hand.

        and fixed    by Fusion on different vitreous Bodies.    1
                                                                  9
hand.      But it is the only one that changes on hard porce
lain.    Its place may be supplied by a rose colour from iron
which does not change; so that by suppressing the carmine
made with gold, and substituting for it the rose oxide of iron
here alluded to, you may exhibit a palette composed of colours
none of which change in a remarkable manner.            This rose-
coloured oxide of iron has been long known; but it was not
employed, on enamel, because on that substance it changes
too much.      As the painters on enamel, however, have be
come the painters on porcelain, they have preserved their
antient method.
    It might be believed that, by first reducing to a vitreous
matter the colour called carmine already mixed with its flux,
it might be made to assume its last tint. But the heat ne
cessary to fuse this vitreous mass destroys the red colour, as
I have experienced. Besides, it is remarked that, to obtain
this colour very beautiful, it must be exposed to the fire as
few times as possible.
    The carmine for soft porcelain is made with fulminating
gold slowly decomposed, and muriate of silver: no tin enters
into it; which proves that the combination of the oxide of
this metal with that of gold is not necessary to the existence
of the purple colour.
    Violet is made also with purple oxide of gold. A greater
quantity of lead in the flux is what gives it this colour, which
is almost the fame crude or baked.
    These three colours totally disappear when exposed to a
great porcelain heat.
    Carmine and purple have given us in glass tints only of a
 dirty violet. The violet, on the other Tiand, produces on
 glass a very beautiful effect, but it is liable to turn blue.     I
 have not yet been able to discover the cause of this singular
 change, which I saw for the first time a few days ago.
       Red, Rose, and Brown Colours- exlracled from Iron.
    These colours are made from red oxide of iron prepared
 with nitric acid. These oxides are further calcined by keep
 ing them exposed to the action of heat. If heated too much,
 they pass to brown.
    Their flux is composed of borax, sand, and minium, in
 small quantity.
     These oxides give rose and red colours capable of supplying
 the place of the same colours made with oxide of gold. When
 properly employed on hard porcelain, they do not change at
 all.   I have caused roses to be painted with these colours,
 and   found   no difference between the baked flower and that
                                 B 2                            not

ZO       On  the Colours  obtained  from   the metallic Oxides,
not baked, except what might be expected to result front
 the brilliancy given to colours by fusion.
    These colours may be employed indiscriminately, either
 previously fused or not fused. .
     In a great heat they in part disappear, or produce a dull
 brick red ground, which is not agreeable.
    The composition of them is the fame both for soft porce
 lain and for glass.      They do not change on the latter; but
 on soft porcelain they disappear almost entirely on the first
 exposure to heat, and to make any thing remain they must
 be employed     very deep.
     This singular  effect must be ascribed to the presence of lead
 in   the crust or glazing.     I  assured myself of this by a very
 simple experiment.       1 placed    this colour on window glass,
 and, having exposed it to a strong baking, it did not change.
     I  covered several parts of it with minium ; and again ex
 posing it to the fire, the colour was totally removedin the
 places where the red oxide of lead had been applied.
     By performing this operation on a larger scale in close ves
 sels, a large quantity of oxygen gas was disengaged.
     It appears to me that this observation clearly proves the
 action of oxidated lead on glass as a destroyer of colour : it
 is seen that it does not act, as was believed, by burning the
 combustible bodies, which might tarnish the glass, but by
 diflblvinac, discolouring, or volatilizing with it the oxide of
 iron, which might alter its transparency.
                                Yellows.
     Yellows are colours which require a great deal of care in
 the fabrication on account of the leaa which they contain,
 and which, approaching sometimes to the metallic state, pro
 duces on them black spots.
     The yellows for hard and soft porcelain are the fame : they
  are composed of the oxide of lead, white oxide of antimony,
  and sand.
      Oxide of tin is sometimes mixed with them ; and when it
  is required to have them livelier, and nearer the colour du
Jo?tci, red oxide of iron is added, the too great redness of
  which is dissipated in the previous fusion to which thev are
  exposed by the action of the lead contained in this yellow.
  These colours when once made never change : they disappear,
  however, almost entirely when exposed to a porcelain heat.
      These yellows cannot be applied to glass : thev are too
  opake and dirty. That employed by the old painters on glass
  has, on the contrary, a beautiful transparency, is exceedingly
  brilliant, and of a colour which approaches near to that of
  gold. The processes which they gave clearly showed that
                                                                silver

         and fixed  by Fusion on
                                  different vitreous Bodies.   21
silver   formed part of their composition ; but, when exactly
followed, nothing satisfactory was obtained.          C. Miraud,
whom I have already had occasion to mention, has found
means to make as beautiful paintings on glass as the antients,
by employing muriate of silver, oxide of zinc, white argil,
and yellow oxide of iron.         T hese colours are applied on
glass   merely   pounded,   and  without   a flux.   The oxide of
iron brings the yellow to that colour which it ought to have
after baking, and contributes with the argil and oxide of zinc
to decompose the muriate of silver without deoxidating the
silver.    After the baking, there remains a dust which has not
penetrated into the glass, and which is easily removed.
    This yellow, when employed thicker, gives darker shades,
and produces a ruflet.
                               Blues.
    It is well known that these are obtained from the oxide of
cobalt.     All chemists are acquainted with the preparation of
them. Those of Sevres, which are justly esteemed for their
beauty, are indebted foT it only to the care employed in ma
nufacturing them, and to the quality of the porcelain, which
appears more proper for receiving them in proportion to the
degree of heat it can bear.
    I remarked respecting the oxide of cobalt a fact which
is perhaps not known to chemists : it is volatile in a violent
heat: it is to this property we must ascribe the blueish tint
always astiimed by white in the neighbourhood of the blue.
I have placed expressly on purpose, in the same case, a while
piece close to a blue one, and found that the fide of the while
piece next the blue became evidently blueish.
    The blue of hard porcelain, destined for what is called the
ground for a great heat {les fonds au grand feu), is fused
 with feld-spar; that of soft porcelain has for its flux silex,
potash, and lead : it is not volatilized like the preceding, but
the heat it experiences is very inferior to that of hard porce
lain.
    These colours, when previously fused, do not change at all
In the application.
    Blues on glass exhibit the fame phænomena as those on
 soft porcelain.
                               Greens,
    The   greens employed in painting are made with grceri oxide
 of copper, or, sometimes, with a mixture of yellow or blue.
They must he previoully fused with their flux, otherwise they
 will become black; but after this fust fusion they no longer
 change.
                                B  3                         They

23      On  the Colours obtained  from the metallic Oxides,
   They cannot stand a strong heat, as it would make therrt
disappear entirely. Green grounds for a strong heat are com
posed with the oxides of cobalt and nickel, but a brownisti
green only is obtained.
   Blueish greens called celejlial blues, which were formerly
colours very much in vogue, can be applied only upon soft
            ; on hard porcelain they constantly become scaly,
  ecause potash enters into their composition.
Eorcelain
   These greens cannot be applied on glass: they give a dirty
colour.    To obtain a green on glass, it is necessary to put
vellow on one side, and blue, more or less pale, on the other.
This colour may be made also by a mixture of blue with
yellow oxide of iron. I hope to obtain from oxide of chrome
a direct green colour. The trials I have made give me reason
to hope for success. Pure chromate of lead, which I applied
to porcelain in a strong heat, gave me a pretty beautiful
green of great intensity and very fixed.
                        Biflres and Rujftts.
   These are obtained by mixtures in different proportions of
manganese,      brown oxide of copper, and oxide of iron from
ombre earth. They arc also previously fused with their flux,
so that they do not change in any manner on soft porcelain,
as lead has not the fame action on oxide of manganese as on
that of iron, as I assured myself by an experiment similar to
that already mentioned.
   This colour fades very speedily on glass.
   Russet grounds in a great heat, known under the name of
tortoise-shell grounds, are made in the fame manner. Their
flux is feld-fpar : no titanium enters into their composition,
though said so in all printed works. Titanium was not known
at the manufactory of Sevres when I arrived there.       I treated
this singular metal in various ways, and never obtained but
grounds of a pale dirty yellow, and very variable in its tone.
                               Blacks.
   Blacks arc the colours most difficult to be obtained very
beautiful.     No metallic oxide gives alone a beautiful black.
Manganese is that which approaches nearest to it. Iron gives
an opake, dull, cloudy black, which changes very easily to
red: the colour-makers, therefore, to obtain a black which
they could not hope for from the best theorist, have united
several metallic oxides which separately do not give black,
and have obtained a very beautiful colour, which, however,
is liable to become scaly and dull.
                                                            These

       end fixed     by    Fusion   on   different vitreous Bodies.              23
    These oxides are those of manganese, the brown oxides of
copper, and a little of the oxide of cobalt.          The gray      ob     'is
tained  by   suppressing   the  copper,   and  increasing  the  dose  of
the flux.
    The manufactory of Sevres            the only one which has
                                          is                                     hi
therto produced beautiful blacks in             strong heat.
                                                   a            This              is
owing rather to the quality of its paste than to any peculiar
processes, since it   does not conceal them.           It         by
                                                             darkening
                                                            is
the blue   by   the oxides of manganese and iron that they are
able in that manufactory to obtain very brilliant blacks.
    Having here made known the principles of the fabrication
of each principal colour,       it  may be readily conceived that
by   mixing these colours together all the shades possible may
be obtained.     It   isevident also that care in the preparation,
choice in the raw materials, and a just proportion of doses,
must produce in the results differences very sensible to an eve
accustomed to painting.         A  mere knowledge of the composi
tion of the colours does not give the talent of executing them
well.
    In recapitulating the facts above mentioned, to present
them under another general point of view,               it   is
                                                          seen         :
    1st,   That among colour? generally employed on hard
porcelain one only          susceptible of changing, viz. carmine,
                           is
and the tints into which             enters
                                    it        that its place may be
                                                   :
supplied   by  the reds of iron, and that no colour then changes.
 I    have presented to the Institute            head not baked, exe
                                                   a
cuted according to this method              and the painting of two
                                               ;
roses, that of the one baked, and that of the other not baked.
It  has been seen that there was no difference between them.
    2d, That among the colours for soft porcelain and enamel,
several change in         aconsiderable    degree.    These are princi-
         the reds of gold and iron, the yellows, the greens, the
Eally
   rowns.     They have not been replaced               by
                                                        others, because
 this kind of painting has been almost abandoned.
    3d, That several of the colours on glass change also                          by
acquiring complete transparency. These in particular are
 the yellows and greens.
    4th, That   it   isneither bv calcining the colours in higher      a
degree, nor previously fusing them, as supposed by some,
 that they are prevented from changing, since these means
 really alter the changing colours, and produce no effect on
 the rest. The change which several colours experience on
 soft porcelain and on glass does not then depend on the na
 ture of their composition, but rather on that of the body on
which    they are applied.

24       Tubes rendered harmonious         by  Hydrogen Gas.
   Consequently, by suppressing from the colours of hard
porcelain the carmine of gold, which is not indispensably
necessary, we shall have a series of colours which do not
change, and which will be absolutely similar to those pre
sented to the Institute in the year 6.
IV.   Memoir on Tubes rendered harmonious by Hydrogen Gas.
   Read before the Society of Physics and Natural Hi/lory of
   Geneva, by G. Delaiuve, Ex-Prejident of the Royal
   Society of Edinburgh, and Member of the Medical Col
   leges of London and Geneva *.
IN     a former fitting, our learned colleague professor Pictet
communicated to the society a series of researches on tubes
rendered harmonious by means of hydrogen gas, and ex
plained the different musical phænomena to which these
tubes give birth.    lie pointed out the influence of the length
of the tube; of its breadth, and of the place where the gas
is burnt; and explained the nature of the sounds produced.
In regard to the cause of the sound, he offered only conjec
tures : as his labour was not directed to that object, it is
under this point of view that I have resumed it.
   Professor Brugnatelli, in my opinion, is the first person
who published the experiment; which I shall endeavour to
explain.    It had been invented by a German: I shall here
give a view of the principal circumstances attending it.
   Isa current of inflamed hydrogen gas be introduced into a
tube the substance of which is elastic and sonorous, such as
glass, metal, dry wood, &c, this tube, after the interval of
some seconds, will emit a harmonic found : if it be open at
both extremities, the found will be strong and full.            The ex
periment may, however, succeed with a tube closed herme
tically at one end, provided its diameter be so lame as to ad
mit of a circulation of the atmospheric air in sufficient quantity
to maintain the combustion of the gas.             The conditions es
sentially necessary for this purpose are : lst, That the sub
stance of the tube be elastic, proper for producing an echo;
that is to fay, for reflecting the undulations which proceed
from the sonorous point: a tube of paper or pasteboard will
emit no found.      2d, The flame must be produced by a cur
rent of hvdrogen gas. An inflamed jet of the vapour of spirit
of wine or ether, a lighted taper, Sec. are incapable of making
the tube emit any sound.
          • From the journal t/e Pi.n/ique,  Fructidor, an. 10.
                                                                    Let

         Tubes rendered harmonious    by Hydrogen Gas.        2$
    Let us now examine what takes place in this experiment.
There   must be a certain point, which may be called the so
norous point; it is at this point that the vibrations which,
communicate to the air an undulatory motion are produced.
This point is the place of combustion; for by changing the
position of that place the founds may be varied, as M. Pi6tet
proved by a series of experiments.      This gentleman observed
also in that< point, by means of the smoke with which he
filled the tube, a continual succession of vibrations. These vi
brations give birth to undulations, which are propagated with
a known and determined velocity, and, striking the sides of
the tube, are reflected with the fame velocity as that with
which they reached them. When the distance of the sides of
the tube is such that the reflections backwards and forwards
are isochronous with the vibrations natural to the sonorous
cause, the sound increases in intensity, and becomes musi
cally appreciable.    It appears also that the reflected undula
tions re-act on the primitive vibrations produced in the place
of combustion, and     render them harmonically regular with.
them; for a certain    space of time is almost always neceflarv
before the instrument has acquired a regular and full found :
the tone of the tube will be higher or lower according to the
greater or less number of undulations which take place in a
given time.
    There is another essential fact lo be observed in the expe
riment which we here examine : the temperature of the co
lumn of air is not the fame throughout its whole length. At
the sonorous point, that is to fay, the place of combustion,
the temperature is exceedingly high ; it is such, that the ex
tremity of the aperture of the glass through which the hy
drogen gas issues is constantly in a state of incandescence :
if an inflamed jet of the vapour of spirit of wine or ether be
substituted for a current of hydrogen gas, the heat is visibly
weaker. According to some experiments it appears probable
also that the temperature    of the chamber -where the experi
ment is made, and the purity of the air in the chamber, may
have some influence on the result.
    The object of my researches was to discover the cause of
these phœnomena, and how, and by what means, these sono
rous vibrations are produced. During the combustion of hy
drogen gas, it is well known that there is a production of
water, and this water appears under the form of vapours.
 The place of the combustion being at a high temperature,
 these vapours must acquire a large volume ; but, coming im
 mediately into contact with air less heated, their volume must
 be rapidly diminished. A vacuum therefore must be formed,
            6                                                into

into which the air rushes to be repelled by the new. vapours,
that contract in their turn. Is it from this alternate motion,
produced by the great expansion and subsequent contraction
of the vapours, that the sonorous vibrations result * ?
   Such were the conjectures which might be -formed on the
probable cause of this phænomenon, when I accidentally
met with a fact which appeared to me to give them some
weight.
   I had a thermometer tube about a line in diameter, at the
extremity of which a small bulb was blown.          In this bulb
was a drop of water, which I wished to expel : for this pur
pose I exposed the bulb several times to the flame of a spirit—
of-wine lamp. I was agreeably surprised to hear the tube
emit a harmonious found.
   To repeat this experiment with success, the tube employed
must be from i to 2 or 3 lines in diameter : its length may
be about from 3 to 4 or 5 inches : it must have blown at one
of its extremities a bulb the diameter of which is about triple
that of the tube. It is not necessary that it should be regular.
It even appears that, if it were a little flatted, the found
emitted would be higher.      Into this bulb introduce a little
quantity   of water or mercury,   and then expose it to a strong
heat : that of a common spirit-of-wine lamp will, in general,
be sufficient ; but the flame must be large and strong when
the operation is performed with a large tube. After the bulb
has been exposed for some moments to the'heat, it will emit
a found.     Tubes of a large diameter produce a found lower
     '*   It
         appears to me probable that the found produced by the air which
ruthes   into the vacuum is more intense than that which results from an
expansive force. The dreadful noise occasioned by the detonation of bub
bles of hydrogen gas and oxygen is well known, and yet the lightest ob
jects which surround the vessel are not even agitated by it ; whence we may
conclude that this phænomenon is produced by the sudden vacuum result
ing from the destruction of the gas. The detonation of an inflammable
gas pistol is much stronger than that of the air-gun, though the effect is
less considerable ; probably because in the pistol a vacuum succeeds the
first expansive farce.  Every body is acquainted with that children's play
thing called the humming top. It consists of a hollow sphere with an
aperture at the circumference,     which being made to turn rapidly on its
axis produces a very strong humming noise.          What is the cause of this
noise > The same, in mv opinion, as that 3bove mentioned : the centri
 fugal force expels the air from the sphere through its aperture ; a kind of
vacuum is formed in it, the exterior air continually tends to enter        it,
                                                                            and
is  immediately repelled, and hence     scries of sonorous oscillations. — The

   The effect        here spoken of seems rather to arise from the velocity with
which          the edge or lip of the orifice meets the air for the fame found may

tribute towards the fame effect.        The found will be perma
nent for some   moments   ;  it will then  gradually decrease, and
at length  will  entirely cease.     By suffering the apparatus to
cool,  and  taking  care  to    make   the liquid condensed along
the sides of the tube to descend into the bulb, the experiment
may be repeated as often as may be thought proper.
   Such is the experiment by means of which, in my opi
nion, the phænomenon of the harmonious tubes may be ex
plained in a satisfactory manner.  Let us now examine what
takes place in tubes with a bulb, and what are the essential
conditions necessary to make them emit a sound, and let us
endeavour to discover the cause of this sound. We shall then
compare them with the tubes employed with hydrogen gas,
and shall examine in what these two instruments resemble
each other in the effects they produce, the differences they
exhibit under the fame relations, and the causes of these dit-
serences.
   The essential conditions necessary to make tubes with a
bulb resound are: ist, That the vessel has a bulb : I was
never able to excite sonorous vibrations in a tube simply
closed at one of its extremities.   2d, This bulb must con
tain an evaporable liquid : water succeeds very well ; but it is
attended    with the disadvantage of forming in the tube, when
it passes   from  the state of vapour to the liquid state, a small
drop   which   often  obstructs it entirely, and, sometimes, falling
on the heated part of the glass, occasions a rupture. Mercury
is not attended with the fame defect : I was never able to pro
duce sounds with ether, spirit of wine, or concentrated sul
phuric acid. The quantity of liquid contained in the bulb
is not a matter of indifference ; it must be as small as possi
ble: if there be too much, the tube becomes filled with va
pours, which completely expel the air from              it,
                                                       and, heating         it
every   where    in  an  uniform   manner,      no
                                               it   longer emits any
sound. The third essential condition             the application of
                                                is                          a
strong heat to the bulb while the rest of the tube remains
cold ;   for,
            if   there be nota    very striking difference of tempe
 rature between the bulb and the tube, there will be no sonorous
effect. In the last place, the presence of atmospheric air
is  indispensably necessary :   if    be entirely expelled, no effect
                                     it
can be produced.        In all the periods of the experiment                it
 will be found that the vapour fills only          certain portion of
                                                    a

      Such are the four conditions essentially necessary for ob

                           a

                  a

                                     a
  rest of the tube remains cold              and, in the last place, the

 be the cause of the sound.               wished first to ascertain whe

 carefully before made the experiment
                       I                                  then made
                                                               :I       emit      it
 sounds, and found, after producing this effect several times,
 that its weight had neither increased nor decreased                whence    ;
I    concluded that caloric produces no chemical effect on the
 liquid, and that the latter merely undergoes successive eva
 poration and condensation.            Is     to this evaporation, then,
                                                     it
 of the liquid, and its condensation, that the sounds ought to
 be ascribed  ?    At first believed that this question might be
                                I
 answered in the affirmative but the following considerations
                                         ;
 made me change my opinion                      first observed that there
                                                 : I
might be successive evaporation and condensation, without
              a
the tube emitting any sound, on applying to the bulb suffi                        a
cient heat, but less intense than that necessary for making
the tube sound.        Secondly, in making the experiment with
a   drop of water, constantly found that the moment when the
                      I
apparatus began to enter into action was that when the whole
of the water was evaporated, and, consequently, when the
heat acted on the vapour             :  single atom of liquid remained
                                         if  a
in the bulb, the tube was mute. From this fact conclude                  I
that the found         isproduced         the action of the caloric on
                                              by

This    is
        a   consequence  of  the oscillations of that nature which,
give to the air an undulatory movement.            The undulations
reflected        by
               the sides of the tube become sonorous and ap
preciable when they are isochronous with the oscillations
produced by the cause         have indicated.
                                   I              From some tubes
it is impossible to produce any sound         in these   am of opi
                                                            :            I
nion that the reflected undulations cannot harmonize with
the primitive oscillations, and that the one destroy the other.
In tubes with bulbs, the found, after certain time, becomes a
weaker, and at length ceases. This may be explained              the              by
 propagation of heat along the fides.       When the bulb       very              is
warm, and the tube cold, the vapour which rises from the
 bulb suddenly loses apart of its volume, and the oscillations
 thus produced are strong and frequent; but when the tube
has acquired       certain degree of heat, the vapour gradually
                      a
decreases in volume               by
                            pasting from    very hot temperature
                                                            a
into    a place less warm indeed, but which, however, has a
sufficient degree of heat to make the oscillations, which be
come weaker and fainter, to cease at length entirely.       That
such     the cause of the cessation of the sound may be proved
        is
by applying      strong heat to the part of the tube already
                      a
heated, maintaining at the same time the same degree of
heat under the bulb          these means the limits of the tem
                              :     by
 peratures are again very abrupt, and the found will be repro
duced in its full force.       may be readily conceived that the
                                        It
 substance of the tube must be some matter        non-conductor     a
 of   heat   :   glass, therefore,       is   preferable.
   Let us now compare the apparatus of tube having bulb         a                 a
 with those tubes in which hydrogen gas         employed.    In     is
 the latter we have every thing necessary for the production of
 found,      vapour very hot, and consequently highly elastic
             a
 for, as already observed, the place of the combustion     at                     is    so ;
 high   a temperature that the beak of the glass      constantly         is
 red.    This hot and elastic vapour, at the moment of its pro
 duction,       in contact with the cold air, which enters the
                 is
 tube at    the  bottom and issues at the top  its volume must      ;
 then decrease       moment after
                          a          has touched that cold air:
                                                  it
 new hot vapours succeed the former, and contract in their
 turn.    This alternate expansion and contraction gives birth
 to the undulatory movement of the air, and sonorous undula
  tions.
                                                            We,

 30       Tubes rendered harmonious    by  Hydrogen Gas.
    We have already seen that an inflamed jet of spirit of wine
 or of ether cannot make the tube sound.            This is a new
proof of what I have advanced, -that to produce found there
must be a great difference between the temperature of the
vapour and that of the surrounding air.        In this cafe there
is a successive formation and condensation of vapour, for the
water streams along the sides of the tube ; but the place of
 combustion has a much inferior degree of heat to what it has
                                                                  ¦
when hydrogen gas is burnt, and consequently the vapour
produced has less heat as well as less elasticity. This cafe is
analogous to that already mentioned, when we said that a suc
cessive evaporation and condensation      of the liquid might be
produced     in a tube having  a bulb,  without  any sonorous ef
fects, by exposing the bulb to a certain degree of heat, but
less intense than that necessary for making the tube emit a
sound. Wesiiould not be surprised if less heat were produced
by the combustion of spirit of wine, or ether, than by that of
hydrogen gas, when it is considered that in the latter cafe
all the caloric contained in this gas, and in the oxygen of the
atmospheric air consumed, becomes sensible heat, and unites
itself entirely with the vapour produced. On the other hand,
in the combustion of an inflammable substance, such as spirit
of wine, we have only the caloric of the oxygen consumed,
rendered sensible, and which is in a great measure absorbed
by the formation of carbonic acid gas, so that it is only the
excess which joins the vapour. It is therefore not astonishing
that we have not heat sufficient to give to this vapour all the
elasticity necessary for the production of found : the presence
of the carbonic acid gas resulting from the combustion may
also be an obstacle to the. sonorous vibrations.
    In tubes employed with hydrogen gas, the found is much
stronger than in those having bulbs : besides, in the former
it is permanent, in the latter it continues only a few mo
ments.     The reason of this is as follows : In the apparatus
with hydrogen gas the tube is open at both extremities, con
sequently there is formed a current of fresh air, which enters
at the bottom and issues at the top ; this current of air lweep-
ing along with the hot and elastic vapours receives their im
pulse, and, by taking from them a portion of caloric, dimi
nishes their volume : we find here, therefore, the most essen
tial condition for the production of an intense and permanent
sound, viz. a great difference between the temperature of the
air and that of the vapour; and this difference always remains
the fame by the continual renovation of the air ; but this
does not take place in tubes with bulbs, and therefore the
found they emit is weaker and of shorter duration.

    From this principle, that the great difference between the
temperature of the vapour and air is necessary for the pro
duction of found, it may be easily conceived that every thing
which tends to augment the heat of the current of air, ana
to diminish that produced by the combustion of the gas, will
tend also to weaken or even to annihilate the found of the
tube : but these two circumstances are united in a warm
chamber rilled with people : the current of air, instead of
being cool, is hot, and the quantity of oxygen being there
less, the heat produced will be of less strength.                  It needs
therefore excite no astonishment, that in such chambers the
experiment does not always succeed.
     Brugnatelli produced sounds in tubes merely by the com
 bustion of phosphorus.           Some philosophers, conceiving that
the sonorous effects were owing in a peculiar manner to the
hydrogen gas, have been induced to infer the presence of that
 substance in phosphorus.          From what has been said, is it not
 more simple to explain this phænomenon by the production
 of the phosphorous acid under the form of vapours, which,
 receive a great degree of elasticity from the caloric disengaged
 during the combustion, and the volume of which is soon di
 minished by the contact of the cold air ? We find there the
 alternate expansion and contraction necessary for communi
 cating to the air the undulatory motion proper for producing
 founds.
     Such are the few observations I have had an opportunity
 of making on harmonious tubes ; I hope they will prove iu
  some measure interesting to those particularly engaged with
  this branch of philosophy, and that they will contribute to
  wards making them pay attention to this curious fact hitherto
  neglected.

   Wi     E should never forget that the value of every art arise*
   from the degree of mental capacity requisite to its production,
   and the degree of instruction or pleasure resulting therefrom.
                                                                        Hence

 Hence      invention is justly ranked as the first and most nobte
 part   of   theart; by it we distinguish the philosopher from the
   mere painter, for he whose powers are confined to imitation
  deserves no better name.
      Invention not only relates to the way in which the artist
  tells the story, but, in a higher fense, requires the aid of
  such probable incidents as may contribute to its further illus
  tration.     Raphael, in his Paul at Lystra, has finely con
  trived to show the miracle wrought, by making one of the
  spectators, full of wonder and astonishment, listing up the
  drapery to examine the limbs that have acquired their proper
  sliape.    N. Pouffin, to convey an idea of the size of Poly
  phemus, has placed him on the distant mountains, and, by
  interposing a great medium of air, has separated him from
  the figures of the fame size on the fore-ground, and thereby
  produced a gigantic effect that beggars all description. Barry,
 in his picture of Elysium, has represented spiritual beings
  conducting the earth, thereby indicating that the world is
¦
 governed by a supreme intelligence*.
     The laws that govern historical painting are not confined
 to   it,but extend to every other species of composition       hence:
it   becomes the most noble part of the art, and from which
 all the others are but as       many branches.
                                         so              not only re

 attire, with landscape, architecture, &c; so that we may
justly term       the only universal part of the art.

     Some men, who term themselves artists, move in an orbit
 so confined that their motions are scarcely discernible without
 the aid of some strong magnifier. Unfortunately for the arts,
 the trifler meets with the most success; perhaps the higher
 parts of the art are not        immediately within the reach of
                                          so

                                in           In those pictures the artist may
be said to have invented his subjects altogether, and has   so  connected them
as to illustrate that great moral truth, " that the attainment of happiness,
individual as well as public, depends on the cultivation of the human fa
culties." They exhibit        fine system of ethics, at the fame time that they

 most ignorant the most            successful,   and the most successful
 the most honoured.
    The   great   artists of former times did not only practise
 history,  but  portrait, nay even landscape, and often excelled
in architecture': then it was that one good work was enough
 to insure a man success and fortune, while now twenty hasty
ones will scarcely furnish him bread.               Little and poor spirits
 have formerly made them separate studies, and their inability
disqualified them from teaching on a more liberal and exten
sive scale, and now the practice of many is insignificant and
 contemptible.
    Man loves himself, and of course is interested in .whatever
relates thereto : hence the great end of painting should be,
recording actions of great personal patience, sufferance, or
heroism ; but, above all, embodying some important moral
truth for the edification of mankind.
               Some lofty theme let judgment first supply,
               Supremely fraught with grace and majesty ;
               For fancy copious, free to ev'ry charm
               That lines can circumscribe, or colours warm :
               Still happier if that artful theme dispense
               A poignant moral and instructive sense.
                                                        Mason's Fresnoy.
   That part of painting termed the ornamental may please
and delight ; but he who in his works combines sublimity with
sentiment, may be justly said to have reached one of the
highest points of human felicity, and does an honour to the
ignorant by raising them from their own native insignificance
to rank with the highest order of earthly beings:
                 The     dullest genius cannot fail
                 To    find the moral of my tale :
                 That the distinguifh'd part of men,
                  With compass, pencil, sword, or pen,
                 Should in life's visit leave their name,
                 In characters which may proclaim,
                 That they with ardour strove to raise
                  At once their arts and country's praise.         Prior.
   In the choice of our subject we should prefer those best
known, and, if possible, such a one as may carry with it a
general interest. As a poet, Milton was particularly happy in
his Paradise Lost; it is not the destruction of a city, or the
conduct of a colony, but the fate of worlds, which involved
the happiness of mankind at large.               The Greek and Roman
history with their fables, also the history of our own nation,
and the works of our best poets, furnish infinite matter for
study, as well as those grand and sublime subjects that occur
in the Old and New Testament.

34                         On Painting.
    But in our choice from the above, or any other work, we"
are not bound, like cattle, to follow a leader; the subjects
unhandled are endless ; those in the Bible abound from the
most simple pastoral to such as are in the highest degree sub
lime.     Besides, by exerting a proper degree of independence
 we shall not only be left free lo act, but thereby stand the
 greater chance to give our works the character of originality.
 What could be more mortifying than to have it said that the
 best part of our picture was pitifully stolen from another ?
 This would render us like the poor animal when stripped of his
 borrowed clothes, in which he looked so formidable, when be
 hold he proved a mere ass ! Such a conduct cannot be justified
 by any example found in a great master, whatever proofs he
 had given of his powers of invention, and it would be equally
 unpardonable in an artist of less celebrity. Nothing can be
 so contemptible as that poorness of spirit that goes limping
 after another, crawling over objects like a Aug, and leaving
 nothing but flime behind: he never can be great that does not
 greatly dare.     The mind, acting from its own impulse, wilt
 energize    with  more vigour than it poffibly could by seeing
 objects through the medium of another's feelings. He who
 imitates the manner of another debases himself, by giving
 his company to the servant when the mistress is ready to en
 tertain him.
     Prints and drawings are useful to please the eye or enrich
 our thoughts, or, by having them before us, to keep up the
 fervour of the mind while employed on similar works of our
 own : then it is we may catch a grace from a figure, a grand
 or beautiful cast of drapery, or a thought that may give energy
 or brilliancy to our own, and that without copying. Collec
 tions of good prints are highly valuable to the artist ; they
 add a nobleness to his conceptions, aud raise and warm hi»
 imagination : so do fine descriptions in history and poetry.
 The prints after Raphael, M. Angelo, and the Caracci, will
  afford a fuifd of entertainment and instruction ; and fine in
                                                                     '
  stances of forms in the back-grounds of Titian and Paul Vero-
  ne fe will be found with occasional good composition. Rubens's
  prints by Bolswert will be highly worthy attention, as well
  as those after the most celebrated French and British artists.
     We stioukl be careful not to suffer our pursuits to be inter
  rupted by vulgar opinions or prejudices, but pursue our studios
  full of the conviction, " that patience and perseverance will
  lead to perfection."     Nothing can be more absurd than to-
  imagine one person too lively for such a study, another too
  grave, or a third too sober or honest for a genius : the fact is,,
  if we suffer the opinions of others to affect our choice or oves-

subject he chose, represented                          by
                                             the peasants of his own

Raphael in the Cartoons         who, knowing how much was ex
                                       !
pected from those who practised the great style, has infused
all the nobleness he was master of into his apostles, notwith
standing history furnishes no authority for             doing.   As we so
cannot make our hero talk greallv, we must make him appear
capable of great actions,                   by
                                   adding all the externals ot dig

                                                 it   is
unity which nature does not always do. Thomson has finely
heightened the death of Amelia                             by
                                              the thunder-storm.    A
murder perpetrated in gloomy day, or at night, will affect
                                   a
our feelings more strongly than in          broad flaring light.

   Events become more compact,             and   of course more inte
resting,       by
            making the inanimate       scenes   of nature more dread
ful or lovely, or        by
                      adding      more   sublime

   Though many things in nature and art exceed expectation,
yet nothing sensible has the power to exceed or even equal
the capacity of thought            from this power of the mind

caverns more gloomy, ruins more majestic, and the whole
face of nature dressed in fun or fliade as best suits our pur
pose, while we may render the human figure more beautiful
or grand.
     The painter of history, like the historian", represents the
event, not the man, which is the province of the portrait-
painter and biographer.
     The Dutch have treated history under circumstances so
purely local, that Christ has appeared in the storm in a com
mon fishing-boat with the tri-coloured flag flying) and Da-
 Iila cutting a lock from a huge black peruke ot the end of
the 17th century.
     Two advantages result from going to remote history for
our subjects : one           becomes more venerable
                             is,   it                       another is,  ;

     The two divisions of history generally rank under the grand
style, and what sir Jofliua terms the ornamental, but which
                                                                             by

      The grand style requires the greatest simplicity of conduct                      :
  the rejection of all things little is necessary to its completion,
  not only as to disposition, form, the minutiae of colour and
  effect, but to the total disregard of all the trickery of penciling                  :
                             6                                    above

above all,    if our subject is lofty, we must be careful not to
admit any thought that is trifling or mean ; a fault many of
the old masters are not entirely free from.
   The drapery should partake of the same great character :
all the minute parts mult be rejected, the folds should be
broad and simple, possess an easy communication, and grace
fully follow each other as by chance.
   The application of those styles must depend on the nature
of the subject all together ; the choice of the Roman school
required a simplicity of conduct which must necessarily rim
through the whole picture.            The subjects of the Cartons
woulu suffer by a destruction of the unity, from changing the
character of any part : the unaffected composition, solemnity
of colour, the broad and simple folds of the drapery, form a
whole that would be destroyed by attaching showy colour, or,
changing the character of the composition or drapery to the
picturesque.      But sportive scenes, feasts, processions, and
marriage ceremonies, such as were principally chosen by the
Venetians, perfectly agree with that picturesque effect arising
from splendour of colour, opposition of light aud (hade, con
trast,  and variety of draperies.
   This character appears to arise (as before         observed) out of
the very nature of the subject.          Who that     wished to repre
sent an assassination      would introduce splendid colours, or
great vivacity of light ? On the contrary, would he not ra
ther use sad and solemn ones, with darkness, obscurity, and
great depth ?
    What has reduced         the Venetian school is want of ex
pression.     Paul Veronese, in his picture of Mary Magdalen
anointing the feet of Jesus, has made it a mere eating-match
of Venetian senators ; and Tintoret, in his Marriage at Cana,
has made the company scarcely notice the miracle' of turning
the water into wine.
   True history should never have its gravity disturbed by any
improbable or impossible circumstance.             What can be more
absurd    than   Raphael's flying apostles    in  the  Attila, the an
gels   in  the  battle  of Constantine,   or  St. Cecilia   in the fame
picture    with   St.  Paul,   St. John,  St.  Augustin, and Mary
Magdalen     ?   The    fame   artist in the  School    of Athens has
confounded all the circumstances of time and place.                How
unlike is the conduct of a great modern artist, who, in bring
ing together a number of great characters that lived at re
mote periods from each other, has wifely placed them in
Elysium ? In the picture by Titian, in the church of St.
Francis in Veuice (formerly alluded to), we find the Virgin
                                       C3                            and

   Those who choose to exert their fancy had better invent
their subject altogether, and not falsify a fact by going to
true history, where invention can never justify the introduc
tion of allegoric fiction. It detracts from the merit of Con-
ftantine as a conqueror, by bringing the host of heaven to
his aid : without it we may suppose Tie could not have over
come his more powerful partner in the empire.         But the
highest joke is to find Heliodorus plundering the temple of
Jerusalem (as related in the second book of Maccabees), and
pope   Julius        present as a spectator.
           I   lose my patience, and     I

           Thele fools demand not pardon, but applause.        PoPE.
   Without racking our invention for fables above the com
prehension of the vulgar, there are many fine moral stories
for the practice of those who can afford the time and expense
necessarv to their completion ; such as the patient resignation
of that first of mortal men, Socrates, at his death ; Curtius
leaping into the gulf; the Decii devoting themselves for
their country ; the sudden reverse of fortune in Marius at the
ruins of Carthage ; the folly of Candaules in exposing his
wife's beauty to his friend Gyges ; the desire of fame in Caesar
weeping before the statue of Alexander ; the virtue of Pho-
cion in refusing the bribes of Alexander ; and the piety of
Æneas in preserving his father from the siames of Troy;
with numberless others that must occur to every one's recol
lection.
     The Florentine and Roman schools have seized on the most
prominent parts            of
                      the arts, and, having perfected them, left
but little to do for those who followed beyond embellishing :
whatever was strong and forcible they seized in their mighty
       ; hence those who have succeeded them as they po-
!;rasp
 iflied have lost vigour and expression.         The Caracci at
tempted        it,
              and  with  some  of their  scholars were often suc
cessful, and for dignity and expression ranked next after the
above great schools.     The Venetians appear scarcely to have
thought of         the rich bustle of their pictures.

Raphael for expression justly ranks before any other painter,
of which there are fine examples at hand in the Cartons at

  Windsor castle, and which by the first judges are ranked
  among the best of his works, if not the very best. They
  are unquestionably preferable to any of his pictures in the
  Vatican, for purity of invention and historic truth.                       His
  easel pictures are generally poor.
      By expression we do not confine ourselves to the face
  merely, but to the justness of the general action.                  That ex
  pression is justly placed at the head of the art is evident from
  its difficulty, for to express well we mult in ourselves feel the
 passion we wish to represent.                He who wishes to wring an
 other's heart with anguissi must feel as exquisitely himself:
  hence the necessity of recurring to nature, >and not depend
 ing on the feelings of another, as the mannerist ever must.
  We i)ia.U obtain but little advantage in this instance from a
  model : we must therefore recur to ourselves; and in so doing
  the looking-glass will become our best friend : for, as Pope
  observes,
             They    best sliall pnint them  who can feel them most.
     The    passions,    as they are called, by Le Brun are over
 charged,     so  much     so as to have become          caricatures.      There
 is no laying down rules for what must ever depend on the
feelings.      Next to nature, the antique heads of the Laocoon,
 the dying Alexander, the Niobes, and many others, will be
 well worth consulting: but expression must be general ; we
 see agony in the fingers and toes of the Laocoon as strong
as in the face.         Domenichino and Poussin were great in ex
 pression; but, as before observed, Raphael is the first mo
 dern.
     It would be an unpardonable neglect to overlook a work
of British art, that for expression would dispute precedence
with the best of the Roman school. Where shall we see pa
ternal despair represented with more force and truth than in
fir Joshua Reynolds's count Ugoli no, or the horrors of death
pronounced in a more determined and masterly manner than
in the children? We need fay no more : Sweetness and Truth
were his handmaids; and when he died the Graces would no
longer remain on the earth.                   Where encouragement has
been offered, the British artists have done their duty: in
portrait and landscape they equal, if not exceed, the best ;
and in history some works have appeared honourable in the
highest degree to the nation. They will be sufficient to sliow
to posterity the powers of the art in the time we live: a few
good works are enough, perhaps, in an ungrateful age*.
    *  I am justified in using      the words  ungrateful age, by the shameful
neglect shown at the sale of      Matklin's pictures   by British artists.   Art,-

     If we wilhto know much, we must fee many things of a
kind,  that by comparing them we may acquire a more per
fect idea of the thing than the real object conveys ; and those
ideas we are bound to improve till we understand the true
principles of general nature, or unaccompanied with those
peculiarities that mark the defects of the individuals in each
species.
    When we have determined on a subject, we must with all
due expedition make a sketch of the principal persons con
cerned in the event, or whatever constitutes the feature of
the picture, without regard to dress or any of the lesser in
cidents, as much of the fire and spirit of the actions, as
well as the grandeur of the whole, depends on the first
impression.       We must then do by our sketch as Virgil said
he did by his works,       " lick them into shape;" for, as the
first part depends on the imagination, so the second is the re
sult of judgment : we are then to prune or add till the whole
comes into perfect ordonnance, choosing such objects as are
strikingly noble or beautiful, and adding such accessory cir
cumstances as may best contribute to illustrate the story.
In our progress with the sketch we may add a second or third
group, settle the dresses and the back -ground, whether land-
icape or architecture, the disposition os the mafles, and com
plete the whole by slightly tinting it.
    We arc bound to preserve a whole throughout our work,
as well as an unity of time and place : we mould therefore
 avoid every thing local ; even a well-known face or figure
 destroys interest, by rendering the work familiar.
    Lairesse whimsically describes a picture of the deluge,
 painted by an artist of his time, as made up of absur
 dities. Among other things jumbled together is                the"
 grave of Mahomet, rolls ot Virginia tobacco, a cardinal's
 cap, a child in a gocart, pickled herrings, a smutch-pot and
 pencils, all the toys from a Nuremberg toy-sliop, the re
 cords of the imperial chamber at Spire," and, to crown the
 whole,        "
              the Vatican," and the artist's own dear self     sit "

 The man must be ignorant indeed who could be guilty of
like beauty, having once withered, can never be restored. Constantine,
with all his wealth and power, could not resuscitate  it,but was obliged
to rrb antiunt Rome to adorn his new city.    Rouse, countrymen, rouse   !
you will add to your own immortality,    and give vigour to the labours of
the artist,    encouraging the noble walk of history painting.

never act so absurdly as to mix in the fame picture things an

Flemish, and Dutch masters.
      If  the subject we mean to handle lies in Egypt, Athens,
or Rome,        let us endeavour to transport ourselves thither by
the warmth and activity of our imagination, and, by remov
ing every tiling local, lead the spectator through the delight
ful and magical mazes of science, so that he may actually
imagine the scene transacting before his eyes.
VI. Extratl           of a Memoir on Argental Mercury.         Read
      before  the   French National Injlitute, by C. Cord ie it,
      Engineer     of Mines *.
    x    HE mineral called formerly native amalgam of silver,
and which since the labours of C. Ilaiiy is now known under
 the name of argental mercury, is one of those natural me
 tallic combinations, the mineralogical and chemical pro
 perties of which had been the least perfectly described and
 examined.         It is however probable that an accurate know
ledge      of this   species would have been obtained, had not its
 great rarity prevented chemists from sacrificing the only spe
 cimens of it which they possessed in order to subject them to
 complete examination.           The places where argental mercury
 is found     are  the mines  of  Rosenar in Hungary, those of Mors-
 feldt in the ci-devant Palatinate, now the department of
 Mont-Tonnerre, and particularly those of Muschel-Landsberg
  in the same country : these are the only mines by which U.
 has been hitherto furnistied.
       Though this mineral is at present too rare to be the object
  of the labours of the miner, it will be seen that it deserves the
  attention of the mineralogist, and lo make a figure among
  the most remarkable of the metallic species.
       Argental mercury is found always disseminated throughout
  the mass of the veins, sometimes in very thin leaves which
   fill up the fissures, sometimes in small crystals totally engaged
  in the matrix, or entirely insulated in the cavities.
       This mineral substance has the colour and resplendence of
   silver or polistied tin, or rather more frequently of liquid
   mercury, because it almost always retains at its surface a thin
   stratum of the last mentioned metal.
       Its regular forms are the dodecaedral-rhomboidal, and all
   its modifications.

43                      On Argental Mercury.
    The small lamellæform leaves of argental mercury are for
the most part bent, and follow the undulations of the rock to
which they are applied. Their surface is generally smooth
 and polished, but much less than that of its crystals.        This
metal is easily scratched by a piece of sharp-pointed steel. By
scraping it loses almost all its splendour, and becomes dull.
When rubbed on copper it leaves a white metallic trace. It
is brittle and easily broken : its consistence approaches to that
of martial pyrites. Its fracture is conchoid, and exhibits no
appearance of laminae.         The fragments of it are indeter-
mined, with very obtuse edges.
    Its specific gravity, determined from a mean of several ex
periments, is 14*1 192; argental mercury therefore, next to
platina and gold, is the heaviest of bodies. When this mi
neral is heated at the blow-pipe, the mercury becomes vola
tilized, and a small button of silver may be easily obtained.
    The varieties of the regular forms are, ist, The perfect
 rhomboidal dodecaedron (fig. i. Plate III). The incidence
of the two contiguous faces is 1200. The crystals not being
susceptible of any mechanical division, it is not possible to
know precisely whether this solid be the primitive form of
argental mercury, as is probable, and as we (hall suppose it
to be, in order to have the expression of the laws of decre
ment and the value of the angles.        This supposition can pro
duce no error, because the results of the calculation may be
easily transferred,    so as to apply them to the octaedron, the
tetraedron, or the cube, which are the only other forms
possible.
    ad,   The dodecaedron truncated on the six solid angles
composed     of four planes.    The fix new faces are produced in
virtue of a decrement by one row : they belong to the cube,
and make with the faces of the primitive form angles of 135°.

expression of the laws of decrement which produce this
form is P E.

been before observed, is the most complex of all those exhi
bited by mineral substances.    It is produced by the intersec
tion of the faces which belong to the following six kinds of
regular or symmetric solids, viz. the cube, the octaedron,
the rhomboidal dodecaedron, the solid with 24 trapezoidal
facets, the solid with 24 isosceles triangular facets, and the
solid with 48 scalene triangular facets. The complete crystal
is terminated by 122 faces.      The expression or this form,
                               11     1 I I    1u
represented    fig. 2,   is   PBBAEE.
      The incidence of the     faces    of the primitive form with
those    of the octaedron is   125°   15' 52"; with thole of the solid
having 24 triangular facets is        153^ 28' 4" ; with those of the
solid having 48 faces 160 53' 36".
    Hitherto no complete anatomy of argental mercury has
bfen published ; mineralogists were satisfied with acquiring
an approximate knowledge of its composition from simple
experiments : it was therefore of importance to determine
with accuracy the elementary principles of this mineral, and
to six the proportions.     This analysis was attended with no
kind of difficulty *.
     Sixty parts of this mineral were exposed in a crucible to
the action of a low heat, which was successively increased,
and continued as long as was necessary to volatilize all the
mercury.      The crystals, without suffering any sensible loss
of volume, were changed into spongy masses, which to
wards the estd of the operation funk down and united into a
metallic button : the weight of this button was found to be
 16*5 parts, from which it was concluded that the weight of
 she mercury volatilized was 43 "5 .
     This button was perfectly malleable, and had all the ap
 pearances of the purest silver.   To ascertain its purity it was
 exposed to the action of nitric acid proved by nitrate of silver.
 The solution was effected without any residuum.
     Oxygenated muriatic acid was poured into the solution,
 and the precipitate of muriate of silver was collected on the
 filter.   The liquor tried by carbonate of potasii furnistied no
 precipitate: the silver then contained no foreign metallic
 substance.
       In
        regard to the state of the mercury in its combination,
 it is certainly not necessary to prove that it exists in a folia
 state.   To be convinced of        it,
                                   nothing wil} be necessary but

to consider, first, that it forms almost three fourths of th*
¦whole   mass; in the next place, that the specific density of
the natural combination not only surpasses, by a great deal,
the mean specific density of silver and liquid mercury, but
also that it is much more considerable than that of the latter
metal, which is the heavier of the two. The specific gravity
indeed of the combination, calculated according to the for*
mula of C. Haiiy, would be only i2-5448, supposing the
mercury liquid, whereas it is 14*11923 that of the mercury
is only 13-5681.

  It   may be of utility to remark here how improper the de
nomination of native amalgam was to denote this mineral
substance.     The name still employed in chemistry and the
arts does not denote        solid combination, but

    An exact knowledge of the specific density of argental
mercurv, as well as ot the proportions of its two component
principles, has suggested the idea of making some researches
in regard to the density of solid mercury. Chemists have set
out with the supposition that the moleculæ of the two metals
experience    no dilatation nor penetration in combining :
knowing the specific gravity of silver = 10*4743, that of
argental    mercury = i4"iio2,         and the ratio of the two
metah if-> it will be founts that the specific gravity of solid
mercury ought to be 16*2662.          In the case of there being a
penetration of moleculæ, as is probable, the real density would
be somewhat less: on the other hand, if there be dilatation,
it will be found to be more considerable.           In a word, this
approximative result ought the less to be neglected, as it is
probable that it will be always very difficult to attain direclly
to an estimation perfectly exact.
VII-     Extract as a Notice, read in the French National In
   stitute, on a new Variety of Epidote.         JJ^Champeaux
    and Cressac, Engineers of Mines *.
   A H E substance which forms the object of this notice was
 found in the primitive chain which traverses the country of
 the Grisons, and unites the mountains of St. Gothard to
 those  of the Tyrol.
    It has always been found united to a variety of red garnet,
 which Saufl'ure, has described t as a particular species under
 the name of hyacinth de Diffmtis. To complete the descrip
 tion of this species, he gives a short description of the sub
 stance which forms the subject of this article, and he gives,
 it the name of pbrenite, because he thought he could distin
 guish in it characters  which     brought it near to the phrenite
 of Oifans.
     In this description we shall follow the method      adopted by
 professor  Haiiy.

 colour becomes less dark; the angles and the ridges then fuse
 into a yellowish enamel, which grows brown in a continued
 heat, and is converted into scoria : if a thin plate be sub
jected to experiment, it becomes corneous before it is sco
rified.
     Acids, cold. Acids have no action on it.
     It results from  this examination, and particularly the con
sideration of the       essential character, that the substance in
              belongs   to the epidote ; for it can be divided in a
   irection parallel
Question               to the planes of a right rhomboidal prism,
which form with       each other angles of 114° 37' and
                                                            650 23 '.
It   sometimes happens that there is observed above the planes
of    the prism facets oblique to the axes, which might give
reason to suppose that they are parallel to the bases, and
thence be lea into an error respecting the determination of
the primitive form ; but an attentive examination (hows that
they belong to other crystals which penetrate the former;
and besides, the examination of a form, sufficiently promi
nent to admit of applying to it the laws of structure, has
proved that observation agrees with calculation.
                                                               This

                  On a new Variety of Epidote.                                              47
   This form, which has not yet been described among the
known varieties of the epidote, results :
   1st, From a decrement by one row on the edges G of the
prism (fig. 3.) corresponding to the acute angles of the base.
   ad, From a mixt decrement on the left, by four rows in
breadth and three in height, on the other edges H.
   3d, From a decrement by three rows to the left On the
fame edges.    This is that which constitutes the new variety.
   The preceding laws do not mark entirely the planes M
and T.
   4th, In the last place, from a decrement by one row on
the acute angles E of the rhombus of the base. The latter
reaching its limits, makes the face P disappear entirely.
   It follows from this structure that the characteristic sign
Of the crystal    will   be   G M TH H T E                         ; and the          form pro-

duced being   a prism of ten planes and diedral summits (fig.4.),
we may thence deduce the denomination of quadridecimal,
which will express the four faces of the summits and the tea
of the prism.
    Calculation has given for the inclination of the face x pro
duced on the adjacent plane M 163° 23', and on the declin
ing plane T 13 1° 17'; results which are agreeable to those
obtained by geometry.
    Independently of the form already described there have
been observed also secondary crystals presenting at their sur
face parallel striæ.    This, no doubt, is that described by
 Saussure in the following words : Jlria;, as if in the form of
 bajlions. In a word, we may mention as pseudomorpbic the
 forms of emarginated garnet, to which this epidote of Dif-
 sentis has been associated ; for sometimes it covers it entirely
 by being moulded over                it,
                                and sometimes          completely           it   is
 covered Dy  it in such     manner, that one of the two sub
                              a
 stances cannot be seen but                 by
                                  the fracture of the other.
    The observation of this new variety proves that the deter
 mination of mineral substances merely         their exterior cha  by
 ractersis  exceedingly defective; for the latter      its faces                 by           is
 very distinct from the species to which         belongs, but the      it
 geometric characters assign to      in the methodical system its
                                                 it
 real place.
    We shall remark also that the epidote       substance the           is   a
 varieties of which differ from each other according to the
 countries where they have been found      to be convinced of      :
 this, nothing will be necessary but to compare that of Dau-
 phiny with that of Arendal                      and       that of Dissentis.             Their

  48                  On a Variety of carbonated Lime.
 aspect is so peculiar that nothing can prove their identity but
 analysis and the laws of structure.
    We shall compare this new variety of the epidote only with
 the phrenite, because it is under this name that it is described
 by Saufiure : it differs from it by its specific gravity in the
 ratio of 33 to 36, and by its structure, as it exhibits evident
 sections in two directions, while the phrenite exhibits only
 one  :   in  a  word, it is not electric by heat.
    The rock which accompanies it is              composed of the sub
 stance of the garnet, the epidote itself,         calcareous stone, and
quartz.        These elements sometimes        are in proportions nearly
 equal ;     but it happens for the most part thil the matter of
 the garnet predominates.           In some specimens the epidote is
disposed in thin zones between crystals of garnet, on which it
 is moulded : it appears also in amorphous masses pretty vo
luminous.           Nothing certain can be said in regard to its posi
tion ; but it may be affirmed that it is found in the cavities or
futures of primitive mountains. We do not think that it has
ever yet been found in its proper place by any naturalist ; and
the case is the fame with the other productions of St. Go-
thard.        The dealers in crystals go in quest of them, and sell
them to travellers.

IX.    Experiments     and   Observations    on    certain  Stony   and
    Metalline Subjlrnces which at different Times are said to
    have fallen on the Earth ; also on various Kinds of Native
    Iron. By Edward Howard, Esq. "F.R.S.
              [Concluded from p. 336 of our last  Volume.]
  JL HE connection which naturally exists between one mass,
of native iron and another, immediately turns our attention
to the native iron in Siberia, described by Pallas ; and this,
we are told, the Tartars considered as a sacred relic, which
had dropped from heaven. The nickel found in the one mass,
and the traditionary history of the other, not to compare
the globular bodies of stone from the Benares with the glo
bular concavities and the earthy matter of the Siberian iron,
tend to the formation of a chain between fallen stones and
all kinds of native iron.     How far any real affinity exists be
tween these several substances, very obliging friends have af
forded me an opportunity to form some judgment.                    I am
indebted to Mr. Greville and Mr. Hatchett tor portions of
almost every known native iron ; and the count de Bournon
has done me the favour particularly to describe them as
follows.
Descripthn     of various Kinds of Native Iron.           By .the Count
                             de Bournon.
    The great number of particles of iron, in a perfectly me
tallic state, contained in the stone from Bohemia, and the
said particles being so near each other, naturally lead to
sonic reflections respecting the existence of native iron, which,
by many mineralogists, is still considered as problematical.
Let us suppose for a moment, that these particles of iron were
to approach still more nearly to each other, so as absolutely
to come into contact, and in that manner to form a kind of
chain, folded upon itself in the interior part of the substance,
and leaving a great number of cavities between the links of
 the chain so folded.       Let us then suppose, that the earthy
 substance with which these cavities are silled, being very
 porous, and having but a small degree of consistence, siiould
 (as may happen by a variety of causes) be destroyed.                It is
     Vol. XIV. No. 53.             D                              plain,

^o                   Experiments and Observations
plain, that if such a destruction were to take place, the iron
alone would remain ; and, being thus left bare, it would ap-
 iear in the form of a mass, more or less considerable, of a cel-
IIular texture, and as it were ramified ; such a form, in sliort,
as that in which most of the native irons we are acquainted
with have been found. May it not be fair to attribute to
such an origin the native iron found in Bohemia, a specimen
of which was presented by the Academy of Freyberg to baron
Born, and which came, with the rest of his collection, into
the hands of Mr. Greville ? May not such also, notwithstand
ing the enormity of its bulk, be the origin of the mass of
native iron found in Siberia, near Mount Kemirs, by the
celebrated Pallas ?
     We   have already   seen, in the results of the analyses made
by Mr. Howard, of         the various stones above described, that
he constantly found       a    certain proportion of nickel mixed with
the iron they contained.   This circumstance recalls lo our
notice the observations that were made by Mr. Proust, some
time ago, respecting the mixture of nickel in the native iron
of South America ; and tends to give some additional sup
port to the opinion hinted at in the foregoing paragraph.
   The circumstances just mentioned naturally gave to Mr.
Howard, as well as to me, a desire to know whether the na
tive iron from Siberia, and that from Bohemia, were also
mixed with nickel. Mr. Howard, consequently, lost no time
in proceeding upon this important investigation. The native
iron of Siberia presents some very interesting peculiarities, and
ha's often been referred to, but has not yet been properly de
scribed; it is therefore with great pleasure that I add the fol
lowing description of       and of some other kinds of native
                              it,
iron, to the description      have already given of the various
                               I
stones said to have fallen on the earth.
 I   feel the greater satisfaction           in
                                        doing this, as the noble
collection of Mr. Greville contains two specimens of this iron,
in perfect condition; one of which weighs several pounds,
and was sent to Mr. Greville         Mr. Pallas himself: on this
                                        by
account, therefore,     Ienjoy an advantage that many of the
authors who have spoken of this iron probably wanted.
   One of these pieces has cellular and ramified texture, ana
                                    a
logous to that of some very porous and light volcanic scoria;
this is the usual texture of the specimens- of this kind of iron,
which are preserved        the various mineralogical collections
                          in
in Europe. When          it attentively examined, there may be
                              is
perceived in   it,not onlv empty cells? but also impressions or
cavities, of greater or less depth, and sometimes perfectly
round, which appear evidently to be the result of the com-
                                                              preflioa

            on certain Stony and Metalline Suljlances.          51
 preflion of hard bodies which were situated there, and which,
 when they came away, left the surface of these cavities quite
 smooth, and having the lustre of polished metal. Here and
 there, in some of these cavities, there remains a transparent
 substance, of a yellowish green colour, of which I shall treat
 more particularly when I come to the description of the se
cond of the specimens above mentioned. It is very clear that
the cavities here spoken of owe their existence to this trans
parent substance ; and that the polish of the cavities arises
merely from the compression of the said substance, and is the
natural consequence of its surface having been in perfect con-
ta6t with that of the iron.
    This iron is very malleable : it may be easily cut with a
knife ; and may be as easily flattened or extended by means of a
hammer. Its specific gravity is 6487 ; which, however, is very
much under that of iron which has been merely melted, and
has not been forged.      The specific gravity of the native iron
of Bohemia, which is nearly as malleable and as easy to be
cut, is still less: I found it not to exceed 6146. This low
degree of gravity appears to be owing partly to the oxidize-
ment of the surface of the iron, and partly to there being,
in the interior part of its substance, a number of small cavi
ties, which are often rendered visible by fracture, and which
have their surfaces also oxidized.     The fracture of this iron
presents the fame shining and silvery white colour as the com
mon cast iron known by the name of white cast iron : but its
        is much smoother and finer ; it is also. much more mal-
  eable when cold. Bergman savs that this iron is brittle when
Ssrain
heated to a red heat.     I have frequently tried it in that state,
and have constantly found it to be malleable.       The fame re
mark may be applied to the native iron from South America,
and also to that from Senegal.
    The second of the two specimens mentioned above, and
which weighs several pounds, presents an aspect that differs,
in some respects, from that of the preceding specimen.        The
most considerable part of it forms a solid compact mass, in
which there is not to be perceived the smallest appearance of
pores or cavities; but there arises upon its surface a kind of
ramified or cellular part, similar, in every respect, to the spe
cimen already described, and every where completely con
nected with the substance of the mass itself.
    If the compact part of this piece is examined with atten
tion, it will be perceived that it is not entirely composed of
iron in the metallic state, but that it is mixed with nearly
an equal quantity of the transparent substance of a yellowish
green colour, (sometimes also of a greenish yellow,) already

j   3                 Experiments and Observations
spoken of in the description of the other specimen.  This sub
stance is mixed with the iron in such a manner, that if the
whole of the former could be removed, the remaining part
would consist merely of iron in the metallic state, and would
present the same cellular appearance as the preceding speci
men, and the ramified or cellular part of the specimen now
described.
   This stony part, separated from the iron, appears in the
form of small nodules, generally of an irregular shape, but
sometimes nearly globular : they have a perfectly smooth and
mining surface, so as very often to present the appearance of
small Balls of glass ; a circumstance that has led many persons
to suppose them the result of a real vitrification.          Some of
these nodules have several irregular facets, produced by the
compression    of the iron in which they were inclosed ; but I
have never observed in them any appearances that could lead
me to suspect they had the slightest tendency whatever to
assume a determined crystalline form.
   This substance is always more or less transparent. It is
sufficiently hard to cut glass, but has no effect upon quartz.
It is very brittle : its fracture is usually conchoid ; but I could
perceive that it broke in any particular direction, in such a
way that I could consider the fracture as a natural one. It
becomes electric by friction. Its specific gravity is from 3263
to 3300.    It is very refractory : I kept       it,
                                                  for some time, ex

having acquired         greater degree of intensity in its colour.

to the opinion that      ought to be considered as kind of glass.

   Of all substances hitherto known, that with which seems      it
to have the greatest analogy       is  the peridot, (the chrysolite of
Werner,) to which some mineralogists have referred it. The
result of Mr. Howard's analysis of          it   isnearly the fame as
that of the analysis of the peridot made           Mr. klaproth.

   The hardness and infusibility of this substance are nearly
the same as those of the peridot but    ;   it seems to have    rather

less degree of specific gravity   :  that of two very perfect crystals
of peridot found to be from 3340 to 3375. The crystalline
             I
forms of the substance here tit-scribed,         itever we should be
able to determine them, would clear up our doubts respecting
the analogy between the two substances.             If we consider the
compact part of the specimen ncnv treated of, particularly the
strong connection that appears to exist between the iron and
                                                                   the

the transparent substance, and the great resistance we experi
ence when we attempt to separate them, we cannot help being
surprised, that almost all the specimens of this mass of me
tallic iron that have been brought to Europe are in the cel
lular state already described, owing apparently to the total, or
almost total, destruction of the transparent substance.      But,
besides the fragility of this substance, the specimen in question
helps very much to explain the above circumstance, inasmuch
as many of the nodules of the transparent substance belong
ing to it are in a state of real decomposition.     In that state,
they are changed into a white opaque substance, which, upon
being lightly pressed or squeezed between the singers, crum
bles into a gritty dry powder.        This decomposition may be
observed to have taken place in various degrees : in many of
the nodules, the substance is merely become friable, without
being much altered in its appearance ; whereas, some of those
which are in a state of complete decomposition arc of an
ochreous reddish yellow colour : it                is,
                                            however, easy to                di
stinguish that this colour does not belong to them, but                      is
owing only to the oxidizement of the adjacent particles of
iron.
   From   the above observations      will not be difficult to con
                                         it
ceive the possibility of the total, or nearly total, destruction of
the transparent substance     and also, the appearance the pieces
                               ;
of iron must naturally present when deprived of it.          cannot I
help observing likewise, that there appears to exist        very    a       in
teresting analogy between these transparent       nodules and the
globules   Idescribed as making part of the stones said to have
fallen on the earth. This analogy, though not very strong       a
one, may lead us to suppose that the two substances are similar
in their nature, but that the globules arc less pure, and con
tain   greater quantity of iron.

30 grains of oxide of iron, inducing an estimation of nearly

    In this experiment,     199 grains of oxide were produced from
 145  grains  of  metal   : hence there may be an estimation         of
8 grains in 145, or between 5 and 6 per cent, of nickel.
    It will appear, from a collected view of the preceding pages
and authorities, that a number of stones asserted to have fallen
under similar circumstances have precisely the same charac
ters.    The stones from Benares, the stone from Yorksliire,
that from Sienna, and a fragment of one from Bohemia, have
a relation to each other not to be questioned.
    1st, They have all pyrites of a peculiar character.
    2dly, They have all a coating of black oxide of iron.
    3dly, They all contain an alloy of iron and nickel.          And,
    4thly, The earths which serve to them as a fort of con

descent of the stones at Benares and at Sienna.           Such coin
cidence of circumstances, and the unquestionable authorities
I  have adduced, must, I imagine, remove all doubt as to the
descent of these stony substances;       for to disbelieve, on the
mere ground of incomprehensibility, would be to dispute
most of the works of nature.
    Respecting the kinds of iron called native, they all contain
nickel.     The mass in South America is hollow, has conca
vities, and appears to have been in a soft or welding state,
because it has received various impressions.
   The Siberian iron has globular concavities, in part silled
with a transparent substance, which, the proportional quan
tity of oxide of iron excepted, has nearly the composition of
the globules in the stone from Benares.
    The iron from Bohemia adheres to earthy matter studded
with globular bodies.
   The Senegal iron had been completely mutilated before it
came under my examination.
    From these facts I sliall draw no conclusion, but submit
the following queries :
    1st, Have not all fallen stones, and what are called native
irons, the fame origin ?
    adly, Are all, or any, the produce or the bodies of meteor? ?
   And, lastly, Might not the stone from Yorksliire have
formed a meteor in regions too elevated to be discovered ?
    Specimens of the Benares and Yorksliire stones have beea
deposited, by the president, in the British Museum.

       inserted  in the first volume of their Transactions, Dr.
Hutton investigates the rule directing the action and effect*
of heat and cold on the atmosphere, in order to establisli a
theory of rain on this principle, that the mixture of portions
of air saturated with water, and at differing temperature*,
will uniformly produce the condensation of a portion of
water.
    f' This rule of condensation," says        Dr. Hutton,     " may
be applied to the theory of rain, which        is the distillation  of
water first dissolved in the atmosphere,        and then condensed
from that state of solution,

  only clouds but showers will be produced, since the sudden
  formation of a mean degree of heat, in the mixture of two
 portions of different temperatures, must condense a quantity
  of vapour sufficient to form rain.
      " Without this law of condensation of evaporation nei
  ther rain nor dew could take place any where in the summer
  hemisphere, perhaps not even in tropical latitudes : there
 would be evaporation and a general tendency to saturate the
 atmosphere with water, but the mixture of different portions
 of air would only temper the saturation without producing a
 condensation of vapour in the mean degrees of heat.            At
 night, from the influence of the cold, the atmosphere
 would become gradually clouded ; this cloudiness would in
 crease to a general distillation os condensed vapour, which
 would be uniformly continued until the returning summer
 should change the state of condensation to evaporation ; and
 instead of the beautiful return of seasons, tempered with va
 rious degrees of heat and refreshing showers, six months
 rain and six months drought would follow each other in an
invariable succession."
     Such is the hypothesis which Dr. Hutton is willing we
should consider as the theory of rain, and which he proceeds
to apply to natural appearances ; seeming to experience no
great difficulty in solving by it every problem that occurs, as
 the solstitial, equinoctial, and other periodical rains, the
comparative state of different climates and of land and sea,
as to its frequency and quantity, &c.           But, if we except
ashort remark on hail and thunder storms (which seems only
to give occasion to a confession of our imperfect knowledge
of atmospherical electricity), in no instance does the doctor
avail himself of the aid of any other principle than the mix
ture of currents of air in traversing the irregular surface of
the globe, and consequent precipitation of water, to account
for the whole train of phænomena constituting the subject of
meteorology.
     The simplicity of this theory, the imposing air of a dia
gram at its introduction, the ingenious and descriptive man
ner of the application, all contribute to render it sufficiently
plausible.    It is rather extraordinary that the objections urged
                         * should have extended no further than

it appears they did.   It would however be readily granted,
I  suppose, by each of these philosophers, that hypotheses,
of whatsoever kind, ought not to be admitted into science
without the molt rigorous examination, and that doubt has
a right to keep the door shut until some passport of the de
monstrative kind is obtained either from nature or experi
ment.     A geometrical      representation of what may be is not
a sufficient foundation     whereon to assert what is a law of na
ture.   Let us therefore     examine how far this theory, which
does not appear to be        supported by any direct experiment,
 will bear the test of the excellent and decisive ones whereon
 t(he doctrine of capacities has been established         by Black,
 Crawford, and Lavoisier.
    The author first assumes, as a law of nature, the position,
"that the solution of water in air increases with the tempera
 ture (h°.at), but in an increasing ratio.     On this he grounds
 a second, the substance of which         is,
                                            that   two portions of
                                                    if
 air, saturated with water and at differing temperatures,         be
 mixed, the mean proportion will not be soluble at the mean
 temperature, and therefore        part will be precipitated.
                                     a
    The first position may be true, or     itmav not perhaps no
                                                         ;
 thing sliort of actual experiment can satisfactorily ascertain
 the actual curve of evaporation*.
    The second depends entirely on conditions which the doctor
 has taken for granted in each of the three cafes of evapora
 tion stated   byhim, and which, on the received principles of
 caloric, can belong to no one of them. These conditions
 withdrawn, the theory of rain, like its subject, falls to the
 ground, and the diagram proves as unsubstantial as the bow
 with which the sliower         decorated.
                                is           To make this appear,
it   isonly necessary  to  produce the following practical results,
 which apply equally, whether we regard caloric as matter or
 motion.
    A homogeneous substance, or two substances having equal
 capacities for caloric, being mixed in equal portions at un
 equal temperatures,      the temperature of the mixture      found
                                                                is
 to be in the arithmetical mean.
     But heterogeneous substances, and those in other respects
 homogeneous, but differing in capacity, being mixed            likein
 manner, give       atemperature    which either exceeds    or  falls
 below the arithmetical mean, and approaches towards that
 of the two substances which possessed the greater capacity.
  * Experiments decisive of this very question were made about this time,
and the results presented  to the Literary and Philosophical  Society of
Manchester    byJohn Dalton, esq.    We shall have occasion to notice his
paper further on.
                                                                         Tic

   The capacity of water (which Crawford terms the com
parative heat) being taken at 1,000, that of air proves by
his experiments to be as 1,790, and that of aqueous vapour
as  1,550, at equal weights and temperatures.
     Then if  to dry air we add successive portions of water at
increasing temperatures,      we are forming a compound (not
merely heating a homogeneous mass), the nature of which,
as in all other respects, so in that of the capacity for caloric,
must still continue approaching to that of aqueous vapour.
   Now in any two portions of this compound, formed at
different temperatures,     the capacities will differ.     It will
be less in that which was saturated at the higher tempera
ture ; and whatsoever may have been the precise rate at which
the solution advanced at increasing temperatures, the mixture
of the two portions will not produce a temperature in the
arithmetical mean, but below          as being molt influenced
                                          it,
by  the drier portion.
   Thus     the principal condition invalidated, viz. that por

tions of saturated air at differing temperatures will possess,
after mixture,     temperature
                     a            the arithmetical mean. This
                                     in
argument may appear at first sight still to favour the conclu
sion respecting the mixture in the curve m dr, since,          pre            if
cipitation take place at the mean temperature, much more
should     at
           it    lower than the mean

                                                   :       may be        it
easy to demonllratc, on the same principles as before, that
the temperature of such        compound, as

circumstance of mixture only, will in no cafe affect the
state of solution, and that neither super- nor under-saturation
will ensue therefrom.
   We will take for this purpose the curve mdr, and exa
mine the real circumstances of solution advancing with the
                                          a
temperature but in an accelerated ratio; premising that the
question  regards the effects of heat (caloric) only as the cause
both of increased temperature and increased solution, and
that, according to Crawford, equal additions of this (the
capacity of the receiving body continuing unchanged) pro
duce equal expansions        the common thermometer.

   That the solution of water in air goes on increasing with
the temperature     of the compound       true, andis       equally it   is
so that it  increases at the expense     that power which gives
                                                of
the temperature      for water held
                     ;                 air    itself in the state of

caloric, and that one part of caloric will raise its temperature
one degree in any part of the scale ; if we wish to convert this
into a unit of moist air at the fame temperature, it will not be
sufficient merely to add the proportion of water, suppose 0,001 ;
for this water, being itself a liquid base, will require nearly as
much additional caloric to constitute it gas, as the portion of
air which was necessarily excluded from the unit took away
with it. When we have added this proportion of caloric
(which would have raised the dry air many degrees in tem
perature) together with the water, we shall have a unit of sa
turated air.
    Further, if we would raise the temperature of the latter
10, 20, or 200 degrees, and still preserve the saturation, we
shall find it impossible to proceed without an expense of power
adequate to the rate of solution, besides that proportion which
is employed in raising the temperature through those succes
sive intervals of the scale which are taken as the standard of
solution.
    Now, in the case of equably advancing solution,          if,
                                                             as often

of no importance in the issue, since the temperature            still
                                                                   is    a

  the idea of some other power operating jointly with the heaty
  such as an attraction between the base of air and water, I am
  not qualified to determine; but were it so, this would in no-
 wife affect the previous reasoning, as the conclusion rests en
 tirely on the temperature, i. e. in the doctor's view, the ca
 loric present, though they are in fact two distinct considera
 tions which he has blended.
     In the concluding part of this essay, as it was originally
 written, I had discussed the subject of the solution of water
 in air, and the several modes of its precipitation, on chemical
 principles; regarding moist air as a ternary compound of
 base of air, water, and caloric, formed and subsisting by
 chemical attractions, and decomposed by the operation of
 the same.
     Having since perused the excellent work of my friend John
 Dalton *, which I have before alluded to, and having seen
 and repeated some of the principal experiments therein de
 tailed, I must acknowledge that, although I might plead the
 authority of a Kirwan       f  in support of the chemical theory of
 evaporation, I am now disposed to give up the idea of a proper
solution of water in air in toto.
     It appears to me that nothing need be more clear, simple,
 and conclusive, than the experiments and deductions by which
 the author attempts to prove that the evaporation of water
 and several other liquids is a process uniformly regulated by
 their temperature, the effect of the latter in equal surfaces
 being the fame in vacua and under the full pressure of the at
 mosphere; the presence of which has no other influence than
 by its motion to multiply the surface of the liquid and carry
 away the vapour produced ; whence the difference of quantity
 evaporated in equal times in a moving and a stagnant atmo-
 sohere.      The solvent power of air on water may also, there
 fore, be safely classed among those causes which are not need
 ful to the effect in question, and therefore not to be retained
in philosophical reasoning.

                           Juices of Plants.
  _l O    prepare these juices, they recommend to collect the
plants   when   they are in full vegetation, to clean them care
fully,   to pound them in a marble mortar, to press them in
closed in a hair bag, after having added to them a little water,
but only when they are either a little too aqueous or too mu
cilaginous.
    All the sap-vessels of the plant, or others, are broken by
the action of the pestle; all the liquids which they contained
flow off, together with the green fecula and the attenuated
remains of the vegetable.
    They recommend to purify the juices either by rest, or by
the heat of boiling water, or by means of the white of an
egg, or by making them pass through gray paper.
    The first method is fit for the juices of fruits.
    The second may be employed for all the juices of herbs
destined to make extracts.
    The third may be employed for all juices, infusions, or
 decoctions, that do not contain tannin.
    The fourth is necessary for all juices the virtues of which
 exist chiefly in the volatile principles.
    It is preferred in pharmacy for magisterial juices, whether
 they be volatile or not j the two viscous juices excepted.
                  Maceration   —Infusion — Decoclion.
     In maceration, the cold water is attracted by the. dry vege
 table substances : it introduces itself into them, swells them
 up, and renders fluid whatever is soluble.
     It has been found that maceration is sufficient to obtain
 from quassia, and even quinquina, the real active parts con
 tained in them.
     In infusion, caloric more abundant than in maceration
 renders the water more penetrating, more active, and more
  solvent ; it becomes charged with a much greater number
 of the principles of the vegetable.         The preparers of medi
  cines  make   use of it in preference  for  dry herbs and for leaves,
  which, like senna, for example, cannot bear ebullition with
  out losing their virtues.
      In decoction, the water saturated with caloric acquires a
  much greater energy : it penetrates in a more intimate man
                                                                    ner

 ner the vegetable subjected to its action 5 it forces to become
 soluble the substances which were not so at a lower tempera
 ture ; it melts and separates those which are oily or resinous j
 it dissipates those which are volatile ; and several of them it
 combines or decomposes.
    They expose to the action of boiling water those plants or
 parts of plants only which are exceedingly hard, and in which
 there exists nothing volatile; and they often subject these
substances to maceration and infusion before they expose them
 to ebullition.
    In evaporation, the water charged with the soluble prin
 ciples of the vegetables gradually abandons them to unite
¦with caloric, and to form with it a volatile fluid known under
the name of vapour : by these means, the principles before
diluted become concentrated, and assume consistence, the
state and name of extracts.
    They prescribe a gentle sire for the evaporation of the
juices, macerations, and infusions, and a stronger fire for de
coctions, taking care to choose large and shallow evaporating
vessels, and to stir the liquors to facilitate the evaporation of
the water, and to prevent the extract from being burnt.
    And to prevent that alteration of which the principles of
vegetables,     when highly diluted with water and exposed to
the heat of an evaporation too long continued, arc suscepti
 ble, they recommend to employ only the necessary quantity
of water, paying attention to the solidity of the substances
exposed to maceration, infusion, and decoction.        They take
 care also to employ for all their operations very pure water,
sensible that it is only when it is in this state that it is sit
 for boiling pulse.
    During the evaporation of several juices or decoctions, some
phænomena occurred which did not escape their notice.
    They remarked, when preparing several extracts which
they called saponaceous, that liquors became turbid; that
 their surface was covered with a pellicle which separated into
flakes, were precipitated, and formed incrustations suscepti
 ble of being burnt at the bottom of the evaporating vessels.
    It was Baume in particular who paid attention to these
 precipitates ; he fays they were saline.
    The preparers of such medicines have also found that,
 during the cooling of the decoctions of roots or barks abun
 dant in resinous matter, and during the evaporation of several
of these decoctions, precipitates more or less abundant were
formed, which, according to the opinion of Baume, were
 owing to the refiu, more or less altered, of the vegetables
employed.

   These precipitates, some of which were thought by Baumi
to be saline and others resinous, have been considered by Pel-
letier as earthy substances, and are ascribed by the modern
chemists to the union which several of the immediate prin
ciples of vegetables contained in the juices have formed with
•xygen, which makes them lose their solubility in water.
   C. Deschamps junior, apothecary at Lyons, is of opinion
that they are a mixture of lime, extractive matter, oily or re
sinous substances in some, and an astringent resinous sub
stance in others ; sometimes of a little calcareous salt, and
sometimes of a little silex or alumine.
   As the observations and experiments on which he founds
his opinion may, by laying aside what he thinks unfavoura
ble to oxygen, be exceedingly useful in the preparation      of
¦extracts, we refer to his memoir published in the Annales de
Cbim'u for the year 7 .
    It results, from the most essential facts announced in the
memoir of C. Deschamps :
    1st. That there exists, in the vegetable juices or decoctions
which he subjected to examination, a neutral salt, the base
of which has always been found to be lime, sometimes mixed
with a little silex and alumine, and of which the acid is often
different.
    ad. That this saline combination,          not very energetic of
itself, is weakened when diluted with water, and is easily de
stroyed by ebullition, like many others, when the acid in it
is not in excess, while it maintains itself, and is not altered
when the acid is superabundant in it.
   3d. That the decomposition of this salt, when it takei
place, ii only momentary, since the deposits become redissolved
towards the end of the evaporation by the fame acid which
has abandoned them ; and which then, notwithstanding the
loss it has sustained in its quantity, relumes sufficient force to
re-establish things nearly in their first state.
    Hence arises the necessity ot' not separating deposits which

tioned, we may.see how extracts must be prepared in grne-
ral : but there is one which requires peculiar processes that
must be made known.
   ist. Robs of the elder and buckthorn are made with juices
which have been extracted 24 hours before from the berries
of these two shrubs.
   During that time, these juices become charged with the
extractive colouring part lodged under the skin of the berries,
 and by these means acquire more virtue.
    2d. Extract of juniper is obtained by maceration of frefli
juniper berries which have been bruised.      They are evapo
rated     in   a gentle       heat,   after   being made to     pass   through
flannel.
     It              and aromatic : it would be acrid and re
          is saccharine
sinous,     if ebullition
                      were employed.    Baume, however, has
prescribed it ; but he made it light, and recommended not to
bruise the berries.
   3d. Extracts of cassia and tamarinds are all products of the
maceration and pulp of these fruits.
   Infusion of tamarinds, cold, is attended with the inconve
nience of suffering their essential salt to be precipitated during
the evaporation.
   4th. Extract of the corn poppy is produced by carefully
infusing the dried flowers.
   5th. That obtained from saffron is very abundant ; almost
the whole of its stamina are converted into extract; so that
it may be considered as useless to subject them to this pre
paration, which, altering their virtue a little, does not re
duce them to a less volume.
   6th. The extract of coloquintida is made with a decoction
of the pulp of that fruit freed from the feeds." To render it
sweeter, and make it less susceptible of griping the bowels,
it ought to be deprived of its resin.
   Baume caused it lo be rediflblved in cold water.          He            fil
trated the liquor, and the resin remained on the paper. This
operation he repealed three times.
   7th. Opium       brought to us from Turkey.

     The third method of correcting opium                    that recom      is
 mended             by
                   Baume for freeing the extract of coloquintida

 cold filtration, and evaporation. But as the resin of opium
is   more difficult to be removed than that of coloquintida,
 these three operations are repeated fix times successively.
     8th.      It  customary to purify

  tracts of the acacia, hypocistis, cachou, and liquorice, fold
 in the sliops. But an exact pharmacopolist will prefer pre
 paring the last-mentioned article himself from the liquorice
 of our gardens: he will treat                   infusion, and will thus

     9th.    Extract   of  senna    ought to be made from an infusion
  of the leaves strong decoction would add to the extradtive

     It   ismuch better to evaporate these juices after they have
  been purified and mixed at the end of the baking, the green
  fecula being separated.

   nth. The dry extracts of La Garaye are all made by fimpTe
maceration evaporated in a balneum mariæ, or in a stove, on
flat dishes ; they form very thin scales.
   La Garaye filtered his liquors a second time when they
were half evaporated ; but this second filtration is useless if
there exists no deposit, and it is hurtful if there be one ; be
cause in separating          instead of suffering
                            it,                      to be redissolved,
                                                    it
the extract acquires the property of attracting moisture more
strongly.
   The process employed            by
                                    La Garaye for preparing his ex
tracts  alters as little  as  possible the substances they contain.
     2th. Extracts made from such fresh -gathered roots as
     1
contain mucous bodies               states of solution and of insolu
                                   in
bility,  that  is to   fay, mucilage, properly called starch, also
have need, as already said, of a preliminary preparation to
make them lose the latter substance, capable of becoming
mouldy when         by the aid of warm water          has assumed the
                                                     it
state  of jelly.
     But this starch does not hurt extracts prepared with infn-
flons or decoctions of the fame roots dried, because the mu
cilage of the roots    destroyed or modified
                         is                           by
                                                    the desiccation.
    13th.  Several pharmacopolists    having  observed    this change
which desiccation produces in the state of the mucous part
of plants, have thought that          would be of advantage to
                                         it
prepare extracts from dried plants, especially in regard to
plants highly mucilaginous, such as burrage.
    Experience has taught them that extracts more abundant,
and which keep longer without alteration, may be obtained
 by  this method.
    Is the extractive principle increased          by
                                                 desiccation at the
expense of the mucilage, or does the mucilage                   by
                                                             drying in
the plants assume      state which approaches very near to that
                         a
of extractive matter?
    14th. There are some extracts in which            is- necessary to

          it                                   The result of these
two solutions, intimately mixed and properly concentrated,

    15th. Sometimes wine          employed in order to have only

tained.
    Wine, indeed, besides its not dissolving            well the two

also an acid, which must necessarilv have a greater or less ac
tion on the extractive matter of the vegetables, change its
nature, and increase in the extracts the tendency they have
 to deliquescence.
    r6th. Vinegar extracts very badly the principles of vege
tables; it generally alters them, or is altered by them.
    It may however be (till employed as a solvent in regard to
squills, garlic, resinous gums, and as a vehicle of the odours
and colours of some flowers.
    17th. Extracts by highly rectified alcohol are resins ; by
weak alcohol they are relins mixed with gummy or extractive
substances.
   Vegetable substances subjected to the action of alcohol are
dry, and much divided: this action is atlisted by a degree of
heat more or less considerable.   The vessel in which the ope
ration is performed must be sufficiently large to allow the
vapours to circulate.
     When the solution has been made and filtered, water is
poured  over        it,
                 and the alcohol abandons the resin to unite
with the water; or          subjected to distillation, and the
                                  it

     It       from these general considerations     on vegeta
ble extracts, that the pharmacopolist,        he proceeds me
                                                    if

healing art with medicines containing the whole of the im

of producing the effects which essentially belong to them.

on the conversion          of forged iron into cast steel, which  were
attended with full success.
    Chemists who have seen this furnace seemed desirous of
being better acquainted with the construction of it : the;
council even transmitted drawings of it to several persons ;
and what has hitherto prevented a description of it from,
being given was a desire to ascertain its power by longer ule.
    I long ago conceived the idea of a filling furnace, in which
the wind was distributed      in three tuyeres placed in its cir
cumference, and at equal distances from each other ; but I
had no opportunity of realizing this idea till I became at
tached to the council of mines.
    Nearly seven years ago a plan was in agitation for con
structing in the laboratory of the school a fusing furnace,
capable of producing a very great degree of heat, -in order to
operate with facility and speed on larger quantities of mineral,
and consequently to obtain more precision in the trials which
niight be made than had been obtained by the small furnaces
before employed for docimastic experiments.
    I proposed my ideas: they were approved by the council
of mines ; and I was ordered to cause the furnace I am
about to describe to be constructed.       The principal difference
between it and thole before used for the same purpose                                      is,
that in the present one the wind         introduced through three

about six feet distant. The extremities of these pipes are
fitted into three tuyeres of forged iron, fixed at equal distances
around the circumference of the furnace          these three pipes:
are more or less curved or bent, to convey the wind into the
furnace     by
             the three apertures made for that purpose.
    About six inches below the box      adjusted, on each of the
                                                       is

    These cocks are well fixed to the tubes, and kept in their
place     bytwo clips of iron suited to the diameters of the
tubes, and forming       kind of three collars, which
                            a                               means                 by

support    the box and       are fixed to          it       by screws.           The      box   is
kept on the crutches     two straps, which embrace
                                by                    at each                    it

   To give the proper strength to this furnace, solid square               a

kept at about nine inches, the height of the bricks : these
bars are pierced with holes towards the end riveted on the
circles, and placed at equal distances on their circumference.
One of the extremes of each of these three bars is left of a
sufficient length to pass beyond the lower circle about an
inch, in order to make them enter into three holes formed in
the brick-work which forms the bottom of the furnace, and
by these means to prevent the furnace from becoming de
ranged.
    This kind of iron frame was filled with bricks similar to
those employed for the bottom of the furnace : they were
rubbed one on the other to smooth them, and the comers
were a little rounded; so that, being plated upright with their
broad sides applied to the iron hoops, the narrow fide stood
inwards.     By these means all these bricks were adjusted in
such a manner as to touch each other by their broadest faces,
and to form the fides of the furnace, the thickness of which
was equal to the breadth of the bricks, and its depth to their
length. Three apertures were reserved for the tuyeres which,
terminate the three tubes that convey the wind, by cutting
from as many bricks a portion equal to the thickness of a
brick.
    These bricks thus adjusted were taken from the iron frame,
 and then replaced, putting between them a cement to con
nect them firmly and to fill up the Joints. The dust pro
duced by cutting the bricks was reserved for this purpose ;
 and I desired the workman to mix with it a small quantity of
 clay diluted in a great deal of water, in order to make a puddle
 for daubing over the bricks, and in particular to put between
 them no more than was necessary for filling the joints and
 the small space left between their faces in consequence of
 any inequality left in dressing them.
     The furnace thus constructed was then placed on its base,
 a stratum of the same mortar employed for filling up the
joinings of the bricks being first interposed. The extremities
 of the three iron bars projecting beyond the lower circle were
   laced in the holes left in the base to receive them.      The
 C ody of the furnace encircled With iron, both by its weight
 and the gentle blows given to the iron hoops above the bars
 which connected them, expelled the excess of the mortar, and
 caused a part of it to enter and unite with that which filled
 up the joints of the brick-work of the circumference, which
 rendered it immoveable.
     The bellows is secured as usual by crutches of iron and
supporters fixed in the wall and to the floor: the handle is
 disposed in such a manner, that the rope which makes it act
                                                             may

           Description of a Tbree-blajl Fusing Furnace.        7j
may be pulled by the same person who manages the fire of
the furnace, which in certain cafes is necessary.
    The tuveres of forged iron which receive the ends of the
copper tubes are secured in their proper apertures in the cir
cumference of the furnace by pieces of brick and mortar
similar to that employed for tilling up the joints; and the
ends of the copper pipes introduced into these tuyeres are
luted with the fame mortar, a little thickened with brick-dust.
    The aperture of these tuyeres towards the interior of the
furnace is only nine lines in diameter; on which account, as
the volume of air furnished by the bellows cannot pals so
quick as it is produced, it becomes condensed in the box
placed above the cocks. By these means a very uniform blast
is obtained, which can also be regulated by opening more or
fewer of the cocks.
    During more than fix years, since this furnace was con
 structed,   it has suffered no derangement: it is not even
 cracked. It is however worn in the inside by the violence of
 the heat it has experienced, which has increased its diameter
about two inches.       The parts round the three tuyeres have
 also got hollowed, so that it has need of being repaired.      It
 is intended to make it deeper, and to have a kind of move-
 able muffs or linings made of fire-clay, in order that its dia
 meter may be reduced at pleasure : it is meant also to con
 struct it in such a manner, as to deposit the rest or support for
 the crucible, not on the bottom of the furnace, but on bars
 of forged iron placed at the distance of some inches from that
 bottom, so as to leave below them a vacuity in which the
 blast of the bellows may be diffused, and from which it may
 rise, pasting between the bars to traverse the mass of charcoal
 which surrounds the crucible.      The blast will then produce a
 more uniform sire, and the flame can no longer be directed
 against the fides of the crucibles; so that the risk of their
 breaking by sudden inequalities jh the heat will be much less.
     This alteration is going to be immediately carried into ex
 ecution, and the method proposed for doing it is as follows :
     A round frame will be made of forged iron, in which,
 bricks will be placed in the fame manner as above described.
 In the lower part of the furnace an aperture will be reserved
 for raking out the ashes, which will be closed by means of
  a door of baked earth carefully luted with clay. Some inches
  above the bottom of the furnace will be placed a grate of
  forged iron, and between this grate and the bottom of the
 furnace the tuyeres will terminate, and the blast be intro
  duced. Muffs or linings of very refractory earth will then
                                                                be

 be introduced, so as to descend to this grale.   There will be
 two of them, one within the other, and both within the
body of the furnace. At the lower part these muffs will be
furnished with a rim, projecting outward so as to leave be
tween the body of the furnace anu the muffs a vacuity, which
will be luted at the bottom with clay, and which will be
filled with pounded glass, or any other substance a bad con
ductor of heat.
    The interior muff, or both of them, may be removed at
pleasure to obtain a furnace of greater or less capacity accord
ing to the operations to be performed. It is proposed to make
the muffs wider at the top than at the bottom.

        The advantage arising in large founderies from the appli

    but I do not believe that such an arrangement was ever
    adopted in small furnaces.
        At Treibach, in Carinthia, C. Le Fcbre, and Hassenfratz
    member of the council and inspector of mines, saw, about
     twenty years ago, a large furnace with two tuyeres; drawings
     of which they brought to France, and which they repre
     sented in the third plate of     I' Art"de fabriquer les Canons, by
     Monge     : two  pairs  of bellows  supply wind through two oppo
     site tuyeres,   and  since  that arrangement the daily product of
      metal has been double.

      Laumont,        Associate*.
   OOME       time ago, having thrown into the fire a solution of
  a mixture     of sulphate of copper and muriate of ammonia,
  where it produced very agreeable colours, some of it fell upon
  a piece of paper placed in the chimney, which became of
  a bright yellow colour.        Having taken the paper from the
  chimney, I was much astonished, some moments after, to
  find that it was no longer coloured : on again exposing it to
  heat the colour reappeared, and disappeared in like manner
  on cooling.
                                                          I
      I tried lately to repeat this experiment ; and obtained
  from these two salts, mixed nearly in equal parts, a solution
 of a bright yellow colour when warm, and of a beautiful
 emerald green when cold, which at first gave crystals in
 oblique prisms with rhomboidal bases, and then blue crystals
 in flat octaedra.
     This liquor and the solution of the crystals gave a yellow
 ink, which appeared yellow with heat, and disappeared with
 cold, but still better with moisture.
     I observed that these solutions are indebted for this pro
perty only to the muriate of copper, which when employed
alone does not produce the fame effect.
     On comparing this ink with that given by the muriate of
cobalt, known under the name of the sympathetic ink of
Hellot, it is seen that all these kinds of ink are indebted for
the property which they have of disappearing, only to metallic
muriates, which powerfully attract the moisture of surround
ing bodies.
     The yellow ink    produced by the muriate of copper and the
solutions    which   contain it (very different from those which,
being at first invisible, remain fixed after they have appeared)
gives by its colour a variety very distinct from that of Hellot,
which is of a sea green : with the latter it forms varied tints
of an emerald green.

XIV. AJbort View of the Craniognomlc Syjlem of Dr. Ga ll,
    of Vienna. By L. Bojanus, M.D. Member of the Me
    dical Societies    of Jena and Paris, and of            the Society   of tbt
     Observers    of  Man    *.
jsxT all periods, a desire to find in the exterior of man cer
tain marks indicative of his interior faculties, his passions,
his morals, &c, has induced the learned to establish systems
of physiognomy more or less satisfactory. The most striking
of these systems are those of Baptista Porta and Lavater, the
theory of the facial angle, and the system of Dr. Gall.
     In regard to the first, who employed himself in comparing
 the contours of the human figure with those of beasts, ob
servers have determined its value, and consider his principles
 as the fruit of a disordered imagination, as too bold, too little
 founded on rational observation, and absolutely uncertain in
its application.
     The system of Lavater has had more success ; but while we
 revere the genius of that celebrated man, who was truly a great
 observer, we cannot help acknowledging the instability of the
 basis on which all the opinions he advances rest ; and the
 mind is not satisfied with truths which can be appreciated
 only by an imagination equally exalted, and a touch so deli
 cate as that of the author.
     The theory of the facial angle, which embraces a wider
 field than the system of Lavater, leaves us in uncertainty re
 specting the detail of the faculties, and gives us only general
 points of view ; but it presents us witn this truth, of the
 greatest importance — that the facial angle increases in size in
  proportion to the faculties of animals : and in this it coincides

  Bojanus in a note fays :

  tended to prove the truth of Dr. Gall's system, it can lead to no decisive
  opinion on this system, which will be established by its author on solid
  reasoning and convincing testimony.       It is necessary also (says he) to ob
  serve, that the passages marked with inverted commas do not rest on the
  authority of Du Gall."

in an evident manner with the general               results   of the   system
of Dr. Gall.
    Without entering into         an exact detail of the laborious
route which this learned philosopher pursued, to be enabled
to establish a certain basis in a science hitherto hypothetical,
we (hall examine briefly his fundamental principles.
I.   The Brain is the material Organ of the internal Faculties.
    Far from attempting to decide the metaphysical questions
on the nature of the soul, or what may be supposed as the
occult cause of the internal faculties, we are, however, forced
to admit a material organ for their action.
    But, as it is observed that these faculties are found only
where the brain exists ; that they are lost with it ; that disease
and læsion of the brain have a sensible influence on their de
gree and their action; that the volume of the brain increases
in direct proportion to the faculties of animals ; it is not ven
turing too far to consider the brain as the material and inter
mediate organ.
    [It might be here objected, that in several cases individuals
have lost a considerable portion of the substance of the brain
without the faculties being sensibly diminished ; but it is to
be observed that the greater part of the cerebral organs exist
 double, and that the observations mentioned are not exact.]
 S. The Brain contains different         Organs independent           on each
                   other for the different   Faculties *.
    The internal faculties do not always exist in the fame pro
 portion to each other. There are some men who have a great
 deal of genius without having a memory, who have courage
 without circumspection, and who possess a metaphysical spirit
 without being good observers.
    Besides, the phænomena of dreaming, of somnambulism,
 of delirium, &c. prove to us that the internal faculties do not
 always act together ; that there is often a very great activity
 of one, while the rest are not sensible.
    Thus in old age, and sometimes in disease, such, for ex
 ample, as madness, several faculties are lost, while others
 subsist : besides, a continued employment of the fame faculty
 sensibly diministies its energy : if we employ another, we
 find it has all the force of which it is susceptible; and if we
 return to the former faculty, it is observed that it has resumed
    • This idea of independence ought not to destroy that principle of ani
 mal organism, that all the parts are in a reciprocal ratio : it ought to mark.
 only, that the action of one organ does not absolutely imply the same de
 gree
 6     in another.
                                                                            ita

its usual vigour.  It is thus that, when fatigued with reading
an abstract philosophical wTjrk, we proceed with pleasure to
a poetical one, and then resume with the fame attention our
former occupation.
    All these phænomena prove that the faculties are distinct
and independent of each other, and we are inclined to believe
that the cafe is the fame with their material organs.
     [We do not entirely agree with this idea of Dr. Gall, and
 we believe, on the contrary, that the separation of the ma
 terial organs ought to be considered as the cause of the di
stinction of the internal faculties.  It appears, to us at least,
 that by supposing the faculties themselves as originally sepa
 rated we cannot save ourselves from falling into materialism,
 which exists when the mind is no longer considered as unity.]
3. The Expansion of the Organs contained in the Cranium is
   in the diretl Ratio of the Force of their corresponding Fa
  culties.
   This principle, dictated by analogy, rests on this axiom,
that throughout all nature the faculties are always found to
be proportioned to their relative organs ; and the truth of it
is proved in a special manner by the particular observation*
of Dr. Gall.
   It is however  to be remarked, that exercise has a great in
fluence on the force of the faculties, and that an organ mo
derately expanded, but often exercised, can give a faculty su
perior to that which accompanies a very extensive organ
never put in action ; as we fee that a man of a weak con
formation acquires, by continued exercise, strength superior
to another of a more athletic structure.
    [We must here mention an opinion which seems to result
immediately from this principle, and which, however, is false :
it is, that the volume of the brain, in general,   in the direct
                                                  is
ratio of the energy of its faculties.   Observation has proved
to Dr. Gall, that we cannot judge of the strength of the facul
ties but     bythe development of the separate organs which
form distinct eminences in the cranium and that cranium
                                          ;            a
perfectly round, of whatever size   itmay be,   isnever   proof
                                                           a
of many or of great faculties.]
  I  do not recollect to have heard the reason assigned     by
                                                            Dr.
 Gall, but, in my opinion, these brains may be considered as
 in state analogous to obesity and as we do not judge of the
   a                            ;
 muscular force of man or an animal
                    a                     bythe volume of their
 members, but      by the development of the muscles in parti-
 <U+2666>ular,  I think we ought, in like manner, to judge of the
         5                                                 strength*

  io            Short Vietv of the Craniognomic System
  strength   of  the faculties by the development           of  the relative
  organs.
      In the last place, the 4th principle, the most important
  for practice in regard to the system of Dr. Gall, is :
      We may judge of these different organs and of their facul
  ties by the exterior form of the cranium.
      The truth of this principle is founded upon another, viz.
  that the conformation of the cranium depends on that of the
  brain ; a truth generally acknowledged, and proved by the
  anterior part of the brain, by the impressions in the anterior
 part of the cranium, and by other facts.
      [There are skulls , it is true, in which an external protuberance
 of the bone corresponds to an interior one ; and this irregu
 larity, which is found sometimes as a disease, and most com
 monly at an advanced age, when the cerebral organs do not
 oppose the same resistance to the cranium, renders the prac
 tice of Dr. Gall's system, in some measure, uncertain.]
      Guided by these principles, Dr. Gall examines the nature
 of the skull, compares the crania of animals and those of men
 analogous and different in faculties.             His researches have
 proved   to him,    in   a   manner    almost  incontestable,    not only
 the above truths, but that the faculties of animals are ana-
 logous to those of man ; that what we call instinct in ani
 mals is found also in the latter, such as attachment, cunning,
 circumspection, courage, &c; that the quantity of the or
 gans fixes the difference of the genus 01 animals, their re
 ciprocal proportion that of individuals; that the disposition
 originally given to each faculty by nature may be called forth
 bv exercise and favourable circumstances, and sometimes by
 disease, but that it never can be created in the case where it
 has not been given by nature*; that the accumulation of
 the organs takes place in a constant manner from the hind
 part forwards, from the bottom to the top, in such a manner,
 that animals in proportion as they approach man in the quan
tity of their faculties have the superior and anterior part of the
brain more expanded ; and, in the last place, that in the most
 perfect animal, man, there are organs in the anterior and
superior parts of the frontal bone, and of the parietals, destined
for faculties which belong to them exclusively.               " It is under
 the latter point of view that the discoveries of Dr. Gall agree
perfectly with the theory of the facial angle, which seems
still further to establish the truth of them."

Wiefation of the different organs which he found, it is diffi
cult to give an exact and satisfactory description of them,
when illustrated with the number of facts and examples
which he employs to prove, in an evident manner, what he
advances; I shall however attempt the enumeration, being
persuaded that it will contain several illustrations of the au
thor's manner of considering the subject, and give a true
idea of the method to be pursued to attain to his results *.
                  I.  Organ of the Tenacity of Use.
    The first organ which the author thinks he has found is
that of the tenacity of life (tenacitas vitœ) : he considers the
medulla oblongata as the feat of it ; and as the circum
ference of the large occipital foramen is in the direct ratio of
the extent of the medulla oblongata, he employs the size of
this hole to judge of the intensity of the life of an animal.
    The observations which serve to support this opinion are,
that this hole is generally larger in the crania of women
than those of men ; that it is constantly large in the cat, the
otter, the beaver, the badger, &c, animals well known to
 have a very tenacious life.         Besides, there are no speedier
means of killing an animal than to cut the medulla ob
 longata.
            a. Organ of the InJlinU of Self-preservation.
    A little further forward in the medulla oblongata, at the
 place where it leaves the brain, the author places the organ
 of the love of life, or of the injlincl ofself-preservation.
    As animals furnish no instances of suicide, it was only
 from the human race he could procure examples in favour
 of this position ; and several cases of suicide, in which this
 part of the brain was diseased, determined him to consider it
 as the organ of that faculty : he does not, however, consider
 it as an absolute truth; he waits for further examples to
 serve as proofs.
               3. Organ  for  the Choice   of Nourishment.
    The organs for    the choice  of nourishment are found, accord
 ing   to the author, in the quadrigemini tubercles ; the ante
 rior of which are larger in carnivorous animals, the posterior
 more expanded in graminivorous, and which in omnivorous
 are   of equal size.
             4. Cerelral Organs of the external Senses.
    The middle part of the base of the brain is destined to the

distributed to the organs of these senses proceed.
             5. The Organ of Inflinil and Copulation,
     The organ of infincl and copulation is situated at the base
of the occipital bone, behind the medulla oblongata and the
large occipital foramen.
     This organ never expands but at the age of puberty, and
its increase has a great influence on the form of the nape of
the neck, because to this part of the cranium its muscles are
affixed.
     In animals castrated before the age of puberty, the expan
sion of this organ does not take place.      It is certain that the
bull has the chest much broader than the ox, and that
" horses subjected to castration before their chest is full have
that part always slender."
     In the ape, the hare, and cock, this organ is very appa
rent ; and in pigeons and sparrows the occipital forms a par
ticular bag, which seems to bean appendage, of the head;
and it is well known that these animals are exceedingly ar
dent in copulation.          The fame disposition is sometimes
found in the cranium of man; and Dr, Gall has in his col
lection the skulls of several fools, who were distinguished by
their lasciviousness,      and whose occipital bone presents an
enormous projection.
    6. Organ of    the reciprocal Love of Parents and Children.
     The organ of the reciprocal love of parents and children
ocenpies the whole posterior and superior part of the occipi
 tal: by its position it is intimately connected with the pre
 ceding organ, the action of which must necessarily have an
 influence upon it.         " Sometimes its excessive expansion
 contributes to produce that prolongation of the occipital in
 the form of a bag, mentioned in the- preceding article."
     This organ in general is more striking in women than in
 men, and throughout all nature more so in the female than
 in the male sex : it is very apparent, in particular, among
  apes, whose love for their young is so well known that it has
  become proverbial.
      " In general, all animals which show a great deal of at
  tachment to their young are provided with it; and it appears
  to us that pigeens, the male and female of which both sit on
  the eggs, and which feed their young by a sort of rumina
  tion, may be given as an example."
      The cuckow, which never rears its young, is almost en
  tirely destitute of this organ.

    At the posterior and middle part of the parietals, and the
lateral part of the occipital, is the organ of attachment or
Friendship.
    "   Its position brings it into intimate connection with the
two preceding organs, and it appears that these organs have
an action together, especially in animals destined to live in
society."
    Dogs (how the most surprising marks of attachment ; and
the instances are furnished chiefly by the barbets, bassets,
and house-dogs.           These species, therefore, are distinguished
by a large head, on which is found the expansion of this or-
tean behind and above the zvgomatic apophysis.                The gre-
hound, which is the least susceptible of attachment, has the
head narrower behind, and in general is destitute of this
organ.
                            8. Organ of Courage.
    It   is the posterior and inferior angle of the parietal that
corresponds         to the angle of courage.      It contributes to en
large    the   size  of the  head, and  to separate the ears from each
 other.      Its proximity to the three preceding organs explains
to us the fury of animals in rutting-time, and the excess of
 courage in those which have young, or which protect the
 female and the individuals of their society.
     It is Very striking in the hyæna, the lion, the wolf, some
species of dogs, and particularly in the wild boar, the teme
 rity of which is well known.
    On the other hand, the ass, the gre-houud, the sheep, and
 the hare, which are distinguished by their timidity, are en
 tirely destitute of this organ : their head is straight posteriorly,
and their ears are very near to each other.
    A very surprising phænomenon seems to support the opi
 nion of Dr. Gall on the seat of this organ : it is a certain in
 voluntary motion of man when he loses courage.                     He
 scratches behind his ear«j as if desirous to excite the action of
 the organ which gives him that faculty.
     [We have remarked a movement in cats which appears to
 have some resemblance to the above, and which relates to the
 organ of attachment.           When fawning on man, they always
 present the posterior part ot the head to rub it against him.]
                  Q.   Organ  of the lnflintl to assassinate.
    Before the organ of courage, towards the middle of the la
 teral part    of the parietals, resides the organ of the instinct to

                               10.   Unknown Organs.
  Two organs which correspond to the temporal bone are as
yet unknown in regard to their functions.
                    1 1. Organ of Cunning.
  The organ of cunning occupies the anterior                                and inferior
part of the parietals: it appears in all animals                         distinguished
by that faculty           ;   such as the fox, polecat,              domestic cat, the
diver*, and is in intimate connection with the organ of theft,
which constitutes a prolongation of it towards the orbit, and
which is found in the cat, some dogs, and the magpie.
   It    perhaps, to the development of this organ that we
           is,
ought to ascribe the great width in the heads of the Cal-
nioucs, among whom       propensity to thieving
                                     a                                      is   a   national
characteristic.

    II.   The Class of     tbe Belles Lettres has again proposed the
question respecting       the Goths and Gothicism, with the follow
 ing variations and definitions, and offers a double prize.
    ist. Did the northern tribes, the Goths, Vandals, Suevi,
Longobardi, Franks, Burgundians, Anglo-Saxons, &c., who
divided the western pofleflions among them, bring with them
from their own country any thing peculiar in their aris and
sciences?       or, Cannot it -be rather proved that every kind of
mental culture which these people acquired was obtained
from their intercourse with the old inhabitants of the Roman
empire, and from their being mixed with them by their
conquests     ?
    ad. Ought we therefore to ascribe to these people a peculiar
style in their literature and arts? or, Are the specimens of
these arts which occur in the middle ages only modifications
of the antient Greek style, produced after the decline of the
Roman empire by the new political, religious, and moral situ
ation of these people ?
   3d. And, ir the latter be the case, what are the distinguish
ing marks of the productions of the middle ages in literature
and the fine arts? What is the proper order in which they
follow each other ? What influence had the cultivation of
the fine arts among the Arabs on those of the western part
of Europe ? When and through what channels was this in
fluence perceptible, and by what signs was it distinguished?
   Papers on this subject will be received till the 1st of May
 1804.
    Us. The following is       the question proposed by the Physical
Class   : — 'Has electricity   any influence on matters in a state of
fermentation?          Does it contribute to, or impede, fermenta
tion ? Does it produce any change in the products of fer
mentation ? What advantage can be derived from calling
forth this matter in order to improve the art of preparing
wine, beer, vinegar, and brandy ?
    Papers on this subject will be received till the ist of May
*8o3'
    IV. The      following is the question proposed by the Philo-
sophical    Class   : —Is the moral worth of an action to be taken
into consideration in the application of a criminal law ? And
if this be the cafe, how far can it be done ?
    Papers on this subject will be received till the 1st of May

      The question proposed last year, which has not yet been,
  answered, is again put by the Academy as
                               A  Prize  Que/lion :
      What useful application can be made in chemistry of the
   temperature below zero of Reaumur's thermometer ; and
   how far is it possible, by artificial means, to lower the tem
   perature   ?
      The prize for the best answer is thirty          ducats, and papers
   will be received till the end of July j 803.
                   FRENCH NATIONAL INSTITUTE.
                                Prize Questions.
      The Class of     the  Moral    and Political Sciences has proposed
   the following question        as the subject  of a prize :
       To determine how the faculty of thinking ought to be de
   composed, and what are its elementary faculties ?
       The prize will be a gold medal of the weight of five hecto
   grammes (about 70I. sterling), and will be decreed in the
   public sitting of Germinal, year 12 of the republic.            Papers
   will be received only to the 15th of Nivose the same year.
       The Class of the Moral and Political Sciences proposed in
   the year 9, as the subject for a prize in geography, the fol
   lowing question      :
       To compare      the geographical      knowledge of Ptolemy re
   specting     the  interior   of  Africa  with    that which has been
   transmitted to us by later geographers and historians, except
   in regard to Egypt and the coasts of Barbary frorn Tunis to
   Morocco ?
       As the     papers transmitted to the class did not answer the
    conditions, the class proposes the fame question as the subject
   of a prize for the year II.
       The prize will be a gold medal pf the same value as the
    former, and will be adjudged in the public sitting of Meffidor,
    year 1 2.     The period for receiving papers the fame as above.
       In the fitting of Germinal 15, year 8, the Class of the
    Mathematical and Philosophical Sciences proposed as the
    subject of a prize the following question :
       To determine, by anatomical and chemical observations
    and experiments, what are the phaenoniena of the torpor
    which certain animals, such as the marmot, dormouse, &cj,
    experience during winter in regard to the circulation of the
   blood, respiration, and irritability ; to determine what are the,
    causes of this lleep, and why peculiar to these animals.
                                                                     Th^

                           French National Institute.               8?
     The   class was of opinion that neither of the two memoirs
 transmitted to it contained a sufficient illustration of the sub
ject to be entitled to the prize, but that the observations in
 them were sufficiently interesting to deserve honourable men
 tion.    The author of the memoir No. 1, with the motto
 Incerta fades inter vitam et mortem, does not explain the
 necessary distinctions between the ways in which the different
 classes of animals spend the winter, and does not give suffi
 cient details in regard to their peculiar habits and the differ
 ences in their manner of life.            He speaks only of some of
 the mammalia; but he gives anatomical details respecting
 the diaphragmatic nerves, and those known under the name
 of nerves of the eighth pair, as well as the thymic gland, and
 the muscles which serve to determine the form which the
 animal assumes during its torpor.             He gives also some cu
 rious observations on the degree of temperature into which
 the animal enters when in that state : it was chiefly on the
 mus avell&narius ; the bat, vejpertilio murinus ; the hedge
 hog, ennaceus europeeus ; and the marmot, arclomys jnarmotta,
  that these observations were made.
      Oue-half of the memoir No. 2, having the motto Quid
  mirum   Ji  non ajeendunt in al turn ardud aggreffi? is devoted
  to general observations on life and death, and on the different
  modifications of life. Without considering these preliminary-
  observations    foreign to the object which the author proposes,
  in our opinion he has given them too much extent. He then>
  makes a distinction between animals which pass the winter in
  a state of torpor.       He separates those whose torpor is properly
  a deep and prolonged steep, which he calls vita soporoja,
  from those whose torpor is a real suspension of the vital func
  tions, which he calls vita interrupta.           Among the former
   he examines the bear, urfus aritos; the hedge-hog, the bat,
  the marmot, the dormouse, myoxus glis Schreber. ; the wood-
   rat or muscardin, myoxus mujcardnius Scbreber. ; and the
  hamster, mus cricetus Linn,           lie enlarges a great deaf on
  their habits, their kind of life, and the manner in which
   they pass their state of torpor; but gives few details in regard
  to their anatomy.         He however observes, as the author of
  the former,    the  size  of the diaphragmatic nerves and the eight
  trifplanchnic pair, particularly in bats, but does not speak of
  the state of the thymus.           Among animals of the second- he
  distinguishes    those   which  are provided with organs of circu
  lation, as the amphibia, and those which have no apparent
   organs of that kind, as is the cafe with insects; but of the
   amphibia he examines only frogs, ami gives no details re
   specting th? torpor of insects.         His observations on the frog
                                     F4                             are

are very extensive : he supports them by very curious observa-*
tions on the respiration of that animal ; the structure of the
organs which serve for that purpose ; the properties he ascribes
to the skin of these animals ; the causes which make them
move during the time of their perfect life, and those which
preserve them during their state of torpor.
   We invite the authors to give more extent to those parts
of their labour on which they have bellowed the least care:
the talents they have displayed in their memoirs do not permit
us to doubt that they will fully accomplish their object.
    The class again proposes the fame subject.   The prize will
be doubled, and will consist of two kilogrammes of gold (about
280I. sterling). The memoirs must be transmitted to the
secretary of the Institute before the 15th of Mesfidor, year 12.
The determination of the class will be publistied in the public
fitting of Vendemiaire, year 13.
                    GALVANIC              SOCIETY,     PARIS.
   The sitting of the Galvanic Society at the Oratoire, on the
14th of October, was remarkable both on account of the
presence of the learned men and distinguished philosophers
who compose        and of the nature of the experiments made
                    it,
on cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals.
   C. Aldini conducted these experiments with          great deal       a
of method. The principal ones were as follow                        :
     ft. Several frogs recently skinned exhibited in succession
     1
the phænomenon of          very sensible contraction without the
                                 a
interposition of any metallic substance, and       the mere conby
tact of the nerves of each with the muscles.
   2d. The animal arc was several times obtained, and ren
dered    sensible     by   the   same dispositions        as   in   the preceding
experiment.
                                  simultaneous, muscular con
   3d. The phænomenon of
traction, in three frogs recently prepared, and placed at the
side of each other in the fame direction, was produced at first
by  the aid of silver alone.   But C. Aldini, being desirous to,
prove   that the  fluid  which  acted on these animals was not
metallic electricity, changed the position of the intermediate
frog      placing the superior extremity of the trunk of the
         by
latter parallel to the inferior extremities of the other two.
A contraction being then observed in the first and last with
out producing any effect on that placed in the middle, C. Al
dini concluded, that, as the fluid did not pursue the shortest
way of communication,        could not be the electric fluid of
                                     it

    Tn another series of experiments the fame philosopher ex
hibited the phænomena of the greatest excitability resulting
from the application of the Galvanic conductor. 1st, Towards
the medulla oblongata of the head of a warm-blooded animal
recently separated from the trunk.            2d, On the trunk itself.
3d,    On  the  head   and  trunk;  at the   same  time making the
anus on the one hand, and the ear on the other, communi
cate with the Galvanic battery.            A small quantity of blood
scattered over the table contributed, no doubt, to the energy
of this simultaneous contraction of the two parts placed at a
remarkable distance from each other. 4th, On a portion of
the muscles detached from the body of the fame animal.
    5th. The crural nerve of a frog, brought into contact with
one of the muscles of the warm-hlooded animal, exhibited
evident signs of contraction.
    6th. The heart of the fame warm-blooded animal, placed
in    a vessel  and   subjected to the impression of the galvanic
battery, gave     no  signs of excitability.   This, indeed, is one of
those organs which are soonest decomposed after the death of
the individual.
    The members of the society paid the utmost attention to
all these experiments; and the president, C. Nauche, congra
 tulated in their name C. Aldini on the manner in which he
 had conducted them, and the zeal he had shown to support,
 by new facts, the theory of his illustrious uncle Galvani.
     From these facts it seems to result, 1st, That the animal
 fluid supplies the place in analogous experiments of the elec
 tric fluid propagated by metals.          2d, That this animal fluid
 has no need of any other conductor than the organized parts.
 3d, That the nerves and the muscles are the surest conductor*
 of this fluid ; and, consequently, that experiments tried either
 on the nervous plexus or the origin of the nerves must pre
 sent the most striking and decisive effects.           4th, That the
 different metals, in whatever manner applied, in cafes ana
 logous to those in question, perform no other functions than
 that of favouring, more or less, the propagation of this uni
 versal fluid, which penetrates easily, and in preference to all
 others, the nervous and muscular parts of organized bodies.

     The Galvanic Committee of this Academy, consisting of

     C. Giuliq will     soon present to the academy     two reports on
                                                                   thii

 yO                Academy      of Sciences, Turin.   ¦
 this subject.   In  the first,  after recurring to the experiments
 which he made in 1792,         1793, and 1794, on several plants,
 in order to show how far       they were sensible to the Galvanic
 influence by the simple medium of arming and of metallic
 arcs, he gives an account of new experiments made lately,
 in conjunction with Vassalli-Eandi, on the different species
 of sensitive plants, such as the mimosa pudica, the mimosa
sensitiva, the mimosa asperata, and the cajjia sensitwa, which
 prove that the muscles of their leaves are sensible to the in
 fluence of the Galvanic         agent  called  forth by the Voltaic
 pile.
     In the second he gives an account of the results obtained
 by experiments made on a man decapitated, September 1 8th,
 in one of the halls of the national college.       The principal of
 these results were as follow:
      ist. By making one extremity of the pile communicate
 with the interior of one ear moistened with a solution of mu
 riate of ammonia, and the other extremity of the pile with
 the other ear, very strong contractiops were produced in the
 muscles of the face : but the contractions of the temporal
 muscles, the pterygoid, and masseter, were particularly strik
 ing, for thev elevated and agitated the lower jaw with so
 much force, that the gnasliing of the teeth was distinctly
 heard at the distance of several feet,
     2d. By establishing a communication between the spinal
 marrow and the large nervi sympathetici and vagi armed,
 and between different regions of the breast moistened with the
 fame solution, and the other extremity of the pile— before
 the' cavities were opened very strong tetanic shocks were ob
 tained throughout the whole body j such violent palpitations
 of the heart, that the hand applied on the region of the fifth
 and sixth ribs was strongly struck by them ; inspirations and
 expirations, with a hissing noise which accompanied the en-«
 trance and escape of the air.
     3d. After opening the breast the palpitations of the heart
 still continued, and could be distinctly perceived : when they
 had ceased, they were renewed by establishing a communica
 tion between the heart and the pile, the large nervi sympa-*
 thetici and vagi and the pile. , .
     4th. By arming the abdominal aorta and the plexus cœ-
liacus, and then making them communicate with the pile by
 means of two respective arcs, contractions were produced in
 the abdominal aorta.
     These experiments, added to others announced in a report
 made to the academy on the 15th of August last, leave no
                                                               douUt

doubt in regard to the irritable muscular contractility of
the arteries, and of the influence which the nerves have in
their action.
    5th. By arming the anterior nervous branches of the last
dorsal nerves and of the thoracic conduit, and establishing a
communication between that conduit and an extremity of
the pile, and the armed nerves and the other extremity,
evident contractions were produced in the thoracic canall
Physiologists know what disputes have taken place for and
against the irritable contractility of this canal.  The experi
ments of the Galvanic committee of Turin remove all doubts
on the subject : in a decisive manner it presents, for the first
time, an irrefragable proof of the irritability of the canal of
the chyle, and q? the existence of mufcujar fibres in the tissue
of that canal.
    6th. One of the eyes was plucked from its orbit, and laid
on a plate of glass armed with a plate of lead, so that the
posterior part of the ball of the eye, the trunk of the optic
nerve, and the nervous branches pf the lenticular ganglion,
were in contact with the plate of lead : a communication
was then formed between the plate of lead and one extremity
of the pile and the sclerotica, and between the transparent
 cornea and the other extremity of the same pile, by means
pf exciting arcs.
    The spectators were greatly astonished to see the pupil
 instantly contract. An incision was made in the cornea ; and
 a sine gold wire being brought into immediate contact with
 the iris and the last filaments of the ciliary nerves, a move
 ment was observed in the iris, and a greater contraction in
 the pupil.    There are irritable fibres then in the iris, not
 withstanding what many authors have said to the contrary.
 But what is the diredtion of these fibres ? The professors pro
 pose to make this a future object of research.
    7th. By introducing an arming of lead into the anus, and
 making it communicate with the pile, while another com
 munication was established between the surface os the in
 testines and the other extremity of the pile, evident contrac
 tions were produced in the muscular tunic of the intestines,
 especially when uncovered by the separation of the exterior
  membranous tunic, a continuation of the peritoneum.
    8th. A long portion of the right anterior muscle of the leg
 being extended on a plate of glass armed with two plates or
 lead, the two extremities of the muscle, when touched by the
  two ends of the arc, without the intervention of the pile, ap
  proached each other, and the nerve immediately became

shortened  one half.   These motions took place even when
the arming was removed.
  These experiments were made in the presence of the com
missary-general of the police, several professors of the Athe
næum, the members of the academy, and a great number of
other enlightened citizens.

 J.   HE  following letter, addressed by A, van der Velden, sur-
       and man-midwife       at Workendam,    to the editor of a
gonutch Journal intitled Algemecne Konjlen Letter-Bode 1 802,
No. 41, we have translated from that work.
   *' By the
               encouragement of some friends to humanity, and
some of our principal medical men, who have exerted them
selves very much to recommend the cow-pock inoculation at
this place, about 140 have been inoculated by me and
J. Heilijers, surgeon and man-midwife at Wondriehem. I am
therefore induced to send you the following information,
with the hopes that it may contribute to the preservation of
those who are suffering under the small-pox.       In the course
of the present month I was called in by an inhabitant of this
place who had the misfortune to lose two of his children by
a confluent small-pox of the most, malignant sort, and the
third, the only one remaining, was exceedingly       of the fame
                                                              ill
disorder. Convinced that no injury could arise to the pa»
tient, I  applied the vaccine, being provided with         lancet   a
armed with good matter, and had the happiness to find, the
second day after the vaccination, that the symptoms of the
small-pox were much mitigated; but on the eighth, and
particularly the ninth das after the vaccine inoculation, the
pustules of the natural pox dried up and fell off.        In the
mean time the vaccine continued to operate, and the fol
lowing day the child was perceptibly better, and no bad con
sequence ensued,
     " If
        you think this simple cafe worth insertion in your
Journal,  as   further proof of the power and utility of the
                  a
vaccine,     will give me great pleasure, especially

  M. Akerblad,      learned Swede, has opened
                         a                       new field to a

knowledge, by overcoming difficulties so great, that the first
critics ot Europe have hitherto considered them as unsur-
mountable.       He has immortalized himself hy a discovery
which will form an epoch in literature, and has given a so
lution to one of the most curious problems in erudition by
discovering the antient alphabet of the Egyptians, and ana
lysing it in his Lettre fur I' Inscription Egj/plienne de Rosettet
Paris, 8vo. de I' Imprimerie de la Republique, year 10.
     This interesting pamphlet is fold at Paris by Treuttel and
 Wiirtz, booksellers, Quai Voltaire, as well as the following
 work of M. Akerblad, who seems to have been born to un
veil the mysteries of the East : Infcriptionis Vheniciæ Oxo~
 nienjis nova Interpretatio, Parifiis, an. 10, 8vo.       This is a
 new explanation, much happier than the preceding, of a
 Phenician inscription which had exercised the ingenuity of
 the learned Barthelemy and of Simon.
     M. Akerblad had before explained, in the Memoirs of the
 Academy of Gottingen, for i8or, another inscription which
 he found in the city of Athens.          He explained also in the
 Magazin Ency elope dique, Ventose, year 10, an inscription in
 a Coptic manuscript, which it appeared impossible to decy-
 pher, because it was written in the running hand of the
  Copts, till then unknown.         It only remains Tor us to wish
  that M . Akerblad may proceed to London to copy, in the
  British Museum, and publish with his translation, the famous
  Coptic manuscript of Dr. Askew intitled PijHs Sophia,
  which would throw great light on the antient philosophy of
  the east,

      The Society of Antiquarians        of London have caused an
   accurate delineation to be made      of the Greek inscription, ac
   companied by two others in honour of Ptolemy-Epiphanes,
   and found on a stone in Egypt, which has since been
   brought to London. This delineation of the Greek inscrip

    A    new metallic substance has lately been discovered in
Sweden. It was extracted by the celebrated chemist Ekeberg
from     a mineral given to him       M. Geyer. This mineral,
                                               by
found in Finland, had been classed among the ores of tin.
M. Edelcrantz, of the Academy of Stockholm, transmitted
a  specimen of        to Delametherie, who gives the following
                          it

complete. M. Ekeberg has extracted from this mineral                                   a
new metallic substance, to which he gives the name of Tan
 ialite.     Itforms the twenty-third metallic substance.
                                    SILVER AND IRON.
   C. Guyton announced, 35 years ago, that iron and silver
brought together into perfect fusion formed two separate but
tons adhering      their surfaces. He thought he could thence
                          by
conclude, contrary to the opinion of Gellert, that these two
metals cannot be alloyed.
   The ingenious experiments of Coulomb on magnetism
having rendered        necessary for that philosopher to procure
                               it
metals warranted free from iron, C. Guyton proposed to him
to try    button of silver from which
             a                             appeared that nature
                                                           it
itself had separated the iron.
   The silver, indeed, did not contain quantity of iron which
                                                           a
could be rendered sensible                by
                                 chemical re-agents, since                        a   so
lution of    did not give an atom of blue with prussiate of soda.
                 it
A portion of the same fragment exercised sensible action on     a
the magnetic bar; and Coulomb, having subjected             to hi»           it
magnetic apparatus, found that          contained    thirtieth of
                                                    it              a
 iron.
    Itthen became of importance to examine whether iron did
 not contain   certain quantity of silver.
                      a                    This C. Guyton did
 with his usual ability. He assured himself that in iron therr
                 ;

 ^5         Rapid Disorganization of the Suman       foody*
 is an eightieth, or nearly so, of silver intimately combined »
  and that this quantity is sufficient to give it very remarkable
 properties, such, as extraordinary hardness, and a fracture
 which presents, without continuity, rudiments of crystalliza
 tion.
     C. Guyton concludes from these experiments on silver and
 iron, as well as from those which he made on iron and lead,
 that it can no longer be said that these metals refuse to form
 an alloy, and that there is actually an union in their fusion ;
 but that by a real quartation the greater part of the two metals
 separates while cooling in the ratio of their weight, and ex
 actly as copper and lead separate in grand metallurgic opera
tions.
   RAPID DISORGANIZATION OF THE HUMAN BODY.
    On   the night of the 16th of March, 1802, in one of the
 towns of the State of Massachusetts, the body of an elderly
 woman evaporated and disappeared from some internal and
 unknown cause, in the duration of about one hour and an
 half.    Fart of the family had gone to bed, and the rest were
-abroad.     The old woman remained awake to take care of the
 house.    By and by one of the grand- children came home,
 and discovered the floor near the hearth to be on fire.       An
 alarm was made, a light brought, and means taken to ex
 tinguish it. While these things were doing, some singular
 appearances were observed on the hearth and the contigu
 ous floor. There was a sort of greasy soot and alhes, with re
 mains of a human body, and an unusual smell in the room. All
 the clothes were consumed ; and the grandmother was miffing.
 It  was at first supposed she had, in attempting to light her
 pipe of tobacco, fallen into the fire, and been burned to
 death. But on considering how small the fire was, and that
 so total a consumption could scarcely have happened if there
 had been ten times as much, there is more reason to con-
 elude that this is another cafe of that spontaneous decompo
 sition of the human body, of which there are several instances
 on record.    It is to be regretted the particulars have not been
 more carefully noted.

 v^OMPOSITION is the forming of a whole by the union
of various dissimilar parts ; or, in a more painter-like fense,
the art of arranging the figures and other materials of a pic
ture in such a manner that the whole may appear as if the
rel u It of chance, though produced by the most consummate
art.
    Before we proceed to offer such rules as are to be extracted
from the works of the most esteemed masters, it may not be
improper to premise what previous knowledge is necessary to
enable us to produce a composition.
    When we have occasion to speak of the works of certain
artists, we wish at all times to be understood as referring
through them to nature, for it mult ever be remembered that
art cannot furnijb its own rules.
    Some who have written on the arts have recommended
particular books for the use of young artists ; which is sup
posing a certain quantity of information sufficient to make a
painter. Where he is to begin his inquiry every one knows;
where to stop, no one can tell: one thing is certain, there
 i* no danger of too much knowledge making him spoil his
 work.
    It is of the sirst importance to imagine well our picture.
To this end we must take every means to become well
 acquainted with the history whence our subject is drawn,
 that we may become familiar with the characters we are to
 represent : hence a reference to their lives becomes necessary,
 that we may not mistake a bad man for a good one from 'the
 show of one good action.           This is not all; time and place
 must be attended to, that we may not confound the customs
 of one people with the manners of another. The country,
 also, should be characterized by its trees, rivers, monuments,
 and public buildings, as well as the inhabitants by their dress
 and manners.
    All this, nay more, being absolutely necessary, how is it
 possible that an artist with a little reading can accomplish a
 work like a historical picture ? As well might we suppose the
    Vol. XIV. NoTfo.                 G                            nierely

merely reading Homer sufficient to enable us to design from
that author without any previous historical information.
    He who first acquires a knowledge of geography will not
only better understand history and biography, but receive 4
higher relish for them than had he followed' a different order
of reading. What gives us an interest in Æneas, but our,
supposing him the founder of the mighty empire of Home ?
Otherwise, he becomes a mere robber.
    As all this knowledge cannot be obtained without muck
attention, we fliall find great advantage result from making
memorandums under their respective heads of the customs,
manners, buildings, and other circumstances connected with
historical painting; by which means we fliall collect a mass
of information at all times ready to refer lo, and that with
out its interfering in the least with o,ur practical studies.
Lord Bacon justly observes, " The proceeding upon somer
what conceived in writing, doth, for the most part, facilitate
dispatch; for though it should be wholly rejected, vet that
negative is more pregnant of direction than an indefinite, as
ashes arc more generative than dust."
    Those who propose to themselves to pursue the great and
arduous talk of history-painting, should be careful to guard
 against commencing their career too soon, or before they have
 obtained a stock sufficient to that end : some have started with
 so slender a capital that it has been confined to colour, chiaro
scuro, with, now and then, a successful composition; requi-i
 sites that do not fink below the superficies.
    The acquirements necessary to qualify an artist to pursue
 the great and important part of the art we are treating of, are
 many: he {liquid possess a thorough knowledge of the human,
 figure as far as it regards his art, and its attire, with lantb-
 scape, architecture, ebiaro-feuro, and colour: he should be
 well read in history, antiquity, and the best poets ; to
 which he stiould join a knowledge of practical geometry,
 as the foundation of perspective ; with that part of optics
 called chromatics, as it explains the colours ot light and of
 natural bodies; aud, withal, possess a tolerable facility of
  hand.    Nothing can be more difficult than to sill up the
  character of a great artist, particularly if he proposes to raise
  a just and lasting reputation ; and, not content, like the ge
  nerality of the profession, to produce trifles, extends his view*
  beyonq the present generation by the cultivation of works
  that may flouriffi in future ages.   To do this, as well as the
  above acquisitions he stiould be endowed         by nature with
  noble and elevated sentiments; a ready and warm genius to
 jnventj accompanied with the greatest coolness to arrange ;

    Petty criticism should be punished with silent contempt.
We might      as well " hew blocks of marble with a razor," or
*' whistle to mile- stones," as
                                attempt to convince some people.
There is an applause which is superior to all others, that is,
our own, from a conviction of well doing; or, in other words,
a consciousness that our industry is rewarded with improve
ment.      He who is too anxiously eager for the applause of
others, exchanges independence for uncertainty, and happi
ness for disappointment.      Besides, he is in danger ot falling
into a style familiar and common, such as mav best suit the
ideas of ordinary life and vulgar opinion.     We ninst be care
ful not to refine our delicacy to too high a pitch, otherwise
we shall render ourselves liable to be wounded by every petty
criticism.    Many with whom our situation compels us to have
an intercourse are no judges of art; others are influenced by
prejudice ; many delight to wound : but, whether the observa
tion be the result of ignorance or vanity, the bell mode of
punishment will be neglect.
     We have already noticed, under Invention, the two cha
racters of" composition, as the grand and picturesque ; that the
former applies to grave and serious subjects, while the latter
 appears to associate best with gay and sportive ones.      Beauty
 and grace not only delight in, but derive their greatest power
 from, mild variety : hence one of the great beauties in our
 common writing characters results from the swell or the op
 position of force and delicacy in the lines, which give grace
 independent ot form : the fame thing enriches and adds spirit
 to a masterly outline, to which if we join fine (we mean true)
 form, it will possess the first or highest kind of excellence.
 Among the profession there is great difference of opinion re
 lative to composition; we should therefore wish to be under-
 ilood as offering those rules that relate to matters of taste with
 delicacy aud modesty, for fear of forcing genius into one par
  ticular tra-k of operation.
     Nothing can be more false than to suppose the art of com
  position subject to some positive law, or that the figures of a
  group should be invariably composed under some particular
  form. Men who look to pictures, and from them obtain all their
  knowledge, are apt to run into this error, and suppose, be
  cause they see a group in some celebrated picture make some
  what of an angle, that all figures to be well put together must
  assume the triangle.     Others, in contradiction to that doc
  trine, maintain that the true Venetian method of composition
  requires the group to incline diagonally, that       is, running
  from corner to corner of the picture, asserting that the former
  jnethod is    barbarous and French  ;   another let of men call
                                                                the

the horizontal       line jimplialy, and the true Roman method,
 expecting   to  see  a range of heads of an equal height running
through    the  greatest part of the work.
    He who wishes to affect with sorrow or melancholy can.
only expect to succeed hy the removal of whatever may be
likely to please, cither from variety and contrast of forms,
brilliancy os colour, or striking effect of liglv and stiade ; and
one great aid will result from telling the story with few figures,
which gre:itlv adds to simplicity.
   The great reason why Raphael is preferred for composition
is his possessing a style more simple and expressive than any
other.    Simplicity appears to have marked the characters of
the Roman and Florentine schools, as also that of the Ca-
racci; after whom we must place Poussin, Le Sueur, Bour
don, and such others as have affected the fame simple and
expressive manner.
   Le Brim, though an artist of great merit, has, in many
instances, so crowded his composition with incidents, that
the attention is entirely taken from what ought to constitute
the principal feature, and the mind becomes distracted amidst
a multitude of events : witness his Crucifixion, and Slaughter
of the Innocents.         Expression derives much of its force from
simplicity.     Sterne, in his Sentimental Journev, was obliged
to take a single captive to give force to his description. What
can more strongly affect our feelings than his Maria?             A
multitude of objects rushing on the fight destroy interest, and,
in single objects, too many parts produce the fame effect :
hence the necessity of not over-crowding with ornaments.
   It appears pretty certain that the sliape of the group must
depend greatly on the nature of the subject. A triumph must
necessarily assume a different figure to a spectacle like a de
scent from the cross, because it woidd be so in nature.
   Diversity does not carrv with it so much art, orthe appear
ance of an, as is generally supposed ; for, if we diligently at
tend to nature, we shall find an infinite variety of formed
groups resulting from the disposition of some men to sit,
others to stand, the contrast of children with adults, men on
horseback, the irregularities of ground, and a variety of other
circumstances, — all tending to produce a diversified and irre
gular mass, probably assuming, more frequently than any
other, a general figure approaching to the pyramid.
   If we examine the most approved compositions of the Ro
man, Venetian, or other schools, we shall find not only the
general disposition tending to the pyramidal figure, but each
group taken separately, — with this difference, that in the Ve
netian and Flemish it is rendered more excessive.            Hence,
                                   G 3                         from

from a dash of excess in Rubens he becomes a better mafiet
 to study than any other, but he mult be studied with caution.
 The close adhelion of his figures points out the method of
 composition, the striking and conspicuous manner of arrange-
 ing his tints evinces the plan pursued in grouping the colours;
 while the union of shadow with shadow, and light with light,
 is seen in the breadth and vastness of his masses. By his ex
 cess we may learn, as from Diogenes in morals, who ob
 served he acted like musicians, who gave a higher tone in
 order to indicate a true one.
      The affectation of contrast in some artists is abominable ; it
 looks studiously absurd to see a woman lying on the ground
 with a child at her breast, and another playing near her;
 besides the common trick of mixing, in quantum sufficit,
 naked with clothed figures; old men with young ones; side
  opposed to the full face ; the contrast or violent motion
 with languid attitudes; and a thousand other petty arts to
 trap the unwary.      Such violent opposition will never please
 the judicious.      Where the highest degree of the picturesque
 is intended, it should never be carried to excess, How ridi
  culous would it appear in a landscape to see trees crosling
  each other at right angles, or one vertical and another hori
 zontal ! In this instance we may take an example from na
 ture, whose progress from season to season is by gentle and
  almost imperceptible degrees, and not by violent opposition
  from heat to cold. By the fame rule, violent fore-shortenings
 should be avoided ; a little adds dignity, but, in general, the
  figures had better be composed than otherwise. We should
  be careful of mistaking bluster and rant for spirit and great
 ness.     " Be not too tame neither, but let your own discre
  tion be your tutor : suit the action to the word, with this spe
  cial observance, that you overstep not the modesty of nature."
      Weak mincis are apt, when they attempt the expressive
  style, to give their figures the wild and extravagant attitudes
  of lunatics. That grave dignity observable in the works of
  the Florentine and Roman schools has entitled them to the
  first place in composition : the next is jullly held bv the Ca-
  racci, whose pupils, as they lost sight of dignity, subltituted
 bustle and show for simple truth.      The style of Guercino is
 forcible and strong, but less elegant and beautiful than Guido,
 which is easily perceived in the extremities. Pouflin has
 great simplicity in his compositions, though his figures are
 sometimes      too much scattered.     He is remarkable for not
 suffering any low or vulgar thought to break in on the dig
 nity of his story ; an error sometimes committed even by
 .Raphael.      There are admirable traits of the true Roman
                                                          simplicity

  ftmpticity in the pictures of Le Sueur. They are rare jewels ;
  and Le Brun's stoning St. Stephen is highly classical.
       Molt of the writers on composition in painting seem to
  imagine it to depend pn contrast, and recommend it in the
  strongest manner; but vio'ent opposition, as before stated, not
  only destroys simplicity, but is of all affectations the most
  disgusting.       If opposition or contrast were a criterion of ex
  cellence, the most violent would become the most perfect ;
'
  and, like a caricature, the more unlike nature the better it
  would be. Variety dr contraposition is certainly necessary;
  but the degree cannot be ascertained by weight or measure,
  it must be learned from the works of esteemed masters*
   Common sense must dictate the neceflity of not making
   all the attitudes alike> and also keep us from a contrary
   excess.
       In a sine composition we shall discover, by an attentive
   examination, all the parts so depending on the whole, that
   the removal of any object would destroy the general good
   arrangement.
       That variety necessary to the perfection of a group should
   be displayed in a single figure, especially if it be a beautiful
   one.      If the figure is seen in front, its grace will be increased
   by showing the face in profile, with a slight inclination in
   the chest *i one of the legs being straight, the other sliould
   be thrown back; and so of each limbs: -but this variety must:
   depend on the nature of the subject, as such a contrast would
   ill become a philosopher, apostle, or senator.
        A single figure may be considered as a group in itself, and
   such a studied one would by no means unite with many,
   any more than one taken from a number would do as a single
   figure.
       The contrast observable in Raphael is not an assectation of
   variety, but the result of consummate judgment, where the
    erect and inactive figure is introduced to give energy and
    motion to the active. Contrast in him is the result of ne
    cessity arising from deep reflection, not the studied and in
   sipid opposition of an oki man, a young woman, a boy and
    a girl, which we often fee in pictures.             He knew well a
    philosopher or an apostle would not move like a soldier, a
    virgin like a matron, or children like adults ; which appears
    to make part of that variety observable in his works*                 He

appears also to have preferred the action to its termination ;
which renders the story more clear, and leaves the spectator
delighted with a suspended motion, and in expectation of its
terminating.    A man represented in the act of walking, and
as having terminated his step, will not have so animated an
effect as one not having finished it. Much of the beauty of
the Apollo Belvedere arises from the state of action he is re
presented under.   We almost imagine he is actually moving
when viewed in front.
     In.a great master, every thing is the result of reason :
if  a limb, such as a hand or foot, is concealed by drapery,
it does not arise from idleness or ignorance ; it is done to give
beauty to some principal members, by not making too great
a display   of   parts,    or to avoid what would otherwise produce
an ugly form.
   The grand or expressive style will ever rank first ; the other,
as in the hands of Lanfranco, Cortona, &c. is only the art
of agreeably rilling a large picture with figures, or merely
pleasing the eve : it may justly be termed ornamental,            and
ranks infinitely  below   the pure picturesque.     In  all  works   of
art, the philosopher will inquire whether the head or the hand
is mojl employed.     Vouffin, though admirable in composition,
often excels in the accessary parts.         In his Pyrrhus, the
figures,  and  dhtanf  ground   over the river,  are more beautiful
than the principal part ; a prodigality avoided by Raphael ;
nor is he so noble in his best thoughts; and his women are
often ordinary.     We wisti to be understood as always distin
guishing   between    the grand style and the picturesque.          In
the former, the utmost simplicity is to be observed in the ar
rangement, and every thing like artifice avoided; while the
latter admits of, and derives much of its chara6ter from,
variety.
    In a group the artist generally prefers unequal numbers,
as 3, 5, 7, or 9, which unite with a better grace and afford a
greater variety than any other; but, where equal numbers are
used, those composed of two unequal are best, as 6, 10, and
 34; but double pairs will         ill
                                   accord, as 4,   8, 12, &c.     The
 principal part  of  the  story oi^ht  undoubtedly    to occupy    the
 centre of the picture, and tb.e group,       byassuming     a rotund
 or semicircular form, will aflist the light and shade, and en
 able us to bring the principal figure in light, as well as to
 procure masses         combining the shadows of several objects
                          by
 in one. In this respect Raphael has displayed          much judg
                                                        so
 ment, that     appears from his works evident that he would
                 it
 have proved     great master in light and ihade had he been
                 a

permitted a longer life : however, he did enough to furnish
the hint to the Venetian school.
   In whatever' way we may dispose our group, the principal
figure ought to be rendered conspicuous, either from situa
tion, colour, drapery, liffht, or from all these combined. To
talk about " effect of light and shade," and thereby attempt
to justify an impropriety, would be reducing painting to a
style merely ornamental indeed! and make paintings of no
use beyond stopping a hole in the wall.
   As in the drama the hero of the piece has a greater part to
sustain to distinguish him, so ours must, as it were, lord it
over all the other objects.
           Nor paint conspicuous on the foremost plain
N          Whate'er is false, impertinent, and vain ;
           But, like t'>c tragic muse, thy lustre throw
           Where the chief action claims its warmest glow;
                                                  Mason's Fresnoy.
     Tt must not be understood    that the principal figure should
be    more laboured or finislied ; that would destroy the unity
which ought to prevail through the whole. In forming our
groups, the greatest mass ought to be in the middle, and the
little or scattered parts placed on the edges to give the whole
a lightness ; while some places require to be left blank for
the fake of repose — for, though our picture should be filled, it
should not be crowded.       As we must also seek to obtain pro
fundity proportioned to the greatness of the group, we should,
to give the whole a pleasing air from a variety in its form,
avoid placing the figures In a file.       Rubens, whose art in
grouping his figures is great, sometimes runs into excess bv
attaching them too much together, so as to make them appear
to cling as- inseparable ; but, as before observed, his vices
teach us what is right.      The golden mean must form the
object of our pursuit, we slionkl avoid a monotony of forms
as well as too great a contrast; a number of extremities fol
lowing each other in the fame line will generally produce a
bad effect.     We should also avoid showing them in the same
point of view.     Pousfin's Sacrament of Baptism is an excel
lent example, where many figures are pointing, all differing
from each other.

          story requires more than one group, the fame laws'
must influence us in (he conduct of each, — they should cer
tainly not exceed three.    The principal one fliould prevail
over the others ; and, by placing it near the centre, or iii

the other objects.
    As we are bound to support an equilibrium     our compo      in

another too naked    but this must be done without adding

As in an epic poem, there should be but one action admitted

XVIII.     Observations       on the Zodiac        at Dendera.   By    the
                Rev.    Samuel Henley, F.S.A.*
OiS     the report of C. Fourrier concerning this zodiac and
its high antiquity has made a deep impression on the minds
of many, and the argument thence drawn has been deemed
of great weight, in opposition to the Mosaic records and re
vealed religion, I fend you the following observations, with
the hope that they may reach those who otherwise might not
see them, and have their effect upon a large class of readers,
who may have too lightly acceded to Fourrier's conclusion.
   Denon, speaking of this zodiac as clearlv proving the pro
found knowledge of the antient Egyptians in astronomy, men
tions the ruins which contain           it,
                                    and are extant but twenty
minutes ride from Dendera (antiently Tentvra), known at
present under the Arabic name of Berbe.       Concerning the
etymology of this term, various opinions have been offered              ;
but that      the learned De Sacy
               by                     most generally admitted.

                                                   Hartmann,

more suitable to pyramids than temples. M. de Sacv replies,
with considerable force, that Schultens would have done
rrore justice to Michaelis,        instead of indulging conjecture,
                                               if,
he had opened some Arabic description of Ecvpt                for ex       ;

the term could not signify pyramids. 'Accordingly,            passage       a
is cited from that author which refers to ihe very place.

                                 Denon, one inference, drawn by
 M. Fourrier, will be readily admitted, which is, that the
 state of the heavens they exhibit, corresponds with the date
 of the building.           remains then to determine, from the
                            It
 zodiac in question, what this date was. Denon, on his                               se
 cond visit, thus describes the temple — " went to the ruins,
                                                          :        I
 and this time took possession of them in the plenitude of re

 admiration of the great temple was not an illusion produced
 by   the novelty of its appearance, since, after having seen all
 the other Egyptian monuments, this still appeared the most:
 perfect      its execution, and constructed at the happiest pe

    The date of 15,000 years before the birth of Christ seems
 but     to agree with this account, when contrasted with the
       ill
 ordinary remains of human efforts, and the uniform effect of
 human experience. The monuments of remote ages are more
 remarkable for their rude bulk than elaborate workmanfliip                           ;

united opinions of Denon and Fourrier, 15,000 years before
Christ was the happiejl period of the aris and sciences.                 So
much for their joint decision !
     Taking, however, this calculation independently of the
structure itself, it is fairly admitted to be accurate, so far as
it is founded on equino£iial precisions ; but, reserving discus
sions on this head for a work shortly to be published *, it
will be sufficient to observe that I had thence fixed the age of
this zodiac to the very year and day before the inscription
ascertaining them was known, and which has not, even yet,
been explained.
     The plate given from Denon           f  represents the zodiac in two
compartments, as           it exists on  the  opposite plat-bands of the
portico of the temple.             The   two   large figures that embrace
the whole, he supposes, represent the year ; and the winged
emblem before their mouth, eternity, or else the passage of
the sun to the solstices. The disk, at the joining of the thighs
of the upper figure, he pronounces to be the fun, whence pro
ceeds a beam of light that falls upon the head of Ifis, which
represents either the earth or the moon.
                                                      " The fun," he con
 tinues, "situated in the sign Cancer, may perhaps (how the
 period of the erection of the temple, whilst the figures joined
 to the signs may mean the fixed stars, and those in the boats
 the revolving bodies, the planets, and the comets."                   After
 offering    these    conjedtures,   this modest    artist,  under a convic
 tion ot their importance, resigns to others all further deve
 lopment.
      Instead of adopting what Denon has conjectured, it will
 be proper to consider the zodiac anew.                     Accordingly, the
 female form bent over either division, is unquestionably the
 Ifis, which by Horapollo is determined to be the year. The
 winged globe, according to Macrobius, is the fun commen
 cing his course. The veil on the head of the Ifis is that mys
 terious one which the famous inscription affirms no mortal
 had ever withdrawn.             On the upper bend or shoulder of the
 lower figure are eight lines or units, denoting that the fun,
 at the cardinal points of the year, is in the eighth degree of

  the sign; for so it is stated to have been by Manilius at thfl
  time of the Julian reform, and such was, according to Co-
  lumella, the adjustment of the Metonic cycle, compared with
  the tables of Hipparchus.       The four stars, of eight rays each,
  are the doe-star, which governed the Egyptian year, and,
  being eight months visible in the upper hemisphere, had a
  month assigned to each ray, as the fun has twelve rays ta
  designate the months of his course.         These four stars here
  signify a quadrenniuni, when, in the Roman year, an addi
 tional, or bissextile day, was added to the 365 days, which
  constituted the Egyptian.      Beneath are twelve other units-,
 as making, in the bissextile year, the solar to exceed the lunar
 twelve days instead of eleven.       The little circle, with wings,
 on the breast of Isis, marks a new but subordinate procession
 of the sun's course, after the quadrennium has been com
 pleted. The waving lines extending along the figure are the
 Egyptian hieroglyphic for flowing water; while the line of
 stars — each marking, by its six rays, as many portions of
 time, and, with the square comprising them, the square of
 that number — severally indicates four times six hours, or a day.
 These, amounting to seventy-nine, express two months or luna
 tions, and twenty days over, which correspond to the two
 lunar months added by Numa to the Roman year ; and, with
 the twelve days allowed as above, compensate for the differ
ence between the ordinary lunar year and the solar bissextile,
while eight days, answering to the sun's advancement in the
sign, complete the given number.          From the bend of the leg
downward, five days are so disposed as to stiow the five sup
plementary days above twelve months, of thirty clavs each,
that constitute the Egyptian year.         This is evident from the
hornless    beetle  annexed,   which   was, among the Egyptians,
an   established   hieroglyphic for a  month of thirty days. The
three stars on the band surrounding the lees, with the four
on the shoulder, symbolizing conjointly seven years, give
seventy-seven days as the difference between lunar and solar
time, and thus represent at once the sixty-seven days which
the year, by the reform of Julius, had gone back, with the
ten days between the winter solstice and the first of January,
or six days with which he lengthened the months in one part
of the year, and four in the other.
    Having recourse to the I sis of the upper division, it will be
found, that, instead of eight units on the shoulder, she exhi
bits but seven, whereas the last of the four stars beneath them
wants two of its rays, and the units which follow are not
twelve but eleven.       To account for these variations, let it be
observed, that, before the Julian reform, the Roman war

                Observations    on the Zodiac at "Dendera,               tit
Lelng lunar,       a month of twenty-two and twenty-three day9
alternately, named Mercedonius, was inserted after the 23d;
of February, to adjust the lunar reckoning to solar ; but, as
in the year of the Julian reform, the twenty-three days were
included, there would of course be one day's advance on the
calendar computation, which would leave but seven davs by
 the lunar account for the sun's place in the sign ; whence the
eleven units below would answer to the ordinary differences
between the lunar year and the solar ; whilst the two ravs,
 deficient in the fourth of the stars, would point out the com
 mencement of the lunar year at Rome on the 1st of March,
 and the solar of Julius on the 1st of January; or, in other
 words, would correspond to the augmentation of the year,
 computed backward, which Numa had made.                         The stars in
 squares,     as before, designating days, which, to the bend of
  the leg, amount to sixty-seven, answer to the beginning
  of the year srpne back by the Julian computation, while the
  seven in addition correspond to the sun's place in the sign,
  which, with the five supplementary davs round the lesrs,
  make the twelve davs in the last year of lunar intercalation,
  and, as the four divisions between them sliow, are coincident
  again with a quadrennium.
       Perfectly congruent with the whole is the pvramidal figure,
   having a globe or fun at its top.          It consists of eleven grada
   tions, which answer to the eleven days between the solar and
   lunar year, and the ninety-nine divisions upon it discriminate
   the ninety-nine days from the winter iolftice, by which
   Julius adjusted his reform, to the commencement of the
   Roman year on the ist of April.                Between, however, the
    Roman 1st of March and the lit of April a month was left
   out, or, in other words, had gone back a sign.                 This is here
   expressed by the recess of Cancer from the zodiac, and agrees
    with Virgil's commencement of the year with Taurus:
                 Candidus auratis aperit qoum comibus annum
                 Taurus —
    the precise     time of which is defined        by what immediately
    follows :

    If, now, the setting of the dog-star be placed, according to
    Petau, on the fourth of the kalends of May, and the fixtyv

    reform, thence reckoned, we come to the 26th of February,
     or j ft of Thoth, at the commencement of the æra of Nabo-
    nassar, which was that likewise of the Egyptian year.                  The

                                                                           days

 days in them, it had accordingly receded two lunar months,
 and eight days over, making in the whole sixty-seven,       and
 so fell on the 27th of April, or day of the dog-star's letting,
 •whence the 28th of March would be the first of Aries ; but
 as, according to Hipparchus,      compared with Mcton and
 Manilius, Julius Cæsar's year placed the fun in the eighth
 dav of the sign, these eight days allowed, will fix the be
 ginning of Aries at the vernal equinox, and 21st of March.
     The anomalies of the Roman year being settled bv the
 year of Nabonaflar, or the Egyptian, it becomes evident,
 from the pyramidal figure, with the fun on its summit and
 the cavern beneath, signifying the vacant interlunar ave of
 the moon ; that the horns of the Pan, symbolizing die hori
 zontal beams of the dog-star, or completion of the canicular
 year, are placed on the common boundary of the eighth and
 third gradation, or day, in the eleven, which indicate the
 difference between lunar aud solar time, or 365 and 354, to
 distinguish the eight days for the excess bevond the two luna
 tions, and the three other days corresponding to the differ
 ence of the Roman lunar year, ending at the 23d of Febru
 ary, and the year of Nabonaflar beginning on February 26,
 which was the first of Thoth by Egyptian reckoning.
    The bandages round the head ot the Pan express the fame,
 with other notes of distinction ; for, whilst the uppermost
 fold has eight points corresponding to eight days, as before,
 the second exhibits five units, to denote the five Egyptian
 fupplemenary days, which, with the five points between
 them, indicate ten days, as corresponding with the winter
 solstice, December 21, whence Julius commenced his re
 form, and the 1st of January, or his new year's date.
    But as, under this reform, the Egyptian year corrected the
Roman, so the Roman year, thus corrected, was made by
Augustus the standard of the Egyptian ; for, as that consisted
 only of twelve months, of thirty days each, with five days
in addition, its commencement receded one day on every
xjuadrennium ; consequently, from the year of Nabonaflar,
and that of the reform of Augustus, by Julian reckoning,
sixty-four days twelve hours (the year of Nabona(T.ir, which
was the Egyptian, beginning at noon, according to the canon
of Ptolemy), will show that the first of Thoth, five interced
ing days being allowed between the Julian correction, taken
as beginning from 707 of Rome, and that of Augustus, esta
blished in 725, the bissextile sour days twelve hours (or,
reckoned from midnight, five days), had varied from the z 1 li
of June, or summer solstitial noon, to the 29th of August,
three in the morning, at which time Augustus"      had fixed it«

For sixty-four  days twelve hours and four days twelve hours
making sixty-nine days, and exceeding the sixty-seven days
of Julius by two, Augustus intercalated^ between the year 709
of Rome, when Julius's reform was completed, and his own,
sixteen years after, one day every third year instead of every
fourth 5 and so, instead of four bissextile days, six were in
serted.   Between three in the morning, when the dog-star
rose, and twelve at noon, when the sun was on the meridian,
Were nine hours to complete the canonical day; these are

ting of the dog-star, which is exemplified by the solar circle
in a crescent on the bull's neck, it will be seen that the Thoth
thence proceeding is represented as a bull in a boat (for the
heavenly bodies, which were the Egyptian divinities, were
held to perform their revolutions in this manner), and as it
has been seen from the star deprived of two rays on the
shoulder of the Upper Isis, as well as from the two months
difference between the year of Romulus and Numa's, that
the fun's place had been altered two signs, the third boat or
month proceeds from Gemini to Cancer : accordingly, the
foremost figure in it represents a priest taking auguries from
 the rife of the star, whilst the other is evidently Aquarius, or
the overpowering of the Nile, at the apparent new moon of
 Cancer. But Cancer withdrawing from the Zodiac, the over
flow falls in with Leo; and here, accordingly, Harpocrates
appears as on the day answering to bissextile, which is also
intimated to belong to that year by the lix leaves on the head
of Aquarius, or the Nile. This being suppressed in the Egyp
tian kalendar, makes Cancer and Leo run into each other,
or confounds the last day of one with the other's first.      The.
 figure preceding Leo has the star of five rays, which, indi
cating five months, marks Leo as the fifth sign, whilst the
serpent, rising from under his feet, exhibits the Nilotic year
thence beginning, as does the serpent behind the Harpo-
 crates, with his head erected from the fourth fold, a qua-
drennium.      The rising and letting dog-star follow, as thus
 corresponding in respect to fixed and moveable time.        From
 the overflow of the Nile, in the sign   Leo,  we  are  brought on
 to the commencement of the vear in Virgo.             This is ex
 pressed  by the torch with two fianiea, followed by a priest
 taking auguries at the year's beginning, which the bull's
 head, whose horns symbolize the apparent new moon, aud
 star of |ive rays above them, sufficiently evince.       This also

  the Thoth, 6r new year's day, beginning from that sign                            ;
  whilst the fourteen articulations in the tail of the dog will be
  found to agree with the fourteenth year of the solar cycle,
  concurrent with the first lunar, when the fun entered Scorpio.
  The hieroglyphics next succeeding, characterize again the
  beginning 01 the year, for such arc the hawk, crowned with
  the lotus;     the wolf, sacred to the fun and the cerastes, rising
                                                           ;
  from an oar.        The figures of the rising and setting star are
  intelligible    as before.    We now come to Sagittarius, an hie
  roglyphic, composed        of   human body, with
                                        a                 bifrontal head

  united.     The arrow on the bow           the first beam of the year,
                                                      is

 whilst the chest, fore-legs, and body to the wing, belong to
  Pegasus, or the horse of the morning.                The hind parts of
 the wolf complete the reference to the new moon of Thoth,
 commencing; from the dawn. The two divisions on the wins              ®
 serve to express the distinction of the lunar and solar differ
 ence, which answers to the eleven feathers, whilst the twelve,
 intercalations between the wine and tail of the wolf, on

Over the wolf's tail            star of five rays, pointing at the
                                is   a                                         di
 stance between the tnoveable and fixed Thoth, whilst the
 priest, under the mask of             hawk, the symbol of

mencing year, immediately follows, and, with an arrow, ot
 first beam of the rising star, stops the further progress of the
 bull, which, to express the 'moving Thoth, has an hind-leg
joined to his head.          This symbol, indeed, vtith the two next
 that follow,   is    a certain key to the whole, inasmuch as they
 distinctly mark the fixing of the first of Thoth, the dog hold
ing the bull's leg             chain of nine links, ending with the
                               by   a
star of five rays as before, whilst five of these stars, surround
ing the. Taurine symbol, decide their established import.
The one between the horns rntimates the original rife at the
first of April in the Roman lunar year, at the apparent new
moon, that      is,   the moon on its second day, to which add
the intercalary month Mercedonius, and the difference rs
obtained of the fua's entrance on the sign, April 20, which

accords with  the Roman commencement of the year on the
Palilia. Hence, Aries is again found on the 21 st of March.
In perfect congruity with this is the chain of nine links an
nexed to the liar.  For, as the sidereal revolutions in a year,
from meridian to meridian, are 366 days, there will conse
quently be a Jay "gained by sidereal reckoning : hence, as the
fun enters capricbrn ori the 22d of December, at noon, these
nine days ascertain the difference between that time and the
noon of the       1st of January, and thus account for the differ
ence   of    ten days by the kalcndar of Julius when he reformed
the Roman year.
    Having then founds in this zodiac, the key to the reforms
rif the Roman year; we have also the clue to that of the
Egyptian, introduced by Augustus in the year of Rome 725,
corresponding to the year of Nabonassar 7 20, and making the
difference of bissextiles fix Egyptian months, or 180 days -r but
these carried back from the 29th of August, or fixed Thoth,
go to the moveable Thoth on the 26th of February.         Thus,
then, have we the two Thoths, before and behind Capricorn,
and these 180 days, from the fun's entrance into Capricorn,
with the four bissextiles between the reform of Julius and
Augustus, fall in with the summer solstice on the 21st of
June.
   But it will be remembered that one of thedog-stars on the
shoulder of Isis was defective in two rays,- and that Numa,
augmented by two months the Roman year :              in retroces
                                                      if,
sion from Capricorn, these two months be cut 6ff, we are
stopped at the 21st of Auguit, and thence, eight days allowed
for the fun's advance     the fien, we are brought again to the
                             in
29th. To this month Augustus gave his name, aud Capri
corn was his appropriate symbol,        Suetonius relates of him,
thatj cm consulting irt his vouth Theogenes, the mathema
tician of Apollonia, when the circumstances of his birth were
made known,- Theogenes rose, surprised, and adored him.
The reason of this conduct         stiall elsewhere explain; but
                                    I
here    itwill be proper    to observe, that, on the celebrated
gem of this emperor's deification,         the sign Capricorn     is
placed       circle, with the dog-star behind, which, as five
             in   a
only of its rays can be seen, the others suppressed, will accord
 with the difference between the ist of January and April,
 reckoned one way, ami, as Augustus was born on the 23d
 of September, adding the difference between' lunar and solar
 time (the Roman year being then lunar), to the 1st of January
 in the other. The absent three rays being thus accounted
 for,    will be obvious that the remaining five relate to the
        it
 distance between the 23d of September and the 19th of Fe-
                               H      a                    bruary,

 bruary, to which the four bissextile days again included be*
 tween the Julian and Augustan reform, came lo the 23d,
 when the Roman lunar year was intercalated ; and again,
 from the 19th day of February, the eight days in the sign
 reach that of the 1st of Thoth, the year being bissextile, and
 the excess of sidereal days, from noon to noon, allowed.
    It remains to observe, that, in adjusting the Roman mode
 of dating to the Egyptian, there is a nominal difference of
 three years, which will be found to be but nominal upon
 comparing the canon of Ptolemy.               Hence what, in Roman
 reckoning after the reform of the kalendar, appears to be the
 ?22d year of the city, contrasted with Egyptian time, will
 faM into the 725th : now, as Augustus was in his thirty-first
 year, when he fixed the 1st of Thoth, in the 725th year of
 Rome, and made this his firji year in Egypt, the two years
 from that of Antony preceding were considered as supprefled.

    Thus, then, as Augustus is stated to have been born in the
 year of Rome 691, when the Roman year is referred to
 Egyptian reckoning, it will be seen that, in Roman com
 putation, his 31st year fell into this year of reform. In perfect
 consistence with- this, and aH that has been adduced, is an
 inscription on the southern portal of the very temple in which
 this zodiac exists, and' which, though hitherto unapplied?
 is given by Denon.         It is rendered by Mr. Aikin thus :
    " On account of the emperor Cæsar, god,          ~     the son of Ju-
                       7                                               Piter,

phon general, the deputies of the metropolis consecrated, in
virtue of the law, the Propylæum to Isis, the greatest of the
goddesses, and to the associated gods of the temple, in the
J ist year of Cæsar."     Here the inscription breaks off, but,
in the Greek, the two words 0slT0 2EB \2THI follow.
For these the French translator unaccountably substitutes—
Le College des Prelres a I'lmperatrice, whereas it fimply                sig
nifies on the sacred Tbotb.
    Itwill now suffice to add, that the nineteen boats under the

               XII.   Japanese Cement,       or Mice Glue..
    This elegant cement is made by mixing rice flour inti
mately with cold water, and then gently boiling it.           It is
beautifully white, and dries almost transparent.            Papers
pasted together by means of this cement will sooner sepa
rate in their own substance than at the joining, which makes
it extremely useful in the preparation of curious paper arti
cles, as tea-trays, ladies' dressing boxes, and other articles
which require layers of paper to be cemented together. It
is in every respect preferable to common paste made with
wheat flour for almost every purpose to which that article
is usually applied.    It answers well, in particular, for pasting
into books the copies of writings taken off by copying ma
chines on unsized silver paper.
     With this composition, made with a comparatively small
quantity of water, that it may have a consistence similar to
          clay, model?, busts, statues, basso- relievos, and the
  ike, may be formed,

    The bows of the Laplanders are composed of two pieces
 rtf wood glued together; one of them of birch, which

 order that the bow when bent may not break, and that when
 unbent   it  may not bend.      When these two pieces of wood
 are bent, all the points of contact endeavour to disunite them
 selves, and to prevent this the Laplanders employ the fol
 lowing cement — They take the skins of the largest perches*,
                  :
 and, having dried them, moisten them                 cold water until

tom.   When they have boiled about an hour they take them
from the bladder or bark, and they are then found to be soft
and viscous.  In    this state they employ them for glueing
together the two   pieces of their bows, which they strongly
compress and tie   up until the glue is well dried. These pieces
never afterwards    separate.— Transactions of the Academy of
Sciences at Stcckbolm.

   In setting precious stones, pieces are sometimes broken off
by accident.      In such cases they often join the pieces so cor
rectly, that an inexperienced eye cannot discover the stone to
have been broken.        They employ for this purpose a small
piece of gum-mailic applied between the fragments, which
are previously heated sufficiently to enable them to melt the
interposed gum.       They are then pressed together to force out
the redundant quantity of gum.
    In the same manner cameo heads, but without any ground,
made of pa 'ie (white enamel or coloured glass) are often ce
mented on a piece of real stone to serve them for a ground,
producing the appearance of a real onyx, from which they
can with diffi'-ultv be sometimes difiinguislied.

     XV.   Turkey Cement         for joining Metals, Glass, &c.
   The jewellers in Turkey, who are mostly Armenians, have
a  curious method of ornamenting watch-cases, and similar
things, with diamonds and other stones,                by
                                                    simply glueing
them on. The stone           set
                            is      silver or gold, and the lower

 other vessel dissolve as much isinglass (which has been pro*
 viously soaken in water till it is swollen and soft) in French
 brandy or in rum, as will make two ounces, by measure, of
 strong glue, and add two small bits of gum-galbanum or am-
monjacum, which must: be rubbed or ground till they are
dissolved : then mix the whole with a sufficient heat ; keep
 it in a phial stopt, and <when it is to be used set it in hot
water. — Eton's Survey of the Turkish Empire.
    XVI. The process above described may be simplified by
adding the gum ammoniac to the isinglass during its solution
in proof spirit, and exposing the mixture to a ooiling heal
until it is dissolved, when the solution of mastic in alcohol
may be added.          The gum-ammoniac previously dissolved
with the isinglass promotes the union of the mastic with the
mucilage. This cement has been tried in London, and found,
to answer well : it stands against moisture.
                   Cements which  rejijl Moi/lure.
    Generally speaking, all cements into the composition of
 which gum-lac or mastic enters, of which we have already
given some, possess this property.
    XVII. A cement of this kind may be made by dissolving
isinglass in proof spirit, to which must afterwards be added a
solution of shell-lac in alcohol.
    XVIII. Another cement, which will also resist moisture,
may be formed by melting by heat, without water, common
glue with half its weight of resin, to which must be added
some red ochre to give it body ; it is particularly useful for
cementing hones to their frames.
    XIX. Carpenters employ a cement in framing sign-boards,
&c. to stand the weather, which they make by adding to
a pint of well made common glue (qiade with water) an
eighth part of that quantity of boiled linseed oil, dropping     if
into the glue gently, and stirring it all the time.
    XX. White lead ground up with boiled linseed oil to the
consistence of paint, makes a good cement for joining broken
porcelain, earthen ware, and glass articles destined to hold
water, eVc.    After the cement is applied, between the pieces
they   should be  pressed home to each other as close as possible.
The closer the better; nor need any sears be entertained that
enough of cement will not be left in the joint; for the thin
nest him that can be interposed will hold firmer than a thicker
one would.      The articles should remain undisturbed for two
or three months, and before using them the cement sticking
on the outside of the joint should Be carefully scraped off with
a knife,

  Mr. Gad, in    the 33d volume of the Memoirs of the Aca^

iron be plentifully mixed \viih oil, they will form a mass

pretty strongly glass, stone, and wpqd, still leave room to
wisti for one of a stronger quality.
    An excellent glue may be procured from cheese. Take
fkim-milk cheese, free it from the rind, cut it in slices, and
boil it in warm water, stirring it with a spoon until it be
reduced to a strong glue which dpes not incorporate with
water. Then throw away the warm water, pour cold water
over the glue, and knead it afterwards in warm water, sub
jecting it to the same process several times. Put the warm
 glue on a grinding stone, apd knead it with quicklime until
 you havp a good glue.       When you wisti to use this glue vou
 must warm it : ifit be employed cold it is npi so strong, but
 it may also be used in that manner. This glue is inloluble
 in water as soon as it is dry, and it becomes ib in forty-eight
 hours after it has been applied.        It may be used for glueing
 wood, and for cementing marble and broken stone, and
 earthen ware.      The joining can scarcely be discovered.
     Baits also for catching fish may be made of it. Fish are
  very fond of    it,

     In joiningthe stanches of iron cylinders and other parts of
 hydraulic  and steam-engines, great inconvenience is often

 make a good fitting of large pieces of iron work, which ren#
 ders it necessary sometimes     to join and separate the piece*
 repeatedly before a proper adjustment is obtained.           When
 this is expected, the' white lead ought to predominate in tho
 mixture, as it dries much slower than the red. A workman,
 knowing this fact, can be at little loss in exercising his own
 discretion in regulating the quantities.     It is safest to err on
 the fide of the white lead, as the durability of the cement
is no way injured thereby, only a longer time is required for
it to dry ana harden.
    When the fittings will not admit easily of so thick a sub
stance as flannel being interposed,      linen may be substituted,
or even paper or thin pasteboard; the only reason- for em-
           any thing of the kind being the convenience of
Kloying
   andling.
    This cement answers well also for joining broken stones
however large.       Cisterns built of square stones, put together
with this cement, will never leak or want any repairs. In
this cafe the llones need not be entirely bedded in      it,an inch
or even less of the edges that are to he next the water need
only be     so

good lime.

   When the cement       iswanted for use, take one part of the
above powder and twenty parts of clean iron borings or filings,
and blend them intimately           by
                                    grinding them in     a  mortar.

   By play of affinities, which those who are at all acquainted
        a
with chemistry will be at no loss to comprehend,        a degree of
action and reaction takes place among the ingredients, and
between them and the iron surfaces, which at last causes the
whole to unite as one mass.          In fact, after  a   time, the
mixture and the surfaces of the flanches become         aspecies of
pyrites (holding   avery large proportion of iron), all the parts
of which cohere strongly together.

a little time become as hard as a stone.
                        XXVI.      Blood Cement.
    A   cement often used by coppersmiths to lay over the
r-ivets and edges of the stiects of copper in large boilers, to
serve as an additional security to the joinings, and to secure
cocks, &c. from leaking, is made by mixing pounded quick
lime with ox's blood.         It must be applied frefli made, as it
soon gets so bard as to be unfit for use.
    We believe, if the properties of this cement were duly in
vestigated, it would be found useful for many purposes to
which it has never been yet applied. It is extremely cheap,
 and very durable.

    the Use  of liquid Pitch    to render them impermeable      to Watet9
    and secure from the Attacks           of Frojl.       By  Casimir
    PUYMAURIN.
 A SHALL not speak of the nature, of the different lime-
 cements hitherto known, as they have been fully described
 by various authors; I shalt only observe, that a cement ought
 to be hard, solid, and impermeable.             To obtain a hard and
 solid cement it has been necessary to employ different bodies
 which, by their aggregation with lime, dissolved in w'ater,
 speedily absorb the superabundant moisture, and furnish to
 the particles of lime diffused throughout the cement the car
 bonic acid necessary for rendering it solid>and regenerating it
 into  calcareous   earth.
                                                                 Vkrified

126      New Method of making       Cement   sot   Tert&ces
   Vitrified lava, natural and artificial puzzolana,      the scoriae
of furnaces, pounded bricks, bone- allies, have      been the bases
of all the cements hitherto maJe, and they           have been ob
tained more or less solid. Cements composed         in this manner
have been attended with perfect success in the southern parts
of Europe, little exposed to rain: they do not absorb the ex
terior moisture, and the frost has not power to dilate their
pores or to destroy their aggregation.
   The cements of Italy, Africa, Spain, and other warm coun
tries, unite all those qualities which can be desired by the most
exact observer ; but in our rainy countries, exposed to very
strong frosts, cements ought to possess a more essential qua
lity than hardness or solidity, that is to fay, impermeability.
Cements composed of porous bodies cannot possess this qua
lity : being hard, and having their greatest soliditv during
summer, the rains of autumn gradually penetrate to their in
terior parts, to reduce to powder that mass which a little be
fore had the appearance of the greatest hardness.
   The inventors of the most celebrated cements have seen
their experiments fail because they neglected this essential
qualitv.    The interposition of a fat body was long ago em
ployed.     Plinv and Vitruvius recommend the thick part of
oil, and oil itself; but these bodies employed alone can never
answer the intended purpose.        Oil with the lime of cement
forms a saponaceous body soluble in water : the thick part of
oil contains a very large quantity of mucilage, which water
dissolves or carries off.
   To preserve the bottoms of vessels, and to render them im
permeable to water, resinous bodies have been employed, and
particularly liquid pitch.      I have thought that my cement
should be covered with boiling pitch, as this resinous body
penetrates its pores and renders it impermeable to water.
One inconvenience, however, appeared in the use of pitch,
which   is, its property of becoming soft during the heat of
summer.       This inconvenienceI       remedied    by
                                                     besprinkling
the pitch with powder of lime   :     the lime combines with the
pitch, and forms on the cement an exterior stratum of new
cement resembling the famous cement of the Romans called
maltha.
   All the merit of my labour consists merely in having first
employed, for preserving cements and rendering them im
permeable,    a  fat body capable of penetrating them, of filling
up their pores, and of being insoluble in water.
  1   shall here give the method which   I     empToy for making
my cemerit but must first observe, that there cannot be
              ;   I

and  sand were every where of the same quality.      The ob
server, therefore, must examine the nature of the composition
of the lime he employs, and particularly the purity ot the
sand and siliceous matters : he may then vary the doses of
the materials of his cement as may be necessary.
    Every method of making cement requires, in general, that
the puzzolana, pounded brick, and fcoriæ, be reduced to
fine powder and sifted.            This precaution is necessary for
cement which is not to be covered with a resinous body : its
surface thereby becomes smoother and more compact, and it
is less liable to be penetrated by moisture.           But this advan
tage is more than compensated by the fissures and cracks oc
casioned by the shrinking of the cement.                This shrinking
does not take place in cement made according to my method,
because I employ all the matters hard, coarsely pounded, and
in fragments of the size of a grain of wheat, and often as large
as peas.     These fragments broken in this manner present
a great number of angles and cavities into which the calca
reous part penetrates, and thus forms a kind of connected
chain, which prevents those cracks and fissures so prejudicial
to cement. The lime which I employed was made from
 hard and white limestone of the hill of Cazeres, in the de
 partment of the Upper Garonne : this lime dissolves with a
sort of ebullition and a great heat, and after its solution forms
 a white paste without any mixture of gravelly parts : it is sus
 ceptible of swallowing, as the masons here term               it, great
                                                                     a
 deal of sand and other hard matters, but        it   has less strength
 in the open air than meagre lime, which being made from
 marly stone contains in its composition              a    great many
 baked and vitrified argillaceous matters, which give              great
                                                                     it
 strength when exposed to the open air and to water. This
 lime, called in the country claux de Bourret, requires little
 sand, because the calcined and vitrified earthy parts which                   it
 contains form with      it  already an intimate mixture, or        kind
                                                                     a
 of cement: this lime, therefore, dissolved in water, acquires
 in little time the hardness of stone.
      a
     The lime employed then was perfectly pure, without any
                I
 internal mixture of heterogeneous parts, but which has no
 great solidity when exposed to the open air.
  I     found that  a   fifth part of lime was sufficient to give to
 cement that connecting quality necessary to envelop all the
  vitrified and siliceous parts of calcareous stratum, and, con»-
                                   a
  sequently, to give    it the greatest solidity.   Such  is the process.
I   employed to form on       a   roof, constructed for two hundred
  years, the joists of which were at     a    great distance from each
  other,     terrace of forty square fathoms, which still exists,

128         New Method of making        Cement   for Terraces   j
and has withstood four severe winters and our scorching sum*
mers.
   One precaution which        I
                             did not take, and which embar
rassed me a good deal, was to pound the limestone before it
was employed. The stone dissolves in water ; but some stones
being less calcined than others, their nucleus does not dissolve,
and only becomes penetrated with moisture.          When these
are blended with the gravel and siliceous matters employed,
at the end of some days the cement blisters and splits into
small fragments, and bits of the lime which have not been
dissolved are found in the state of lime staked in the open air.
   Take two measures of river pebbles well washed, or frag
ments of brick of the fize of a nut ; two of tiles and iron
scales coarsely pounded, one of river sand perfectly well
washed, and a measure of the lime of Cazeres, just from the
kiln,  and pounded.
    Form a circle with the sand, and throw into the hollow the
lime which has been slaked, taking care to mix it thoroughly:
when the lime is well diluted leave it in that state for three
hours in order that the whole lime may be dissolved ; then
mix with it gradually the river pebbles, the iron scales, tiie
tiles, and the sand.     This mortar must then be worked for
half an hour, that every siliceous stone- and fragment of tile
may be well incorporated *.
    Such is the manner in which          I
                                       prepare cement.     There
are two methods of employing it : either above a pavement
of brick, or below it. The former appears to be the most
solid during the first year, while the other suffers the rain
water to filter through      it,
                             but at the end of certain time

acquires the most perfect solidity.
    As time destroys the timber on which the mortar          it is
                                                          placed,
when    a terrace isintended to be made on       floor
                                                     a   must be
coarsely covered with sand and clay        when this covering
                                             :                           is
dry, another, composed of mortar and pretty fat sand, must
be placed over   it: there   no necessity for cutting the bricks,
                             is
and the upper surface must be rough or notched with chisel.     a
This pavement must have an inclination sufficient to make
the water run off.
    In the month of July, when the two coverings are very
dry, the cement composed in the above manner must be ap
plied in bands of two feet in breadth two workmen are
                                                 ;

inches and a half lo three in thickness; the covering on
which it is placed ought to be moistened with niilk of quick
lime ; and the cement must be pressed down closely with
the trowel, taking care to beat it with the (harp edge of that
instrument. It is smoothed by the back of the trowel slightly
moistened. The surface of the cement must be again pressed
down, to bury the coarser parts and render the whole smooth.
When the first band is finislied the workman proceeds to a
second, and the two bands must be carefully united to pre
vent their separation.
    This cement soon dries, and at the end of an hour can sus
tain a strong pressure.      It must, however, be left seven or
 eight days;     after which   the surface of it is to be slightly
 moistened, and then pressed down and smoothed by means
 of flat -stones in the fame manner as marble is polished. This
 last precaution is essentially necessary, and the solidity of the
 cement will depend on the care with which it has been per
 formed.      When the terrace has been constructed in this
 manner, the aggregation of the cement becomes stronger,
 and its pores are smaller and less numerous.
     In order that the cement mav succeed perfectly, it must
 be made during the great heats of July, that the superabun
 dant water may evaporate, and that it may be perfectly dry
  before the autumnal rains. At the end of August, boil pitch,
  such as that used for ships, and spread it over the cement by
  means of large brushes.        As this coating would render the
  cement not fit to be touched during summer, this inconve
  nience may be remedied in the following manner : — Take
  lime, slaked in the open air and reduced to fine powder, and,
  having sprinkled it over the pitch, remove, by means of a
  broom, the superfluous part of the lime which does not ad
  here to it.    This lime, by combining with the pitch, will
  form with it a very thin stratum of cement similar to the
  maltha of the Romans.         At the beginning of October a se
  cond stratum of pitch and lime must be laid on.
     The second method of employing the cement is to place it
  immediately over the stratum of brick and clay, and then to
  cover it with a pavement of brick, mortar, and sand".     I have
  two terraces, fifteen fathoms in length and one and a half in
  breadth, which appear to me to have the greatest solidity.
  They are not so beautiful as those where the cement covers
  the brick; but they can stand every kind of friction or pres
 sure.
    After making a stratum of clay and sand, spread over it a
 stratum of cement four inches in thickness, well beaten, and

nave observed that,                    by
                           cutting, their strength       lessened, as-    is
it  destroys  their  upper  half-vitrified  surface:   nothing then
remains below but an earthy surface, which                soon pene       is
trated         by
             moisture, and which                     is

some time to filter through them in small quantity.              This
water charged with calcareous particles stops up the pores of
the cement; no more filtration takes place: and terraces of
thts kind have the greatest solidity, and are exceedingly cheap.

    of Vienna.     By L. Boj anus, M. D. Member of the Me
    dical Societies of Jena and Paris, and of the Society of the
    Observers   of Man.

           13. Organ     of the Infiiticl of exalting oneself.
  1   HE    organ in the middle of the interior edge of the pa-
rietals at the upper middle part, and a little towards the po
sterior of the head, gives us a true idea of the difficulties which,
oppose the researches of Dr. Gall, and at the fame time fur
nishes us with a striking example of the happy opinions of
this great observer.
    He found this organ well expanded in the chamois goat,
and still more in the bouquetin; he observed the same thing
in several men distinguished for their pride. It was difficult
to collect all these observations       into one point of view. But
when he considered that the chamois goat inhabits the most
elevated peaks of the mountains; that the bouquetin always
endeavours     to ascend higher j and that pride, when atten
tively  examined,     is only a desire of being superior to others;
he was persuaded that it must be this organ which produces
these effects different in appearance, and he considered it as.
the organ of the instinct of exalting oneself.
    The head of the proud man, carried upwards and back
wards, tends still more to confirm this opinion.
    [It appears to us that the picture of the proud man, con
trasted with that of the humble and modest, renders the truth,
of this idea still more striking. In the former, every thing is
directed upwards : the hair is highly frizzled ; the head is
elevated ; the eye-brows are arched upwards ; the eye-lids
are raised; the shoulders are straight ; he walks on tip-toe,
and looks on every thing around as beneath him.                 In the
latter the hair hangs down naturally ; the eye-brows, eye
lids, and head, are Towered, the body and knees are slightly-
bent : in a word, every thing denotes submission, and that
be has no wisli of being above others.]
                 14.   Organ   of  the Love   of Glory.
    If this organ is more extended on the fides, it forms that of
the love of glory; an inclination very analogous to pride.

    The function of the org-an which sliows itself at the poste

                                   I  2                            Dr.

Dr. Gall     he, however, has some reason? for considering this
               :
angle             of the organ of the love of truth, but he has
            as the feat
not yet collected a sufficient number of facts to be fulry con
vinced of it.
    [We find some difficulty in being persuaded that there is
any truth in regard to this function ascribed by Dr. Gall to
the last-mentioned organ.        It appears to us that an organ
placed   in the middle  of those  with which animals as well as
men are provided, cannot be destined to a faculty such as
truth, which belongs only to the latter.
    How ever, the caie with this faculty is perhaps the fame as
with that of pride, which in animals undergoes a great mo
dification : and we confess we have seen two men, one of
whom, distinguished by great veracity, was furnished with
this organ in the highest degree; whereas the other, who had
a most extraordinary propensity to falsehood, was so destitute
of    that his head at that place instead of a cavity exhibited
      it,
a protuberance.]
   In the anterior and inferior part of the frontal bone Dr.
Gall has found several organs the function of which          very              is
important.
   During his first researches he considered them as the or
gans of the different kinds of memory but finding afterwards
                                                     ;
that thev were not only reproductive but also productive; he
was induced to consider them as the organs of          particular    a
fense, and to establish on this observation the opinion, that
memory in general       only the reproductive action of all the
                             is
organs: imagination, on the other hand,         their productive
                                                            is
action.
   The spontaneous movement of the man who endeavours
to recollect something, seems to have     relation to these or
                                                     a
gans.    He carries his hand, as     involuntarily, to the base
                                               if
of the forehead.   This action, though not perceived          the              by
person who performs                it,
                               however constant, and
                                         is                 never             is
confounded with that already mentioned in speaking of the
organ of courage.
                     16.   Organ    of   the Sense   of  Locality.
     The       of the sense of locality occupies the anterior part
             organ
of      frontal bone which corresponds to the protuberances
      the
above the orbits {protuberantia supra-orbltales)         generally   ;   it
accompanies thole crania which are distinguished             large            by
frontal sinuses, and which always exhibit in the inside        ca                  a
vity corresponding   to an  eminence    of the  brain.
   When      acts reproductivcly
               it                     constitutes what we call the
                                              it
memory of locality (metnoria Ucalis)           on the other hand,
                                                     j
                                                            when

                     of Dr. Gall, of Vienna.                     133
 when it acts productively it determines the combinations of
 new localities.
    It is this organ which directs the blood-hound, in which it
 is very striking: it exists in all the birds of passage : it invites
 them to change their place of residence ; to undertake distant
voyages; and to find again their former place of-habitation :
the stork and swallow are provided with it in an eminent de
gree, and these are the animals which migrate to the greatest
distance from our countries.       Men furnished with it are ob
served to have a strong remembrance of places, and a desire
for travelling : it is therefore always found in able landskip
 painters.
    " A general who arranges his army, and who with one
look must observe all the localities of the country which it
occupies, cannot dispense with this organ." Of this, the
great Frederick was a striking example. At an advanced
age this organ is one of those which gradually decrease : it is
known also that memory of every, kind, and imagination, are
lost as a man grows old : the frontal sinuses are then increased
interiorly ; the action of the brain no longer opposes so much
 resistance to their expansion.
       17. Organ    of the Sense  of Fails   (Sensus Rerum).
    The fense of facts has its corresponding organ in the infe
rior and anterior part of the frontal bone, in the middle of
and belovv the preceding : it acts productively and reproduc-
tively, and in the latter cafe it supplies a remembrance of
facts and of things.
    It is an organ very necessary for education and instruction,
which absolutely require that one stiould rememher things
past : in old age it is subject to the same changes as the pre
ceding.
    Among animals the elephant is particularly distinguistu'd
by the expansion of this organ. This animal remembers,
with the greatest accuracy, every circumstance and fact which
has any relation to it.
    Among men we have found this organ not only in those
who had a great deal of memory in regard to facts and things,
 but also in those who might be called systematic heads, who
 arranged facts in order, and deduged conclusions from them ;
 and in those who had a ready conception, and who distin-
 gui shed themselves by a desire of knowing every thing.            It
 even appears to us that the operation of combining facts to
 deduce from them a result is one of the principal actions of
 this organ : the elephant, at least, which keeps in its trunk

the preceding evening, arranges several facts, and deduces
from them a result which is a real logical conclusion ; and
we are acquainted with no other organ in the elephant to
which this action can be referred^
     The automatons motion of a man who perceives that he
has acted wrong, seems to support these conjectures: he
strikes the middle of the forehead with his hand.
    1 8. The Organ       of Painting and of the  Sense for Colours.
     The organ of the fense for colours or of painting occupies
 the anterior part of the frontal bone below the orbit.           Dr.
 Gall has observed this organ in all painters of great talents.
     " As this discovery did not reach us till lately, we have
 been able to collect only a small number of observations :
 we have, however, observed it in some individuals; and it is
 very apparent in the head of Raphael, in the National Mu
 seum,    No. 57."
                 1
                   9. Organ of the Sense for Numbers.
     The organ which corresponds to the inferior and exterior
        of the frontal bone near the zvgomatic apophyfis of that
    one has the function of the fense of numbers: it exists in
 Eart
 men who have a retentive memory for numbers, and in arith
 meticians, who perform with great facility the combinations
  of calculation : it exists in that kind of pie which has the
  faculty of counting as far as nine ; the only instance known
  among animals.
      " We had occasion trt observe this organ on the head of a
  blind person at the Quinze-Vingts, who is distinguished by
  his arithmetical talents; and Dr. Gall has in his possession the
  busts of several men which furnish very instructive examples."
                     20.   Organ of the musical Sense.
      Below this organ is that of the musical fense, or sense of
  sounds.      It acts in the fame manner as the other organs,
                   and reproductively ; it gives a memory for refl
  {iroductively
    ecting sounds; it facilitates new combinations of musical
   compositions; it incites the bird? to sing: it acts in those
   which are learning to speak, and whose language is founded
   only on this remembrance of sounds.
      It is absolutely wanting in animals which have no musical
   fense; it is very apparent in the parrot and starling; and the
   great musicians Gluck, Mozart, Haydn, and Pleyel, furnish
   striking examples of it.
               21. Organ      of the Sense for Mechanics.
      In the lateral   and inferior part of the frontal bone is placed
   the organ of the     sense for mechanics. The castor, which cpr>-
                                                                siructs

                       of Dr. Gall, os Vienna.                   135
 structs edifices, is endowed with it in an eminent degree: it
 exists in the field-mouse, and in bird9 which build their nests
 with a great deal of art : it is found in men who have a ta
 lent the mechanical objects, who construct with ease any
 kind of machine,       and who distinguish themselves in the dif
 ferent   arts that require manual labour.       Though it be very
 difficult to judge of the existence of this organ when it is
only moderately expanded, " because the temforo-maxillary
muscle covers this part of the cranium, it is very eminent if
the faculty exists in a superior degree; and it is then one of
those organs respecting which there can be the least doubt.'*
                     32, Organ   of verbal Memory.
     Tn the interior of the orbit at the bottom of the superior
part is the organ of verbal memory ; it may be observed at
the time of its expansion by the influence it has on the posi
tion of the globe of the eye, which it always pushes forwards,
and more or less without the orbit.
     Persons provided with this organ easily retain words in
their memory.          Dr. Gall, when young, remarked this fa
culty in several of his schoolfellows, who were not only difiin-
             for this talent, but also for very protuberant eyes,
   'his was the first observation, which afterwards gave a direc
fuished
tion to all his researches.      A great many observations in re
gard to this organ have since confirmed the truth of its exist
ence and of its function.
               23.   Organ of the Sense for Languages.
     The organ at the exterior and superior part os the orbit is
called by Dr. Gall the organ of the fense for languages.          Its
presence has a considerable influence on the position of the
glob.e of the eye : it forces it dowqwards and towards the
nose, and increases its distance from the superior edge of the
orbit : in animals it does not exist, and therefore in the latter
the globe of the eye is directed more towards the exterior
and lateral part of the orbit.
     Its expansion is always accompanied with a-disiinguifhed
talent for languages : it is very striking in great philologues ;
and though it be difficult to judge externally of its existence,
we have observed that it has never escaped the acute eye of
Dr. Gall, and that, in regard to this point, he has never once
been deceived.
                  24.  Organ of Memcry    for Persons.
    The function of     the organ at the upper and interior part of
the    orbit  has  not yet been discovered by Dr. Gall ; b.ut severaj
                                  1 4                  observations

136           A Jborl    View of the Craniognomic      System
observations on man and animals, such as the clog and horse',
have induced him to suppose it to be the organ of memory
for persons.       Its expansion, like that of the preceding, mult
have an influence on the position of the eye ; it must con
tribute to remove it from the upper edge of the orbit, and to
push it towards the exterior and lateral part, if an equal ex
pansion of the preceding organ does not counterbalance its
effect.
                        4\5-  Organ   of Liberality.
     The orean of liberality is placed in the anterior part of the
frontal bone, above those of the sense of locality and of the
sense for painting          (16 and 18), and close to the musical
sense (20) : a very great expansion          of it accompanies prodi
gality : it is wanting in misers, and in these this part of the
frontal bone exhibits a cavity. Dr. Gall has in his possession
numerous examples of it.
     " The proximity of the organ of music and of the fense
for painting (18 and 21) seems often to favour the expansion
of that of liberality ; and this, perhaps, is one of the reasons
why we so often find prodigals among those men who excel
by their talents for these two arts."
     We constantly observe, that the older a man grows the
 more niggardly he becomes : at an advanced age, therefore,
 i.he diminution of this organ is so striking, that it sometimes
 gives rife to a \ery considerable            extension of the frontal
 linuses.
                 26. Organ of the Spirit of Comparison.
     The organ      ahove the fense for facts in the middle of the
 forehead      is destined for a faculty which Dr. Gall calls the
  comparative spirit (judicium comparativum) .                It forms an
  oblong    eminence,      and  is found  in men   who   in speaking have
  a ready command of figures or tropes ; who are not at a loss
  for expressions ; who relate well, and have a great deal of
   ioquence.
                  37. Organ of the metaphysical Spirit.
      If this  organ is more expanded towards the sides, so that
  it forms    a  round eminence which rises in the middle of the
  forehead, it indicates a metaphysical            spirit.     Among the
  busts of the antient philosophers that of Socrates in particular
 vassords one of the" most striking examples               of this organ.
   Among the modern philosophers, I shall mention only Kant,
   as one of the most celebrated.
      [I recollect that the sorehead of one of my first schoolfel
  lows, whom we styled the philosopher, on account of his at
                                                                 tachment

                       of Dr. Gall, of Vienna.                          137
tachment to the abstract            sciences,  exhibited a very sensible
 expansion of this organ.]
               28. Organ os the Spirit of Observation.
      The organ of the spirit of observation extends over the
 whole anterior part of the frontal bone, and its expansion
 brings the forehead nearer, in a greater or less degree, to the
 vertical line.     It is found in particular in the crania of the
 observers of all ages.         The celebrated physician Frank is en
 dowed with it in an eminent degree j and Dr. Gall himself
 is evidently furnished with it.
                   39.   Organ of the Spirit of Satire.
      The organ of       the   spirit for satire and wit (witz of the
  Germans^and facetiæ of the French,) corresponds to the
  frontal protuberances. Dr. Gall observed several examples
  which prove the truth of this opinion j and we have never
  found it to fail.
                          30. Organ of Mildness.
       The organ of mildness is situated in the middle of the sore
  head above that of the spirit of comparison (26).                It forms
  that oblong elevation which is constantly found in the heads
   of Christ and Mary painted by Raphael and Coreggio, and
   greatly contributes to give them an engaging character of
   mildness and benevolence: it always accompanies the crania
   of men naturally mild, and is wanting in those who are ma
   levolent and revengeful *.
    "
       Among animals, the roe-buck, hind, pigeon, &c. are pro
   vided with it : on the other hand, it is wanting in animals of
           such as the eagle, starling, tiger, fox, &c. The frontal
   Crey,
      one, then, instead of being arched and elevated, is depressed
    and hollow.
                    3 1 . Organ     of Theatrical Talents.
        A very striking enlargement of the summit of the frontal
    bone arises from the expansion of the organ for representing
    sentiments by gestures, or of theatrical talents.
        " Dr. Gall has collected many observations which prove
    the truth of this opinion; and it cannot fail to, be observed
    by those who examine with attention the heads of the great
  . actors of the different theatres of Paris."
         [We think we have observed also that this organ is par
    ticularly expanded in the deaf and dumb; and this we ascribe
    to the necessity which these persons are under of keeping it in
        • That mildness which results from the
                                                  principles of morality is not
     here meant, but that which exists by instinct, without being the conse
     quence of moral reflection,
                                                                   continual

  continual action — an exercise which        must  necessarily  favour
  the improvement of it.]
                       32, Organ     of Theosopbia.
     The organ of theosophia occupies the most elevated part of
  the frontal bone. AH the representations of the old faints
  preserved to us afford very instructive examples; and if there
  be one destitute of this character, it is certain that it is also
  void of expression.
     An excejjive expansion of it is observed in religious fana
  tics, and in men become religious by superstition. It is the
 feat of this organ which, according to Dr. Gall, has induced
  all nations to consider their gods as above them in an ele
 vated place in the heavens.        When we consider, indeed, this
 object with a philosophic eye, there is no more reason for
 placing the deity above the globe than below it.
                      33. Organ of Perseverance.
     The last of the organs hitherto found by Dr. Gall is that
 of perseverance, constancy, and firmness of character : it is
 situated at the anterior and superior part of the parietals in the
 middle of the head.       When it exists in excess it gives obsti
 nacy ; and inconsistency is the consequence of a want of it.
     " In regard to those parts of the cranium in which Dr,
 Gall has not yet found organs, it is probable that his further
 researches will some day enable him to discover more; and
 the work he intends to publish will furnish us with further
 details on the subject.       It belongs therefore to him to con
 vince us, in   an  incontrovertible manner, of the truth of his
system, a detail of which cannot be satisfactory in a treatise
so incomplete."
     We find it necessary to remark also, that all the organs
 here enumerated cannot be distinctly perceived but in indi-
vi luals who possess anv faculty in an eminent degree ; and
 that it is impossible to judge properly of a moderate talent,
¦when its organ is too much confounded with the neighbour-.
ing    ones.
     "  In regard to the objections made to the system o Dr.
Gall, that it leads immediately to materialism, we do not see
the philosophical reasons on which it is founded.              Even if
we suppose organs for the interior faculties, the immense di
stance between thought and matter still remains the fame ;
objects of so heterogeneous a nature are not susceptible of being
classed together.      Besides, the will still remains entire: it is
it  which    ought to  counterbalance     the action of the organs)
and tbc passions ought      to be  restrained by morality.

     an Ichneumon        brought  from Egypt
I
in
     N
      the
          the middle of April 1802, C. Aimet, chef de bataillon
            corps of engineers, brought to Rome a young ichneu
mon which he had caught in Egypt.                           I  took the earliest
opportunity        of   examining     it  ;  and,   as   I made   some very in
teresting       observations   in  regard      to the  natural   history of this
animal,       I  communicate      them      to  you  with   pleasure.
     The Greeks and the Romans called it the ichneumon : it
is the mangoujie of Buffon, and the mus Pbaraonis of Pro
sper Alpinus.           It is a pretty animal, about the size of a cat,
with a long tail ; its hair is rough and of considerable length;
it cannot be compared to any thing better than the bristles
 of the wild boar. It is radiated transversely with three co
 lours, viz. grayish white, fawn or russet colour, and black.
Each hair has five or six transverse rings, like the quills of the
 porcupine : the length of these hairs from the body is an inch
 or an inch and a naif; they are shorter on the tail, and in
 particular at the head, which gives to the animal a neat ap
 pearance.
      The head, and particularly the muzzle, are very small ;
 it has beautiful teeth like those of the dog ; two canine, fix
  incisive teeth, and eight grinders in each mandible, making
  in the whole thirty-two. It has small ears of a brown co
  lour without hair ; they adhere to the head like those of apes.
  Its eyes are small and lively. An observation which I made
  in regard to the eyes will be mentioned hereafter.
       Its colour varies a great deal according to the place in
  which it is viewed.           When observed towards the fide of the
   head it appears to be grayish black ; when looked at behind,
  it appears to be reddish.              The legs, and particularly those
  before, are short : it has five toes on each foot, four before and
   one smaller behind.           The two middle toes on each foot are
   longer.       The nails are black, like those of the dog.
         The young ichneumon is very familiar and domestic : it
   is fond of being caressed; it is much afraid of cold; and
   though the temperature of Rome is very mild, it was gratified
   by having a covering now and then thrown over it; some
   times even a chaffing-disti was placed near it. Very often it
   Jies down in a round form on a chair or on the bed, which

 it  leaps upon with great agility, and conceals its head be
 tween its thighs to keep itself warm.
    This individual is a female:1 it has below its parts of sex
 a large bag, which has been described by all naturalists : it is
 asserted that during the great heats it opens this bag in order
to cool itself.      Jonston gives a very good description of this
 conduit, which is as follows: — " Meatum denique extra
 foramen excrementi peramplum, undique pilis cinctus, pu-
dendo muliebri non disfimilem, quern magno urgenti cætu
operiri solet.       Hinc scriplores omnes indiscriminatim ich-
neumones et mares et fceminas arbitrati sunt*."                      From this
conduit an odoriferous liquor distills : the individual in ques
 tion, on the approach of a dog, opens this bag, and the dog

    The figure given by Buffon is          very good, and has a perfect
resemblance       to the individual here described.            The figure of
 Aldrovandi is also very correct.             The cafe, however, is not
the fame with those ot Jonston and Prosper Alpinus.
    In regard to the description which Buffon has given of the
mangoulte, it is traced out with the fame pencil which has
so  well delineated the other animals             :  he has separated      fable

aud a half in length from the head to the extremity of the tail.

                On an Ichneumon brought from Egj'pt.                 141
from history, and has described its habits with great pro
priety.      Two observations, however, which I had an op
portunity of making, and which appear of importance, seem
to have escaped him.
     ist. That the animal has a kind of interior eye-lid, which
passes over the globe of the eye as in nocturnal birds ; but
with this difference, that in the eye of owls this membrane
rises and falls in a direction which        I  would call perpendicu
lar from the bilj to the summit of the head, while in the in
dividual in question it proceeds laterally from the nostrils lo
the e.ir; which induces me to believe that the animal seeks
its prey in the night-time. By means of this interior eye
lid it contracts the pupil at pleasure, and it must then see in
obscurity, like the cats ; but in the latter the pupil is lessened
 and dilated by contraction; whereas in this animal the fame
thing is effected without contraction, and, as we may fay,
by mechanical means.
     2d. That the four toes of the fore- as well as hind-feet are
 connected to each other by a brown membrane without hair,
 such as that of amphibious animals.                I extended its toe3
 and examined this membrane, which is folded backwards,
 so that when the animal walks it is not seen.             This certainly
 indicates that the animal swims with great facility.
      This character proves that it ought to be classed among
 amphibious animals.             Jonston fays of the ichneumon : —
 " Amphibium est animal et ad Niloticas ripas commoratur."
 Aldrovandi also considers it as amphibious : his words are :
 "    Ab ordinis rations non esse alienum opinamur, si post
 Jutram ichneumonis historiam recenscamus, quoniam et ipse
  inter animalia afjupoiept^aura, id est promiscuain aquis et terrS.
  degentia, reponamur, ideoque a nonnullis lutra Ægypti nun-
  cupatur*." He quotes also Strabo, who is of the fame opi
  nion. " Strabo quoque hanc belluam aquatilem consistere
  videtur."
      However, though these respectable authors have considered
  this animal as amphibious f> none of them have mentioned
  the skin on its feet, which forms a kind of fins. Aristotle,
   Pliny, and Prosper Alpinus, are equally silent respecting it.
   Though this character seems very essential in the description
   of an animal which frequents the banks of rivers; while, on
   the other hand, they have carefully noticed this peculiarity in
   the feet of the otter and in those of the castor.          After what
       *  Aldrovandi  de quad, die- p- *9?.
       f  I take the word amphibious in the same sense in which it was
   taken by the antients ; for this term, strictly speaking, can be applied
   only to the faaiiiy of the pboc*.
                                                                       has

 T42         On an Ichneumon troughs from Egypt.
 has been here said, will it be asserted that this is not the cafe?
By no    means ; for there is no opposing facts.
   Buffon in his description of this animal exclaims against
nomenclators and generic denominations.               I know that
science will make little progress when people are prejudiced
In favour of their systems ; but there are certain characters
so striking in some animals that no error can be committed
in classing them. He reproaches Linnæus with having
made the ichneumon at first a badger, then a ferret ; yet it
certainly belongs to neither of these species.
   Had he observed that skin or sort of fins which it has on
its feet, he would certainly have classed it among the amphi
bious quadrupeds after the castors and beavers, which have a
similar membrane between their toes.         Klein calls it lutra
Ægypti * ; but he does not speak of fins. Besides, as the
ichneumons frequent the banks of the rivers in Egypt, where
they search in the sand for the eggs of the crocodile, of
which they are exceedingly fond, or go in quest of those ser
pents which the Nile leaves among the mud after its inun
dations, they must be obliged to cross, by swimming, some
arms of the river or some canals in order to find their prey.
For this reason nature has provided them with fins, and the
conformation of the eye induces me to believe that they
must also search for their food in the night-time.          To this
fact I shall add the decided taste which the individual in
question has for fifli, which seems to prove that the ichneu
mon in its wild state eats this food.
   As this animal will soon be at Paris, vou will be enabled
to examine it yourself, and to verify my observations. I have
no doubt that others will be brought from Egypt : you can
examine whether the peculiarities 1 have described be com
mon to all ichneumons, or belong only to some families.
   If this animal should unfortunately die before it arrives at
Paris, for it has suffered a great deal by the change of cli
mate, and these animals, besides, do not live to a great age,
you will fee the beautiful picture of it which M. Aimel
caused to be executed by M. Peter, an excellent artist in this
department, who has represented it with the greatest exact
ness possible.   Two figures of it are delineated under two
points of view. M. Peter kept it at his house for a fortnight,
to study its deportment and attitudes, in order that he might
be able to give a correct representation of it.

XXIII. Of      tb* State   of Vapour subsisting in           the Atmosphere*
     By  Richard       Kirwan,          Esq.   LL.D. F.R.S.              and
     P. R.I. A.*
 V    A POUR      or moisture in the atmosphere may subsist in
dense air, or in air highly rarefied : that it is found in the
former is well known, and th3t it may subsist in the latter
appears by the observations        of Bougucr ; for he saw clouds
three or four hundred toises above Chiromboracho,               and
consequently     at the height  of  twenty-two  thousand  five hun
dred and twenty-eight English feet, or 4*3 miles over the
level of the sea; a height at which in the temperature of 32°
a barometer would stand at 12*7 inches.           At such heights,
and at much inferior, since evaporation proceeds much more
quickly, it is not to be supposed that all the vapour so rapidly
produced is dissolved in the ambient air, but part rises un-
combined, as it does under an exhausted or half-exhausted re
ceiver, and in this cafe Mr. De Luc's system is admissible.
This emission of pure vapour seems to begin at heights at
which the density of the air is 25, (that       is,
                                                at neights at which
 she barometer would stand at twenty-five inches, and thus                I
 shall in future express the various densities of air,) at least           it

 leads me to treat of the properties and state of pure invi
 sible vapour, namely, its specific heat, elasticity, and specific
 gravity.
     The immortal Doctor Black, the father of all discoveries
 of this kind, informed me that ihe vapour of water, boiling
 at 2120, that  is,  at 1800 above the freezing point, and posses
 sing   the some  sensible heat as the water, contains nine hun
 dred and forty times more latent heat than an equal weight
 of water does heated to 2120, or 5-222 times more latent heat
 than     itdoes of sensible heat, counting from the freezing
 point, for 180 X 5-222 = 940 nearly.              In this cafe the
 pressure or density of the atmosphere        thirty, the barometer
                                               is

                                                    j
 Black's account the experiments of Mr. Schmidt of Giessen
 very nearly agree; for according to him the latent heat of the
 vapour of water, barometer 2984 inches, and the heat 212%
     5*33 times greater than its sensible heat above the freezing

   Mr. Watt discovered that the latent heat of steam dimi
nished in proportion as its sensible heat increased, Phil. Trans,
1784, p. 335. Now the sensible heat of steam exceeds 1800
above the freezing point when the barometer stands above
thirty inches, and less than 180° when the barometer stands
lower than thirty inches, as Mr. De Luc first discovered, and
may be seen in Sir George Schuckburgh's and Mr. De Luc's
tables, Phil. Trans. 1779, p. 375. trom these              I have de

                          25 inches is evidently the diminution of
 resistance, from the diminished weight of the atmosphere,
 which then is very sensible : but as the cold continually pro
 duced by evaporation ii then also very considerable,          the time
 necessary to procure ebullition is longer, as Saussure remarked
 on Mount Blanc. Vol. vii. in 8vo, § 201 1, p. 328.                 He
 found the heat of ebullition barometer 16 to be 68*993 c*c-
 erees, or in English measures barometer 17 "05. 185-5° of
 Fahr. (counting one of Reaumur at Geneva = 2*225 °f
 Fahr.)
    Hence since, according to Mr. Watt, the sensible heats of
 the vapours of boiling water at different baromeirical heights
 are as the barometrical heights reciprocally, and the specific
                                                                  heats

                      subsisting in the Atmosphere.                    145
heats    of the vapours     of  water  boiling  are as the sensible heats
reciprocally, it being known, that the specific heat of the va
pour of water heated to 180 degrees above the freezing point
is 940. The specific or latent heat of the vapour of boiling
water, whose sensible heat is known, (and it may be known
by the barometrical height as shown in the above table and
the notes; may also be discovered.
     Thus the sensible heat of the vapour of boiling water baro
meter 30 being 180° above the freezing point (2 i2J— 32° =
 1800) and the specific or latent heat of vapour, whose sensible
heat is 208-56° (that is 176-56 above 320) as it is when the
barometer stands at 28 inches, is 958 for -H- 176*56. 180 : :
 940958*.
     As pure invisible vapour does not in my opinion (of which
 I   have already stated the grounds) exist in the atmosphere
 when its density is higher than 25, as it is in most of the in
 habited parts of the globe, but is always in this cafe united to
 air, an inquiry into its latent heat at different temperatures
 below ebullition were superfluous.            But as it does exist in air
 whose density is 25 or less, since it is found in air whose den
 sity is 12-5, it becomes necessary to examine its latent heat in
 such cases, in all temperatures inferior to that of ebullition.
 Now, by analogy, I apprehend this latent heat in all inferior
 temperatures may thus be determined.
     As the sensible heat of ebullition, when the barometer is
 at 25 or below 25, is to the latent heat of the vapour at ebul
 lition, so is the sensible heat of water heated to any inferior
 degree above 33° to the latent heat of its vapour, multiplied
 by 5*222. Thus the sensible heat of water in ebullition baro
 meter 25 being 171-4° ( — 203-4°— 320) its specific heat is
 987    (
          = —~   —)       the latent heat    of  the vapour    of water at
 23° above congelation (that is 52" on Fahr. scale) is 657
 for -i I7i"4° 987 :: 22°. 116 X 5*22 = 657.                    The latent
 heat of vapour in such cases cannot be determined by experi
 ment, on account of the admixture of atmospheric air: we
 must therefore resort to analogy, which in this cafe is perfect.
     The latent heat of pure vapour at greater heights is more
 considerable : thus at heights, at which the barometer stands
 at 20 inches, the latent heat of vapour whose temperature is
 22° above 32°, as in the last cafe, is 730; for the heat of
 ebullition is 194-8°, per table, = 1628", above 32': and
 the latent heat of the vapour at ebullition is 1039.              Now -H*
  162-8. 1039 : : 23. 140 and 140 X 5"32 = 730.

    The elasticity or expansive force of pure vapour has been
examined at every sitth degree of Reaumur above o to uo°,
by Mr. Betancoiirt, and may be seen in an excellent work of
Prony's, his ArcbiteBure Hydraulique          he has     most in
                                                         :                by   a
genious calculation interpolated the expansions answering to
the intermediate degrees.       But Mr. Schmidt seems to have
determined this expansive force still more exactly than Betan
 coiirt.   Hence    Ihere insert this table, adding Fahrenheit's
 for Reaumur's degrees, and distinguistiing the expansions in
 terpolated    bycalculation from those actually observed                               by  I.

   2do. Mr. Pictet has also made a set of curious experiments
on the elasticity of pure vapour in low temperatures. EJsais
de Pbyjique, p. 157.       He found that a grain of warm water
in vacua evaporates in forty minutes in the temperature of
38° Fahr. under a receiver containing 1452 English cubic
inches *', but th-tt it did not diffuse itselt equally in less than fix
hours, and then raised the hygrometer from 170 to 6o°, that
is 43"; and during this whole time the cold under the re
ceiver was constantly decreasing, though slowly ; which de
crease undoubtedly contributed to the diffusion of the va
pour.
   Mr. Schmidt has also made a series of experiments upon,
the dilatability of air, made as dry as possible by exposure to
hot tartarin— an object of great importance, that had never
before been examined.        This table I here insert, converting
Reaumur's degrees into those of Fahr. and adding from his

148         Conjectures respecting the   Origin of  Stones
    Note  — 1°. Hence we see that 1000 inches or measures of
dry   air at 32 would become 1004-4675 at 34*25 Fahr. and
 at 500 would become 1017-87.         Hence 1000 measures of dry
 air gain -9^5555, &c. by each decree of Fahr. above 32s
 (or more compendiously 1-9856, which is true to two decimal
 places) or nearly two,
     ado. We fee the source of the discordant results of
 D'.-imontons, De Luc, Lambert, Schuckburgh, Roy, Ber-
 tholiet, and Monge, &c. ; for they all operated upon air more
 impregnated with various degrees of moisture; besides taking
 the boiling point at different barometrical heights ; in the
 present experiments it was taken at 29-841 English inches.
     3H0. It appears that the expansions are as the differences of
 heat above 32% as D'Amontons, Lambert and Schuckburgh
 also noticed; though their experiments, not being made on
 perfectly dry air, could not be very exact.

 XXIV.      Some Conjectures     respecting    the Origin os   Stones
    •which have been observed to       fall  from   the  Clouds.  By
    William Bkauford, A.M.*
   J.  H E falling of stones from the clouds, a natural phæno-
 menon not generally understood, is by no means a novel cir
 cumstance in the history of nature. Several stones were ob
 served to fall from the clouds in Yorkfliire in 1360, in Bohe
 mia and Saxony in 1480, in Bohemia about 1753, in Si
 enna in 1794, in Portugal in 1796, in Yorkfliire in Enffland
  in 1795, and near Benares in the East Indies in 1798. From
  an analysis made of these stones by the French academicians
 in 1768, and by the Royal Society of London in 1802, they
  are all found similar in their component parts to each other,
  but distmiilar to all bodies found in mines and quarries, being
  composed principally of four kinds of substances : the first
  being in the form of dark grains, composed of silex, mag
  nesia, iron, and nickel ; the second, a kind of pyrites ; the
  third, metallic iron-; and the fourth, a gray earthy substance
  which serves as a cement to the others, and with which they
 were coated.      From these compositions the matter seems to
  be of volcanic origin ; yet it is difficult to conceive how stones
  of any considerable magnitude could be thrown at such a di
  stance from any volcano as those found in Bohemia, Saxony,
  and Britain.    The nearest volcanos to .Britain are those of
  Vesuvius,  Ætna,    and Hecla : a stone to be thrown into Bri-

by   the electric tire, whereby the minerals are generated and
united to the earths, and consequently fall in the form ot
stones. Thus stones,     bymeans of electricity, are formed        the             in

and sulphuric gases, containing the generic principles of iron,
magnesia, and nickel, &c. : these, uniting with siliceous, ar
gillaceous and calcareous earths, produce in great quantities
that species of iron ore termed bog ore, and that in much
greater quantities than is generally imagined.     T hese ores are
produced in lumps from 40 to 100 lbs. and more in weight,
containing from one-fourth to one-half of pure metallic iron,
intermixed with pyrites and vitrified substances resembling
glass and petrified (hells, the inhabitants of fresh-water lakes.
Whence it is evident that a number of petrifactions and mi
neralizations are performed by water and air assisted by the
electric fluid alone ; and a number of the operations of nature
have been attributed by philosophers to the effects of fire, and
deemed volcanic, which are the effects of the aqueous and
pneumatic elements.
   In order to ascertain in some respects the truth of this
proposition by experiment, I caused a quantity of gas, libe
rated from water by means of steel filings and vitriolic acid,
to be received in a glass vessel, to which was added carbonic
acid from the fumes of charcoal and sulphuric gas, with the
fine dust of chalk and earth, until the whole appeared a dark
thick cloud. The electric spark being then passed through
it,   flash of light and
      a                      smart detonation ensued.
                             a                          After this
operation the cloud became more transparent, leaving at the
bottom of the vessel     aquantity of water, with   gray powder,
                                                       a
evidently metallic, mixed with earth.        If
                                              the experiment had
been performed on    a   larger scale, and the ingredients varied,
the result might have been more decided, and the phænome-
non more accurately demonstrated.
   This   is  subject that merits ever)' philosophic investiga
               a
tion.     The magnitude of the stones undoubtedly depends
on the quantity of generating matter, and the height from
whence    it falls; yet, how stones of such       weight as that
                                                   a
which fell     inYorkshire could be formed in the air, might be
a subject of doubt, if   the substance had not been found of the,,
same nature as those which fell         Bohemia and Sienna. But
                                       in
it ought to be considered that these substances are not formed
instantaneous in the clouds: the constituting matter, pre
cipitated      bythe electric ftiock,    thrown
                                        is             by

                                                        falling, it
becomes enveloped in the terra cemenlium with which the
matter    is mixed.    Whence, the greater the height or range
the matter has to pass through from the time of the electric
shock, the larger will be the stones.        Most     not all the

which descend on the earth ; whilst the more light, or those
which are composed only of inflammablegases, mount into the
upper regions of the atmosphere, where, taking fire, they fly
off" in luminous vapours.      The height to which some of these
vapours are carried before they are decomposed is amazing;
reaching into regions where we should imagine the atmosphere
would not be of sufficient density to sustain them.             But the
natural history of the terrestrial atmosphere has not yet been
fully investigated; nor the power and effects of electricity in
the formation of lithological, mineralogical, vegetable, and
animal substances ; — subjects that demand the attention of
the most able chemists and sagacious philosophers.

XXV.      On the Hydrometer.        By William           Spber, Esq.
   Supervisor and AJsayer of Spirits in the Port        of Dublin*.
  X HE hydrometer, or areometer, as it is called, is an in
strument which ascertains the density of liquids, weighing
unequal masses with the fame weight.
    This instrument is of great antiquity, and until lately it
was supposed to have been invented at the end of the fourth
century, bv Hypatia, the daughter of Theon, the celebrated
mathematician of Alexandria: but M. Usebc Salverte, in a
memoir on this subject, in the Annales de Cbimie, vol. xxii.
has demonstrated      its having been invented by Archimedes
three hundred years before the period in which Hypatia was
born ; and the very elegant Latin description he gives of this
instrument, from an author of great antiquity, (hows that,
in the form, several of thole now in use differ but little from
that of the original invention.
    This instrument, from the facility and expedition with
which it may be applied, has long been in use for ascertain
ing the specific gravity of various kinds of liquids ; but its
application to the particular purpose to which it is now used
is comparatively of modern date.
   * Extracted from his " Enquiry into the Causes of the Errors and Irre
gularities which take place in ascertaining tht Strengths of Spirituous
Liquors, &c. London 180*"
                                 K  4                             Until

1£2                            On   the    Hydrometer.
    Until within a period of about forty years, the strengths of
spirituous liquors were mostly ascertained by other modes,
both in Great Britain, Ireland, and on the Continent.
    Proof by oil, by agitation, by firing gunpowder, by alka
line salts, and by glass bubbles, has been used, but in every
ease found
              defe^ive ; and the hydrometer was at length re
sorted to, as an instrument calculated to ascertain these
strengths with less trouble and greater accuracy.
    To obtain indications of strengths by it correctly, how
ever, depends on circumstances that have not, until lately,
been sufficiently understood or ascertained; on which account
the instrument has been complicated in various ways, by
weights and sliding rules : these, in some cases, have rather
increased than diminished its irregularity.
    The object of the following inquiry is therefore to bring
into one view all the causes of those imperfections and irre
gularities, and, by so doing, to prepare the way for their
removal.
    Those irregularities have arisen from several causes.         In
the first place, when Clarke's hydrometer was constructed
 (forty years ago), the effects of expansion by heal, and con
traction by cold, on the specific gravity of spirituous liquors,
had not been accurately ascertained; nor was the diminution
of bulk by penetration (or concentration, as it is improperly
 called,) well understood.
     In this state of ignorance of these effects, Clarke's hydro
 meter was conceived to be a great improvement on that which
 had been in use before it. Precisely the same kind of advance
 in improvement had been made in the Irish hydrometer, some
 what nearly about the same period. The duty on spirits in
 both kingdoms previous to this time was paid only on two
 denominations, viz. single and double spirits : the former was
 proof, or under     it,
                       and the latter all such as were over proof;
 and this discrimination of strength was made cither
                                                                    of by
                                                                rude    a
  fort of instrument which hardly deserved the name          hydro
  meter, or   by  dropping oil into the spirit      the oil floated,
                                                          :    if
it   was called single     ;  funk,

to the relative increase of overproof, were considered great
improvements ; and though, from the construction of Clarke's
hydrometer, it was evident that the variations occasioned by
¦change    of      temperature              were       then somewhat          known;         yet     in
Ireland the effects of these variations were conceived so im
material, am! the numerous weights attached to this instru
ment, the difficulty of understandirvg          the certain delay    it,
and probability of mistake, were considered to be lo objection-
ble, that       was deemed better to use an hydrometer which
               it
paid no regard to temperature, than to use cue liable to so
many other objections.          The variations       the ordinary             by
 change of temperature being, however, from cue to fifteen
per cent., this defedl in the construction of the risti hydro                       1
 meter    is    manifest, that
               so                   preiumed     would be waste

 of time to attempt any demonstration of its incompetency.
     Although Clarke's hydrometer has not been constructed
 without       reference to temperature, yet this has been al-
               a
                       part; and the instrument being otherwise
                              it in
 tended to only
 very   defective,     will be necessary to exhibit these defects,
 in order that they may be guarded against in such hydrometer
 as shall be adopted instead of it.
     Till Clarke's hydrometer was adopted, which, from the best
 information       can obtain, took place about the year 1762,
                     I
 proof spirit   was  made     mixing equal portions of water and
                                           by
  the strongest spirit which could         procured but         be
                                                             being                 :        it
  sometimes difficult to obtain this proof spirit for comparison,
  such a   mixture was made        order of the honourable board
                                                  by
  of excise; and       was found, that when (ix gallons of
                              it                              were                           it
  mixed with one gallon of water, wine gallon of the mixturea
  weighed seven pounds thirteen ounces avoirdupoife: the board
   therefore declared, that the spirituous liquor, of which the
  gallon weighed seven pounds thirteen ounces, should be
   reckoned one to fix, or one in seven under proof.
      This definition of proof was adopted in order to accord
   with   a mode of examination which had been long in use,
   and sanctioned                by
                        the board.
      The hydrometer said to be invented         Mr. Clarke was          by                      *

  E eing that only which weighed an exact number of pounds
  and ounces, without a fractional part, per gallon, by the
  statute of the 2d of George III. this obscure mode of ascer
 taining proof was adopted.               At this time, the effects of heat
  and cold, on the trial of the strength of spirits by the hydro
 meter, had not been clearly understood ; and though Clarke's
 hydrometer, which was then adopted, by having, in addition
 to the weights used for ascertaining the strengths of spirits,
 another set of weights called weather weights, adapted to
 several temperatures,           is a demonstration that these effects
 were not altogether unknown ; yet they were considered so
 immaterial as not to require the mention of temperature in
 the act of parliament. This omission has added considerably
 to the irregularities of the various hydrometers' since in use,
 as by it the legal standard for proof is rendered very uncer
 tain, and will, by the ordinary change of temperature, vary

     I here beg leave to quote an observation of sir Charles
 Blagden, from ihe Proceedings of the Royal Society in 1790,
 in his Report on the best Method of proportionating the
 Excise upon Spirituous Liquors made by Desire of Govern
 ment :
     " By the act of 2(1 George III. it is ordered, that the
 gallon of brandy or spirits, of the strength of one to fix under
 proof, shall be taken and reckoned at seven pounds thirteen
 ounces (which is understood by the trade to mean 55 of
 heat).       Hence taking the weight of a gallon of water at the
 fame heat to be 81b. 5 oz. and 66 parts, the specific gravity
 of this diluted spirit will be found 9335 at 60 : this specific
 gravity indicates a mixture of 107 grains of water with 100
 grains of pure spirit ; whence, by a computation founded on
 the tables in this report, the specific gravity of proof spirit
 will come out 916 : but the rules of correction belonging to
Dicas and Quin's hydrometer give the specific gravity of proof
 spirits about 922, at 55, equivalent to 920, at 60.                      The
former, 916, corresponds to a mixture of 100 parts of spirit
with 62 by measure, or 75 by weight of water ; and the lat
ter, 920, to a mixture of ico parts of spirit, and 66 by mea-
recours a la methode de Fahrenheit : j'ai vu depuis, qu'elle avoit etc mise
en usege pr.r M. Hrilson.      J'ciucnds par cette methode cclle de 1'areomc-
tre itiiiaili par Hahienlieit, ct sijivi par Clarke et Desaguliers." He aftei-
wards describes    the instrument,      and condemns it for its complications,
and being improperly graduated : from this it would appear that this in
strument was invented by Fahrenheit,        and not by Clarke,
                                                                        sure,

sure, or 80 by weight of water.             The difference is considera
ble,   but  the  first   is  undoubtedly, most conformable to the
existing   acts of  parliament :         if,

to preserve the term proof spirit in our excise laws,                 may be

understood to mean spirit whose specific gravity                    916, and
                                                                     is

at 60 degrees of heat."
    From this extract        it appears there are no less than three
imperfections    in    this  manner     of defining proof spirits. First,
the spirit defined      is not proof, but another spirit, one lo six,
or one in seven, under proof, requiring                 subsequent process
                                                        a
to make proof      : secondly, the difficulty of procuring an exact
gallon measure.
     The late ingenious Mr. Ramsden, in publication on this
                                                      a
 subject, printed in 1792, speaking of the standard of proof,
says  :  " Hydrometer-makers differ on this point                   per cent,
                                                                     V
                                                                     7               j
 and government, to avoid disputes, have been under the ne
 cessity of passing an act to constitute Clarke's hydrometer (for
a   short time) the only legal one, though                it   is,
                                                               in all proba
 bility, as vague as any of the others, particularly in spirits
 considerably higher than proof. An obstacle to ascertaining
 this term (fays he) arises from the difficulty of obtaining prac
 tically the exact capacity of our gallon measure:                         in
                                                                          it   is,
 deed, stated to contain 231 cubic inches; yet, notwithstand
 ing the great pains taken               by  committee of the house of
                                               a
 commons, about the year 1758, for that purpose, assisted by
 several ingenious mechanics, this point was left undeter
 mined.      The method they used was making hollow cubes
 of different dimensions, from one inch upwards, which were
 executed with great care           bythe late Mr. J. Bird, and are now
 in the repository of the house of commons but whoever con:
 siders the difficulty of making an exact cube, and that of
 ascertaining the inside calibre with precision, must be sensible
 that no great reliance can be had on the exactness of gallon             a
 measure obtained        by  this method."
     Thirdly, that no temperature being mentioned, the strength
is   doubtful  ;and though sir Charles, in this part of his Re
  port (which has not,        [  believe, been contradicted), fays the
  trade considers the temperature to be 55, and that proof spirit
  should be as he states,          by thg .unerring test of the specific
  gravity 916, at 60, (and which would be 918, at 55                        yet;)
  the specific gravity of proof spirit,            byClarke's hydrometer,
 is   924, at 55 of temperature.
      From this    itappears, that even Quin's and Dicas's stand
  ards of proof are erroneous to au extent of three per cent.                        ;
                                                                           and

  156                     On the Hydrometer.
 and that Clarke's is nearly four and a half different from the
 strength prescribed by the statute : this is supposing the tem
 perature to be what sir Charles fays it is considered by the
 trade.
    In Ireland the standard of proof is still more uncertain, no
 definition of it whatever appearing on the statute, but resting
 solely on the practice which prevailed in England prior to the
 ad of his present majesty, viz. mixing water with an equal por
 tion of rectified spirits of wine, as it is called, no specific gra
 vity of the spirit mentioned, and the spirit, called rectified spirit
 of wine, differing materially in point of strength : neither has
the temperature Deen attended to, the hydrometer there hav
 ing no thermometer attached to it : the standard of proof haa
 consequently become just what the maker of the Irish hy
 drometer pleased : the generally received opinion, however,
 supposes it to be nine per cent, over Englisti hvdrometer
proof.
    Two material imperfections appear in Clarke's hydrometer,
 exclusive oP its complexity ; namely, that neither variations
of temperature, nor the gradation* of strengths, have been
sufficiently attended to : with respect to the former of these,
the same weather-weight (as it is called by the trade) is used,
though the temperature should vary four or five degrees.
    The inventor, foreseeing that this was liable to weighty
objections, conceives he has guarded against it by the direc
tion he gives in a N. B.: but this N. B., so far from remov
ing doubts, only serves to increase them ; the words about
and near leaving room for much to be guessed at, and much
more to be apprehended, where the important points it al
ludes to are so loosely and indistinctly defined.
    May I be permitted in this place to explain the conse
quences of this mode of including four or five degrees of tem
perature to be indicated by the fame weight, by stating a cafe
that has frequently occurred ? — A merchant in Ireland sliips
for London a quantity of spirit, and previous to its ship
ment examines the strength by Clarke's hydrometer:                 he
adjusts the strength to be somewhat less than 10 per cent,
(suppose 9!) over hydrometer proof, the strength allowed to
be importable without an augmentation duty : this spirit is
per specific gravity 91c, temperature 55. Suppose it to be ar
rived in London, but the temperature is then 60; notwith
standing this increase os temperature (of 5 degrees) the fame
weather- weight continues to be used in trying the strength in
England which was applied in Ireland : by this increase of
temperature, the specific gravity being diminished to 907.;ths,
when it comes to be proved in London, by the fame hydro
                                                              metcij

                             On the Hydrometer,                                     157
tteter,   it then appears to be full one and a half per cent,
stronger  than  when  it was (hipped, aud will now be found to
be 11 per cent, over proof.     Should this spirit be a foreign
one, viz. brandy or geneva, it must pay the entire augment
ation duty of 11 per cent.; whereas, it the temperature was
sufficiently discriminated, it should have paid no augmenta
tion duty whatever.
     That this cafe is not merely a supposition,               believe,  is, I
well known to several respectable merchants in London, to
whom consignments of foreign spirits have been made from
Ireland, and who,            in
                           several instances, have been obliged to
pay    this augmentation duty of         per cent. Here, therefore,

weights remedy it.
     The principle on which            constructed supposes that the

                    is                            demonstrable thus
                                                          is                          :
     Suppose a weak spirit to be tried, the specific gravity of
 which, at the temperature of 35,            960*48, let the tempe
                                                is

                                         12*35.
     Suppose next, the spirit under trial to be        strong one, and

  paid on      depending on the quantities of the former which
              it,

  principles of hydrostatics.
      A solid body descends       inliquid, because

 158                         On tbe Hydrometer.
    Hence it is evident that every variation of gravity in the
liquid will affect the indication on the hydrometer.
    This gravity is known by the term specific gravity ) and as
the specific gravity of liquids is not absolute, but relative, this
can only be determined by comparison : the first operation,
therefore, consists in getting one whose absolute weight is
known, in order to serve as a fixed point, and to determine,
in its turn, a comparison of the density of the liquid.       Pure
water having always been considered the best standard for this
purpose, the term specific gravity is most readily defined, by
saying, that it is as the weight of the liquid is comparatively
with pure water : for instance, if a phial, which holds pre
cisely 1000 grains of water, holds only 922 grains of a                             spi
rituous liquor, the specific gravity of this spirit    said to be   is
922.
   But as spirits expand         by
                                heat, and contract        cold, thisby
specific gravity varies according to the degree of the heat of
theJiquor, which        called its temperature: therefore
                        is                                                         it
                                                                                   is
necessary first to ascertain what that may be, and              done     it   is
very accurately    by the thermometer.        And in the experi
ment mentioned, supposing the temperature to have been 5^,
if the spirit be heated to 70, the specific gravity will be di
minished to 915 1> ar»dj      afterwards
                               if               be cooled down to
                                                    it
35 degrees   of temperature,     will
                                    it  be found  to have increased
to 9304.
   This       very convenient manner of trying and expressing
        is
        a
what the specific gravity of the liquor may be         and as shall
                                                                ;         I
hereafter have occasion to use the term frequently,           hope   I              I
shall be excused for explaining       in this place.

in   a gross   mariner to a general use, it is well known that no
method admits of real accuracy but that of the specific gra

differ from one another by at least a sixth part of the weight
of the former ; whence it is obvious, that when those two
fluids are mixed together, the compound must have some
intermediate specific gravity, approaching nearer to that of
water or pure spirit, as the former or the latter is the more
predominant ingredient.
     " Were it not for a certain effect attending the mixture
 of water and spirit, which has been called their mutual pe
 netration, the specific gravity of these compositions, in a
 given degree of heat, would be simply in the arithmetical
 proportions of the quantity of each of the fluids entering into
 them.
     "   But whenever different substances, which have a strong-
 tendency to unite together, are mixed, the resulting compound
 is found to occupy less space than the substances forming it
 held in their separate state; wherefore the specific gravity of
 such compounds is always greater than would be given by a
 simple calculation from the volume of their ingredients.
 Though it be a general fact, that such a decrease of bulk
 takes places on the mixture of substances which have a che
 mical attraction for each other; yet the quantity of this di
  minution is different in them all, and, under our present ig
  norance of the intimate composition of bodies, can be deter
  mined by experiment only.                To ascertain, therefore, the
  quantity     and   law   of   the  condensation    resulting from this
  mutual penetration of water and spirit, was the first object
  to which the following experiments were directed.
      "   All bodies, in general, expand by heat : but the quan
  tity of this expansion, as well as the law of its progression,
  are probably not the same in any two substances.               In water
  and spirit they are remarkably different.           The whole expan
  sion of pure spirit, from 300 to iccr os Fahrenheit's thermo
  meter, is not less than i-25th of its whole bulk at 300;
  ¦whereas that of water, in the fame interval, is only 1-14.jt.r1
  of its bulk. The laws of their expansion are still more dif
  ferent than the quantities.           If the expansion of quicksilver
  be,    as  usual,   taken   from   the    standard (our thermometers
  being     constructed     with   that  fluid), the expansion of spirit
  is,  indeed,   progressively increasing with respect to that stand
   ard,   but  not  much so within the above-mentioned interval ;
   whilst   water   kept from freezing to 30', which may easily be
   done, will absolutely contract as it is heated, for ten or more
                                                                  degrees,

                                               as to observe upon
the whole     very increasing progression.

    " Now mixtures of these two substances will, as may be
fuppoled, approach to the less or the greater of those progres
sions, according as they are compounded of more spirit or
more water; whilst their total expansion will be greater ac
cording as more spirit enters into their composition       but the:
exact quantity of the expansion, as weil as the law of the pro
gression, in all of them, can be determined only                  by
                                                             trials.
These were therefore the two other principal objects to be
ascertained        by
                 experiment."     Sir Charles then proceeds to
describe those various experiments, and which are too lone
to admit an insertion of them here but from perusal
                                                ;             a will   it

inquiry, minuteness of attention, and accuracy of investiga
tion, seldom to be met with, and which, with the calcula
tions grounded on them            by
                               Mr. Gilpin, clerk of the society,
and published in the Transactions for 1794, have removed
those obscurities with which the subject had heretofore been
enveloped.
    These celebrated experiments, and the table deduced from
them, have been minutely examined            several of the ablest
                                                    by
philosophers in Franee and various other parts of the conti
nent, and they are allowed to be what Mr. Nicholson (who
has also minutely examined them), in his Chemical Dic
tionary, fays, may be considered as fundamental results         and    ;
it   issomewhat remarkable that, since their publication in
 1794, no person has hitherto availed himself of the important
information they contain, as        foundation for putting
                                       a                         pe    a
riod to those irregularities and uncertainties which have been
so  long and     universally complained of.
                   so
    That hydrometers should be complicated in their struc
tures, and erroneous in their indications, previous to this
period,   isnot to be wondered at.
    The specific gravity of the spirit, which       the foundation
                                                             is
of the hydrometer indication, was but little attended to and           ;
those variations which take place in the specific gravity,
 through the several causes above mentioned, having never be
 fore that period been precisely ascertained,    hydrometers, in
stead of being graduated          by
                               this unerring test, have been gra
 duated    by comparison with another instrument, called                    a
 standard, but no means have been pointed out to prove that
 this standard was correct.
    These tables of Mr. Gilpin, however, furnish such elemen
               7                                                tary

 tary information as has enabled me, by the addition of four
 columns, to remove all doubts and uncertainties on the sub
ject, by demonstrating, from the specific gravity of the               spi
 rituous liquor, what the hydrometer indications should be
 of every gradation of strength.
    In the Report, which accompanies these tables, fir Charles
Blagden makes an observation which first suggested to me the
utility of these additional columns.
    " may very probably be thought right (fays he), for the
     It
future use of the revenue, to compute another set of tables,
in which the degrees of heat standing at the head of each
table, the first column of        shall be even numbers of specific
                                 it

quantities   of  spirit  and  water in mixture from its heat and
                                          a
specific gravity."
    Sir Charles,     by this observation, alludes not to the means
of obtaining the hydrometer indication, but to an opinion he
had given in his first Report, in 1790, that the simplest and the
most equitable way of levying the duty on spirituous liquors
would be to consider pure spirit as the true and only excise-
able matter, instead of the relation to the standard of proof,
and for calculating which one column of the table             deci
                                                              is   a
mal multiplier, to ascertain the proportion of this     inanv given
quantity of spirituous liquor; an idea which certainly is in
            a
genious, and, at first view, appears to have the recommenda
tion of simplicity    :  but as every discrimination of strength
would require an operation of figures, fractions would un
avoidably occur, from which, and the delay and danger of
errors in these operations, this mode,         conceived, had been
                                               I
considered practically inconvenient, and therefore         was not
adopted.
   The relation to the standard of proof having been long re
cognized   bythe different statutes, and in commerce,     Ithought
it probable it would not be laid aside; nor was         it,

rendering this relation to proof equally correct as that which
he pointed out   :and the new set of table?, which at first            I
apprehended he was about to describe as useful for the reve
nue, were those which would deduce the hydrometer indica
tion of strength from the specific gravity of the spirit at            a
given temperature. A table for this purpose would,            con

comparison, many of whose discriminations of strength being)
as I had reason to believe, nierclv conjectural.
    Before I proceed to explain Mr. Gilpin's tables, and the
columns added to them, it becomes necessary to define what
is meant by the term pure spirit, and to inquire whether the
spirit which fir Charles describes can with propriety be called
such.
   "   The first step (says he, in the Report made on this sub
ject in 1790) towards a right performance of the experiments,
was to procure the two subliances with which they were to
be made, as pure as poflible.     Distilled water is in all cafes
so nearly alike, that no difficulty occurred with regard to it;
 but the specific, gravity of pure spirit, or alcohol, has been
 given so very differently by the authors who have treated of
it, that a particular set of experiments appeared necessary for
determining to what degree of strength rectified spirit could
conveniently be brought. The person engaged to make these
experiments was Dr. Dollfuss, an ingenious Swiss gentleman,
then in London, who had distinguished himself by several
publications on chemical subjects. Dr. Dollfuss, having been
furnished by government with spirit for the purpose, rectified
it,     repeated and slow distillations, till its specific gravity
       by
became stationary      in this manner of operating: he then
added dry caustic alkali to           let      it,
                                             stand for    few days,
                                                              it         a
poured   off the liquor,  and distilled    with    small addition
                                                          it      of
                                                                   a
burnt alum, placing the receiver in ice.         By this method he
obtained       spirit whose specific gravity was 8188, at 60 of
                a
heat. Perceiving, however, that he could not conveniently
get the quantitv of spirit he wanted lighter than 8.2527, at
60, he fixed upon that strength as         standard.      a
   Several highly respectable authorities might be produced
to prove this specific gravity to be      proper standard for pure
                                                          a

bones      and teeth have been discovered both in Siberia and
America, which at first were generally attributed to the ele
phant *, except some very large teeth of the carnivorous kind
totally different from those of any animal known.
     In Siberia they were attributed to the mammoth, whose
fabulous existence they supposed to be under ground, and of
which Isbrand Ides pretends to give a description. In North
America these large bones and carnivorous grinders have
been found in great abundance on the Ohio and its tributary
streams, washed from their banks, or discovered by digging
in salt morasses in the neighbourhood of Cincinatti ; where
they are found intermixed with the bones of buffaloes and
deer, which a tradition of the Indians states to have been de
stroyed by a herd of these animals which came upon them
from the north. This event happened, the Indians believe, as a
punishment for their sins; but they say the good spirit at length
interposed to save them, and, seating himself on a neighbour
ing rock, where they (how you the print of his feat and of
one foot, hurled his thunderbolts among them. All were
killed except one male, who, presenting his forehead to the
 shafts, (hook them off, until, at length wounded, he sprung
 over the Wabasti, the lllenois, and the Great Lake, where he
 still lives.
     These bones were forwarded with great eagerness to all
 parts of Europe, and deposited in museums, where they at
 tracted the curiosity of all naturalists, whose conjectures and
 theories on them were very various, until Dr. Hunter, by a
 more accurate comparison between them and the bones of
 other animals, determined that they must have belonged to a
 large non-descript animal of the carnivorous kind, somewhat
 resembling the hippopotamus and the elephant, yet essentially
 different from both.
      The subject is now completely elucidated. Not long since
 some farmers in the State of New York, in America, digging
 marie from their morasses in the neighbourhod of New-
 Windsor, accidentally discovered several of these bones, which
 were preservediy physicians in the neighbourhood. In the au
  tumn of 1801, my father Charles W. Peale and myself, having
  obtained possession of these bones, persevered for nearly three
  months, at the expense of much time, labour, and money, in
  a search for the remainder of the animal ; and were fortu-
      * Naturalists were led to this idea in consequence of finding, in a few
  instances in America, but frequently in Siberia, some large graminivorous
  teeth, which probably belonged to an animal of the elephant kind, though,
  certainly of different species from any known : these teeth are remarkable for
  size.and in the number of lamcllated veins of enamel which pervade them.

nate enough to obtain two skeletons, found in two distinct
situations, and unmixed with bones of any other individual
whatever: one of these is preserved in the Museum at Phila
delphia, and the other is now exhibiting in the Old Academy-
 room, Pall-Mail, previously to its being taken to Paris.
     The skeleton or the mammoth bears some general resem
 blance to that of the elephant, yet on examination even the
 general figure is found to be considerably different ; princi
 pally in the effect of the tuslcs, structure of the head, promi
 nence and pointedncfs of the back over the slioulders, its
 great descent thence to the hips, together with the compara
 tive smallness of the body and the necessarily detached effect
 of the hind-legs — proofs of greater activity than in the ele
 phant.      On a closer examination, the characteristic features
 are greatly multiplied; and with respect to the hind-legs, the
 idea of activity is confirmed from the structure of the thigh
 bones, which are extremely broad and flat, and well adapted
 for great exertions    of  strength, beyond that of the elephant,
 whose \thigh-bones       are not flat, but round.     This effect of
 strength likewise prevails in the ribs, which are of a very un
 usual structure, being bent edgewise and having their greatest
 thickness at top, gradually becoming smaller towards their
   unction with the cartilage; whereas in the elephant they are
i" >ent flatwise, like those of the ox, and are narrow at top and
 broad at the lower ends.        This peculiarity in the ribs of the
 mammoth is worthy of particular notice, not only on account
of    the unusual position of strength, but because, from their
distance between each other, they show the animal to have
had considerable flexibility in its body; to which the breadth
and proximity in the ribs of the elephant, as well as the ox,
 are a certain impediment.         Besides, as I observed before, the
 body is comparatively smaller, in consequence of the small
length of the ribs.
     The spines of the back over the slioulders are of an unusual
magnitude, which gives the appearance of a hump, like the
 bison, and are calculated to give power and motion to the
 head. Those in the elephant are not so large over the shoulders,
but much more so all the way to the sacrum : consequently
 his back is more arched. The proportionate length of the
 processes from the spine os the scapula differs essentially from
all other animals. And, independently of any other variation
in form, all the bones, of the limbs in particular, are asto
nishingly thick aud strong.
    We now come to the head, where the most striking feature*
of this animal are to be found ; and since between the corre
sponding parts of all animals there is a general analogy, it is
                                                                  the

the province of comparative anatomy not only to trace out
the points of distinction, but, since they originate from cer
tain fixed principles, in the discrimination of variations,
to confirm their propriety by an examination of the princi
ples on which they are founded.
   Although it is sufficiently evident to those who are accus
tomed to this kind of investigation, from the observation of
a few facts, that this animal must have been carnivoroTis ; yet
to others it is necessary to introduce every proas and conclu
sive evidence.    Many persons, from a false impression, be
lieve that teeth are determined to be carnivorous merely from
their having a rugged surface : with this opinion they very
properly asle,
               "   May not the vegetable food be of a coarser
quality }" It is true that the surface is roughest on those
graminivorous teeth which are employed in the mastication
of the coarsest vegetable substances, not only because such
roughness    is requisite, but because the teeth are rendered
so from the quality of the food, the bony interstices wearing
down more easily than the ridges of enamel, which operate
as the roughness in a mill-stone.    It is not therefore from
this species of roughness that we presume on so important a
determination: the roughness existing on the surface of car
nivorous teeth is of another nature, much more strongly
marked, and far from being rendered so by usage : the more
they are used, the more even do they become.      The to^th of
a graminivorous animal is composed of alternate veins of
enamel and bone, which thus pervade the whole mass : those
of carnivorous animals are covered with a stiell or crust of
enamel, which is merely external, and exists as well in the
cavities as on the ridges; which is not the cafe with other
teeth.   This enamel is required in the cavities, because the
teeth interlock with each other, the prominences striking
into the cavities.
    An uniform composition of tooth, as it respects the inter
mixture of enamel and bone, is observed to prevail in those
of the elephant, horse, ox, &c. principally differing from
each other in ibe Jigure which those veins of enamel assume,
and by which alone they may be discriminated among them
selves.'  On the other hand, carnivorous teeth, incrufted with
enamel as far as the gums, yet vary in the form and number
of their protuberances, so as generally to designate their
species : yet among them there is a very proper distinction to
be observed, which   is, that those carnivorous animals, the
form of whose teeth and the attachment of whose jaws allow
them the side or grinding motion, are always ot the mixt
kind.    Man, the monkey, hog, &c. are carnivorous ani-

mals, because their teeth are incrusted with enamel, and be
cause they do eat flesh ; yet they are adapied for other food,
by the rotatory motion of their jaws and the form of their
teeth : this rotatory motion does not exist in the jaws ot those
animals which live entirely upon flesh; for they are attached by
an oblong head or process inserted into a transverse groove, and
consequently have no other motion than up and down.               In
graminivorous      animals  the  under jaw   is attached  by  means
of a considerably round head (condyloid process) to a pro
minence or flat surface, so that they rotate ; and, to favour
this motion, the coronoid process is generally thicker and not
so long as the condyloid ; whereas         in carnivorous animals
 the coronoid process is extremely flat and long, being never
 acted on except lengthwise.
     But it must not even be supposed that an animal may be
 of the mixt kind, unless we observe a capacity for mastica
 tion ; without which we must declare it exclusively carni
vorous.
     Some object to the carnivorous nature of the mammoth
 from its not having cutting or canine tttth. To this it may
 be replied, that if we form our rule of judgment, as to what
 constitutes a graminivorous animal, from the construction of
 an ox's jaw, the elephant would certainly be excluded, be
 cause it has not incisores at least in the lower jaw : the fact      is,
 that all carnivorous as well as graminivorous animals differ
 among themselves with respect to the number and situation
 os their teeth     and hence they afforded to the sagacious and
                    ;
  celebrated Linnæus the most infallible method of classifica
 tion,' which has since been adopted, either wholly or partially,
 by    all naturalists.  The proboscis of the elephant answers
  the purpose of incisores he therefore requires no others than
                                     :
  grinders, which entirely fill his jaws: hence he          is  com
  pletely graminivorous.      And although the mammoth            de
                                                                 is
  ficient in cutting teeth, and has no other canine teeth than
  his enormous tusks, the deficiencies of which may have
  been supplied         pair of Urge and powerful lips, indicated
                        by   a
 by    the uncommon sinuosity on the front of the lower jaw;
  yet I    am decidedly of opinion, since         cannot be contra

   clusively carnivorous        which
                                 ;       bymean, that he made no

and so completely lock together : 3dly, Since, therefore,
they are not graminivorous, since they cannot be of the mixt
kind, from a defect in motion, they mult be exclusively and
positively carnivorous.
    Independently of the teeth, the under jaw of the mam
moth differs most essentially from that of the elephant, which
in its outline is semi-circular, from the condyle to the chin ;
whereas in the mammoth the outline is distinctly angular,
and is much greater in the length than it is in the height,
which is the reverse in the elephant : besides several other
striking distinctions in both jaws.
   When the skeleton was first erected, I was much at a loss
how to dispose of the tusks; their sockets stiowed that they
grew' out forwards, but did not indicate whether they were
curved up or down.       I chose, therefore, first to turn them
upwards, not because they produced the same effect as in
the elephant, for it is evident they could not in any position,
owing to two circumstances. In the elephant, taking the level
of the teeth for a horizontal base line, the condyle of the neck
is at right angles with it; and the perpendicular, one third
longer than the base line : hence they are useful on every
occasion, the tufles themselves being nearly straight, and
           downwards ; whereas in the mammoth, taking the
f»ointing
 evel ofthe teeth for a base line, the condyle of the neck is
situated but a few inches above it: consequently the sockets
for the tusks and the condyle of the neck are in a horizontal
direction : this circumstance, together with the extraordinary
curve ofthe tusks, would raise the points in the air, directed
in some degree backward over the head, twelve feet from the
ground, and never could have been brought lower than six or
seven feet from it.     This position was evidently absurd :     I
therefore resolved on reversing them ; in which position, in
consequence of their twist or double curve, they appear infi
nitely more serviceable.
   Six miles from the spot where this skeleton was discovered
we found two entire tusks, in form exactly like those in the
skeleton, but very much worn at the extremities (the point of
one I have with me), and worn in so peculiar a manner, con
sidering their form, as could not have happened in an ele
vated position; unless on the absurd supposition,        that the
animal amused himself with wearing and rendering them
blunt, by rubbing them against high and perpendicular
rocks : this in a state of nature can never be supposed,
whatever habits may be acquired when in a narrow confine
ment.     There can be no doubt, then, of their having been
used   against the ground, and not improbably in tearing up
                                L4                          shel!

                 if,
an amphihious nature for this species of food his teeth seem
                                  :
admirably adapted.        All animals of similar habits have fimi
lar teeth this animal has teeth unlike any other with which
         :
we are acquainted there       :   much reason, therefore, in (up-
                                      is
posing his food to have been different         especially when we
                                                         ;
consider the thickness of enamel which covers the teeth, the
peculiar manner in which they are worn, and the small
opening for the throat. But, whether amphibious or not, in
 the inverted position of the tusks he could have torn an ani
mal to pieces held beneaih his foot, and could have struck
down an animal of common size, without having his sight
obstructed, as      certainly would have been in the other posi
                        it
tion.
    The tusks themselves are composed of two very distinct
substances:    the internal bony or ivory part, which we find
in the greatest state of decay       and   thick, distinct coating,
                                           ;         a
doubtless having undergone some decay, yet at present abso
lutely heavier and harder than the freshest ivory.       No part of
the skeleton      petrified, but all in their present (late of pre

water even in the driest seasons.

cause;   and nothing appears     more  probable than one of those
deluges or sudden irruptions ot the sea, which have left their
traces in every part oi the globe, and which are           amazing        in

XXVII.       New    Theory   of the Constitution of mixed        Gases elu~
                  cidated.    By J. Dalton, Esq.*
 I  N an effav, published in the Memoirs of the Literary and
 Philosophical Society of Manchester, vol. v. part 2, I gave a
 new theory of the constitution of mixed gases, and particu
 larly of the atmosphere,         and endeavoured         to illustrate my
 meaning by a plate, &.c.          Notwithstanding this, I am in
 formed by some of my chemical friends that they do not
 clearly understand the hypothesis itself, and consequently are
 not able to judge of its merits or defects : and a late writer
  (Dr. Thomson) in his System of Chemistry, vol. iii. p. 270,
 speaking of the uniform diffusion of the different gases of the
 atmosphere,     makes the following observation : — " Even Mr.
 Daltou's ingenious supposition, that they neither attract nor
 repel each other, would not account for this equal distribu
 tion j for, undoubtedly on that supposition they would arrange

                                                                 themselves

  170              New    Theory   of the  Constitution
  themselves according to their specific gravity." Now, as           I
  am persuaded that no one acquainted with the principles of
 mechanical philosophy could have written the above if he
 had understood my hypothesis, it seems to call from me a
 further explanation.      I propose therefore, 1st, To state, in as
 clear  a point of view as the subject will admit, the principles
 which    I assume : zA, To (how that the consequences which         I
 have deduced from them are legitimate ; and, particularly, that
 mixed elastic fluids ought not to arrange themselves according
 to their specific gravity : and, 3d, To demonstrate that the
 supposition of the gases constituting the atmosphere           being
 held in a state of equal diffusion by chemical affinity, if not
 only inconsistent with the phænomena, but is completely
 absurd.
                        I. Principles    ajsumed.
     1. I  take for granted, that the particles of simple [un
 mixed] elastic fluids repel one another with forces inversely
 as the distance of their centres, the temperature being given.
 This is a mathematical deduction from the allowed fact, that
 the space occupied by any gas is inversely as the compressing
 force.   (See Newton's Principia, b. ii. prop. 23.)         The ab
solute  distances  of the  centres    of such particles must vary ac
 cording to circumstances, and cannot easily be determined ;
 their relative distances in a liquid and aerial state sometimes
 may.      Mr. Watt has sliown that steam of 21a0, and pressure
 28 inches, is 1800 times lighter than water; consequently
 the distances of the particles of steam arc to the distances of
the said particles in a liquid state as 12 to 1, nearly, in that
 particular cafe.    Vapour in the vacuum of an air-pump, at
 common temperature, will have its particles about four times
 the distance, or 48 to 1.         ,,
    2. I suppose that in mixed elastic fluids the heterogeneous
 particles do not repel one another at all at such distances as
 they repel those of their own kind ; but that such particles,
 when brought into actual contact (to use the common lan
guage), resist each other in all respects like inelastic bodies.
This is the peculiarity of the hypothesis, and what appears
not to be generally understood. If I may explain by analogv,
the most striking will be found in magnetism.              Two like
poles of magnets repel one another with the fame force, whe
ther any other bodies intervene or not, and do not affect those
                                      J
other bodies : in the fame way conceive two particles of any
one gas repel one another with the fame force, whether par
ticles of other gases intervene or not, and do not aflect those
other particles. A magnet is amenable to the common laws
             7                                                     of

                      cf mixed    Gases elucidated.                   171
of motion in its collision with other bodies,             and when it is
brought into seeming contact with them; so is a particle of
one gas when it is brought into seeming contact with a parti
cle of another species; and in this cafe the bodies may be
said to have a repulsive power : but this power is essentially
different from the other, in that it extends to no definite di
stance.      Further, conceive a very fine capillary tube placed
perpendicular to the horizon, into which let a number of
correspondent small magnetic wires, or particles, be inserted,
with their poles of the fame denomination togetber, or, more
strictly, as near as their repulsive power would admit, one par
ticle above another, the air having intercourse amongst them.
Then, as the magnetic particles would not actually touch one
another bv realon of their repulsion, they would seem to be
supported by the intervening air ; whereas in reality they are
 supported and kept at certain distances entirely by the repul
 sion inherent in themselves and their own gravitation : and
 thus, I conceive, particles of gas support those of their own
 kind above them, though, were they visible, they might seem
 to rest upon others immediately under them ; and the ground,
 or lowest folio or liquid surface, by supporting the lowest par
 ticle of each kind, has the weight ot the whole to sustain.
 These observations,       together with a view of the plate above
 alluded to, must, I think, be sufficient to satisfy any one
 what the hypothesis is.          And it may be proper to add, there
 is something much resembling polarity observable in the ul
 timate particles of bodies at the instant of transition from the
  liquid to the solid state : witness the congelation of water.
                             II.  Consequences.
      It is plain from the above account that         I conceive anyone
  gas   to be  constituted   of perhaps  one part   solid  matter, and one
  thousand    or more    parts  vacuity orpore,   if it maybe so called ^
   and that into this vacuity we mav throw as many other gases
   as we please without materially disturbing the first, provided
   we do not absolutely fill the vacuity with solid matter (for so
   I  denominate common liquids or solids). Thus, we might
   have had a dozen gases in our atmosphere instead of three or
   four, all in the same compass, and each retaining the fame
   density it would Jiave had alone.         The heavier gas has no
   more tendency to raise the lighter than a quantity of shot has
   to expel the air from its interstices.       If  therefore Dr. Thom
   son, or any other, can show how one fluid, which is not dis
   placed nor any way acted on by another, should by its re
   action cause that other to move into a higher or lower station,
    then the mathematical world will be obliged to reconsider
                                                                       their

JJ2   Xew Theory os the CcnJIitulion of mired          Gases elucidated.
tbeir doctrine of statics. Till then I must take the negative of
the proposition, and conclude that clastic fluids of the greatest;
and least specific gravity imaginable, on the supposition I hold,
will alike take the lowest and the highest stations, regardless
of each other; or, in other words, thev will arrange themselves
in the fame order as if thrown into a complete vacuum. The
great difficulty respecting the uniform diffusion of the gases-
being removed, I think on mv hypothesis the other phæno-
mena can require no explanation to any person conversant iu
pneumatics.      I will take one instance : it mav be asked, How
does fulphuret of potash abstract oxygenous gas out of any
mixture; lime water, carbonic acid gas, &c. &c. ? The an
swer is obvious : Exactly in the fame way as if the gas in
question was the only one in the vessel, and the operation
going on in a close vessel.
      III.   Gases held together by chemical       Affinity absurd.
  On this head it will be proper to premise certain facts:
  lst, When two gases of different specific gravity, such    as
oxygenous   and hydrogenous,   are put into the fame vessel and
agitated ; then, after standing some time, they still continue
uniformly mixed.
    2. They occupy the fame space before and aster mixture ;
that   is,one measure of each put together occupy /cro mea
sures, the temperature and pressure being the fame.            Mr.
Davy    seems  to think this principle  not strictly true in regard
toa    mixture of azotic and oxygenous gas but the deviation
                                                   ;
from   it,   if
             any,     extremely small.
                          is
    3. The  compound      subject to the same laws of rarefaction

      Virgmis by the Moon, which took place in tbe Ytar 9— <
    Discovery of a new Comet — Observations of tbe Planet dis
    covered by Dr. Olbers.
    Occultations of the stars by the moon are so useful for im
proving geography, by determining the longitude, that they
have been ranked among the most important of the celestial
phænomena ; and in this class those easiest to be observed,
and which give the surest results, are occultations of stars of
the first magnitude.
    The moon, by the position of its orbit, can eclipse only
four; namely, Aldebaran, Regulus, Centares, and the Vir
gin's Spike ; but the passage of the latter behind the moon's
disk rarely takes place.           C. Lalande knows only four epochs
                                                             the year 9 having
in the space     between      1623 and 1790 ; and
exhibited two,      he   took  care    tQ  unite    and  calculate     the obser
vations   which    reached      him    of  this  phænomenon.
     For the first occultation, which took place on the 30th of
March, these observations are in number sixteen, ot which
the city of Paris alone furnished six, carefully made by the
most distinguished astronomers.                 It was from an observation
made by      C.  Ciccolini,     at   Florence,     that Lalande determined
the longitude      of    that   city,    which     he   published some time
»<ro, expressing     his   astonishment       that   the  position of a city of
so much importance             mould       have   hitherto     been so inaccu
rately fixed.
     The longitude of the moon, deduced from observations at
the time of the conjunction of these two bodies, is less by 13"
than that given in the tables lately transmitted to the board
of longitude by M. Burg.
     Fourteen observations of the second occultation, which
took place on the 34th of May, were examined and calcu
lated with the same care as the preceding.                     On this occasion
there    was  an  observation       also  at  Florence,     the   result of which
 gave 6"   more     in   time    in  the  difference    os  meridians     between
 that city   and   Paris,   as  deduced      from    the  first  occultation.

 Serpentarius.        It  was  not    visible  by   the naked eye : it resemr

 some degrees towards the south.                 The centre of the nebulo

fity seemed a little more luminous than the rest; but no sen
sible nucleus was distinguished, nor any trace of a tail. After
that period the light ot the comet always decreased, because
it was removing from the earth. Its apparent motion in de
clination, which was at first 2\ degrees towards the north, in
24 hours, was not more the last day than 30 minutes.                  The
motion in right ascension amounted towarJs the end to no
more than 17 minutes in 24 hours. The successive decrease
of the light of the comet, and the brightness of the light of
the moon, did not allow of its being observed any longer. It
traversed the constellations of Serpentarius and Hercules.
    During the 36 days it was visible he determined its position
on 23 different days; and from his own observations he «al-
culated the elements of its orbit as follows : they have no re
 semblance to those of any of the preceding comets :
 Perihelion distance 1*0942046 ; the mean distance of the earth

     This comet is the 94th with the elements of the orbits of
 which we are acquainted, and the thirteenth discovered by
 C. Mechain. It was observed on the 26th of August, or two
 days before, by C. Pons of Marseilles ; but on these two days
 the sky at Pans was overcast.           Dr. Olbers discovered it also
 at Bremen 011 the 2d of September.             C. Messier, our fellow-
 labourer, and C. Bouvard, adjunct of the board of longitude,
 observed it with great assiduity after the appearance of it had
 been announced Dy C. Mechain.
      We fliall give here only four positions determined by
  C. Mechain ; the first, the last, and the two intermediate
 ones : all the rest will be published in detail in the next vo

    The planet which we announced in the account of the la
 bours of the last quarter, discovered by Dr. Olbers, of Bre
 men, has also engaged the attention of all astronomers.
    It was observed by C. Mechain till the 28th of August,
 and a sufficient number of its positions was obtained to de
 termine the elements of its orbit in such a manner as to en
able us to find it again some months hence, when it will ap
pear in the morning after issuing from the rays of the fun.
 C. Burckhardt, adjunct of the board of longitude, presented
 some to the class, which he calculated, taking into account
 even the perturbations which this planet experiences from
 the principal part of the rest. These elements represent very
 well all the observations hitherto made.       C. Vidal, director
of the observatory of Toulouse, placed under a sky so favour
 able to astronomy, followed the planet of Oibers with the
fame attention and constancy which he employed in the ob
 servations of Mercury, which are so difficult ; and he sent to
 the class forty, with a table containing twenty-three select
determinations of its right ascension and declination, and a
 chart of its apparent route from the 19th of May to the 23d
of August.
    In this period of time it passed over about 17 degrees in
 right ascension and 5 in declination.
    It appeared to C. Vidal as a star of the ninth magnitude,
and exhibited no trace of that nebulosity with which comets
are always accompanied.

                     NATURAL PHILOSOPHY.
 Observation    of a remarkable Pbanomenon of Terrestrial Re
                             sraclion.
    The most    remarkable of the physical pbænomena       next to
tbose which inspire most men with terror, are those singular
appearances which are produced sometimes by the reflection
or refraction of parts of the atmosphere, and towards which
the attention of philosophers has been directed by the ob
servations   of C. Monge.
    This circumstance reminded C. Dangos of an effect of ter
restrial refraction which he witnessed at Malta in 1784.
    On the 20th of March, about one in the afternoon, he
learned, by loud shouts, which resounded from all the streets
of the town, that a new island had arisen in the channel of
Malta. Having ascended to one of the terraces of the ob
servatory,    he indeed observed a very white tradl of land in
the middle of the water, the form of which was nearly that
of a right cone irregularly truncated. The illusion was so
complete, that some of the sailors had resolved to go and re

  connoitre this island in order to take possession of it. Tts
  figure, colour, and particularly its situation, in the line
  which joins Malta and Mount Ætna, made C. Dangos soon
              that it was nothing else than the appearance of the
    ummit of that mountain, always covered with snow, which
  fierceive
  some extraordinary cause had brought considerably nearer,
  lowering it at the same time very much below the level of
  the water.
        The publicity of this phænomenon did not permit
  C. Dangos to observe it with more precision. A multitude
  of curious    spectators, whom he could not get rid of, crowded
  the terrace.     But this astonishing spectacle appeared again
  on the 17th of April 1785, at six in the morning; a time
  when the indolent, not being awake, could not interrupt the
   diligent philosopher in his retreat.
       On this occasion, the apparent island, which was better
   defined than that of 1784, seemed to be 15' 17" below the
   horizon, which corresponds to a distance of about 18000
   yards : it seemed then to recede and to rise up ; after
                                                             which,
   it  became confused for a moment, and Ætna re-appeared in
   its real place.    The coasts of Sicily, which had been hitherto
   concealed, were fully seen, and remained visible during the
   rest of the day.
       C. Dangos, without attempting to explain this phæno
   menon, thinks that the humidity of the atmosphere, of which
   he that day perceived very sensible signs, had a great share in
   it ; and that observations of the hygrometer ought not only
   to be added to those of the thermometer and barometer to
   determine the refrangent force of the atmosphere, but some
   day may supply the place of each other.
       Going back to the beginning of the last century, we find,
   in the memoirs of the Academy of Sciences,            " that the
    mountains of Corsica, seen from the coasts of Genoa and
    Provence, seem at certain hours to plunge into the sea."
.   The author of the memoir which we here analyse, saw the
    same appearance      when at the Isles d'Heyeres in 1778: but
    this phænomenon was not so well defined as that which he
    relates.

        In the public fitting on the 6th of September last, this
    society, after adopting the plan of its labour and fixing the
    nature of its occupations, thought proper to change its title
    into that of Academy of the Sciences, Arts, and Belles- Lettres.

of that illustrious association to which it has succeeded, and
in whose steps it proposes to tread.
    C. Leschcvin read a report on the discovery of the phe
nomenon of scintillation bv the coHi6on of charred wood.
Three successive explosions took place in the course of soar
months in the powder manufactory of Yonges, notwithstand
ing all the precautions employed to avoid them. The fre
quent return of these events induced government to fend to
the spot C. Lem:»itre, inspector-general, to inquire into the
cause of these accidents.         Having assured himself that no part
of the machinery was deranged, and that no foreign sub
stance had been introduced into the mortars, he <
to verify the suspicions entertained in regard to the i
roent of charcoal in sticks. He recollected, that under cer
tain circumstances he had obtained sparks bv the collision of
charred wood : he therefore made a trial, and, after three or
four strokes, excited three strong sparks.            This fact serves to
account for the explosions ; it explains whv they do not I
pen more frequently, and points out in what m
Sons may be totally prevented, bv adding one i
to those already employed, namely, to pulverize the char
coal used in the manufactory ot gunpowder                     C. Leschevin
 terminates his memoir with the fallowing reflection : —
 "   Heat and light disengaged from a combustible body being
 the more abundant as tbe combination of oxygen with the
 bodv is stronger in a given space of time, it seems to re
 sult from tbe different circumstances of the phenomenon I
 have described, that a verv slight degree os heat only is re
quired to effect the combination us oxygen with charcoal, and
 the combustion of the latter."

 the society interesting details respecting the new method sub
 stituted for the old one for bleaching linen, See.                He exa

 and concluded his memoir by pointing out the most advan

 cavjlic alkali in vapour, which are those employed in his
 establishment. He showed that the use of Julpburet of line

if  the operation is performed by an intelligent and careful
artist, the cloth gains instead of losing.   The author ac
knowledges that in these different processes the agent is al

colouring principle renders it soluble in the leys employed,
which then become much more effectual.
    The use which C. Potel made of oxygenated muriatic acid
gas conducted him by accident to many trials and experi
ments which are of the utmost importance.        He has disco
vered that this substance may be employed with the greatest
advantage in all cases of asphyxia.    Several rats which had
been found drowned, were placed on a table on which some
ot this gas was deposited: soon after the rats disappeared, and
concealed themselves in a corner of the room, except one
which remained in the neighbourhood of the apparatus : it
had been restored to life, but, having sustained some injury in
its feet, it was not able to follow the rest. C. Potel caught
these animals, reduced them again to a state of asphyxia,
and, having subjected them to the action of the gas, saw
them resuscitated before him. He repeated the experiment
with the fame success in cats : in the last place, in imitation
of Dr. Storch, who tried on himself the action of hemlock,
this young chemist was induced to try on himself the efficacy
of his new method, and his boldness was crowned with suc
cess.    The academy has appointed commissioners to ascer
 tain in a certain manner the property of this gas in cafes of
 asphyxia.
    C. Degouvenain gave the result of a great number of ex
 periments he made on acetous fermentation, and which led
 to the demonstration of two points in theory not before
 proved by any positive fact; one of which, when the author
 publishes his processes, will serve as a guide to those desirous
 of making good vinegar. In the mean time he has applied
 his discovery to the advantage of domestic economy; and
 being convinced that the efficacy of aromatic vinegar de
 pends much more on its acid nature than the aromatous
 substances with which it is accompanied, he made some
 which to be saturated required from 130 to 150 parts of pot
 ash in a thousand, whereas the strongest before known (that
of Maille) absorbs only 114.
   Good wine combined with oxygen by a series of ingenious
processes peculiar to himself, is the only substance he employs
for making vinegar; and the result, according to the report of
the commissioners of the academy appointed to examine            it,
 is,thatit   in every respect superior in quality to the most

    Did Dr. Hebcrden inform you whether this inoculation
was performed from one human being to another, or front
the virus taken immediately from the cow                       ?

claim of being the promulgator, or inventor of vaccine in

    A.  I  have admitted Dr. Jenner was the gentleman who
first set on foot the inquiry into the advantages of the vaccine
inoculation       but apprehend that the practice of vaccine in
                  ;          I

his new facts, or what          consider to be new, have been, in
                                      I
my opinion, disproved                  by
                                subsequent observers     and that in   ;
consequence of those facts being disproved, together with the
very extensive experience of other persons, we owe the pre
sent practice of the vaccine inoculation.
    Will you inform the committee who those practitioners
and persons were to whom you refer?
    A. The cow-pock inoculation, after Dr. Jermer's book was
publislied in May or June 1798, which contained seven or
eight cafes, (the whole result of his experience,) was not
practised      byany person, that     know of, till January 1799;

  sequence of a general inquiry, which I had instituted imme
 diately after Dr. Jenner's publication, information was given
 of the cow-pock disease breaking out in two of the cow stabks
 near London; and from these sources Dr. Woodville and
 myself collected matter, by which, in the course of about
 three months, not fewer, I think, than about 300 persons
 were inoculated, in addition to the seven or eight cases of
 Dr. Jenner, then the whole stock of facts of inoculation be
 fore the public.         Besides carrying on the inoculation our
 selves in this manner, we disseminated the matter through
 out the country, in particular to Dr. Jenner* himself ; and
 particularly also, I within that time issued a printed letter,
 directed to upwards of 200 practitioners in different parts of
 the kingdom, containing thread impregnated with cow-pock
 matter.- In the course of this practice ws already learnt that
 young infants might be inoculated with safety, which I con
 sidered to be then a new fact, Dr. Jenner not having had the
 experience,      and being apprehensive of serious t consequences
 from inoculating them.
     Secondly, That the inoculated arms, so far from requiring
 caustic or eseharotic, or other topical applications, according
 to Dr.   J  , were sooner cured than in the inoculated small-pox :
 That Dr. Woodville's publication, in June 1799, appeared,
 containing the cases of upwards of 400 inoculated, up to that
 time: ana in August 1799 I published a statement of inocula
 tion, referring to many practitioners who had furnished me
with reports of inoculation with matter which I myself had
furnished: among these I beg leave to mention Mr. Keiion, of
Seven Oaks; Dr. Mitchel, of Chatham ; and Dr. Harrison's
cases; as communicated to me by the right honourable (ir
Joseph Banks: and by that time 1 had also introduced it into
the army, through the bunds of the surgeon-general, Mr.
Keate; and reports frequently came into my hands, by his di
rection, from the army. I had also by that time introduced
the vaccine inoculation into many parts of the continent, and
received reports of the successful practice of it; in particular,
from Dr. De Carro, of Vienna.                In addition to these testi
monies contained         in  the  paper  above  alluded to, is the result
of my own practice in three parishes of poor people inocu
lated under my i'uperintendancc ; so that in that paper, I be-

  i8a                       Vaccine Inoculation.
  lieve, it will be found that 2000 cases had by that time been
  afforded for the public by Dr. Woodville and myself, and
  the persons with whom I was in correspondence,               and who
  are mentioned in the papers alluded to.            By this time, too,
  some difficulties appear to have been removed which had
  been occasioned, in a great measure, by some facts stated to
   the public by Dr. Jenner.         In particular, I published expe
   riments of inoculation in the paper alluded to: — 1st, Of in
   oculating persons with the cow-pock who had undergone the
   small-pox, to sl>ow that they could not take the cow-pock
   after the small-pox, contrary to Dr. Jenner : 2dly, Experi
   ments to (how that persons could not take the cow-pock both
   locally and constitutionally who had already gone through
   the cow-pock, also contrary to Dr. Jenner : 3dly, Many per
   sons had bv this time made experiments to (how that the
   cow-pock did not originate in the grease of horses' heels, as
   Dr. Jenner had asserted. These sentiments will be found in
    a printed statement, which I beg to deliver in as published
    by me.
        In the spring of the year 1799, whilst the above-stated evi
    dence was collecting, a second publication appeared from
    Dr. Jenner, adding nothing but a few cases of inoculation
    further of the cow-pock, but recommending caustic or ef-
    charotic applications to the inoculated parts in the cow-pock,
    not found necessary by myself or the medical persons alluded
    to in my evidence : and I consider that the distinctive cha
    racters of the cow-pock were understood better by some of
    the above alluded to persons than by Dr. Jenner.
        The vaccine inoculation was next considerably establiflied
    by the Cow-pock Institution, of which I was one of the
    founders, the arrangement for which commenced at the very
    close of the year 1799; which Institution has been the prin
     cipal office, I apprehend, for supplying the world in general,
-   and the army and navy in particular, with matter ; and w here
     a regular register is kept ot each of the cafes inoculated, more
    fully and accurately than had been done any where before or
     since that time ; where the authenticity of the cafes, from
     the nature of the institution, is established in a manner that,
     I apprehend, will be considered as unexceptionable. This
    appears from a register of above 700 cafes already entered,
     and open to the inspection of the subscribers.         Bv this time,
     namely,    the  close  of the  year 1799,   I think  I  can make it
     appear  that  about   4000 persons  have  been   inoculated   by Dr.
     Woodville, myself, and correspondents, which can be referred
     to. I here close my evidence, as I consider it of very small
    importance, comparatively, what was done by others after
                                                                      this

  this time, all the facts that I recollect of use in practice
  being by this time established, as they have been since con
  firmed.
       Did you never hear of inoculation having been performed
 by Mr. Cline*, with matter furnished by Dr. Jenner, pre
 vious to the time you began to practise vaccine inoculation ?
      A. I cannot recollect distinctly.
      Were not seven or eight cases of Dr. Jenner alluded to by
 you, cafes of inoculation from one human being to another ?
      A. Some of them were ; some were not.
      Had not many, or a large majority of your first cafes, va-
  riolous-like eruptions?
      A. The matter, which had never been in the Small-pox hos
 pital, and which I myself took from the cows at the two cow
 stables above alluded to, scarcely ever afibrded any eruptions
 like the small-pox ; but when I obtained matter to supply
 my correspondents           in the country, not having enough of
 my     own,   but    obtaining it from the Small-pox hospital, it
frequently, according to the reports of my correspondents,
and in a few cafes where I used it myself, did produce such
eruptions.
      Was not the matter, or virus, which you distributed, found
great fault with on account of the eruptions it produced ?
      A. No, ft was not found fault with ; but many people were
disappointed, as they expected that one of the advantages at
 tending the inoculation was to be exempt from the eruptions.
      Did not these eruptions, which were produced by your
matter, very much discourage practitioners and the public,
and very much retard the progress of the new inoculation i
      A. I mould think it did not.
      Do you not know there is a cafe in Dr. Jenner'sf first publi
cation of his having inoculated a child of eleven months old?
      .A.  I believe there is one cafe.
     Did not Dr. Woodville and yourself take the vaccine mat
ter in Gray's-inn Lane, for the purpose of commencing your
experiments, from          a person fully marked with the small-pox ?
     A. No     such case is in mv recollection.
      Have those facts stated by you to militate against Dr. .Ten
ner's declared opinions remained uncomradicted by him ?
Does he still maintain them, or has he publicly retracted
 them ?
      A. I think     he has not retracted     them.       [Withdrew.

                      Dr. Heberden   s  Evidence.
     Dr. Heberden, being called to speak to the statement made
as above written, said,      "  That all he knew upon the subject
was, about three years ago Dr. Lind, of Windsor, mentioned
to him, in conversation, there was living, near Windsor, a
young man, apprentice to an apothecary, who, when a child,
was inoculated with vaccine matter by his father, who wa3
 an apothecary in the west of England. Wfth respect to Mr.
 Batliscombe he could not speak, having heard nothing of it."
— On this extract, from the minutes of the committee of the
 house of commons, the following remarks have been pub
 lished : " In his (Dr. Pearson's) examination of the 14th
  (April) the authority of Dr. Heberden is made use of to
 prove what on that gentleman's examination was found
 completely erroneous, for he could not speak to what Dr. Pear
son asserted be could ; and of Mr. Battifcombe he had no know
 ledge. On this it is unnecessary to make any comment; the
 conclusion must be obvious."
     These assertions, made from the words of Dr. Hebcrden's
 evidence, must appear unwarrantable by merely publishing
 this gentleman's explanation subjoined, obligingly commu
 nicated at the request of Dr. Pearson, who is conscious that
 he had been sufficiently correct in the statement above given
 on the authority of Dr. Heberden.
      "Dr. Heberden acquiesces in the correctness of his printed
 evidence, with the addition of only two words, viz. " having
  heard nothing of it from him."        In fact, Dr. Heberden was
  acquainted with Mr. Battifcombe, but received his informa
  tion respecting the vaccine inoculation from another quarter.
  Still it is true, that when Dr. Heberden mentioned the cir
  cumstance to Dr. Pearson upon Dr. Lind's authority, he cor
  roborated     his statement by adding, that Dr. Gisborne had
  been    made   acquainted with the same account through Mr.
 .Battifcombe.       So that Dr. Heberden may, in effect, be said
  to have related the circumstance to Dr. Pearson upon the
  united testimony of Dr. Lind and Mr. Battifcombe; though,
  his information in the latter cafe not having been derived
  immediately from that gentleman, he could not, with pro
  priety, produce to the committee the authority of Mr. Bat
  tifcombe for what he had heard upon the subject."

usual way.        The remaining third was inoculated in each arm
with one puncture with this diluted matter, and also in each
arm, in like manner, with undiluted cow-pock matter ; but all
 these sour punctures failed to produce the vaccine disease, the
 subject being an adult, and probably had had the small-pox.
      Letters from Bassora of the 17 th of June, from S. Mairesty,
 the British consul at that place, and Dr. Milne, physician to
 the factory, addressed to Dr. De Carro, of Vienna, confirm
  the happy result of the vaccine inoculation, which has been
  introduced into several parts of the East by the zeal of Dr.
  Carro.      This beneficial practice has been introduced not
  only    at Bagdad but also at Bassora.    At the latter the con
  sul set the first example by causing his own son to be inocu
  lated; and from the end of April to the 17th of June the
  operation had been performed on forty subjects with the
   best success.    Dr. Milne inoculated not only the sailors on
   board some ships destined for Bombay, but supplied a mer
   chant who was travelling to Mascate with vaccine matter for
   that district.
                     THE PLANET OF OLBEKS.
       Circumstances have been much more favourable for deter
   mining the orbit of this planet than for that of Piazzi, an
   arc four times as large. A great number of observations
   made during six months, with great exactness, notwithstand
   ing the difficulty of observing To faint an object, and an in
   clination of orbit much more considerable, give more pre
   cision to the results of calculation.
       C. Mechain and Messier observed this planet till the mid
    dle of the month of August ; the former, with a telescope
    which was not even mounted on a parallactic machine,
    which greatly increases the difficulty of observation. The
    comet which C. Mechain then discovered having obliged
    him to interrupt his observations, C. Messier continued to
    observe it alone till the 24th of September : he even tried to
    observe it on the i 6th of October;      but the vicinity of the
    horizon, and particularly the smoke of the chimneys which
    surrounded the observatory, rendered the observation too un
    certain to be turned to anv use. All these observations agree
    with an uncommon precision, and far superior to what could
    have been expected from an equatorial sector; C. Lalandc
    having found the difference of 30" in two consecutive
    observations of Mercury made with a large equatorial sector
    by an able astronomer : it appears also that this planet has no
     where been observed so long as at Taris.
                                                                 I  have

t$6                       Transit of Mercury.
   I have again carefully calculated the perturbations of the
new planet. They are exceedingly numerous ; nevertheless
I have obtained only an approximation very far distant from
that perfection to which astronomers aspire.           The applica
tion of so many equations to calculation is attended with se
veral difficulties, and requires many trials, principally on ac
count of the great inequality.        I have not yet finished them,
but I hope it will be a gratification to astronomers to be
made acquainted with the primitive orbit which I had cal
culated without employing perturbations, and corrected
according to the latest observations ; a labour which was in
terrupted only for two days by the researches.         I began em
ploying the perturbations —

Messier, and Burckhardt.
   With    these elements it is found that the planet on the
4th of Feb. 1803,       at midnight, will have 2670 41' right as
cension, and 50 38 north declination ; which differs only a
few minutes from the position which Dr. Gauss deduced
from his elements.         That able astronomer could employ ob
servations only to the 8th of July, and still proposes to rectify
his elements by later observations.
   I hope this result will be confirmed when I have deter
mined an ellipse by employing the perturbations.

                        Transit of Mercury  .                   187
    Utrecht, Nov.   10. — M.   van Utenhoven observed yesterday
at the observatory of this academy, the ingress of Mercury
at 1 a hours 17 minutes 53 seconds, and the egress or the end
of the transit of the planet over the fun's disk at 12 hours
19 minutes 28 seconds true time.         M. Timmers of Rotter
dam, a student here, observed the passage of Mercury over
the meridian to be 15 seconds after the fun's limb. He ob
served also several times the contact of the Sun and Mercury
on the horizontal and vertical threads of a quadrant by Bird,
in order to calculate ihe time of the conjunction according
to the method of L'lfle le Cadet. This phænomenon, which
will not be visible again in this republic till the 4th of May
183a, was rendered much more important by the appearance
of a great many solar spots ; a collection of such spots, one or
two of which seemed to be larger than Mercury.
    Ley den, Nov. 10. — Yesterday morning I had the satisfac
 tion, with M. Bifdom, M. van der Meer, and several of my
 pupils, to observe at the observatory of our university the
passage of Mercury over the sun's disk.         Mercury it appears
 must have been on the fun's disk before sun-rise, as the clouds
 prevented us from seizing that luminary till half after nine.
 The sun having then broke through the clouds for some time,
 the planet was plainly seen on the son's disk as a black,
 round, fliarply defined body, and could be easily distinguished
 from the solar spots, a great many of which were then visible
 on the son's disk.     The planet took its course under a great
 many    of  the  principal spots, and, when it approached the
 fun's limb, seemed to have a somewhat elongated form.              I
 observed the contact at the time of ingress to be at 12 hours
  15 minutes 6 seconds, and at the time of eprefs at 12 hours
  16 minutes 40 seconds, and therefore that of the planet's was
  12   hours 15 minutes 53 seconds, true civil time.             The
  planet employed 94 seconds from the time of ingress to that
  of its egress, which agrees very well with calculation if the
  diameter be taken at 1 1 seconds.       I previoufly observed the
  planet's passage  of  the  meridian with   our meridian circle on
  the 8thv of November, 23 hours 43 minutes 8 seconds mean
  time.    I have no doubt that this transit will enable astrono
  mers to improve or confirm the tables of Mercury.

  fun.
     Enschede lies 500 1 6' north latitude and 7 '30" in time
  cast from Amsterdam.       At fun-rife I saw the planet a good
  way from the eastern limb on the fun's disk.       There were a
  great many spots on the fun's disk, and particularly on the
  west side, about 10 in the morning.         The sky was clearer,
  though it was cloudy in the west. We were, however, able
  to follow the planet in its passage.      About 11 the sky be
  came clear in the south ; but about 10 minutes after noon a
  very thick cloud proceeded from the north, which threat
  ened to deprive us of all hope of seeing the egress.       A few
 minutes before the planet came in contact with the fun's
 limb, I took the smoked glass from the telescope, and saw
  clearly the interior contact of the sun's limb, at ia hours
  aa minutes 10 seconds true time; but in a few minutes the
 western limb of the fun was covered by a thick cloud, so that
 no observation could be made of the exterior contact of Mer
 cury with the sun's limb.
     The planet when on the disk seemed to be surrounded by
 a small luminous circle.      The fun's limb also at the time of
 interior contact seemed to quiver, and, as it were, to swell up
 a little.                                  L. Nieuwenhuis.
     Paris, Nov. 9. — The passage of Mercury over the fun's
 disk was observed this morning, for the 19th lime.            The
 weather was exceedingly favourable, and astronomers en
joyed, in the completest manner, the fight of this curious
 phænomenon.         I was the more anxious to have a view of         it,
 as
 I     shall never see it more, since the next will not take place
 till the 5th of May 183a        for   do not reckon those which
 will be invisible in Europe.

       Respected Friend,
    I must beg room for a few lines to obviate any offence to a
respectable body by the erroneous addition of F. L. S. to my
same, which      I  meet with in p. 55 of last Magazine.        I am
neither fellow nor associate of the Linnæan Society, and,
notwithstanding the insertion of a little piece, which has
been favourably received by that body in their last volume of
Transactions, am not, nor have been, a candidate for         a  place
therein.              Thy sincere Friend,

    We are sorry to have made the mistake alluded to by
Mr. Howard. It arose from a very natural association of
                                                               ideas,

                           GALVANISM.                Paris, Oct. 14.
     C. Aldini, a native of Italy, and nephew of the celebrated
 Galvani, to whom we are indebted for the discovery of that
 electricity called the Galvanic, repeated, a few days ago, in
 presence of the commissioners of the National Institute, and
 yesterday at the Oratoire, in presence of the Galvanic Society,
 the principal experiments ; in consequence of which he as
 serts, with justice, that the ideas of his uncle respecting ani
 mal electricity ought not to be entirely rejected, to adopt ex
 clusively those of Volta respecting metallic electricity.        It
 results, indeed, from the experiments of C. Aldini, that there
 is an animal pile and an animal circle, as there is a metallic
 pile and metallic circle.
     The experiments of which we were witnesses, and which
  prove his opinion in a rigorous manner, are as follow:
     1st, The sciatic nerves of a frog being laid bare, as is usu
  ally done, for subjecting them to the action of the arming
  and metallic circle, he contented himself with bringing to
  gether and putting in contact the muscular parts of the
  thighs and paws ot the frog with the uncovered nerves, and
  contractions of the animal took place as in the usual Galvanic
  experiment.
     ad, He took the frog by the paws, holding it with one
  hand by the muscular parts, making the nerves hang down:
  he touched with a finger of the other hand the nerves thus
  suspended ; and the contractions took place as by the metallic
  circle and Galvanic apparatus.
     3d, For the third experiment, he made his assistant hold
  the frog by the paws or by the muscular parts ; applied his
  finger to the nerves, without giving his hand to the assistant ;
  and the contractions did not take place.       He then gave his
   hand to the assistant ; and, having applied a finger of the
   other hand to the nerves, the contractions took place as in
   the other experiments. These experiments were repeated on
   several frogs.
      In the last place, several experiments were made on the
   head of a large dog separated from the trunk, which had no
   relation either to the animal circle or pile ; but afterwards
   they took one of the above frogs, and, by putting a singer
   into the spinal marrow of the dog, presenting with the other
   hand the nerves of the frog to one of the muscles of the trunk
              6                                                    of

 lyz                         Galvanism.
of the dog, the contractions of the frog took place as with
the Galvanic apparatus; which, according to the observations
of the author, leaves no doubt respecting the existence of the
animal circle and pile. These ingenious experiments will
doubtless furnish to their modest and learned author a multi
tude of other ideas on the animal economy, particularly re
specting the nervous fluid, &c, which leave him the care
and glory to explain.
   For my part, I came out from these experiments charmed
and transported with admiration at the simplicity of the means
which nature employs in its phænomena that seem to us the
most complex.       It appears to me proved, that to perform a
prodigious number of its operations it contents itself with one
electric fluid, which it puts in motion at the surface and in
the interior of the earth by a kind of Galvanic piles, which,
produce, as I have explained in my lectures, a great number
of the phænomena of the animal and vegetable kingdom;
and that it has employed the fame agent in the animalking-
dom, by organizing the nerves and muscles as Galvanic piles
to execute most or the operations of animal life by the fame
agent, and by means of these substances the nerves and the
muscles, which it has organized in such a manner, that they
discharge, in regard to each other, the same functions as the
different metals the contact of which excites a permanent
current of the electric fluid ; which is the most valuable dis
covery for which we are indebted to the pile of Volta.
   It had hitherto been tried, without success, to excite a per
manent electric current without friction ; and the machine
of Hierne did not accomplisti this end in a satisfactory
manner.
   This permanence of the electric fluid, for which we are
indebted to the Voltaic pile, is a discovery, then, no less ad
mirable perhaps than that of C. Aldini ; and both have given
to the natural sciences a stimulus which will astonish future
ages, if the results be followed, as there is no reason to doubt.

  XXX.     On Capillary Aclion.      .By  John Leslie,       Esq.*
  A HE      principle of universal attraction, having finally sub
dued every species of opposition, is now fixed on a base never
to be shaken.      Many are the fruitless attempts to explain its
operation by the impulsive energy of some invisible impalpa
ble fluid : but these owe their birth to metaphysical prejudice,
and are justlv discarded by all sober and reflecting inquirers.
Nor is the supposition of such mechanical intermedia merely
repugnant to the spirit of true philosophy; it is directly con
tradicted by recent discoveries.      When an impulse is com
municated to any mass or system of particles, it is transferred
along the chain by a series of pulsations, each particle in fuc-
ceflion feeling the action and suffering a momentary derange
ment.     Motion is therefore propagated in the fame manner
as found, and the celerity of its transmission must depend on
the mutual distance of the affected particles and the relative
force with which they are connected together. In most cafes,
indeed, that come under observation, it is impossible to di
stinguish the interval between the origin and the termination
of an impulse, which is thence very generally imagined to act
simultaneously through the whole line of its communication.
But, though the rapidity of transit outstrips the quickness of
 our sensations, it still requires a certain lapse of time.     Nay,
 on the just estimate of this principle, — on the duration of ef
 fect, — (refined as it may appear,) depends the theory of the
 tools and manipulations used in most of the mechanic arts.
 Nor is the existence of such a small yet finite moment a
 mere abstraction; it is the necessary result of the known pro
 perties of matter.      Were we to suppose that the sun acts on
 the planets by the intervention of some subtle medium dif
 fused through the celestial spaces and endowed with the most
 powerful elasticity, a very considerable measure of time would
 be required to propagate the impression.           If we ascribed lo
 that fluid, for example, the relative density and elasticity of
 hydrogenous gas, almost five years would be spent in convey
 ing the impulsive energy to the earth.        But it is proved, by
 some late and very nice researches of M. Laplace on the ir
 regularities of the planetary motions, that the attractive force
 or the fun is exerted simultaneously at all distances.           The
 notion of an intermediate fluid is thus entirely precluded.
    The principle of atlion at a dijlance is therefore a primary

of that law, from which are derivol (he various constitution
and all the diversified properties, of bodies. The mutual action
exerted between two elementary portions of matter            in the     is,
language of modern algebraists, always sorn^ funclion of their
distance.     At proximate distances, this function must change
repeatedly, aud with different degrees of intensity, from posi    ,

whether we consider the elementary portions of matter as
points, atom?, particles, or molecules. Their magnitude,                          if
they have any, never enters into the estimate.              When the
distance     considerable, the law of action becomes confounded

with that of gravitation, and      isof such remarkable simplicity
as to qualify    it  for the happiest application ever made of the
mathematical sciences.         Could we ascertain the gradations
at near distances, we might determine the structure, affini
ties, and mutual operations of bodies, with the fame cer
tainty as we compute the revolutions of the planets. But
such  a discovery seems placed beyond the reach of the human
faculties.    However,    by   ascrupulous attention, we may dis
cern   certain   instances of the approximation and transition of
corpuscular    forces.    And  I  hold those facts to be the more
valuable, as they form the intermediate link between the me
chanical and the chemical phænomena.
   Of this kind   I     consider the ascension       water and other

not stop to describe it.     It was first noticed            by
                                                        the Academy
del Cimento, at Florence, early         in  the 17th century; but
seems not to have been much regarded in the sequel.               After
the promulgation, however, of the Newtonian system, the
subject was revived with ardour.        It  was justly considered as
affording   intuitive  evidence of the  reality of attraction. About
the beginning of the 8th century, Hawksbee, in England,
                         1
made Tome excellent experiments            on capillary action      aud       ;
Musschcnbroeck pursued the same course              Holland. Similar
                                                       in
experiments were performed         in  France; but in that country
the Cartesian philosophy was then       in   the height of its career,
and no deliberate attention could be paid to facts which ap
peared to countenance an opposite system.            About the same
period Dr. Jurin published, at London, an elaborate disserta
tion on the cause of capillary action        ; and his explication of
that curious fact seems, either from conviction or supine
acquiescence, to be almost universally adopted.               repeated
                                                                  It   is

 of its solidity, and scarce an attempt is made to establish an
 other theory.       The celebrated Clairaut, indeed, has casually
 touched on the subject of capillary adtion in his Treatise on
 the Figure of the Earth; but his investigation of that phæ-
 nomenon is lost in a chaos of calculation.            M. Lalande, who
 is so active a writer, has tried to unravel         it:  the astronomer
 does not appear, however, to have succeeded.              I content my
 self with this general notice of his little tract ; for to refute it
 is much easier than to render it distinctly intelligible.
     But, when we coolly consider Jurin's account of capillary
 action, we are surprised that it could obtain such success. It
 is in appearance simple indeed, and plausible; but it will not
.bear the slightest examination.          The water is conceived to be
 kept suspended      in  the  tube  by  the attraction of the small ring
 of glass immediately above the interior surface.                But I ask,
 Ought      not  the   ring  below   to  exert an equal   force   in a con
 trary    direction,   and   consequently destroy      the   effect  of the
 former? This argument it seems impossible to elude, and to
  expand it would be superfluous.             We must therefore regard
  the common account of capillary action as entirely without
 foundation.
      It may well furnish matter for surprise and mortification to
  remark such a glaring oversight committed in the very porch
  of the physical sciences.        But if we extend our observations
  we shall soon be convinced that the popular branches of phi
  losophy, with all their supposed improvement, are in general
  still very defective and erroneous. Those flowery departments
  have been left to the culture of a secondary order of men,
 whose imagination was commonly more powerful than their
 judgment.        In every age the vigour of genius has been di
  rected to the sublimer parts, and those united efforts have
  reared a stupendous         monument of the penetration and re
  sources of the human mind.
      In attempting to explain the mode of capillary action, the
  chief difficulty ieems to arise from the prejudice that a ver
  tical attraction is necessary to account for the elevation of
  liquor in the lube: yet this is assuredly' not the primarv di
  rection of the force; for, the action of glass being evidently
  confined within very narrow limits, that virtue must be dif
  fused over the internal surface of the tube, and consequently
  must exert itself laterally, or at right angles to the fides. Nor
  is it difficult to conceive how a lateral action may cause an
  ascent.     We know that in fluids a force impressed in one di
  rection is capable of propagating itself in all directions. The
  tendency    of  the liquor to approach the glass, must occasion           it
                                     Ni                                    tQ

to spread over the internal cavity of the tube, and, conse
quently, to mount upwards.
    But let us view the subject a little more closely.       Suppose
I put a drop of water upon a horizontal plate of glass: it
will quit its globular form, adhere to the glass, and spread
 out till it has covered the plate with a thin aqueous film.
 What then is the cause of this phænomenon ? It is surely
 not the mere incumbent weight of the water; for that would
 not have been sufficient even to surmount the mutual adhesion
 of the particles of the fluid, or their natural tendency to ag-
 globulate.     Besides, the fame precise effect will take place if
 the drop be applied to the under fide of the plate.       The water
 therefore diffuses itself on the glass in the fame manner as if
 it were urged by the pressure of a column acting against that
 surface.    Its attraction to the glass is equivalent to this sup
 posed pressure, and is productive of the fame consequences.
 But why should the mere tendency of the water to the surface
 of the glass occasion a dispersive motion ? The reason              is,
                                                                  that
 the external particles could not approach without spreading
 themselves and extending the film       :  and analogy will instruct
 us, thai the attraction of water to glass must increase in pro
 portion to the proximity of its approach, till        ithas reached
 the term of closest union.
    If the plate be held vertically the aqueous film will still
 adhere, but only to       acertain limited elevation, depending on
 its thickness.  I    reckon the force of suspension corresponding
 to each inch of width, or of the extent of the horizontal
 linear boundary, as equal to the weight of about the 100th
 part of cubic inch of water.
         a                              Hence,     the film was only
                                                  if
 the 1000th part of an inch in thickness,         itwould maintain         a
 height often inches; but         if its thickness amounted to the
  100th of an inch,    it would subside to an elevation of one inch.
    Suppose  I   now dip the plate perpendicularly          inbasin of
                                                                 a
 water, the film will suffer      a very considerable   modification.
 A new portion of water greedily attaches itself to the film,
 and depresses   it   by the load of additional weight.     The curve
 of protuberance seems nearly an inverted parabola, and con
 sequently the pressure to be sustained      is only the third part of
 what would obtain     if  the column had been of uniform thick
 ness.    The relative force of attraction        istherefore =¦ -,-4*     ;
 and  if   we   conceive   the  height   to  be equal to the breadth,
 which appears nearly the case, either of them will be denoted
 by   */ih-B, or little more than the sixth part of an inch
                 a                                                         :

      Is two   glass plates, held near each other and parallel, be
  clipped  in water,   the water will mount in the included space.
  1 he aqueous protuberance is now confined, and the ascent of
  the column is therefore greater; besides that the effect is
  doubled by the united action of both opposite surfaces. Each
  surface acts only upon a thin film ; but, since the force is
  spent in supporting the particles which adhere to this, the
  height of the column must evidently be inversely as the weight
  suspended, or the distance between the glass plates.      Imagine
  the interval between those plateg to be the 100th part or an
  inch : then each surface may be considered as acting against
  a column of the thickness of the 200th part of an inch ; and
  since the force of attraction is equivalent to the weight of the
   100th part of a cubic inch, the corresponding ascent must be
  two inches.      In like manner, if the interval were only the
  200th part of an inch, the height of the column must be
  four inches.      In general, put d = the distance between the
  plates, and    —- =     the height of the column.
     The fame reasoning is applicable in the cafe of capillary
  tubes.    The attraction of the internal surface is exerted on
  a thin circular lining; b-.it this force is diluted and attenu
  ated by the pressure of the water which adheres to the film
  and occupies the cavity of the tube.          A circle, it is well
, known, is equal to a rectangle which has the circumference
  for its base and half the radius for its altitude : consequently
  the attractive power of the glass will produce the fame essedt
  as if it acted simply against a column whose thickness is one-
  fourth part of the bore of the tube.     But we have already seen
  that the measure of force is expressed by -,ia; and hence, if
  d denote the width of the bore, the height at which the water
  will  be suspended     in the tube will be  =          —   =  —.
  Thus the altitude of suspension in capillary tubes is the double
  of what obtains with parallel plates whose mutual distance is
  the diameter of the bore.
     The suspension of water in capillarv tubes must depend
  entirely on the smallness of the superior orifice.       Nor will
  the effect be in any degree altered, however much the lower
  part of the tube be enlarged : for, by the laws of fluids, the
  pressure is proportional merely to the altitude of the column ;
  and this pressure is balanced at the upper extremity by the
  adhesive force of the film, which attaches itself to the infibe
   of the tube.

   If a capillary tube be inserted through another tube, and
both clipped in water, it will rise not only in the capillary
bore, but in the interstice between the two tubes.          Even
though the diameter of the outer tube be considerable, the
water must form a sensible elevation in the intermediate ring;
and this elevation will be determined by comparing the ex
tent of the opposite surfaces of glass with the intercluded space
on which their action is spent.       The absolute ascent in the
capillary bore continues the fame; but, if we estimate it from
the external protuberant ring ot water, it will appear evi
dently diminished.      Conceive the outer tube to be fitted with
a bottom, and the whole to be removed from the basin : the
effect will still remain the same, and consequently the appa
rent altitude of the fluid in the capillary bore will be dimi
nished: Let d denote this bore, d" the diameter of the tube,
and d" the width of the outer tube, or rather that of the cis
tern in which the capillary is plunged : then it may be easily
investigated,    from the principles already explained, that the
height   to   which   the water will rife is =        —         "~
jT-f-— ) in    inches.
     If the tube has its lower orifice not too wide, on removing
 it from the cistern in which it was immersed, a drop of water
 will adhere, and the column in the capillary bore will remain
 at the same height.       Its suspension, we have seen, is pro
duced by the lateral adhesion of the internal him, to which
a cylinder of water attaches itself.     If the drop at the extre
mity be diministied by any cause, such as the contact of
bibulous paper, the column will subside ; for the tendency
of the water to agglobnlate then counteracts, in some degree,
its capillary extension in the tube. Cover a horizontal piece
of glass with a fine film of water, and bring the tube with
its charge to touch        the water will immediately desert the

which the vertical column of water, joined to its weight, bears
to the expansive horizontal film, overcomes its adhesion to
the narrow film that lines the inside of the tube.         We here
contemplate the extreme calc      ;  butit  should be remarked in
general that the mutual attraction of the particles os water or
other fluids must, to      acertain degiee, dimiuiili their ascent
in capillary tubes, since that force lends to agglomerate the
parts, and consequently opposes any ramifications or fila
mentous prolongations of the fluid.       This resistance,it might

  ponderates       one consequence of this
                      :                            is the concavity re
  marked at the top of the column;           clear proof that the lateral
                                               a
 exceeds the central adhesion.         If the upper surface were per
 fectly flat, those two forces would be in exact equilibrium.
 But the convexity of the top of the column proves that the
 fluid has greater attraction to its own particres than to glass.

 Such      the cafe with quicksilver, which, instead of ascending
           is

 pulsion existing between quicksilver and glass.            But regard

     Hence the mercury in         abarometer can never mount to its.
true height; and the error will be the more considerable in
proportion as the tube       is  narrow.    If two tubes of different
diameters be carefully filled and planted in the fame basin,
the mercurial column will stand visibly higher in the wider
tube. This aberration has been generally neglected, though
it  must evidently affect the barometric calculation of the alti

idea, though not logically accurate, was ingenious, and had a
certain degree of success. It is evident that the force measured
was not strictly that of mutual attraction, but only the weight
of the protuberant mass of fluid the moment before its sepa
ration.   Nor does the height of this column depend on its
mere adhesion ; for it can never exceed the cohesive force of
the fluid molecules to each other.      When the plate, what
ever may be its attractive power, is raised above a certain
limit, the attached column breaks, and part of it adheres to
the plate, while the rest falls back into the body of the fluid.
Thus, those experiments can ascertain the adhesion of the
plate only when it is comparatively very small ; in other cases
they measure simply the integrant attraction of the particles
of the fluid.  If  capillary action be regarded as approximate
to chemical affinity, this may be always determined, with
facility and with sufficient accuracy, by observing the ascent
in two parallel plates fixed at some minute but known di
stance from each other.
   The elevation of a liquid in a capillary bore is produced by-
its specific attraction to the matter of the tube. With dif
ferent substances the effects are considerably diversified : al
cohol, for example, rises little more than a third part of the
height to which water reaches.         But the slightest alteration
in the constitution of the substance will sometimes occasion a
very material difference of effect.    Thus I find that, on di
luting the alcohol, the ascent of the liquor is scarcely at all
augmented ; but, if I reverse the process, and add a few drops
of alcohol to the water, the capillary column will suffer a re
markable depression. On this principle might be constructed
a very simple hydrometer for measuring the strength of weak
liquors.    And I would invite chemists to try capillary action
with different saline and metallic solutions, as I am confident
that many curious facts would thus be discovered.         Nothinc
 could exceed the simplicity of such an instrument. It is only
necessary to choose a sine calibred tube, and to have it divided
 on the outside into equal parts by the point of a diamond, or
 marked with enamel colours. On plunging it into the liquid
 and then removing      it, the precise effect would be indicated
 by the suspended column.         Ihave no doubt but that such
 an instrument, in the hands of        askilful operator, would be
 brought to mark, with sufficient exa6tncs», the proportion of
 ingredients contained in     a compound fluid, and might in
 some cafes supersede the trouble of analysis itself.

merous proximate facets ; and it is the more notable, as the
aggregate surface is very large in comparison with the inter
stices to be silled up with humidity.        But the absorption of
water by bibulous paper, linen, or flannel, though com
monly referred to the fame cause, is of a very different na
ture.     From close observation I am convinced that in those
instances there occurs a real though not a permanent change
of constitution: the solid begins to assimilate itself to the
qualities of the combined fluid, and becomes softer and more
tranflucid.      By means of an instrument, contrived to mea
 sure the smallest alteration of volume, I have proved deci
 sively that the union of water or oil with paper or linen ii
 accompanied with a general contraction or concentration of
 the mass. Nay, applying a delicate thermometer, I perceived
 a very sensible extrication of heat invariably to take place
 during such combinations.        And this effect was the greater
 in proportion to the previous dryness of the solid. Thus           I
 have sometimes produced a heat of ten degrees by moistening
 saw-dust which had been parched before the fire. An ab
 sorption of this kind is strictly a chemical process : the in
  ternal structure of the solid is altered, and a force is deve
  loped very distinct in quality and degree from what obtains
  in capillary action. The contemplation of such facts may
  serve to extend our ideas of chemical agency.        The state of
  fluidity is essential to its operation ; but that quality is re
  quired only in one of the ingredients, and the result of the
   combination may be indifferently a fluid or a solid.     Copper
   will imbibe quicksilver and become only more brittle; and,
   on the other hand, quicksilver will dissolve a small portion of
   copper without relinquishing its fluid character.     Nay, if the
   one species of combination can be produced, we may safely
   infer the existence of the other. Thus all stones are found
   to contain water incorporated in their substance, altogether
   distinct from what may insinuate itself in their accidental
   crevices.    If we reverse the combination, therefore, and sup
   pose the fluid to predominate, we shall conclude that water
   is to a certain degree capable of dissolving all sorts of stones.
    And if,   disregarding the authority of disputed systems, we
   candidly examine the numerous facts that occur in geology,
    we cannot hesitate to admit the justness of the proposition.
I      would not venture, however, to maintain that water           is
    singly capable of dissolving the hardest stone; for the cohesion
    of the integrant molecules will, in some cafes, oppose force
                                                            a
    superior to the attraction of the water.   But the process may
                                                                    be

be assisted by the concurrence of other agents that tend 10
disunite the {olid.       In general, the action of chemical affini
ties admits of comparison with the application of mechanical
force. There are some obvious facts which at once illustrate
and confirm this principle. For example, carbonic gas, com
bined with water, enters into the composition of marble ; but
neither of those fugitiva substances, however concealed or
disguised, yet abandons its specific character.         On the ap
plication of intense heat their elasticity becomes developed
with irresistible force, and they make their escape, leaving
the stony basis in the dry caustic state of quicklime.       I shall
mention one other fact which exhibits the play of chemical
affinities.    Charcoal, it is well known, has the property of
imbibing     air;  and I have proved from experiment that this
imprisoned     air exists  in a compressed or condensed state. But
water, being applied to the charcoal, will be immediately
absorbed by superior attraction, and will dislodge the air,
which now recovers its usual expansion.
    Sulphuric acid, potasli, and in general all the deliquescent
salts, have the power of attracting moisture from the atmo
sphere.     They exert a real chemical action which overcomes
the adhesion of humidity to the air. But I have remarked
the fame property to obtain more or less in a great variety of
substances;     in paper, linen, flannel, wood; nay, in stones
and earths. The water, thus abstracted from the atmosphere,
penetrates into their substance and disappears.        The surface
of glass (hows, in a limited degree, a similar power. I have
observed that, on the approach of evening, bits of glass be
came covered over with minute globules long before the sur
rounding air was absolutely damp.           About the temperature
of freezing I have noticed this dew to appear on the surface
of the glals, when my hygrometer still indicated a dryness of
five degrees.      But in higher temperatures the effect was even
more linking ; and I have seen the fides of a tumbler covered
with dew when the ambient air possessed iq degrees of dry
ness,    la those cases, however, the humidity is merely de
tached from the air by the action of the glass, and it remains
adhering to the surface without being absorbed into the vi
treous mass. The effect cannot, with any appearance of pro
bability, be imputed to a supposed alkaline efflorescence ; for
it was observed with fine flint glass, and the dew collected
was always perfectly tasteless.' When poliffied metals were
exposed, they never received any dew till the atmosphere was
absolutely damp.        They seem therefore to be entirely passive.
    This singular property of glass is certainly a modification
                                                                  of

 of capillary action     : it must therefore obtain in other kindred
 substances.      I am inclined to refer it to the fame cause, how
 ever apparently subtle, which has so forcibly struck me in
 some other researches.        It is well understood that physical is
 different from mathematical, contact.             In the former there
 is a finite interval whose extent is various, depending on
 the mutual relation of the bounding surfaces.              The degree
 of approach is greater in some cafes than in others, or
 the contact is of a more perfect kind.                 I have proved
 lately, I think to demonstration, that air is separated from
 the polished surface of metal by a much wider interval than
 from glass or other substances.         The air therefore, charged
 with its humidity, approaches so close to the glass, that the
 latter exerts most powerfully its specific attraction, and de
 taches the minute globules of water.           Paper and other vege
 table substances, though saturated with moisture, and there-
 sore capable only of displaying capillary action, seem to pos
 sess the fame property as glass.
     I consider the power of abstracting humidity from the at
 mosphere as of important consequence in the vegetable eco
 nomy.       Plants mav thus inhale liquid nutriment, when the
 ambient air is still far from being disposed to part with its
 watery store.       And we have seen that heat promotes the
 effect.    Hence certain vegetable tribes, without feeling the
 beneficial influence of rain or dews, are yet capable of ex
 isting in the sultry arid plains of Arabia.           They extract a
 scanty supply     of  moisture  from  the  air by  a sort of chemical
 process.    Perhaps the organic     structure  of the  plant may con
 spire with its physical quality in augmenting the effect.
    The celerity of the flow of liquids in capillary syphons de
 pends chiefly on a circumstance which, I believe, has not
 hitherto been noticed.        If we consider with a little degree of
 attention the motion of water through a narrow passage, we
 shall soon be convinced that it is not regular and uniform. The
 obstruction at first experienced occasions a certain accumula
 tion, which at length overpowers resistance and causes a par
 tial acceleration.       In this manner, a sort of continual re
 ciprocating    tide  is produced in a series of pulses more or less
 intricate.     This curious effect is distinctly visible in artificial
jels-d'ea?i.      But the fame thing may be perceived in every
 current of water.        Hence the varving dimpled surface and
 the gentle murmur, of brooks.           The volume of water conti
 nues the fame ; but its contours and flexures are incessantly
 changing, and soothe the fancy by exhibiting a picture of ani
 mation. After performing a certain cycle, however, the fame
 irregularities are again repeated; and hence the musical ca
                                                                 dence

  dence    of rivulets, so closely associated in our minds with luxu
  rious   ease and   the calm pleasures of pastoral life.
     If we examine carefully the ascent of mercury in a fine
  thermometer, we shall find that it mounts by a succession of
  starts.    It seems to force itself along by a sort of vermicular
 motion.       Nor does the resistance depend much on the fric
 tion experienced against the fides ot the tube ; it is owing
 chiefly to the waste of force in impressing a narrow thread of
 liquid with those concatenated contractions and dilatations
 indispensable to progressive motion.          I must observe that the
 term fluidity itself is merely of relative import. A solid body
 may soften by insensible gradations, and pass into the state of
 a fluid.     In this new condition the particles arc indifferent to
 position, and therefore easily admit of intestine motion. But
 such a property implies an extension of the sphere of mutual
 connection.        In a large system of molecules, the slightest al
 teration in the situation of each is sufficient to produce a total
 change of arrangement.           It is otherwise when the group is
 rery limited.       The composition of a fluid may thus Le con
 ceived to resemble a long spring, which bends easily and
 without risk under the smallest pressure ; while the structure
 of a solid may be compared to a stiort spring, which yields
only to the application of a great force, and is then liable to
 break. But the action of heat extends this imaginary fpriug,
 and promotes softness and fluidity.            Thus a bit of sealing-
Wax, held near the flame of a candle, gradually loses its angles
 and protuberances; an evident proof that the sphere of mu
 tual cohesion is enlarged. And every person must have re
marked that oil, during the heat of summer, becomes appa
 rently thin, and flows with facility. Nay, water itself under
goes a similar change of constitution, though it eludes ordi
nary observation.         I bend a thermometer tube, with rather
a wide bore, into a siphon, which 1 insert into a tumbler of
cold water, and count how many drops fall in a minute.               I
then empty the tumbler, and fill it to the fame height with
hot water; and, replacing the siphon, 1 find that the drops,
which are still of the fame size, succeed each other much
more rapidly than before, insomuch as sometimes to form a
continual streamlet.         I conclude, from several trials, that the
velocity of the flow is at least fix times greater near the boil
ing point than on the verge of congelation.             But the dif
ference may be rendered much more striking in another
way.       The height to which liquids are projected is pro
portional to the square of their initial velocity.            Provide,
therefore, a glass tube three or four feet long and more
than half an inch wide: by the help of a blow-pipe, draw
           7

out the end into a tapering capillary bore, and, a little above
this, bend the {houlder back parallel to the tube. Then,
holding the tube perpendicular, fill it with cold water, and
break off by degrees the slender stem till the water begins
to spirt up perhaps half an inch. Now plunge the lower
end of the tube, for the space of a minute or two, in boiling
water, and, on removing it, the jet will appear to dart almost
to the height of three feet, but will gradually subside as the
heated portion of water is expended.
    The fame experiment will succeed, though in different pro
portions, with alcohol and even mercury.             Yet all these are
commonly deemed perfect fluids ; nor can we doubt that the
application of heat will in every cafe increase the tenuity of
the liquid substance, and heighten its degree of fluidity.               If
water thus experiences such a change, the effect must be pro
portionally greater on the dilute solution of mucilaginous and
 saccharine matter which constitutes the sap of plants.               The
 return of spring, by the mere physical influence of its warmth,
 will promote the flow of the juices destined for the nourish
 ment of the vegetable tribes. That genial season, therefore,
 not only reanimates the principle of life, and stimulates the
 organs of secretion to elaborate their fluids, but quickens the
 circulation of those fluids through the fine ramifications of
 the sap-vessels.      Hence the rapid growth of plants in the hot
 climates.        Hence, likewise, the quick vegetation remarked
 within the polar circle, where, for the space of weeks or
 months, the slanting rays of the fun play without intermission.

 The        saline substance which has lately been imported into
Britain under     the name of salt os bitumen, is not, as might
be inferred from the title, a natural production, but an ar
tificial preparation of great antiquity invented by the Hindus.
It  is known in India by various appellations    ; but the trivial           t
name, by which it is familiar to those who have resided any
time in that country, is kbala nimuc, or black salt.         It is
met with in every village in large irregular lumps, for the
most part of a dark brown colour.
   It has a strong saline taste, with a peculiar sensation dif
fused over the mouth, which is not easily described.    At first,
the taste is disagreeable : but I have been told by those who
were in the habit of using      that              it,

                Observations   on the   Salt of Bitumen.         fiojp
tton has been pretty strong, on pouring out the water, the
inside of the vessel in which it was contained is found lined
with a crust of a dark brown colour; a phænomenon observed
in most sulphur wells : this will be best discovered if the ex
periment is made in a glass vessel.
      A silver spoon laid over a fresh solution of the salt became
 discoloured in the course of a few hours; and a little sugar of
 lead put upon the shank of the spoon, and kept over the so
 lution during the night, was found in the morning consider
 ably blackened.       A few drops of the nitric acid added to the
 fresh solution caused a milky appearance,        and a little acetate
 of lead poured into a glass of it caused a precipitate that filled
 nearly one-third of the glass. The hepatic gas is in such abun
 dance, that, by exposing a strong solution in a tumbler to the
  air, the sulphur becomes at once evident, in the crust with
  which the glass is uniformly found to be lined.
      After a solution of the salt had been exposed to the air till
  it became perfectly clear, a quantity of it was poured into a
  china plate, and gradually evaporated by the heat of the fun:
  there remained in the plate a number of cubical crystals,
  evidently pure common salt, without any other residuum.
  The salt, from the taste, and some curious phænomena at
   tendingit,   appeared to be of an uncommon degree of purity.
      From these experiments        appears that salt of bitumen
                                it                                   is
   chiefly composed of common salt and hepatic air, or, in the
   language of modern chemistry, of muriate of soda and sul
   phureous hydrogen gas, the two principal ingredients that
   impregnate the mineral waters of Aix             Chapelle, Baden,

   springs in Europe.
      There are very few sulphurated springs, either hot or cold, id

    How far the Hindoos have succeeded in discovering the de(id&-
    ratum for preparing them artificially appears from the above
    analysis, and will ne confirmed       by comparing     asolution of
    the salt with the sulphurated waters at their sources.     All the
    European processes and machinery for imitating these waters
    have been directed to the impregnation of water with gas dis
    engaged from befar Julpburis, which produces an imitation
    of the sulphurated waters mentioned            Dr. Coggan in his
                                                    by
    Travels on the Rhine, but not of Moffat or Harrowgate:           it
    may perhaps be found that air disengaged from common salt
 is    different from that (A befar sulpburis, and in sulpbur springs

 Purham, Rippon, Shipton,              Keddlestone, Sutton Bog, &c.
 &c, have all common fait for their basis. This discovery
 of the Hindoos is upwards of two thousand years old, and
 far surpasses all the attempts of modern chemists to make
 artificial sulphurated waters * : they have perhaps discovered
the very process employed by nature in the formation of
 them.
     The Arabians and Persians, and even the Mussulmans in
 India, have generally considered fait of bitumen a natural
production ; and those who allow that it is made in the
 country insist upon two kinds, the one natural and the other
artificial, and that the latter is only an imitation of the na
 tural.     The Mahummedans have such a contemptible opi
nion of the Hindoos, that they are much more disposed to
believe it dug out of the earth, or formed from the water of
the Mare Mortuum, than that it is a produdtion of Hindoo
chemistry.         Some of the chemists to whom I showed it in
this country were also inclined to consider it as a natural pro
duction.       That it is an artificial preparation I am perfectly
convinced, from the information or the natives, from having
seen a mass of the salt in the form of the earthen vessel in
which it had been made, and from having succeeded, in a
great measure, in making it : finally, Mr. Robertson, the
gentleman who collected and sent it from India, writes, that
the salt is manufactured in the neighbourhood of the city of
Agra, where it may be had in any quantity.                     Although     I
was at considerable expense with the native chemists and al
chemists, yet I must confess that I never prepared any fait
equal to what was to be got in the bazar or market-place.
I  shall therefore not describe the different processes performed
by my operators.          I shall only remark one part, in which
they    all  agreed,    and  that was, the igneous fusion of com
mon salt with a very celebrated Hindoo medicine called
turp'bulla t, or the three fruits, a name given by way of
   * Even in the gaseom pan, the present artificial sulphurated waters are
said to be different. In the report made to the National Institute of France
bv citizens Fourcroy, Chaptal, ic. respecting the artificial mineral water*
of Messrs. Paul and Co., they observe, 9thty, finally, " the sulphurated
appeared to the committee not sufficiently impregnated with sulphurated
hydrogen    gas."
    +  lurp'bulla is the atriful of the Arabians and Persians, and the true
and genuine origin of those celebrated compositions, long retained in the
pharmicopeias of Europe under the title of nypbfra ; a word which seems
to have exhausted the ingenuity of our lexicographers, who, I find, are
fast expelling    it from their lexicons and dictionaries.  It never had any
connection with the Greek word rfu^i, nor the tijpbira of Scriboniui
Lirgus.

 I know no medicine the consumption of which comes near it.

the natives in charge of horses, elephants, camels, and other

   tion of a new and economical Method of conjlrutling Cupetls
   or Refining Vessels : read in the Trench Rational Institute.
   By C. Duhamel, Member of the Injlitute and InfpeSor
   of Mines *.
AT    is well known, that to separate silver from lead, a metal
lurgy    process called refining or cupcllation, performed in a
vessel called a cupell, has been employed : it is known also
that this vessel is composed either of the aflies of the bones
of animals, or of those of vegetables, after they have been
lixiviated, lo free them from the saline matters which they
may contain.
   The   great quantity of wood-ashes which must be employed
in the  construction      of cupells, and the difficulty of obtaining
them, lone ago         induced   me to endeavour to discover a sim
pler  and  less  expensive    method    of constructing the vessels in
question.     The     old   chemists   having observed that lead be
comes oxidated, or reduced into what is called litharge, when
exposed to heat, or the contact of the atmospheric air, while
the silver united to \t retains its metallic^ form, nothing seemed
necessary but to find the means of separating these two me
tals. They were conducted to the method of accomplishing
this by observing that the oxide of lead, in its state of liquefac
tion, easily penetrates the substances which are in contact with
it, and especially bone-aslies, without deforming the vessels
which are formed of them. No matter, indeed,                       more
                                                                   is
proper than the latter for constructing small refining cupells.

proprietors     have   r.'course  to   wood-allies;  but, besides that
these aslics arc expensive,    it  often happens that they cannot
be procured in sufficient quantity.            hey are even attended

takes place every time that the aflies are badlv prepared, that
the cupell   is   insufficiently or not uniformly beat, or when
the canals destined for the evaporation of the moisture are
neither in sufficient number, nor properly arranged, nor co

    To ascertain the proportion of lead in silver, it is sufficient
to put some pennyweights into a small cupell of bone-ashes
placed under the muffle of an assaying furnace.        In propor
tion as the lead becomes oxidated, it insinuates itself into the
cupell, and the silver at last assumes that vivid appearance
which announces that the whole lead is dissipated, that the
silver it contained is refined, and has attained to its maximum
of purity.
    In refining on a large scale, the object also is to separate
the silver from the lead, but not to make the whole of the
latter penetrate into the cupell, which is even impossible ;
for in that case it would be necessary to have a much larger
            of ashes for the total absorption of the metal : be
Suantity
  des, the operation would require a period ten times as long
as that used in general for refining, and would occasion ten
times the expense in fuel, and a much greater loss of the
metals than by the usual process, where the greater part
of the lead is obtained in litharge, while a portion pene
trates into the cupell for about two inches of its thickness,
which must be fused to revive the lead.         This reduction is
also more expensive, and experiences a greater loss than the
litharge, which is easily fused, and which, without passing
through the furnace, may be employed as an article in com
merce.
    Lead ore and litharge may be fused as in England, and
the department of the ci-devant Brittany, in a reverberating
furnace the soles or basons of which are formed of pounded
and moistened clay.        These soles can stand the action of
heat and of the oxide of lead for six or eight months of un
interrupted labour.
   The durability of these earthen soles gave me the first idea
of the method, which I shall hereafter propose, for retining-
furnaces, where the only thing required is to oxidate the
lead to obtain it in litharge, and not to cause the cupells to
imbibe the whole of    it,   is
                            as   done when the object     to assay

scoriae of which always carry with them some of the metal.
     In a cupell of ashes beat into an oval circle of iron, the
greater diameter of which is only five or six feel and the
less one yard, the English refine from a ton to 23 cwt. of
lead, which is converted into beautiful litharge, except the
small portion which penetrates into the cupell, the thickness
of which is only about 2\ inches, and which is supported
tinder the arch of the furnace by two bars of iron.        A pair
of leather bellows drive the litharge towards the anterior part
of the furnace, from which it falls, without interruption, on
the floor of the foundry, while, to sill up the vacuity left by
the oxide running off, an ingot of lead placed close to the
base of the bellows is made to advance gradually into the in
terior part of the furnace. This lead, by fusing, keeps the
cupell full till towards the end of the operation.
     If I have here given a short view of the process of the
English, it is only to show that it is possible to perform ope
rations of refining by employing only a small quantity of
ashes for the construction of cupells.       Those in question do
not absorb 90 pounds of oxide in the large quantity of lead
which is refined.
     It is then proved that metallurgists have alwavs endea
voured to obtain the greatest quantity possible of litharge,
and little ashes impregnated with oxide; but as they thought
that they ought not to deviate from the docimastic process,
they have always constructed their cupells of ashes.
     It has been seen that in cupellation on a fmaH scale, lead,
in proportion to its oxidation, penetrates the ashes. W hen no
more is left, the small button of silver remains pure at the
bottom of the bason under a spherical form. This operation
takes place with the more celerity, as the surface of the mass
is always convex in these small vessels; which allows the oxide
to flow as on an inclined plane, towards the edges of the
cupell, where it is immediately imbibed.
     The case is not the fame with cupells on a large scale,
which are several yards in diameter: bellows must be ap
plied, the wind of which serves not only for accelerating the
oxidation, but also for driving the litharge towards the gutter
formed
   '
           for its escape.
      We have remarked the inconveniences and even the im
possibility of making the whole lead penetrate into the ashes
of large cupells : oxidation, indeed, is not effected but in the
parts of the mass exposed to the contact of the air or to the
wind of the bellows ; but as litharge, towards the middle of
the bason, could not reach its edges, it would remain there
                                                                in

In a state of stagnation, and would necessarily oppose the
formation of a new stratum of oxide. This has induced me
tallurgists to expel the litharge by the wind of a pair of bel
lows in proportion as it is formed, and to make it flow from
the furnace.
   Oxidation then takes place only at the surface of the mass,
and not at ils lower part: if the cafe were otherwise, the
ashes of cupells would be penetrated by the oxide to a thick
ness the more unequal, as the operation is lonsrer; but I have
always remarked, that the iejl, or the part ot the ashes im
pregnated     with litharge, in refining on a large scale, is not
thicker in the centre of the bason than towards its circum
ference, though the lead remains thirty or forty times as long
in the bottom as on the edges; since the mass continually
decreases till the whole lead is reduced to litharge, and till
nothing remains but a cake of silver at the bottom of the
cupell.
   If the whole lead is imbibed by the assaying cupell, it is
because this small vessel is exposed to a heat uniform in all
its parts.    As the cupell, in operations on a large scale, pre
sents to the action of the caloric only its upper surface, the
oxide imbibed ceases to penetrate it at the place where the
temperature     is no longer high enough to keep that oxide in
a state of fusion.    For this reason, the thickness impregnated
is equal throughout the whole extent of the cupell ; and this
prevents the possibility of making the whole lead penetrate
into the ashes.
   From the above observations it may easily be conceived,
that if the assaying of lead ought to be performed in small
cupells of bone-asties, in order that the oxidated metal may
penetrate them, and be in part evaporated, tiie cafe is dif
ferent with refining on a large scale, where it is necessary to
accelerate the operation, and to obtain as much litharge as
possible.
    I have already said, that the wood-ashes of which cupells
are made for refining on a large scale are expensive;         that
very often a sufficient quantity cannot be procured ; and that
besides this, part of the ashes, and sometimes the whole, se
parate themselves entirely from the sole ; which occasion a
considerable loss.     I shall add, that to give more weight and
consistence to the cupells, it is often necessary to mix with
the asties a larce quantity of sand ; especially if the lead con
tains foreign substances, such as arsenic, cobalt, antimony,
tin, &c.     If the lead be only arsenical, after having separated
the first scum, a quarter of a hundred weight of iron filings or
cast iron turnings are now and then thrown over the whole

Over it and absorbs the arsenic, after which the mass must
be scummed : soon after, the litharge is formed without any
obstacle.   This method is employed in Saxony.
   The necessity .of adding sand to the ashes of cupells must
have conducted to the discovery of the following means, which
I shall here propose.
        New Method of conflruBing Basons jor Refining.
     Without making any change in the mason-work of                            the
refining furnace, called the German, care only must be taken
to form at the bottom a sufficient number of canals for the
evaporation of the moisture, and to arrange them in the
manner best calculated to produce that effect.      These canals
or spiracles must be covered with a bed of scoria?, over which
a pavement is to be made of one layer of the most porous
bricks.
    On this area, which must be concave like the sole on which
the ashes of common cupells are beat, place founders' sand
a little moistened ; to which may be added a fifteenth part
of argil, if it is not sufficiently earthy, in order to give it the
requisite solidity ; and the whole must be carefully mixed.
 This sand must be rammed in the fame manner as for con
 solidating aflies ; and a refining bason is to be formed in like
 manner, uniformly beat in all its parts.        The thickness of
 this cupell must be six or seven inches : it may be formed of
 two strata, as will be seen hereafter.
    After the bason has been uniformly beat in every part,
 about a gallon of lixiviated wood-ashes may be sifted over its
 whole surface, and rendered adherent with beaters.
    When the cupell is thus prepared, let down the head on
 the furnace and make a moderate sire in the fire-hole; which
 must be maintained for several hours, in order to cause a part
 of the water, with which the sand has been moistened, to
    evaporate.     The surplus will be dissipated during the opera
    tion, without any inconvenience, bv canals of evaporation.
       After a sufficient desiccation, raise the head and suffer the
    cupell to cool a little; spread out straw or hay over
                                                                      it it,

sire in the fire-hole as for the common operations of refining.
    When the lead is in complete fusion, and the mass is
covered with scum and charred straw, make the scum or
dross run oft" hy the gutter for the litharge with a bit of
board about a foot in length, in the middle of which is fast
ened a rod of iron of sufficient length to traverse the furnace
and about a yard more.
    When the lead has been well scummed several times, and
begins to be red, make the bellows act, but at first gently;
arrange the nozzles of them in such a manner, that the wind
ifluing from both may be directed to the centre of the cu
pel!; and in order that the wind may be always reverberated
on the mass, adapt to the extremity of each nozzle a small
round piece of iron plate.      This kind of valves, which the
French refiners call papillous, is employed         for refining
according to the German method. They are suspended by
hinges at their upper part: at each stroke of the bellows they
are naif raised, and they reverberate the wind on the lead,
which accelerates its oxidation.
    After all the dross or scum is removed, and when the lead
has become exceedingly red, and covered with a stratum of
litharge, form, with a small iron hook destined for that pur
pose, a small gutter in the sand of the cupell, which mult be
dug deeper, gradually and with caution, until the bottom of
it be on a level with the mass. The litharge then, driven by
the wind of the bellows towards the anterior part of the fur
nace, will run by this gutter and fall on the floor of the foun
dry, as is the cafe in the common operations of relining.
     When the refiner observes that no more litharge remains
in the neighbourhood of the gutter, he will stop the flowing
oft" with a small quantity of moistened ashes: but as soon as
the lead again becomes covered with oxide, the gutter must
be opened, and mult be dug in proportion to the diminution
of the mass, taking care that no lead escapes, and particu
larly towards the end of the operation ; for it would carry
with it a great deal of silver, which would be lost. You must
proceed in this manner till the silver has acquired its vivid
colour; taking care to increase the sire in proportion to the
diminution ot the mass; especially when the operation is
nearly terminated, because the silver then is collected toge
ther : and, as it is much more difficult to be kept in tun >n
than the small quantity of lead which remains united wuh       it,
it  could be refined only in an imperfect manner at an insuf
 ficient temperature; and instead of about  a  twentieth of lead,
 which the    silver generally containsin the German refining-

houses,     it would remain charged with a great deal more,
which would render it more difficult to proceed to a second
operation, called the refining of jih'er, by which it is carried
to the required degree of purity.      The Germans call this se
cond process jilber brennen, burning silver.
      Those accustomed to the refining of lead according to the
German method, will be able to perform that which I here
propose ; for, though the cupell be of sand instead of ashes,
the operation must be conducted in the fame manner.
      It has been seen that the English refine a large quantity of
 lead in a small cupell : in the like manner, a great deal of
 metal may be made to pass by that which I propose, if care
 be taken to add more metal as that which is oxidated escapes.
 If   we suppose that the cupell is capable of containing four or
  five tons of lead, above sixteen may be refined at one opera
  tion ; which will not be attended with the inconveniences of
  the English process.
       I have reason to think that a cupell of sand well con
 structed may serve for several operations without the necessity
 of re-constructing it each time, as is the cafe with those of
  ashes; but in this cafe, and before the lead is introduced,
 vou mutt fill up the gutter which has been made for the
  litharge to run off, after having removed with a chisel the
  kind of varnish which the oxide of lead has left on the fides
  of   it, in order that the new sand, somewhat moistened, may
  form an intimate connection with the old sand, which must
  also be watered in that part before the new sand   is  deposited.
       The long duration of earthen soles in reverberating fur
  naces, where lead ore and even litharge are fused, as     1   have
  already mentioned, leaves no room for apprehension in regard
   to the action of the oxide of lead, which will act only at the
  surface of the cupell, and will penetrate only     a   very small
  part of its thickness.
       After one or more operations of refining, this crust must
   be removed, and fused in   a    furnace in contact with fuel, in
   order to obtain the lead.     This process will be as easy as the
   reduction of that metal contained in the ashes of common
   cupells, and in
                 a     much smaller quantity. More litharge then
   will be obtained  by   the new method than the old  ;   which is
   an advantage, as have already observed.
                  I                           I shall here add, that
   as the sole of sand does not absorb so much oxide of lead as
   that of ashes,
                it    will not carry withit   somuch silver; for it
 is     well known that lead revived from its ashes always con
   tains more than that which arises from the reduction of
   litharge.
       Instead of sand, argillaceous earth might be employed for
                                                            'the

the construction of cupells, as is the cafe in regard to the
soles of the reverberating furnaces in the ci-devant Brittany;
but it would be necessary to ram this earth repeatedly for se
veral days ; otherwise it would split, and these cracks would
increase by the shrinking which must result from the heat,
and lead would insinuate itself into these fissures : an incon
venience which cannot take place with sand even a little
earthy.      I shall observe also, that a sole of earth would har
den too much to allow a gutter to be dug for the passage of
the litharge : in this cafe it would be necessary that the place
destined tor the oxide to run off should be constructed with
sand or lixiviated ashes.
     I shall add also, that it will be advantageous to employ two
kinds of sand in the formation of theljason of the cupell ;
one kind fine like that used by founders, and the other coarser
 and not earthy : the latter will form the first stratum, which,
 after being beat with rammers destined for that purpose, ought
 to be about three inches and a half in thickness. The fine
 sand, a little earthy, must then be applied over this first stratum
 to form a second, which is to be rammed like the former. Both
 these kinds of sand must be somewhat moistened before they
 are introduced into the furnace, in order that they may be
 better heaped up, and be consolidated by the rammers.
     The sand of the lower stratum, being coarser than that of
 the upper, will absorb the moisture of the latter in proportion
 as it evaporates ; and it will pass without any obstacle through
 the canals disposed for that purpose.
     The lower stratum of sand may remain in its place when
  a new cupell is to be constructed with fine sand, and the part
  of the latter, which has not been impregnated with oxide,
  must be mixed with new sand to form a cupell.           Care must
  be taken in raising this sand not to touch the lower stratum ;
  for the sand of the latter, which is coarse, must not be mixed
  with the other. This inconvenience may be avoided by
  beating over the bed of coarse sand a thin stratum of asties,
  at which you must stop in removing the fine sand of the upper
  stratum.
      It has been said that the founders' sand must be some
  what earthv, and that, if it is not, a little argil must be added
  to give it cohesion : but, as it is necessary that this argil
  should he uniformly diffused through all the partsof the sand,
  it must be diluted in the water with which the sand is moist
  ened, and the whole must be carefully mixed.
      It may be objected, that as cupells of sand do not absorb
  so much litharge as those of ashes, more time will be required
  to terminate the operation of refining ; sineej in the new pro
                                                                 cess,

 cess, the oxide, instead of being absorbed, ought to flow from
the furnace. This circumstance needs excite no uneasiness ;
for the wind of the bellows, if well directed, will make the
litharge flow along the gutter more abundantly than if there
had been an absorption.
    I have seen refiners in Germany, who, in constructing their
cupells of asties, formed in the middle of it a small circular
depression the diameter of which was proportioned to the
quantity of the silver which they knew to be contained in
the lead subjected to the operation.       By this excellent dif-
           no grains of that valuable metal remain insulated
  rom the cake ; the whole runs into the central bason, and
Jiosition
forms a cake perfectly round.        I would recommend this
practice.
    I am certain that the cupells here proposed, if carefully
and properly constructed, will be attended with complete
success; will be free from the inconveniences of those of
ashes, and at the fame time will be economical.        I am de
sirous, for the benefit of metallurgy, that the method here
pointed out may be put in practice : it will prove that we
ought not to be too tenacious in adhering servilely to antient
usages or to the common routine of workmen.
 XXXIII.        On Painting.           By     Mr. E. Dates, Painter*.
I   TrtiNK it right again to repeat, that I have not observed
any order in the production of these Essays.      They were
written as the subjects arose in my mind, and the pre
sent paper should be considered rather as an introductory
address than otherwise.   My motive in writing the present
essay was to endeavour to remove the prejudice of those who
consider the arts as a useless study, and their produce as
things merely ornamental.     But who, in a state of civil so
ciety, would be content with the useful or necessary ? Who
is he whose soul seeks not after perfection ?
                The  motions of his spirit are dull             as   night,.
                And his affections dark as Erebus               :
                Let no such man be trusted.
    The subject of          the following essay had long engaged my
attention   ;   but   I   had dropped the idea of writing on      in                it,

               On ibe Power and Usefulness              of Drawing.
     I  am persuaded that to be a virtuoso (so far as befits a gentleman) is a
higher step towards becoming a man of virtue and good fense, than the
being what in this ;ige we call a Icholar.                        Lord Shaftefbmy.
      IN this essay we have two objects in view : to show the
connection of drawing with painting; and to exhibit, in as
clear a manner as we possibly can, its usefulness and influence
on society.
      But before we proceed it may be necessary to observe, that
 those who would question the utility of the arts, would be
 equally disposed to question the utility of these essays that treat
 about them. Of their usefulness we hope to be able to offer
 numberless proofs ; but they rife superior to the merely use
 ful.      For that which is necessary is neither ornamented nor
  elegant, because necessity implies poverty, while ornament
 implies abundance.            Hence architecture, as an art, does not
  apply to mere house-building.
       In defence of these essays, they are serviceable by exhibit
  ing the usefulness of truth ; and so far they become an object
  to all those who wisli to be acquainted with the subject han
  dled, and to obtain a knowledge therein.                    But to those who
  never think or inquire, or concern themselves with matters
  of speculation, or who take up with speculations without ex
  amining them, or read only to confirm themselves in such as
  they have received, not any thing can become an object of
   concern, or any book be useful.
       That man was not intended by nature for purposes base
  and ignoble, none will deny ; and, if arguments were wanted,
  they might be drawn from that eternal inquiry after what
  ever is grand, dignified, or exalted ; and, finally, after a state
  superior to our present terrestrial one. For it is not too much
       • We cannot help thinking that Mr. Djyes has
                                                              judged well in taking
   up this part of the subject    It is of great iirt| orunce, and he has rendered
   an essential service not only to the art itself, but to its liberal professors, by
   removing, as his arguments effectmlly do, ill-grounded prejudices against
  its indispensable utility in civilized society ; prejudices which c.iuld only
   eriginate in, and be fostered by, ignorance and stupidity.     — Editor.
                                                                                   to

 to assert, that we approach the Divinity in nothing so much
 as in wisdom.     Hence, as the arts are connected with wis
 dom, as men become careless of their culture, they become
 equally incapable of fulfilling the duties of social beings. For
 knowledge is what humanizes mankind ; reason inclines
 them to mildness, but ignorance generates prejudice, which
eradicates every tender reeling.
    By drawing is meant the exact imitation of all the forms
 and* manners which present themselves to our fight; and in
knowing how to give every thing its proper and correspond
ing character agreeably to the subject consists the excellence
of what the artist terms a good draftsman.
    Drawing, as far as it is connected with mere imitation, is
a mechanical operation, and may be acquired by a person of
very moderate talents. So may a knowledge of bodies, pro
perties, facts, events, and fables, by reading. But the powers
of invention, the vis poetica, which distinguishes the bard
from the mere versifier or journalist, the genius from the
mere imitator and copyist, must be a gift from heaven be
stowed at the formation of the being.         Neither this poetic
energy   nor the  inventive  powers  of the artist can be taught
in schools or academies ; but they both may be buried in rust
and inaction, if proper objects are not presented to call them
into motion. So the inventive powers of genius will be fu
tile if unaccompanied by a (kill in drawing.       Without this,
the learning of the painter or sculptor cannot be shown to
advantage: it is the Jine qua non by which all the other ac
complishments are displayed.
    From what has been already stated, the dependence of
painting on drawing must be obvious.
    Genius has been compared to fire from flint, which can
only be produced by collision : if so, success must follow where
nature directs and perseverance attends.         Activity is a ne
cessary ingredient   to enable us to obtain a  knowledge in art;
and should we find others out-step us, let us redouble our
diligence, and comfort ourselves with the recollection, that
a late spring produces the greatest plenty.
   No one can possibly judge of his powers from mere specu
lation ; the test must be applied before the value of the gold
can be known.       Nor will inactivity ever discover how far
our fortitude will enable us to overcome difficulties, our pa
tience to bear disappointment, or our industry enable us
to range the wide field of art. For, were the arts of easy at
tainment, they would be unworthy the notice of a great
mind. This should induce us to increase our exertions in
proportion to our disappointments, remembering that to strive
                                                             with

with difficulties is noble, but to conquer is one of the highest
points of human felicity.             It is in painting as in writing:
 where difficulties oocur, they arise from not clearly under
 standing the subject.         Hence, to be able to represent an ob
ject jultly we must understand its fabrication; for it would
 oe in vain to think of drawing the arch of a bridge correctly
 without knowing how it was keyed or put together, or even
 a basket if we did not know how it was wove.
     We shall now proceed to consider the power of drawing
 in a point of view merely useful.
      How limited must their ideas be who consider it as             "   the
 foundation of painting" only ! We know it is such : for with
 out drawing it would be in vain to think of producing an
 effect; as mere colour without form must remain a crude
  and undistinguishable mass.
      Drawing is not only an accomplishment the most elegant,
  agreeable, and ornamental, but, at the same time that it is
  the foundation of painting, is of the utmost utility to the
  sculptor, the civil and naval architect, the engraver, the
  engineer, the mathematician, and navigator.                  It also assists
  the gardener, the cabinet-maker, the weaver, Sec.                 In short,
  there is scarcely a branch of civil society that is not indebted
  to it,   from the maker of the iron rails before our house to
  the tea-urn on our table. To          it     we are indebted for repre
  sentations      of  those  elegant    remains     of antiquity that have
  contributed     so   much   to  the advancement       of our knowledge of
  fine form.       Volumes     of  verbal  description will never convey
  so   true  an  idea  of  a thing   as  the  most slight sketch.      Hence
   the source of much of our knbwledge in antiquity, of which
   language could convey no adequate idea.
       To be able on the spot to make        a   sketch ofa    fine building,
   beautiful prospect, or any curious production of nature or of
   art,is    not only  a  very desirable and elegant accomplishment,
   but in the highest degree entertaining. To treasure up what
   ever may occur in our travels, either for future use or to illus
   trate conversation, to represent the deeds of the great of for
   mer ages, to preserve the features of our most valued friends,
   has made this art not only one of the highest embellishments
    of our nature, but the delight of all ages. The greatest wri
    ters have united to praise, and empires to encourage it.                It
    has been in the highest degree morally useful        ;      and, where      it
    has flourished, conferred honour on the country.                  In fact,
    society   could  not  sustain
                                a     more   severe  loss  than  in being de
    prived   of
             it;      as many    comforts,    and   all those elegancies that
    adorn the present state of our being, must depart with it.

    What has been the fate of those people whose lawgivers
forbid the practice of one part of the elegant arts ? It appears
they well knew, that where art resides, wisdom will ever be
of the party ; and dreaded the downfall of opinions built on
a false base.
    Wisdom is power, and power is what preserves a nation :
hence those who shut the door against knowledge are wilfully
seeking their own destruction : such is precisely the present
state of the Turkish empire.

    What was the fate of Crete, that was so renowned for her
wisdom, valour, and laws? How did she fink under the
tyranny and oppression of Rome ? With their freedom de
parted their arts, their sciences, their valour, and their vir
tues.    With the loss of liberty we lose all the ardour nature
has furnished us with to strengthen and support the flame of
genius and the ardent glow of valour : without it we become
destitute of vigorous resolution, and fink below the natural
virtue and dignity of our species.
    Drawing may be said to possess a divine virtue in its crea
tive power, and to be a perpetual miracle, as it preserves the
images of distant objects, and the likeness of those we love.
    Without risking our lives on the boisterous ocean, we may-
enjoy at home, in a small book, representations of the finest
productions of nature and art situated in the remotest regions
of the world.
    The wealth of a state, and the degree of civilization of its
inhabitants, are shown in the perfection of the elegant arts :
no country ever flourished without them.
    To speak of the power of drawing in a very limited point
 of view: without it we could not have maps and charts;
without them we could not navigate ; and without navigation
we could not possess the advantages of commerce.         Its appli
 cation to ship-building must be obvious, as every part is
 made to a scale.     As a mere power of imitation, it unques
 tionably sets man at the head of creation, no other animal
 having made even the attempt.
    The arts have not only an influence on our manners but
 passions, and, taken in a national point of'vicw, are highly
 useful. The pictures representing gallant actions or noble
 achievements rouse and stimulate to acts of heroism and

public spirit while those of a more elegant turn exhibit ex
                ;
amples of graceful address, and incline the mind to ads of
beneficence and virtue.
    However much we may lament that historical painting it
not sufficiently encouraged, yet we must distent from those
who support the old but erroneous opinion, that our love of
portrait-painting arises from a national vanity.         This ridi
culous idea has "been bandied about, both by foreigner and
native, till many who take up with opinions without exa
mining them have believed it true. We boldly assert, on
the contrary, that it is national virtue that gives it birth, and
a desire the most rational, that of preserving the images »f
those we love and delight in, constantly before our eyes.          It
argues great national beneficence and goodness of heart. We
may in some measure judge of the disposition of the master
of a house from the number of portraits he possesses : they
cannot be likenesses of his enemies.          Hence his choice must
be founded on love, and not, as the antients' was, on pride
and vanity.       The portrait-painter therefore becomes morally
useful by increasing that social tie that binds society together,
in keeping before our eyes the images of departed worth or
existing merit.       It is only those who neither love ner are
beloved, that have no need of the portrait-painter.
    Among the number of our own national advantages, and
which some may think superior to all others, we may observe
that the excellence of our artists has turned the balance of
trade in our favour. For whereas we forrrrerly imported vast
quantities of prints, we now supply all Europe, and import
very few. Even for the decoration of our books we were
formerly obliged to apply to strangers : but Heath has added
a taste to that department of art unknown lo former engravers
 in the historical line. Among the topographical publications,
those prints that accompany the " Beauties of England and
 Wales" must be highly interesting for talte and beauty.
     In the beginning of the last century, the writers on the
continent amused themselves in endeavouring to assign a
 cause for the dulness of us islanders in not having produced
 one historical painter. Our northern latitude, being involved
 in fogs, was among the reasons assigned : but the cause of
 such absurd inquiries has ceased, and the mental capacity of
 Britons no one will now dare to question.
     The consequence of our nation and the arts appear to have
 advanced together.        The first is evinced in our colonial pos
 sessions; and if we go back to the time of Henry VIII., we
 shall easily discover the stale of commerce and the comfort
 less situation   of society compared with the present.      Hollin
                                                                stiH

   shed observes that chimneys were a novelty, as were pewter
   ornaments for the table. Straw formed the bed, and a good
   hard block of wood the pillow.          Then was the dawn of the
   arts.    Since which time they have been advancing, and are
  now, thank God ! matured into a glorious mid-day, under
  the auspices of his present majesty.
      It is impossible to speak of the arts without expressing our
  gratitude towards their great patron ; and were his name to
  flourish in no other way, that of George III. will be sacred
  to posterity with those of Leo, Julius, and all such as have a
  claim on eternity, as their protectors. His majesty has done
  for the arts what no monarch of this nation ever did before ;
  he has given, by his patronage, a turn to the national tast*
  highly beneficial to the profession, which the public are bound
  to support by a liberal and fair encouragement. With respect
  to the mere act of buying, we are bound to consider his ma
 jesty in the light of a private gentleman, who regulates his
  expenditure according to his income : and we ought to thank
  God it is so.
     Holbein had not taste enough to change the grotesque fa
  shions of the court of Henry VIII. He brought about a re
  volution in architecture; but he introduced a mungrel style,
 inferior to the Gothic of that period.             Zuccaro was in
 England       in  the  time   of Elizabeth;   and  during that long
 reign    we   find  Httle  improvement    in architecture, dress, or
 in the general circle of elegancies.          It was a court of in
 trigue and vanity.        In the reign of James I. Van Somer and
 Cornelius Janson paved the way for Van Dyck — an'epoch
 of taste : but this appears to have been confined to the court
 and a few noble collectors; and the troubles of Charles his
 successor prevented his giving them a more general influence.
 His reign stands high in the nistory of architecture, from hav
 ing produced Inigo Jones. Under Lely taste funk into Indian
 gowns and flowing perukes ; till fashion became a monster in
 the time of Kneller, and appeared in buckram coats, square-
toed shoes, and disproportioned head-dresses in the ladies.
This style of dress prevailed till within these few years, when
good fense and a more just taste broke through the buckram
and whalebone, and produced            the present easy and elegant
mode of attire ; which mav be said to mark a point of
national excellence.          Reynolds contributed much to this
change ; his whole life was a struggle with the hydra fashion,
as his works evince.
    The above statement will be found not to apply only to
the article of dress, but to extend to every department.         Let
us, for instance, from the period of Henry VIII. examiue
                                                               ship-

     Before we dismiss the present essay we shall endeavour to
 point out some of the advantages that result from the prac
 tice of drawing, to those who. do not make a profession of it.
 Many must be obvious from the former part of this paper.
 To every gentleman who travels, it is absolutely necessary ;
 for, independently of its teaching him to fee accurately, the
 curious and ever-restless eye of the artist comprehends more
 at one view than the common observer will notice in an age,
The volume of nature is laid open to him ; his attention is
directed to the vast and minute ; men and manners are not
 concealed from his view, and his imagination clings to per-
 fectien with ineffable delight.
    It is not too much to fay, that drawing opens the mind
more than years devoted to the acquiring oflanguages, or the
mere learning of words : it teaches to think.            The artist
is a true logician : not content with producing effects, he is
ever inquiring after causes founded on a visible demonstration,
to exhibit them in his works.
    We must not rank it among the least of the advantages
resulting from the practice of the arts, that it enures the re
flecting mind to the most enticing fort of logic. The prac
tice of reasoning upon objects in themselves agreeable tends
to produce such a habit, and habit strengthens the reasoning
faculties. Besides, while the mind is engaged in obtaining
knowledge, we escape the insipidity and Indifference con
nected with the tediousness of inactivity.       Hope attends la
bour; a blessing unknown to those who live lazily on the
toil of others.   The sensualist imagines he enjoys the world
because he eats and drinks, and runs about upon it; but to
enjoy it truly, is to be sensible of its greatness and beauty.
    Independently of keeping the mind employed, the arts
contribute to harmonize the temper; and the power of draw
ing brings with it so much mental enjoyment, that youth, in
order to "be occupied, is not tempted to precipitate into the
ruinous and destructive vices of gaming and drinking.            It
defends us in the meridian of life from the wild schemes of
ambition, and in old age it becomes a sure lhield against
avarice.    Shenftone observes, " Wherever there is a want of
taste, we generally observe a love of money and cunning."

32<S                        On Painting.
    The influence it has on our moral conduct is, perhaps,
one   of the greatest recommendations for the study of the arts.
No    one can meditate on the order observable in nature, and
not reduce his conduct to a similar standard of regularity.
To have a just relisti for what is elegant and proper in paint
ing, sculpture, or architecture, must be a sine preparation for
true notions relative to character and behaviour.          Should
such a one be overpowered         by passion, or swerve from his
duty, we need not fear but he will return on the first reflec
tion, and with a redoubled resolution not to err a second
time: for he cannot but observe, that the well-being of na
ture, as well as of the individual, depends on regularity and
order; and that a disregard of the social virtues will ever be
 accompanied with shame and remorse.           Passion is a whirl
wind, that fliakes the human frame, as the convulsions of an
 earthquake disorder that of nature.
    Every Briton that travels should propose to himself plea
 sure and advantage, and his inquiry should enable him to
 add to the national stock of knowledge ; for it cannot be said
 that he travels to enjoy the advantage of a better government,
 or because other nations have a greater commerce.         Hence,
 then, it must be for arts and learning. And how is he to become
 acquainted with the former without a knowledge in painting,
 sculpture, and architecture, any more than he could with the
 latter, without a knowledge in the languages of the coun
 tries he may have occasion to pass through?          Lord Bacon
 fays : " Travel, in the younger fort, is a part of education ;
 in the elder, a part of experience.     He that travelleth into a
 country before he hath some entrance into the language,
 coeth to school and not to travel."      The same may be said
 of those who travel before they have obtained a knowledge in
 the polite arts., How many noble works of architecture did
 lord Burlington bequeath to his country ! They remain mo
 numents ofnational taste, highly honourable to his memory.
 Let us be permitted to mention the honour the arts at pre
 sent derive from the masterly productions of the earl of Ayles-
 ford, sir G. Beaumont, fir R. Hoare, \V. Scope, esq. of
  Castle-comb; captain Lewis, of the royal navy ; capt. Mor-
 daunt, and many others, whose works will ever rank among
 the first productions of the pencil.    Lord Warwick is said to
  possess the true poetic spirit for composing heroic landscape.
  While we are recommending to gentlemen to learn to draw,
 it must not be understood that we wish to deprive the ladies
 of the pleasure and advantage that must result from their
 practising an art that stands, perhaps, before all others for
                                                        improving

  improving our taste, particularly in such things as are con
  nected with decoration.
    Though we recommend learning to draw thus generally,
 we must fay it requires the utmost caution in the choice of a
 master; for, should his abilities be confined, or his taste de
 praved, there is great danger of the poison being conveyed
 to the pupil : and         if,
                            in the end, his better understanding rife
 superior   to   the   evil, he will, unfortunately, have much to
 unlearn.      Above all,        he be arrived at an age to discrimi
                                  if
nate, objects worthy attention should be set as examples of
 imitation      he sliould not be amused and his time wasted with
                 ;
gew-gaws       and    trash beneath the dignity and attention of
rational beings.
    Every one          acquainted with the progress of what may
                      is
be termed common or school education.                The masters begin
teaching     the   letters,  and   then  proceed    to syllables, which
are joined into sentences            but the ultimate end
                                        :                       is,com
posing themes to call forth the power of invention, and
convey        more exquisite idea of the language.
               a                                                 Exactly
so should be the progress in teaching drawing.             If the know
ledge to be obtained be the human figure, we begin with
parts    as eyes, noses, heads, hands, 8tc, which
         ;                                                 is the ABC.
This, of course, leads to the whole figure, which may be
compared to spelling; that naturally conducts to the round,
or drawing from plaister casts; then from the life; and ulti
mately to composition. Should landscape be the pursuit, the
progress      precisely the same. We begin with parts or single
                 is
objects as trees, bridges, cottages, castles, &c.
             ;                                               Here again
is   the alphabet.        This we too quit to copy wholes, or            a
combination of objects; and in the end we apply to nature,
which sets us free from our master.           Then we must improve
by   our own activity; and, like the bee, cull the honey from
every flower.       As much of our success depends on the abili
ties of the master, the greatest care should be observed in the
choice.     He         but as
                      is         crutch to the lame; but we ought
                                   a
to make ourselves sure             found, and without flaw or (hake
                                  it   is                               ;
that     is,
          as far as our judgment will permit, or the opinion o
friends direct.
    He who aspires to          knowledge in the fine arts can only
                                  a
hope to succeed           turning his attention to the sensitive part
                           by
of nature, particularly            by
                                 an inquiry after such objects as are
naturally agreeable, or the contrary           also such as are grand
                                                :
or mean, proper or improper.            This       the only foundation
                                                      is
of   a just and rational taste, and, like morals, may be culti
vated to      high degree of refinement.

more advanced period, when the fervour of the imagination
goes off.      On the contrary, where we are governed by just
principles    and  a thorough knowledge, they will afford scope
for fancy as well as judgment, they will grow into a favourite
entertainment, and their vigour will prevail as strong in the
evening as in the morning of life. This only can make the
arts truly delightful.     It is not a few technical phrases, picked
up    from   professional men,    which ftiay enable one to babble
like a parrot, that ran at any time please or be pleasing.
Science is a coy lady, and will not grant her favours without
being long courted. But, should we aspire to no higher cha
 racter than that of the mere critic, a small stock of informa
 tion will suffice ; and practice will increase confidence where
 there is nothing to lose.       Criticism is a lady of easy access :
 the want of meaning she supplies with words j and the want
 of knowledge is recompensed with cunning. She flatters all j
 and those whom nature has made weak, or idleness keeps
ignorant, may feed their vanity at her shrine.
 XXXIV.        On the Differences which exist between the Heads
     of   the   Mammoth and Elephant.             By Rembrandt
     Peale, Esq.*
    1 HE       drawings which accompany this (fee Plate V.)
  are intended     to explain the differences between the head of
  the mammoth and that of the elephant. The teeth form the
  most striking character : those of the elephant are exclusively
  graminivorous, and consequently distinguished from those of
  the mammoth, which were intended for animal food of some
  kind, and not improbably shell-fish, on the supposition that
  the animal was amphibious f: and this may account for th,e
  peculiar form and position of the tusks.          On examining the
  head of the elephant, it will appear that the sockets for the
  tusks at A are situated, with respect to the condyle of the
  neck at B, nearly in an angle of 45 degrees ; so that the
  tusks, which have but little curve, are directed downwards
  and forwards, and may be with ease employed offensively
  and defensively.      On the other hand, it will be observed that
   in the mammoth the socket A is nearly on a horizontal line
   with the condyle B ; and therefore the tusks, which are semi
   circular, could never have been elevated in the air, pointing

the points thrown out by the spiral twist on each fide: — in
this portion, they might have answered in striking down small
animals, or in detaching stiell-fish from the bottoms of rivers,
or even in ascending the banks.
    In the elephant the orbit of the eye is situated at C,
whereas in the corresponding part at C in the mammoth is
a large mass of bone, so that the eye must have been else
where : to ascertain where, we must wait until we receive the
cranium lately discovered on the Ohio. The cheek of the
elephant is formed of two bones; but in the mammoth, besides
other variations, there is but one bone.        The whole figure
of the under-jaw differs most remarkably ; first in the length
of the condyles or arms from E to B : in the mammoth it if
ihort and angular ; but in the elephant DEB forms a semi
circular line, aud at D it is long and pointed.
    This short reference is sufficient to direct the attention of
those who wish to examine them more critically ; when they
may remark several other characters sufficiently interesting.
XXXV.       On the Hydrometer.     By William       Speer, Esq.
     Supervisor and Assay er of Spirits in the Port of Dublin.
                     [Concluded  from p. i6z.]
 I    SHALL now proceed to explain Mr. Gilpin's tables,
 in order to demonstrate their use, and the use of my addi
tional columns.     The first I cannot do better than in the
 words of Sir Charles Blagden himself:
     " Tables for reducing the quantities by weight, in any
mixture of pure spirit and water, to those by measure; and
 for determining the proportion, by measure, of each of the
 two substances in such mixtures, by Mr. George Gil pin,
 clerk to the Royal Society, communicated by Sir Charles
 Blagden :
     " These tables are founded on the experiments, of which
 the results were given in the Report and Supplementary Re
 port on the best Method of proportioning the Excise on Spi
 rituous Liquors. They are computed for every degree of heat,
 from 300 10 8o°, and for the addition or subtraction of every
 one part in a hundred of water or spirit ; but as the experi
 ments themselves were made only to every fifth degree of
 heat, and every five in the hundred of water or spirit, the
 intermediate places are silled up by interpolation in the usual
 manner, with allowance for second differences.
                                P3                       « Every

Z$o                   On    the Hydrometer.
  "    Ever}- table consists of eight columns, and there are two
tables for every degree of heat. In the first column of the^/jr/Z
of the two tables are given the proportions of spirit and water
by weight, 100 parts of spirit being taken as the constant
number, to which additions are made successively of one part
of water, from t to 99 inclusively : the first column in the
second table has 100 parts of water for the constant number,
with the parts of spirit decreasing successively by unity, from
100 to 1 inclusively.
   "    It must be observed, that each of these tables, occupy
ing   one   page, is divided in the middle tor adapting it more
conveniently to the size of the paper; but the whole of each
page is to be considered as one continued table.       The second
column of all I he tables gives the specific gravities of the cor
responding mixtures of spirit and water 111 the first column,
taken from the table of specific gravities in the Supplementary
Report, the intermediate spaces being silled up by interpola
tion.     In the third column, 100 parts by measure of pure
spirit,   at the temperature marked at the top of every separate
table, is assumed as the constant standard number, to which
the respective quantities of water by measure, at the same
temperature, are to be proportioned in the next column.
   "    The fourth column, therefore, contains the proportion
of water, by measure, to 100 measures of spirit, answering to
the proportions by weight in the fame horizontal line of the
first column.      The fifth column shows the number of parts
which the quantities of spirit and water, contained in the
third and fourth columns, would measure when the mixture
has been completed ; that       is,the bulk of the whole mixture
after the concentration or mutual penetration has fully taken
place. Tbe sixth column, deduced from the three preceding
ones, gives the effects of that concentration, or how much
smaller the volume of the whole mixture             than is,would
                                                               it
be if   there was no such principle as the mutual penetration.
The seventh column shows the quantity of pure spirit                by
measure, at the temperature            the table, contained in an
                                      in
hundred measures of the mixture laid down in the fifth co
lumn."
   From this account   it will be seen, that every mixture of

 for several reasons, to be the most convenient.         And as a
reference    to it becomes necessary, I have annexed           this,

                                           which the hydrometer

indications of strength are regularly deduced from the specific
gravity of the spirit at this temperature*.
   In order to explain the manner in which            have calcu            I

                                                       I
will be        by
             an example.

100 parts of the former to 81 of the latter (both         weight),                    by

                               is   4

42 parts.      find next, that this mixture contains per cent, of

   These being the proportions in the standard of proof, to
which every other gradation of strength         relative, the Rule is

the temperature of 55, its specific gravity    848       looking       is       ;     by
into the table    perceive that this contains per cent. 93- 18 of
                        I
pure spirit.    then try how much more than proof this
                    I                                                                           is    by
subtracting 61-57 (the quantity which proof contains), and
I find that this has redundance of pure spirit, amounting to

  Therefore,   as 100 gallons of pure spirit require 66 gallons
99  parts of water to reduce     to proof, the redundant 3i'6l

    These examples are,    I   hope, sufficient to explain this table.
The     uses to which it is applicable, are, that as it
                                                         affords jirjl
 an unequivocal Jfandard for every gradation of Jtrengtb, an
 hydrometer can be graduated on a certain principle ; and,
 secondly,     the errors of those that are graduated otherwise
 may    be  discovered   it,
                        by     and we shall no- longer be obliged
 to rely on   a    mere assertion, that the instrument    is  correct,
 nothing more being required than to compare the specific
 gravity of the spirit with the indication of strength which          it
 has demonstrated.
     On considering how far        might be practicable to simplify
                                   it
 the hydrometer,  I     perceived that the makers of these instru-
-ments had fallen into two errors, which had very considera
 bly increased the necessity for those complex additions with
 which they are incumbered.
     First, conceiving that the instrument was to be valued
 in proportion as   it    was capable of making minute discrimi
 nations, (or of its sensibility as
                                         it
                                         is  called,) they have,      by
 attempts to increase this beyond those limits required either
 in revenue or in commerce, destroyed its simplicity.
     In the construction of this instrument, the proportion of
 the stem to the ball     is    an important consideration:      ifthe
  former be too large, the instrument will not be sufficiently
 sensible; and should "it, on the contrary, be too small, the
number of gradations of strength         capable of indicating
                                             it   is
will proportionably be diminished.
   Those who have constructed most of the hydrometers now
in use, have run into the latter error; the stem being dimi
nished to  asize which rendered     necessary to have recourse
                                        it
to complex additions to supply the place of this injudicious
and unnecessary waste     of the simple and proper power of the
instrument.
   From   a threat variety of experiments to ascertain the proper
proportion between the ball and stem,         was finally satisfied
                                                   I
that the latter would admit of such enlargement as to be ren
dered capable of measuring upwards of 66 gradations or per
centages of strength, without any weight; and this
                                                            so
                                                           clearly
and distinctly, as to convince me that its sensibility and ac
curacy were still fully sufficient.
   The second error alluded to has arisen from an attempt
to extend the power of the instrument beyond those limits,
which, with propriety, and consistently with its simplicity,
could be effected.
   An hydrometer being counterpoise to ascertain the weight
                               a
of spirituous liquor, may, with propriety, be compared to
   a                                                                  a

pair of scales*, of which there are various fixes and descrip
tions, to aufwer different purposes, by which means their sim
plicity is uniformly preserved.
      On the contrary, it has erroneously been conceived, that
an hydrometer would be imperfect that did not, by one means
or another, ascertain the specific gravity of all liquids at their
various temperatures : the simple power of every instrument
of this kind being confined within certain limits, this could
not be effected without additional complications of various
kinds to those which were added, to increase its sensibility,
some of which are certainly ingenious, but, I conceive,
highly unfit for the purpose of revenue.
      Should this ingenuity be exercised on a pair of scales,
 which it would be proper to use in weighing a portion of
 eight or ten pounds, and by complex additions render them
 sufficiently sensible to ascertain a few grains or fraction of a
 grain, or so extended in their power as to weigh 100 pounds,
 is it not evident thaj the simplicity of the bafance, which is
 its g^reat recommendation, would be destroyed ?
      'lhat which led to the construction which I finally fixed
 on, was first a quadrangular Jlem, from which I had four
 temperatures, viz. 35, 45, 55, and 65 ; and the intermediate
 degrees I managed with four small weights on the top of the
 stem, each serving for two degrees oT temperature.                       The
 instrument having been graduated with these on, if the tem
 perature should be two degrees higher than the scale, I re
 moved one weight, in order to lighten the instrument equal
  to the decrease of specific gravity ; if four degrees, I removed
  two weights ; if fix degrees, I removed three weights ; and
  if eight degrees, I removed the fourth ; and two degrees more
  brought me to a new scale, or fide of the stem : by this means
  the instrument would accord with the variations arising from
  temperature, so far as at most to be but one degree different
  from it.      It was adjusted at every tenth degree of tempera
   ture.
       This was evidently a considerable progress towards the ob
  ject I was in pursuit of, as it not only remedied the great de
   fect of inattention to temperature which took place in the
   Irish hydrometer, but, in a great measure, the various defects
   of the English revenue hydrometer, as, notwithstanding the
   weights were reduced from 36 to 4, it accorded nearly with
       • The name of the instrument, which in strictness mould be areometer,
    (hydrometer being an instrument for weighing water), demonstrates this
   to be the principle on which it acts ; therefore in France it is called peje
   liqueur, and by some English writers, a watcr-poil'c.
                                                                           the

the   various temperatures,      and indicated 66 gradations of
 strength.   I   perceived, therefore, that the principle would
 answer,   but  that it could be improved still further; and after
 various efforts I at length fixed on that construction, of which
 I shall now beg leave to give a description.
    This new hydrometer is made of hard brass: the ball is
 shaped in the form of a pear, being nearly two inches in dia
 meter at its greatest dimension, and two inches and a quarter
in length : the lower stem measures one inch and a half, and
is in shape a prism, each fide measuring one-eighth of an
inch : to the lower end of this a round weight is fixed, the
diameter of which is seven-eighths of an inch.          The upper
 stem is in length five inches and a half, and is an octagon,
each side being somewhat less than an eighth of an inch
wide: each of these sides is graduated for a temperature en
graved on the top, the lowest being 35, the second 40, and
so increasing by five until it reaches 70.     The zero, or proof
point, is marked 0, and the gradations of strength (numbered
at every fourth) amount to sixty-six, and those so clearly di
stinct, that at the over-proofs they will admit of a sub-division,
and by that means indicate a half per cent. These divisions
are not at equal distances ; an error which takes place in the
present Irish and several of the old hydrometers, but widen
jn proportion as the specific gravity of the spirit diminishes ;
and, being graduated with spirits of known strengths at every
four per cent., the intermediate per centages are adjusted by
interpolation.
   To prevent any error which might arise from taking the
indication of strength from the wrong side of the stem, an
index is applied on the top of              it,
                                        with an opening to show
the figures which point out the temperature.           This index,
which applies merely to the purpose here mentioned, may be
removed lower to any part of the stem, but above the surface
of the liquor, without affecting the accuracy of the instru
ment, as neither its weight nor dimension               is
                                                    changed    and    ;
being of     different colour from the stem (sanguined steel)
              a                                                            it
forms   a contrast with           it,
                             and, as   were, points to the indi
                                            it
cation sought for,        which every danger of error in this re
                             by
spect   is   removed.
  Although this      the only use of the index, when the tem
                        is
perature shall be found one of those eight marked on the stem,
         neceflary that the instrument shall accord with the
   it
yetis
four intermediate degrees between each of the adjoining fides:
for this purpose one of two other indexes of different weights
are occasionally substituted for the first oucA        in   order to lighten
                                                                          the.

the instrument so as to accord with the decrease of gravity
which takes place in the spirit by the increase of tempera
ture. Therefore the manner of using the instrument is as
follows:
   Supposing the temperature to be 50, nothing further is re
quired but to place the index No. 1 (each being marked so
as easily to be distinguished) on the fide marked 50, and im
merse the instrument, which at once shows the strength.
Should the temperature be 51 or 52, instead of index No. 1,
use that marked No. 2 : should it be 53 or 54, use index
No. 3 : the instrument having been adjusted with these two
auxiliary indexes, in the one cafe at a temperature of 51 J,
and in the other 53 \, these four intermediate temperatures
are so accorded to, as to be either the actual one, or within
half a degree of it. And they apply in all cafes, tothc four
intermediate degrees of temperature, and no other appendage
required to enable the instrument, in this plain and simple
manner, to measure sixty-fix gradations of strength with an
accuracy which, it is presumed, is fully sufficient for either
revenue or commerce*.             No weight requiring different im
mersions to find out that which is the proper one; no tem
perature omitted to create doubts, or false indications of
strength ; no fraction in the per centage to operate either
against the revenue or the merchant; no gradation of strength
left unascertained or determined by conjecture ; no doubt re
maining as to the correct strength of all the various grada
tions; and no second inspection and subsequent combination
to be made, requiring the aid of, and liable to the errors of,
a sliding- rule.
    The following is a table for graduating hydrometers on a
certain and invariable principle, showing from the specific
gravity of the spirit at the temperature 55, what the hydro
meter indication of strength should be of every possible mix
ture of pure spirit (or alcohol) and water, from the former
down to proof spirit. — N. B. This table is calculated on
 the suppojition that the standard of proof is 922, tempera
 ture 55.
   * Even this half degree of temperature may be obtained by holding
the jar containing the spirit for a few moment* in the hand.

  XXXVI.          Memoir      on the        Supply and Application of the Blow-

   X HE blow-pipe                  is,
                              on many occasions, an useful instru
 ment to the artist and philosopher. By the former                   used,       it   is
 for the purpose of enamelling, to soften or solder small pieces
 of metal, and for the fabrication of glass instruments while                     :
 the latter can,       means of
                         by           in few minutes, subject small

 abled to judge of the advantage to be gained, and the method
 to be pursued, in operations on          larger scale. The celebrated
                                                      a
 Bergman      has  amply displayed      the   utility of this instrument
 in docimastic operations; and with the perfection of the do-
 cimastic art the improvement of metallurgy                    intimately  is
 connected.        It    ismeans of the blow-pipe that glass tubes
                              by
 are most conveniently exposed to the heat necessary to mould
 them into the many forms occasionally required for philoso
phical purposes; and            the various application of tubes thus
                                       by
moulded, ingenuity          often enabled to surmount the want of

 apparatus, which         the greatest obstacle to the attainment
                              is
of (kill in experimental philosophy.
    To all the purposes which             have mentioned the blow-

             is adequate,    when    properly    supplied with air, and
applied to        proper flame

                                                :         it
which have hitherto been employed to accomplish those ends
are all faulty.
    The most general method             that of supplying this instru
                                                    is
ment with the breath.          In addition to the well-known diffi
culty of keeping up        constant emission of air during respira
                               a
tion, and its injurious effect on the lungs                  may be ref;   it
marked, that as the breath            deprived of part of its pure air,
                                                is
    mixed with carbonic acid gas, and loaded with moisture,
it is  not the most fit for combustion and the obvious impos

             is
   Another way of supplying the blow-pipe with air,                  that             is
of affixing to     it small pair of double bellows.
                        a                                     A contriv

rials of which bellows are constructed, and the difficulty of

instrument.

making their valves air-tight, upwards of nine-tenths of the
air drawn into them escapes at other places than the proper
aperture.      A pair of bellows of this kind, belonging to au
artist of    this  city, which were considered as unusually air
tight, were found to discharge the complement of their upper
compartment in fix-fourths of a minute, when the orifice of
the pipe was open; and in seven-fourths of a minute when,
it was closed.       Hence it appears, that fix-sevenths of the air
injected    into  the upper compartment escaped at other places
than the proper aperture; and if to this loss were added that
sustained by the lower compartment, the waste would be
found much greater.         As in operating with these machines,
it is necessary constantly to move the foot, the operator can
not leave his feat ; and, in nice operations, the motion of his
body is an inconvenience, if not a source of failure. Bellows
of this kind cannot be used for supplying combustion with
oxygen gas; because, as this air is only to be obtained by a
chemical process, the smallest waste of it is of serious con
sequence; and as there is always a portion of air remaining
 in them, even when the boards are pressed as near to each
other as the folding of the leather will permit, any small quan
tity of oxygen gas which might be drawn into them would
 be thereby contaminated.
    It seems that the only instrument hitherto used for the
 supply of combustion with oxygen gas, is the gasometer of
 the celebrated Lavoisier : but this machine, although admi
 rably calculated for the purposes of that great philosopher, is
 too unwieldy and expensive for ordinary uses.
    Being sensible of the advantage which would result from
 the invention of a more perfect method of supplying the blow-
 pipe with pure or atmospheric air, I was induced to search
 for means of accomplissiing this object.          Having observed
 the cheapness, strength, and tightness, of coopers' vessels, I
 became desirous of forming an apparatus for my purpose, by
 means of hydrostatic pressure exerted within them.           I soon
 found that this could not be effected conveniently without
  the use of leather. Obliged to resort for assistance to this ma
  terial, I endeavoured to apply it in such manner, as to remedy
  the evils resulting from the use of it in the common kinds of
  bellows.     The causes of these evils appeared to be, the open
  ing of the pores and joints of these instruments by dryness,
  and the tension to which they are so frequently subjected.        I
  therefore determined to subject the leather which I should
  use, to moisture and compression.        In this I succeeded, and
  derived the expected advantage from i'ucces..        The result of
                                                                 my

    i-\o                 Memoir  on the  Supply and
    my attention to this subject is the production of a machine,
   of which    there follows an engraving and description.
       When it was first shown to the gentlemen of the Chemical
   Society, some of them bestowed on it the appellation of gaso
   meter; but, as etymology does not authorize this name, it
   has been changed for that of bydrojlatic blow-pipe.
       Fig. i. (fee plate VI.) is a perspective engraving of the hy
   drostatic blow-pipe.      Part of this figure is made transparent,
   that the internal construction of the machine may be under
   stood with the greater facility.
       It consists of a cask A, whose length is thirty-two, and
   whose least diameter is eighteen inches.          It is divided, by
  the partition B, into two apartments. The upper and external
  apartment B A, is in depth fourteen inches.          The lower and
  internal apartment BC, is in depth sixteen inches; and con
  tains a sheet and pipe of copper EE, D, which descend into
  it nine inches, forming two equal compartments of that
  depth. The sheet and pipe of copper are soldered together
  and inserted into the partition B, as may -be observed at
  fig. 2; where B represents the partition, EE the sheet of
  copper, and D the pipe. The edges EE of the sheet were
 slid down into corresponding joints in the staves of the cask
  until the partition attained its proper situation.          Coopers'
 flags were then passed into the joints ; and the hoops were
 driven on the cask.
      CF, fig. i. is a pair of circular bellows. The bottom of
 the cask serves as a bottom for these bellows.          In the centre
 of this bottom there is a hole, round which, at the distance
 of one inch from its centre, is a circular rim of wood. On
 this is nailed a valve opening upwards, which may be ob
 served at B, fig. 3, where there is a transparent engraving of
 the bellows.       Under the valve B may be observed the hole,
 and circular rim of wood, over which it is nailed.         C the top
 of the bellows, is a circular piece of wood, seven inches in
diameter and two in thickness.          In its centre there is a hole
one inch and a half in diameter.             Around this hole there
is a circular rabbet, in which is nailed a valve, opening up
wards.       This valve, and the rabbet in which it is fastened,
may be seen under the letter D, at the end of the rod. There
is also in this top, at the distance of one inch from its peri
meter, a circular dove-tailed furrow filk-d with lead, E. The
body of the bellows F F, is composed of strong hose-leather
so as to be water-tight.      Before it was fixed to the other parts
of the bellows its form was that of a hollow frustum of a
cone, of which the perpendicular and greatest diameter were
                                                                 each

t\ich eight inches, and whose least, diameter was six inches
and a half.    It was more easily fastened to its appendages
when of this conical form than if it had been cylindrical.
At the protuberances FF, it is distended by two iron rings,
to which it is sewed fast.
    FG, fig. 1, is an iron rod, by means of which the top of
the bellows may be raised or depressed.      It passes up through
the pipe D to the handle G, which is worked by the hand or
with the foot by means of the pendent stirrup. An enlarged
view of this rod, and of the contrivance by which it is an
nexed to the top, mav be seen at tig. 3 ; where GD repre
sents the rod, and H, H, H, H, flat pieces of iron branching
from it. These are fixed to the circular rim KK in such a
manner as to include the rim 1 1, of the fame metal, which
is screwed fast to the top of the bellows.     Sufficient room is
left to allow the pieces H, H,H, H, and the rim KK, to
move round without rubbing against the included rim 1 1,
or the top of the bellows.
    A copper hood, with an opening in one side, may be ob
served at L, fig. 3. The rod GD is passed through the centre
of this hood, until the flat pieces of iron H, H, H, H, come
in contact with the flat part of it. The hole in the centre is
then luted. The hood may be seen in its proper situation,
atF, fig. 1.
    HI, sig. 1, is a suction-pipe half an inch in diameter.
 It passes under the caste in the direction of the dotted lines
 at C, and turns up into the hole in the bottom of the bel
 lows.    This hole, which is of such a size as to sit the taper
 ing end of the pipe, is seen at fig. 3, and has already been
 mentioned, together with a circular rim of wood, which,
 being nailed round         prevents the end of the pipe from
                                it,
 touching the valve.     The suction-pipe has       conical mouth,

   P is a table affixed to the cask by means of irons, which
ere at pleasure slid into or out of staples. One of these irons,
and   its staples, may be leen near the letter Q.    Thev are
fastened to pieces of wood which run lengthwise under the
table, and which arc so grooved as to support a block of wood
which slides between them. Through this block passes tht
screw S, which slides backward and forward in the opening
TRV.        The stand      TV,
                             which may be observed under the
lamp,    is loosely put on this screw, as a wheel is placed on
its axlctree. It riles and falls with the screw ; but is prevented
 from turning round with         it,    the upright strip of wood T.

    Having    described  the  construction    of the hydrostatic blow-
 pipe, I   proceed   to an explanation     of  the principle and man
 ner  of its action,   and to   adetail  of  the  uses to which     may
                                                                      it
 be applied.
    Suppose that as much water were poured into the cask A,
 fig. I, as would fill the lower apartment, and rife above the
 partition B, one or two inches.           Let fig. be representa

 tion of the cask when supplied with this necessary quantity
of water. When the machine                 at rest, the top of the bel
                                            is
lows, being loaded with lead,          depressed as low as the folding
                                       is
of the leather will permit, and the small space which re
mains in consequence of this folding, between the top of the
bellows and the bottom of the cask, becomes filled with wa
ter, which leaks through the upper valve.               Let the bellows
be extended      by deprefling  the  handle    at a.   The  upper valve
will slnit tight and
                 ;         a quantity    of  water   equal to the bulk,

bottom of the cask, the air will press through the suction-
pipe H, list this valve, and occupy the vacant space within
      I
the bellows.      If the hand be then removed from the handle,
the lead in the top of the bellows will again depress                 it,

the air drawn into them, being thereby compressed, will force
open the upper valve, and ascend.     During its ascent    will       it

   In fig. 4, the bellows are represented as nearly depressed,
iand the air issuing from the open fide of the hood into the
compartment immediately over         which    about half filled
                                              it,                   is

completely full of that fluid.    The water      represented in      is
commotion, that the action of the machine mav be strongly
masked; but the motion of this fluid       in reality    gentle,
                                                              is                   so

                                in
 thrown into either compartment will divide itself equally be
 tween both of them.
   It    must be obvious that the air in the compartments on
 each side of the sheet and pipe of copper                 D, fig. 4,
                                                                    E    E,              i»

 out at the pipes of delivery, unless stopt                    by
                                                     the cocks. These
 pipes are omitted in fig. 4, but have been already described,
 together with their cocks, at MNO, mno, fig. I.'
     The leather and joints of the bellows are evidently sub
jected to the weight of      a  considerable column of water; but
 this pressure, being external, tends to tighten them, and ren
ders this part of the machine            perfect, that
                                          so               the orifice ofif
 the suction-pipe be closed,        will be found impostible to raise
                                     it
 the top of the bellows, without the immense force which
 would be necessary to produce          vacuum within them. This
                                          a
 would not be the cafe     if the smallest leakage took place.
   It   isnow time lo give an account of the purposes to which
 the hydrostatic blow-pipe may be applied, and the manner
 of applying      to them.

 sliding backward or forward the block through which                                     it
 passes,  the (land mav be           adjusted, as that the straight
                                     so
mouth-piece      X  will just enter  the flume.      The handle must                      >
then be worked until the blast obtains the proper strength.
This generally happens when the water has risen above the
partition    £three or sour inches. If        stiould be raised higher,

  the blast may be regulated by turning the cock more or less
  at N.
     When an operation is to be performed on a subject which
  cannot be held over the table ; by fixing the small hose and
  blow-pipe    ab, fig- 7, into one of the conical mouths O, o,
  of  the pipes of delivery, and, by placing a lamp or candle on
  the edge of the table, an operator may, with the subject in
  his hand, expose the proper spot to the flame.          In this way
  glass matrasses filled with liquors have been hermetically
 sealed.
     Nothing can be more steadv than the stream of air emitted
  by this instrument.      The falling off" in pressure, arising from
 the descent of the water, does not perceptibly affect the flame
 in a blast of six minutes duration ; and, in the mean time,
 the hand'e may be depressed so gentlv, that the most strict
  observation will not discover the least unsteadiness to be pro
 duced by it.      Or, if the machine be silled with air, by open
 ing the cock more or less, an equable blast may be supported
 for more than the space of an hour.
     In order to supply the enamel lers' lamp with air by means
 of the hydrostatic blow-pipe, it is only necessary to substi
 tute this instrument for the bellows commonly used for this
 purpose.     There will then be nothing novel in the manner
 of operating, excepting, 1st, That the relative situation of the
 flame and the pipe is to be regulated by turning the screw S,
 or by sliding backward or forward the block through which
 it passes; and, 2dly, That in lieu of the frequent movement
 of the foot, necessary with the common bellows, in the space
 of one minute, and with fifteen strokes of the handle, as
much air may be drawn into the hydrostatic blow-pipe as
 will blow for one hour ; and as the cask and pipes are com
 pletely air-tight, the blast may be stopped, or its strength in
creased or diminished at pleasure, by turning more or less the
<bck of the pipe delivering the air.
    The flame of the cnamellers' lamp is not used exclusively
for the purposes of the artist from whom it takes its name.
It is this modification of the principle of the blow-pipe which
is applied to the moulding or glass instruments. But in heat
ing glass with this flame, an inconvenience arises from the
impossibility of exposing both sides of any subject to the same
heat, unless it be constantly tinned round ; for, il only one
fide of a large glass tube be applied to the flame, the part
exposed to its action will be fused before the other will be
softened, and if it be tujncd round constantly' a much longer
time will be required to melt U. Indeed some large tubes of
                                                           refractory

      On  the  Fabrication  of Charcoal in     the Fores? de Benon.    245
refractory glass, which are not to be melted while undergoing;
this rotatory motion, may be readily filled in any spot con
stantly exposed to the a£tion of the flame.
    In order to produce a flame which should be free from the
inconveniences just described, I procured the oblong lamp
with two wicks W, X, rig. 1. It may be observed, that
these w"icks are fixed on two plates, which slide in a groove,
in the direction of the length of the lamp. They may there
fore be made to approach            to, or recede from each other.
This lamp being as represented in the engraving placed on
the little (land T V, so as that one of the wicks was before
the orifice of the straight mouth-piece, above X ; the bent
blow-pipe at W was so adjusted to the other wick, that when
they were both lighted, and a blast passed over them, their
flames met each other as represented in the plate.                 The re-
fultof this was, that a much larger tube could be fused by
the united action of two flames, than could be melted with
one of them ; and the parts being more equally heated, a
bend could be made more regularly, and with less danger of
collapsing.
    It may be proper to observe that the machine represented
in the plate is much more complex 3nd expensive, than is
requisite for the purposes of the mouth blow-pipe, or ena-
mellers' lamp, simply. But it is expected that artilts, avail
ing themselves of the principles of the machine, will reject
thole appurtenances         which are unnecessary to their peculiar
purposes      *.

2^6       Memoir   on the   Fabrication   of Charcoal,
   It is no doubt to this high price of wood, and the necessity
of deriving as much advantage as possible from the few so-,
rests   in the neighbourhood, that we are indebted for a
method of fabricating charcoal which seems to be practised
no where else. At any rate, from the silence respecting it in
the Collection des Arts et des Metiers, and in La ISouvelle
Encyclopedic, and from the surprise exprefl'ed bv several per
sons on seeing, in the market of Rochelle,       pieces of char
coal of such a size and length that they could be tied up and
transported in the form of faggots,      there is reason to pre
sume that it is not known,
    The Council of Mines, desirous to collect every thing that
can contribute to the success of the different establishments
of the republic, requested me to make known the process.
What I have been able to collect on the subject is as fol
lows :
    The charcoal of the forest of Benon is fold at Rochelle 25
or 30 per cent, above the price of every other charcoal fabri
cated from the fame kind of oak brought from the neigh
bouring departments. The wood of this forest may have
 some superiority over that os others : it grows slowly, is hard
 and heavy ; but, as it appears that the fame means of fabri
 cation are not employed in other places, a small part only
 of the great difference in the prices of charcoal can be
 aferibea to this superiority of the wood.
    The care taken to place the furnace in the centre of sur
 rounding walls, which, by checking the current ot the infe-t
 rior air, renders the operation of charring more uniform and,
 more perfect, with some other circumstances which will be
 mentioned hereafter, seem to contribute in a special manner
 to the advantage in question.
    The heaps of wood which are to be converted into char
 coal, are everywhere almost dispersed throughout the forests,
 and remain exposed to the action of the air in every direc
 tion ; but at Benon the charcoal is fabricated in chambers.
    These chambers are 20 feet square 1 the walls, built of
 rough stones, united by means of earth, are 15 feet in height,
 and are covered with planks and tiles, arranged in such ;\
 manner, that between the planks a space of two inches U
 left, to afford a free passage to the smoke.
   The floor of  the chamber is convex : a mass of argillaceous
earth rises in the centre about fix or seven inches, having be
tween it and the wall a circular space two feet and a half    in.
breadth, and the four corners free for the service of the fur
nace.
   The only wood employed       is   oak, known under the name
                                                             of

ef black oak,    ami very rarely white oak *.     That cut within
the   current year is used, and  never that of  the preceding.
   The wood is ten, twelve, or fifteen years old, and the lower
part of the tree is never separated.   It however, in generals
does not exceed six inches in diameter.      It is cut into pieces
from three feet eight inches to four feet in length, called bil
lets.
   They are placed upright, without being split, resting, with
the side cut into a slope like the mouth of a flute, on the
mass of earth, and in such a manner that they all touch
each other;    those at the circumference only being a little in
clined ; and, contrary to the general practice of those who
char wood, one story only is formed.          Care is taken to mix
these billets with small branches; but twigs are never intro
duced, except in the centre of the furnace, merely to kindle
it. Two cords of wood are sometimes employed at one
times.

inches with earth : it is then suffered to cool for' a day, and
the charcoal is taken out. This operation lasts eight days in
 winter, and only four in summer. At the latter period the
 furnace is watched day and night.
      The pieces of charcoal extracted are often three inches
 and more in diameter, and sufficiently long to be made up
 into bundles, w hich are transported on the backs of mules to
 the distance of five or fix leagues : the smaller fragments are
 put into sacks.
      This charcoal, which is very black, exceedingly brilliant,
 and sonorous, has two qualities which cause it to be much
 sought for in preference to all others ; it possesses more acti
 vity, and lasts longer. It is attended with the inconvenience
 of emitting an odour, hut it is well known that this is one of
 the characters of the best charcoal.
      It is preferred for the kitchen, and for ironing linen. For
 the latter use it is put into iron boxe?, called at Rochelle
fiasques.        It is employed also by blacksmiths when they have
 no common coals.            That in large pieces is most esteemed.
      The latter is sold at seven or eight francs per cu t. delivered
  at Rochclle ; but if the forest ot Benon were taken proper
  care of, this price might be diminished *.
      This method of making charcoal differs from that described

    The forests of Chizai and Aunai, which, except that of
Benon, are nearest toRochelle, furnish charcoal, which is fa«
bricated also from pieces of wood us the fame size, which are
 put into the furnace in like manner without being split;
 but the difference in the choice of the wood, and particularly
 in the fabrication, which takes place in the open air, makes
 a difference of 25 or 30 per cent, in the price as the char
 coal, This difference is sometimes greater when compared
 with that of other forests.
     In the process therefore here described, there is a saving of
 wood, and at the same time the product acquires a greater
 value.
  XXXVIII.         On the Northern Magnetic Pole           of the   Earth,
                       By  Jerome Lalande            *,
  It    has been known for more than two centuries, that the
  piagnetic     needle does not point exactly north, arid that its
  declination from that direction is different in different places.
  Relearches therefore have been made to determine the point
  of the earth towards which the magnetic needle turns ; and
  this object engaged the attention of Dr. Halley in 1683, of
  Euler in 1745, of Lemonnier in 1776, and of Buffon in
  1788. About five years ago Mr. Churchman, a native of
  America, came to Paris to induce government to set on foot
  a voyage to the north pole, for the purpose of determining
  the polition of the magnetic pole in the north.             In the year
          he  publiflied  a work, in which he proposes a theory by
  1794
  which the declination of the magnetic needle can be deter
  mined for different periods and different places.               I endea
  voured to compare it with the latest observations.              Those of
  V'hich I have already spoken in the Connoijsunce des Terns              f
  ¦were made at Nootka Sound in 48

tion there was T90 44' west. In the supposition that the lines
 of direction lie in the planes of great circles, and meet in
one point, I found it to be in 7 7° 4' north lat.        Euler in the
Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin places it in 750 ; Le-
monnier, in the Lois du Magnetifme, in 730; and Buffon,
11171°; which makes the differences to be very small.            Eu
ler conceived two magnetic poles, which are not diametri
cally apposite to each other.        The two observations which
form the ground of my calculation were made, however,
near enough to the north pole to enable us to determine it
independently of the south pole. Churchman places the
north pole in the lat. of 60°; a difference which would be
too great.
   The two observations here alluded to would give the longi
tude of the magnetic pole in too doubtful a manner, as the
angle at the pole is too obtuse.        I endeavoured, therefore, to
obtain an intermediate observation, and found that, in the
year 1770, at Norreton, in lat. 40^ 10' north, and long. 77°
36' west from Paris, the declination was 30 8' *. From this
it would follow, that the longitude of the magnetic pole is
lio° 35' west from Paris. The year, however, of the last
observation does not correspond with that of the two former
ones : but the difference on this account cannot be of much
importance.
   At the time of the transit of Venus over' the fun's disk in
 1779, observed at Hudson's Bay, in lat. 580 48' north, and
long. 960 30' west from Paris, the declination of the magne
tic needle was found to be, in that place, 90 41' wests.
This gave me for the longitude of the magnetic pole only
86° west from Paris.         The mean of the two observations,
therefore, would be 980.         Euler makes the longitude 115°,
and Bufson 100° west from Paris: Lemonnier makes it only
500.    But, as the parallel at so high a northern latitude is
only  of small extent, a more considerable difference in lon
gitude  would   have no great influence on the previous deter
mination of the true position of the magnetic pole.
   We can therefore admit the given data till a series of
more accurate observations of the declination of the mag
netic needle, and its variations, collected for different deter
minate places, shall enable us to deduce from them the va
riations of the magnetic pole.        The variations of the mag
netic declination have been observed at Paris for 140 years;

the proper data for calculating the motion of the magnetic

                                                 by
 that the expansibility of air, saturated with moisture, was
 smaller than the expansibility of pure vapour until the 167th
 degree ot Fahrenheit        but in higher degrees they constantly
                               ;
 approached      nearer to each other.      And the general observed
 that the mean rate of expansion, which from 152° to 172'
 of Fahr. was 12 for each degree, did, from the 172° to the
 1920, increase to 17-88 for each degree, and increased still
more after the io^d to the boiling point.              The fluggisliness
of expansion of air, saturated with moisture at about 32', was
 also noticed      by the general      and he hence concludes the
                                         ;
mean rate of expansion from o to32° of Fahr. to be 2-37
for each degree, which           smaller than that of drier air.

     These variations of the rates of expansibility of moist air,
saturated at different temperatures,        Schmidt very justly attri
butes to'the variation of the degrees of affinity or adherence
of air and vapour to each other at different temperatures.            At
32' Fahr.    it is very strong, and also below that degree           and    ;
hence the strong solv. nt power of air colder than the water                             it
acts upon, remarked                by
                                 Richman      but :    both are equally

167^ or 170" air and vapour are disposed to separate.
    jto. Hence we may deduce the impossibility of discovering
a co-esticient universally applicable to express the rate of ex
pansion of air in every state of moisture, as Treinley has well
noticed. (See Saujsure P'oy. aux Alpes, ii. 4to.)            This must
vary   with  the  mean   state  of hygrometers   above   and below the
heights    to  be  measured    : and  experiments   of  this kind  have
not yet been made.         De Luc's co-efficient answers tolerably
well for very dry air, that         is,whose saturability     greatest;
                                                              is

smallest.     Hence each succeeds in certain cafes, and fails in
others. The dilatation or contraction which air saturated
with moisture at any one given degree of temperature receives
without the addition of any more moisture, at any higher
or lower degree of temperature, has not as yet been disco
vered :   for Schmidt, who alone has attempted                it, justly
                                                                    is
diffident of the correctness of the table he has given of it;
and,  in   fact,it   is not grounded on the indication of any
known hygrometer, and improperly supposes the 50th degree
to indicate the mean betwixt the lowest and saturation                         :
whereas the 65th degree on SaufTure's indicates that mean;
and 98, and not 100, indicates saturation.
    According to Mr. Watt (as stated           byDe Luc, Meteorolo
gy, hi. p. 145), the specific gravity of pure vapour            to that
                                                                  is
of air as  4   to 9. I    suppose he compares        itwith air at the
usual density of 30 or 29, and at some particular temperature
which     is not mentioned  ;    for at high temperatures the differ
ence must be much greater, as appears           by

     M. Saufsure (Hygrometer, p. 284,) has given us the spe

solved in air, with more precision        ;for he tells us, inio. That

     But I strongly suspect that the original experiment, ott
 which this calculation is founded, is erroneous, chiefly bv
 reason of the strong adherence of moisture to cold glass, as
 will hereafter be seen in treating of dew. From Schmidt's
 experiments it may be inferred that the specific gravity of
 vapour, dissolved in air at this temperature, is much lower
 with respect to that of pure air than Saussure has stated ; for
 he tells us that about 1066 measures of dry air in tempera
 ture 65°, would, if saturated with moisture at that tempera
 ture, occupy the space of about 1 100 measures, and conse
 quently receive an augmentation amounting to about -^d of
their bulk : now, transferring this ratio to the cubic foot in
Saussure's experiment, it appears that T\d of a cubic foot thus
added to the cubic foot of dry air weighs 1 o grains j but a
cubic foot of dry air, augmented by an accession of T\d of
similar air, would weigh 751 + 23*46 grains, which ap
proaches nearly to Mr. Watt's ratio: therefore the specific
gravity of vapour dissolved in air at this temperature is to that
of perfectly dry air    as 10 to 23*5 nearly.       It should however
be recollected that      M. Saussure sound that a cubic foot of
dry air in reality took up         11 '069 grains of moisture when
saturated at this temperature, and that it was only by way
of concession to those against whom he argued, that he stated
the weight taken up at 10 grains ; then we should have of
 11-069 to 21*195, or, in round numbers, as 11 to 21, or 10
to 9. And it should further be remarked that the tempe
rature is given very loosely, for it is stated to be from 14 to
15° or 160 of Reaumur.           See Hygrometer, p. 104 and 284.
     Saussure has given us a table, *by the help of which the
absolute quantity of vapour at anv barometrical height, in a
cubic foot of air, being known, the proportion and absolute
quantity in a cubic foot, at another barometrical height 3 6
inches lower, may be known from the mercurial height 2877
to that of three inches and one-half nearly.
     This table  I here give, adapting it to our measures.

     21*57      08899      vapour at a height at which a baro
     17*97      0-8264     meter would stand at 25*17 inches
     14*37      0-7629     would be 10 X 0 9528 = 9*528, and
     10-77      0-6887     at the height at which a barometer
      7 17      c*6230     would stand at seven inches, the quan
      .V57      O43II      tity in a cubic foot would be only 10
X -6230      - 6*83.    But still it is  supposed that at those great

heights, at which barometers would stand so low, that the
air is of the fame temperature as the original experiment is
made at, namely in this cafe, as it is sound at barometer
2877 inches; but since in reality air at great heights is ge
nerally much colder than below, to ascertain the real pro
portion of vapour at those heights it will be necessary to find
the quantity of vapour which a cubic soot of air is capable of
holding at that temperature barometer 28-77, anu the ratio
which the quantity or weight of vapour actually sound, bears
to the complement at that temperature.         Then, ado. to find
the complement of a cubic soot of air at the temperature
which prevails at the given barometrical height, and dimi
nish it in the same ratio in which it was sound diminished
below ; and finally, diminish it still further in the ratio which
that barometrical height demands. An example will fully
explain this rule.
    Thus Saussure found, barometer 2877 and thermometer
 820 of Fahr., a cubic soot of air contained about 10 grains
of moisture at Geneva.          Now the complement of 82s is
 nearly 15 grains, and the ratio of 10 to 15 is 7. Then at
 Mount Blanc, on the fame hour, the barometer stood at 16"
 and the thermometer at 26-8 J: the complement of a cubic
 soot of air at this temperature is 5^3 grains, which diminished
 in the ratio of 2 to 3 becomes 3 '5 ; and this, further dimi
 nished by the ratio which the barometrical height of 16
 inches demands, namely 78 = 3-5 X 78 — 27 grains, by
 observation it was found to be 17 : the difference is only one
 grain. Voy. aux Alpes, § 2007. How the temperature which
 prevails at those great heights may be found, will be fliown
 in  the sequel.
    The   celebrated Lambert of Berlin (Mem. Berlin 1772,)
 has also given an eliimate of the proportion of vapour which
 prevails in the atmosphere at different barometrical heights,
 deduced from calculations founded on many fictions — such
 as that of a homogeneous atmosphere,         of pure air distinct
 from common air, and an erroneous system of the ascent of
  heat; yet, as it is much easier in its application, and in the
 instance just quoted approaches very near the truth, I have
  calculated the results of his system, which is nothing more
  than that the quantity of vapour at different barometrical
  heights above the earth is in the ratios of the squares of those
  heights.    By a homogeneous atmosphere it is probable he
  meant such a state of the atmosphere as prevails in serene
  unclouded weather; and it is certainly only in such an at
  mosphere that any calculation can be instituted.

for as 8277        (-

   As vapours unite to air, partly through the agency of heat,
and partly through that of affinity and of electricity, so they
separate from      sometimes from
                        it,           diminution of that degree
                                                     a
of heat which they possessed in their nascent state, sometimes
from    diminution of affinity, and sometimes from an altera
         a
tion in their electrical state.
   In their first degree of coalescence when separated from
air, they form aggregates of exceeding minute particles,                                     se
parated from z\roy the diminution of affinity, and also from
each other      electrical atmospheres: these aggregates are of
                   by
equal and often lower specific gravity than the air in which
they are formed, and yet are visible      reason of their opa
                                                            by
city; when near the      earth, they are called fogs, mi/Is, or
baxe, (which differ only in density,) and when at greater
heights, clouds.
   Vapours issuing from water or moisture warmer than the
air to which they unite, are soon cooled               and thence in by   it,
great measure   dismissed    hence  the : morning     mists  observed
in summer and     the winter  mists of  the  colder  regions even                  :
ing mists, on  the  contrary, proceed     from   the superfaturation
of air with vapours previously dissolved, arising from the                                   su
                                                            pervening

                   JiibfiTtng in the Atmosphere.                %$j
pervening decreased temperature.        The inferior strata of the
 atmosphere,   are scarce ever, supersaturated by vapours arising
 from water or moisture warmer than the air into which they
 ascend ; for, before the point of saturation can be attained,
 their affinity to the portion of air to which they are united is
 weakened, and thence exceeded by the unincumbered affinity
of the superior strata : and this happens successively on to the
 higher regions ; but with diminished activity, by reason of
the diminished densitv of the higher strata, until their ulte
 rior progress is checked by saturation ; but as they are still
 continually recruited from below, their quantity is at last so
far increased that they coalesce into clouds.       Here the pro
 cess recommences ; for from the surface of these clouds a
fresh evaporation often takes place, which, after some pro
gress, is again checked in its turn, and clouds are formed at
a superior height : these again
                                    give room to a further evapo
 ration, and a new stage of clouds is formed, until the process
is at last arrested by the intense cold of the superior regions.
But the mere cold of congelation is not sufficient to arrest it;
for Bouguer informs us that clouds are formed 2500 feet
above the lower line of congelation, and that ice itself eva
porates, though cooled, several degrees below the freezing
point, is well known.        The distance of the particles, both
of air and vapour, from each other, when so far rarefied as
they must be in the superior regions of the atmosphere, pre
vents their coalescence in any but the extreme degrees of
cold.
    Hence we fee that in the warmer latitudes and seasons va
rious strata of clouds may be formed one above the other :
Mufchenbrooek attests that even in Holland, in August 1748,
he distinctly discerned three.     These distinct strata, variously
electrified and otherwise circumstanced, give occasion to va
rious phœnomena, the detail of which would here be mis
placed.
    The clouds which commonly crown the summits even of
low mountains, and often announce rain, are caused by the
near approach to saturation at those elevations, and its actual
attainment through the evaporation from those summits.
But the summits of the loftiest mountains ever crowned with
snow, are generally shrowded in clouds, from the cold they
impart to the air in contact with them, and the loss of elec-
tri'-ity conducted away from the vapours contained in that
air by the mountain.
    The heights at which the lowest clouds are formed, are
various in various latitudes and seasons ; greater in the
warmer, and smaller in the colder. In latitude 5^.° in Cum-

 one-fourth of that of the cubic foot of air in which they sub

     JL II E conference of mines had long been sensible of the
   neceflitv of determining, with rigorous precision, the specific
   gravity of coals in mafles or in large fragments, in order that
   it might be compared with that ol the fame article as fold by
   the coal merchants.           This obje6t was at the fame time of
   more importance, as it would make known what difference
   humectation would produce on the volume which coals oc
   cupy in their state of dryness.
       C. Duhamel and Blavier proposed to accomplish this
    object in the execution of a labour with which they were
    charged, in order to confirm the different'assertions             already

larly to those which it experiences till the moment when
it passes into the hands of the consumer : but they were ob
liged to confine their experiments to each of those kinds of
coal placed at their disposal by the council, and which were
transmitted to them directly by the workers of the mines of
Creuffot, St. Etienne, Lataupe, Labarlhe, Lacomballe, and
Decise.
   The method by which they were able to ascertain the spe
cific gravity was as follows :
    After bringing the different kinds of coal above mentioned
to the uniform size of pease or beans, by lifting them, and
having carefully picked out all the earthy or schistous parti
cles, the commissioners silled a decalitre wilh each of them,
taking care to choose those in the highest state of dryness,
and to pour them in without any (hock, as merchants do
who measure them on the ground or in their barges.           The
weight of each decalitre being ascertained, the dry coal con
tained in the vessel was then watered in succession without
shaking or displacing it ; and this was continued till the water
floated over the surtace. The coals thus moistened were again
weighed, and the difference of weight indicated the specific
gravity required, since this article is impermeable to water,
which only sills up the vacuities left between the grains of
the bruised coal by their uniting under a greater or less ob
tuse angle.
    In regard to the increase of weight arising from humecta-
tion, it will be sufficient to decant the supernatant liquor ;
and the difference of the two, weighed as above, expressed
this second result.
    They then moistened successively, and in different propor
tions, each kind of coal; suffered the superfluous water to
drain off for a quarter of an hour; and, comparing the vo
lume of the dry matter with that which it occupied at dif
ferent degrees of humectation, were able to discover the pro
gressive increase or diminution by employing for this purpose
a wire placed exactly level with the surface of the vessel.
    The table annexed exhibits the scries of the comparative
experiments: indicating for each hectolitre of the kinds of
 coal before mentioned the weight of that article in its state
of dryness; that of the water introduced, which may be
 considered as solid ; the increase of weight in the moistened
 coals; the augmentation of its volume arising from greater
or less humectation ; the number of parts of solid coal in a
 hundred parts of dry coal, and the specific gravity of the latter.
    It follows, from the labour of C. Duhamel and Blavier,
 ist, That the increase of weight is always in the direct ratio
 •f the quantity of water added, which itself increases accord -

the latter also is in the inverse ratio of the weight of the liquid
which the dry coal retains after decantation.           3d, That the
increase of volume is the more sensible a,5 a greater quantity
of humectation has been produced; and that there exists a
term at which the addition of water occasions no change,
and beyond which the volume decreases in determinate pro

not only in regard to the different kinds of coal, but even in
the fame kind of coal, according to its nature, its mixture
with parts more or lei's earlhy, and particularly its size or
degree of trituration.
    The most natural conclusion to be deduced from these ex
periments    is, that in the hie of coals there may be introduced

 100 parts of dry coal there are scarcely 70 parts of solid coal

    In consequence of these considerations, C. Duhamel and
C. Blavier, in report dated Pluvlose

p restinga   wish that an accurate table of the specific Gravities
of all the coils in France, comparing them with each other
in different degrees of size and humectation, might be drawn
out. The result would at least be approximative data, bv
help of which          would be possible to expose the shameful
                      it
traffic of some coal-merchants, who alter the nature of their
commodity by mixtures more or less earthy.               This labour

experiments proper for determining the real value of cod in

example, that C. Blavier has already found,                   repeated
trials, that the pera of Decisc must be 'selected to heat rever
berating and evaporating furnaces in preference to the small
coal ot St. Etienne;. while the latter, which         fold

in forges and in all circumstances where strong concena

     porter proposes to subject the different kinds of coals in the
     republic to experiences, capable of fixing, in an invariable
     manner, not only their peculiar use in commerce and in the
     arts, but also the advantage? which would result from mixing

 XLI.  Memoir on the Wax-Tree os Louisiana and Pennsyl
   vania.  By Charles Louis Cadet," of /be College of
   Pharmacy *.
 J\     Number of       plants, such as the Crolon sebiferum, the
  Tomex sebifera of Loureiro, the poplar, the alder, the pine,
  and some labiati, give by decoction a concrete inflammable
, matter, similar, in a greater or less degree, to tallow or wax ;
  that is to fay, a fixed oil saturated with oxygen. The light
  down, called the bloom of frpits, and which gives a sil
  very appearance to the surface of plums and other Hone fruits,
  is wax, as has been proved by M. Proust. But the tree
  which furnishes this matter in the greatest abundance, and
  which in many respects deserves the attention of agricul
  turists, chemists, physicians, and commercial men, is the
  Myrica cerifera, or wax-tree.
      We read in the History of the Academy of Sciences for
  the years 172a and 1725, that M. Alexandre, a surgeon and
  correspondent of M. Mairan, observed in Louisiana, a tree
  of the size of the cherry-tree, having the appearance of the
   myrtle and nearly the same odour, and bearing a seed of
  the size of coriander.      These seeds, of an ash-gray colour,
  contain a small osseous stone, pretty round, covered with
 ¦shining wax, which is obtained by boiling the feeds in water.
   This wax is drier and more friable than ours. The inhabi
   tants of the country make tapers of it. M. Alexandre adds :
   " This feed has commonly a beautiful lake colour, and on
  being bruised with the fingers they acquire the fame tint:
  but this takes place only at a certain season."
      The liquor in which the seeds have been boiled, and from
   which the wax has been taken, when evaporated to the con
   sistence of an extract, was found by M. Alexandre to be an
   effectual remedy for checking the most obstinate dysenteries.
      The advantageous properties exhibited by this tree could
  not but induce scientific men to make researches for the pur
  pose of ascertaining the varieties of this vegetable production,
   and what care was required in its culture.     It was long con
  sidered as a mere object of curiosity.
      Linnæus, in his Vegetable System, speaks only of the
  wax-tree of Virginia {Myrica cerifera), with leaves lanceo-
  Jited as if indented, stem arborescent.
       Having requested C. Ventenat to inform me how many
  species there are ofit,  he replied that Ayton has distinguished
   two, viz.
              *   From the Annales   de Cbimie,   No.   iji.
                                                               1st,   Myrica

       On    the Wax-Tree os Louisiana and Pennsylvania.          263
    1st,  Myrica cerifera anguflisolia, which grows in Louisi
ana.     This tree is delicate, flowers with difficulty in our
green-houses: its feeds are smaller than those of the fol
lowing.
    ad, Myrica                           which grows in Pennsylva*-
                    cerifera latisuli:,
nia, Carolina, and Virginia. It does not rife to such a height
as the former, and is perfectly naturalized in France.         These
two Myricee are of the family of the diœci.
    They are hoth cultivated at the Museum des Plantes and
in the gardens of C. Cels and Lemonier.
    C. Michault admits a third species of Myrica cerifera, which
he calls the dwarf wax-tree.            C. Ventenat thinks that wax
may    be   extracted   from   all the Myricœ.
    The authors'who have spoken of these trees with some de
tails are C. Marchal, translated by Leserme, Lepage-Du-
 prat, and Toscan, librarian of the Museum of Natural His
tory.     A memoir inserted by the latter in his work intitled
 U  Ami de la Nature, makes known the manner in which
 vegetable wax is collected in the colonies.
    **
        Towards the end of Autumn," fays he, " when the
 berries are ripe, a man quits his home, with his family, to
 proceed to some island, or some bank near the sea, where
 the wax- trees grow in abundance.             He carries with him
 vessels for boiling the berries, and an axe to build a hut to
 shelter him during his residence in that place, which is ge
 nerally three or four weeks.           While he is cutting down the
 trees and constructing the hut, his children collect the ber
 ries : a fruitful shrub can furnish about seven pounds. When
 the berries are collected, the whole family employ themselve*
 in extracting the wax. A certain quantity of the feeds are
 thrown into the kettles, and water is poured over thein in
 sufficient quantity to rise to the height of half a foot above
 them. The whole is then boiled, stirring the feeds from
 time to time and pressing them against the sides of the ves
 sels, that the wax may more easily be detached.              A little
 after, the wax is seen floating in the form of fat, which is
 collected with a spoon and strained through a piece of coarse
 cloth to separate the impurities mixed with it. When no
 more wax detaches itself, the berries are taken out by means
 of a skimmer, and new ones are put into the water; taking
 care to renew it the second or third time, and even to add
 more boiling water in proportion as it is consumed, that the
 operation may not be retarded.           When a certain quantity of
 wax has been collected in this manner, it is placed on a piece
 of linen cloth to drain, and to separate the water with which
 it is still mixed.      It is then dried, and melted a second time

                                      moulded into the form is
of cakes. Four pounds of the feeds give about pound of                              a

that in countries where the wax-tree grows,         employed                   it   is
for making excellent soap, with which linen can be perfectly
washed.
   Such was the knowledge naturalists had of the myrica, or
at least no other observations, as far as know, had been              I
 published, respecting        when    naturalist gave me half

    This feed      kind of berry, of the size of

 shagreen.  When     rubbed   between  the hands,     renders them             it

bare, has     very thick ligneous covering, and contains

contain a colouring principle, and I did not despair that          I
should find in it the beautiful lake, mentioned by M. Alex-
andre. With this view, I bruised strongly the powder, and
boiled it in a solution of acid sulphate of alumine.         I was
much astonistied to obtain nothing but a liquor scarcely co
loured, and the alumine precipitated by an alkali, was only
slightly stained.
    I took another part of this black bruised powder, and put
it to infuse in alcohol.     I soon obtained a tincture of the co
lour of wine Ices : on heating this tincture, it became as red
as a strong tincture of cinchona or cachou.         This result in
duced me to believe that the colouring principle was resinous,
but by adding water I saw no precipitate formed.
    I poured into this tincture water charged with sulphate of
alumine; a slight precipitate was produced : a solution of sul
phate of iron formed it immediately into an ink.
    What is the astringent colouring principle which is not
soluble in alcohol, which forms no precipitate with water,
and which has so little attraction for alumine ? To find it a
series of experiments, which the few substances I had in my
possession did not permit me to make, would have been ne
cessary.     The astringent matter mentioned by M. Alexandre,
must be found in the decoction of the unbruised seeds.           To
ascertain this fact, I boiled the feeds in a silver vessel.    The
decoction on which a little wax floated, was of a greenisli
colour, with a taste somewhat styptic : it precipitated ferru
ginous solutions black.       Having heated it in a very clean iron
vessel, it speedily became black. To know whether this pro
perty arose from the gallic acid alone, or from tannin, I
mixed a little of the concentrated decoction with a solution
of gelatin, but no precipitate was formed.
-
   It is therefore to the pretty considerable quantity of gallic
acid contained in the feeds of the myrica, that the virtue of
its extract in checking dyscntaries ought to be ascribed.        In
this respect, I am of opinion that the leaves ahid bark of the
tree would furnish an extract still more astringent than the
berries.
   The following arc the most interesting results of an exami
nation of the wax :
    When extracted either by decoction from the feeds, or by
solution of the white powder in alcohol precipitated by water,
this melted wax is always of a yellow colour, inclining to
green.     Its consistence is stronger than that of the wax made
by bees ; it is dry and friable enough to be reduced to pow
der ; in a word, it is manifestly more oxygenated than wax
prepared by these insects. Tapers made with the wax of the
                                                            myrica

 %66                  Memoir on the Wax-Tree
 myrica give a white flame and a beautiful light, without
 smoke, cio not run, and when new emit a balsamic odour
 which the inhabitants of Louisiana consider as very benefi
 cial to the sick : when distilled in a retort, it pastes in a
 great part to the state of butter. This portion is whiter than
 it was before, but it loses its consistence, and acquires that
 of tallow. Another portion is decomposed, furnishes a lit
 tle water, febacic acid, and empyreumaticoil.      A great deal
 of carbonated hydrogen gas and carbonic acid gas are disen
 gaged, and there remains in the retort a black carbonaceous
 bitumen.     Common wax when distilled, exhibits the fame
phenomena.
    I have already said that alcohol dissolves the wax of the
myrica, but- ether dissolves it much better, and, by the eva
 poration of the liquid, it separates in the form of stalagmites.
 Neither of these liquids destroy its colour.    If this wax be
boiled with dilute sulphuric acid, it becomes a little whiter,
 but there is no sensible combination of the acid with it. The
yellow wax of bees, treated in the fame manner, did not
change its colour.
    Oxygenated muriatic acid bleaches both kinds of wax per
fectly.   The vegetable wax, however, loses its cplour with
more difficulty.
    The vegetable wax dissolves in ammonia.         The solution-
assumes a brown colour : a part of the wax becomes sapona
ceous.    The volatile alkali has much less action on the wax
of  bees.
    These two kinds of wax, when strongly agitated in a boil
ing solution of caustic potash, wash and form a real soap,
as observed by Kalm the traveller.         The whiteness which
wax acquires by this saponisication is not a new phænome-
non.     C. Chaptal, in his process for bleaching by the steam
of alkaline lees, has proved that the colouring principle of
vegetables yields to the action of alkalies.     Some chemists
ascribe this effect to the direct combination of soda or potasli
with the coloured extractive part, and a combination which
brings it to a state almost saponaceous and renders it soluble.
    According to my opinion, the alkali, in this operation,
exercises over the oil or wax a double attraction, first direst
with the constituent principles of the oil, then predisposing
and favouring the combination of the oxygen of the atmo
sphere with oil or wax. 1 do not know whether any one be
fore me ever entertained this idea ; but it was suggested by
observing what takes place when soap is decomposed by an
acid. The oil is always concrete and more oxygenated than
it was before.
                                                                It

    It would be of importance for the theory of chemistry to
make soap, if possible, in a close vessel, and to examine the
air afterwards, or in different gases containing no oxygen.
    Bv decomposing soap of the myrica, very white wax is
obtained; but in a particular state, which does not admit of
its being employed for our purposes.
    Litharge, or semi-vitreous oxide of lead, dissolves very well
in the melted wax of Louisiana.          It forms a very hard mass,
the consistence os which may be diminished at pleasure by
the addition of a little oil. If the wax of the myrica, as there
is reason to think, retains a portion of the astringent prin
ciple given by a decoction of the berries, the physicians,
perhaps, will find useful properties in topics made with this
 wax.
     By taking a general view of what has been here said, it is
 seen that the myrica may be of very great service in the arts.
 The wax which il furnishes is sufficiently abundant to prove
 an ample indemnification for the care and expense of cultiva
 tion, since a shrub in full bearing gives six or seven pounds
 of berries, from which a fourth of wax may be extracted.
 This wax is of a quality superior to that of bees.
     The astringent principle of the myrica, extracted on a large
 scale, may be very useful either in medicine or in the arts.
 In certain respects it may be substituted for the gall-nut in
 dyeing, hat-making, and perhaps in the tanning some kinds
 of leather. The colouring principle seems to be sufficiently
 fixed to deserve some attention ; and, if it be true that in
 Louisiana beautiful lakes are made from               why it,   not
                                                                   it

 rendered useful in painting?
     In word, when this wax becomes sufficiently common to
      a
 be sold at  a   low price, great advantage might be derived from
it   in making soap.
     The art of bleaching this wax requires also some researches,
 when  it   is to be performed on       large scale whh ceconomy.
                                         a
 Two re-agents present themselves to manufacturers — the sul
  phuric acid and the oxygenated muriatic.          But as wax does
  not fink in these liquids, means must be found to multiply
  the contact, either          by
                               cutting the wax into slices and be
  sprinkling      with oxygenated muriatic acid, or shutting

   different periods, till there is no longer a sensible disengage
   ment of muriatic gas.      A large quantity of water is then to
  be added, and the mixture must be stirred with a rod.          By
  rest, the insoluble sulphate of lime is precipitated, and the
  bleached wax will float at the surface.
       I shall terminate this memoir with some observations on
  the culture of the myrica.
       C. Destiayes, to whom I am indebted for the trials I
  made, has observed, for several years, the wax-trees of Ram-
  bouillet.      What he wrote to me on this subject is as fol
  lows :
       "  The Myrica latifoiia (Ayton) is here absolutely in its
  native country : it is in the foil proper for it; that is to fay,
 in sandy and blackish turf. We have sixteen wax-trees in
  full vigour. They are four, five, and fix feet in height : one
 male is seven feet. The seeds are abundant almost every year:
 I   fay almost, because in some years they fail.      The fruit in
 general is in that part of the English garden afllgned to it.
       " The culture requires no care. Every year a great num
 ber of shoots, which proceed from the roots of the large trees,
 are pulled up.      These are so many new shrubs, which arc
 then planted at the distance of a yard from each other.
       " The feeds may be sown in beds in the spring, and then
 transplanted : but this method is tedious.      The myrica will
 succeed wherever it finds a light foil, somewhat moist. How
 many provinces are there where the cultivation of this shrub
 ¦would be useful, and employ land almost neglected !
       " What advantages may not agriculture hope for from such
 an acquisition, since Prussia has so long seen the myrica
 flourish in its dry, sandy plains !"
       C. Thiebault, of the Academy of Berlin, gave me the fol
 lowing interesting note on this subject :
       " The late M. Sulzer, author or a general dictionary of the
 fine arts, had obtained from Frederic the Great a pretty ex
tensive piece of waste land on the banks of the Spree, at the
distance of half a league from Berlin, in a place called the
Moabites.         However barren this ground, which presented
only a- very thin, poor turf, above fine light sand, might be,
M. Sulzer converted it into a very agreeable garden, worthy
of a philosopher. Among other remarkable things he formed
a plantation of foreign trees, consisting of five pretty long
alleys running east and west. In these alleys there were not
two trees of the fame kind following each other.         In the al
leys most exposed to the north he planted none but the highest
trees, capable of withstanding the severity of the climate.

                   of Louisiana and Pennsylvania.              269
Hence, m proceeding from the north to the south, the first            »
alley exhibited trees of about seventy feet in height, the
second trees of from twenty- five to thirty, and so on, in the
form of an amphitheatre ; so that all these trees had the fun
at least in part, and the weaker were sheltered by the stronger.
      " In the most southern allev I observed a sort of shrub
which rose only to the height ot two or three feet, and which
M. Sulzer called the wax-tree. Every person visited this
alley in preference to the rest, on account of the delicious
 perfume emitted by the leaves, which they retained a very
 long time.
      C. Thiebault then speaks of the method of extracting
 the wax. This operation is the fame as that described by
 M. Alexandre.
                                  "
      " I have seen," adds he, one taper of this wax perfume
 three chambers which composed M. Sulzer's private apart
 ments, not only during the time it was lighted, but even for
  the rest of the evening."
      The myrica cultivated at Berlin was, no doubt, more odo
  riferous than that which we possess, the wax of which does-
  not emit the fame perfume.-           s
      M. Sulzer intended to make tapers of this wax not
  bleached, covered with a coating of our finest wax. The
  heirs of this academician fold the garden, but the wax-trees
  still remain.     They were planted in 1770.
       If it has been found possible- to naturalize the myrica ceri-
 fera in the north, whv should we neglect a vegetable produc
  tion so valuable, which would certainly thrive in our southern
  departments,' and which requires lels care than bee-hives.
  The successful trials which have been made must excite the
  zeal of our agriculturists.
       The government has already encouraged this branch of
  industry by ordering plantations of the wax-tree.       There are
  nurseries     at Orleans and Rambouillet which contain more
  than 400 llirubs. Results so satisfactory cannot be made
  too public.      Useful plants are always propagated slowly : a
  barren but picturesque tree, an agreeable shrub, are soon
   adopted through faUiion : they ornament the parterres of
   our modern Luculluses and the flower pots of our Phrynes,
   while our indefatigable agriculturists exhaust themselves in
   vain efforts to enrich our meadows with a new grafs, or to
   fill our granaries with a new nourishing grain. The vulgar,
   through prejudice, long rejected maiz and potatoes, which
   have been of so much service to our soldiers and to the poor.

   forests.    Let us, however, hope that our agriculturists will
                                                                   at

                   NATURAL PHILOSOPHY-.
      Of Meteors supposed   to fall  under the form of Stones.
   A great deal has been said of stones which have fallen
from the clouds ; it was long believed that this was one
of the forms assumed by thunder in its fall ; they were then
considered as the product of the explosion of certain lumi
nous balls, which are sometimes observed.           The rarety of
these phænomena, however, which has not allowed of their
being seen at a stiort distance by observers possessed of intel
ligence, and at the fame time worthy of credit, and which
seems hitherto to have reserved them for the eyes of the vul
gar, so much inclined to exaggeration, has prevented the
learned from believing in the existence of these stones.
   However, most mmeralogical collections, contain a great
number of stones, to which this origin has been ascribed.
They exhibit exterior uniform characters : a specific gravity
nearly equal, and by analysis, give the fame component parts,
among which is nickel, a substance rarely found at the sur
face ot the earth ; and iron in a metallic state, which is ne
ver met with in volcanic productions, to which these stones
in other respects seem to be very analogous.
   These remarks have induced Mr. Howard, and Count de
Bournon, to think that, however doubtful the fall of stones
from the atmospheric regions may be, it ought to be subjected
to accurate examination.       They have collected the different
testimonies in a paper read before the Royal Society of London,
and C. Pictet thought it proper to present it to the class, that
the attention of philosophers maybe directed to this subject,
in order that the phænonienon, it true, may be confirmed ;
or, if only an illusion supported by popular error, may be
confined forever to the class of errors.

all the   parts may be carefully described, and that these parts
may be assigned to the regions which they compose.         Such,
it appears is the idea which may be formed of the present
state of the chemical knowledge of salts.      Their general for
mation seems to be well known, the great divisions are well
established, and the principal facts have been exactly observ
ed and classed ; but notwithstanding these satisfactory labours,
many details are still unknown or imperfect.          Hence the
researches of the chemists of the institute during this quarter
have been particularly directed towards this object, and it
will be seen that they have not been fruitless.
    The liquor charged with the colouring matter of Prussian
blue, having manifested the property o( taking metals from
their solvents, without producing a decomposition of the salts
with an alkaline or earthy base, the phenomenon of the pre-
cipjjation of barytes had been considered as an indication
ofihe metallic nature of that! ubstance, which could not be
reduced to a metallic state, because it had a greater affinity
for oxygen than carbon. The most ceiebrated chemists had
adopted this opinion, others had announced that precipita
tion did not take place.       Mr. William Henry thus main
taining that prussiates perfectly purified did not produce and
precipitation,    confirmed himself the first observations      of
Bergman and Lavoisier, and announced that there was formed
by double affinity a real prussiate of barytes.      C   Gtiyton,
having long observed that prussiate of lime was decomposed
 by carbonate of potash, made use of this experiment, "and
 those of Mr. Henry, to fix the theory of these phænomena ;
and, instead of concluding, like the English chemist, that ba
 rytes differs in this respect from other earths, and approaches
the nature of metals, he shows that the fame effect takes
 place with lime, strontian, magnesia, potash, soda, and
even ammonia, and consequently          that, in all these cases,
 there is nothing but the necessary result of the concurrence of
 several divellent forces.
                        On Mercurial Salts.
    After treating different oxides of mercury, as already men
 tioned in his memoir, C. Fourcroy continued to read an ac
 count of his labour during the last quarter. In this second
 part he employed himself on the sulphates and nitrates of
 mercury ; a very complex kind of compounds, exceedingly
 variable, the characters and properties of which have been
  examined by many chemists, without their being able to de
 termine the real differences between them, and particularly
 the cause of these differences.   The author had already made

 long paper on these salts.              Me established three kinds of
 them, distinguished by the proportions of acid and oxide,
 aud he showed a difference between them, founded on the
 different states of oxidation of the metal.
    Different sulphates are made not only by exposing mercury
 with sulphuric acid to a greater or less heat, and for a longer
 or shorter time, but also bv mixing this acid ora soluble sul
 phate with a nitric solution os mercury, more or less oxi
 dated.     If the latter is little oxidated, a white precipitate of
 sulphate little oxidated is obtained; if               be much oxidated

 water added for warning does not render the mixture vellow,
 and will not make turbith mineral.              The author gives the
proportions of the component parts, acid, oxygen and mer
 cury, of the different neutral or acid sulphates, little or very
 much oxidated.-        These results are    a  supplement to his labour
 of 1791 on this kind of mercurial falls.
    Nitrates of mercury furnished him with observations still
 newer and more important for science than the sulphates.
 There are two kinds of nitrates, one much oxidated, and the
 other little oxidated.         The formepis precipitated, of gray           a
 colour, and almost black          by alkalies, and white bv sulphates           ;

 much oxidated, results from long and strong ebullition, gives
 no precipitate    by muriatic acid,    it  gives    yellow one with sul

 phates, a   white one with ammonia, and an orange yellow one
 with fixed alkalies. Nitric solutions of mercury, are often
mixtures of the two salts. That which precipitates                    water by
is   a solution of oxide much oxidated, or red, in concentra
ted acid.     When         nitric solution osmercury, little oxidated,
                   by   a a

which    is   not decomposed.            What     is new in this labour
is,  the comparison of the properties of the nitrite osmercury
with those of the nitrate. Almost all solutions contain more
or less of the former of these salts.        It       is

phuric and nitric acids. It tinges the skin of a dark purple
colour: while nitrate very much oxidated dyes it black, and
nitrate little oxidated, like the nitrite of the lame nature, does
not change the colour of animal matters.         It retains longer
in the open air its nature of nitrite than the alkaline nitrites,
which speedily resume the nature of nitrates. Alkaline ni
trites, and particularly deliquescent nitrites, may be prepared
without difficulty by impregnating the solutions of nitrates,
&c. with nitrous gas, which easily condenses in them.
     The author, to terminate his labour, is to occupy himself
with the muriates of mercury., of which he has discovered a.
new kind, and with the sulphurets of the fame metal.              It
would be a pity that the important and numerous functions
entrusted to him, should oblige him to discontinue these use
ful researches ; but, happily for the interest of science, people
seldom abandon a career which they have long pursued with
 success.
                      On Aluminous Sulphates.
     S. Sesruin, having been employed in continued researches
 on the different states of the sulphates of alumine, read on
 that subject a memoir, in which he proves That the acid
 sulphate of alumine pure, that is to fay when free from those
 substances which it is necessary to add to it in order to make
 it crystallize, does not, in* any cafe, decompose the muriate
 of soda — That alum, the cause of the crystallization of
 which is the sulphate of potash, does not experience decom
 position from the muriate — That alum,          the cause of the
 crystallization   of which  is the sulphate of ammonia,    receives
 no alteration from the muriate of soda, when it contains only
 the quantity of sulphate of ammonia indispensably necessary
 for its crystallization — Finally, that alum, containing more
 sulphate of ammonia than the quantity necessary for its crys
 tallization, is the only salt which experiences alteration by
 the muriate of soda; and that this alteration is confined
 merely to the decomposition of the sulphate of ammonia
  which it contains in excess.
                         A  New Triple Salt.
     There results from the decomposition above mentioned, on
  the one hand muriate of ammonia, and, on the other, a
  triple salt, composed of sulphuric acid, soda and ammonia,
  aud which had not been before remarked.

brication of sal ammoniac : it crystallizes regularly ; does not
effloresce in the air; has a savour, at first pungent, then
slightly bitter ; is decomposed by soda, which transforms it
wholly into sulphate of soda; decrepitates in the fire, swells
up in        it,
           and lusters to be disengaged, first ammonia, and
then acid sulphate of ammonia, while pure sulphate of soda
remains at the bottom of the vessel.

servations on ochry reds similar to those of Almagra in Spain,
and which, in many cases, might be substituted for red
Oxide  of iron or colcothar. He mentioned as very œco-                  a
nomical process, and proper for giving the last polish to the
hardest matters, the use of bits    old hat, which, as 13 well
                                                 Byot
known, are dyed with iron.         immersing these pieces of
hat for some minutes in sulphuric acid, the iron which they
contain passes to the state of red oxide, and they then be
come excellent pieces for polishing, and may be used in the
stead    of    the finest rouge.

    C. Sage communicated to the Class the analysis he made
Of  a  sulphurous ore of uranium, of       blackish brown colour,

that it is more proper to consecrate the names of men who
have enriched them by their discoveries, than those of the fa
bulous deities, and great men who resemble these deities in a
great many points, C. Sage wished that the name of uranium
given to this metal by the Germans, who call the planet dis
covered by Herschel Uranus, might be changed.              In ap
plauding these motives, it will perliaps be found that the
names of celebrated men ought to be assigned to those things
which have been the particular objects of their attention,
and that Klaproth, who discovered this metal, has a greater
right than any other to distinguish it by his name. The
French seem constantly to agree in giving the name of
Herschel to the planet which he brought from that obscurity
under which it had been concealed for so many ages; and,
by the effect of the fame sentiment of justice, the names of
Piazzi   and Olbers will undoubtedly remain to those disco
 vered by these astronomers.
    Zoologists and botanists now consecrate to their masters
and friends the genera or species which they discover j and
mineralogists no doubt will soon follow their example.         The
name of Scheele, so justly celebrated, , has already been substw
tuted for that of tungsten.

                  Artificial Pn' orations in JVax.
    The art of imitating anatomical preparations with wax, of
little use when applied to objects easy to be obtained by dis
section, and which may be daily procured, such as those of
the most visible parts of the human body, becomes import
ant when applied to the representation of things rare or diffi
cult to be obtained, such as the different objects of compa
rative anatomy, or of things accidental         and transient,   as
monstrosities    and uncommon diseases.       In the last place, it
is almost indispensable to make known to pupils certain parts
of such a complex nature, that the demonstrator cannot de
velop the whole in one dissection.
    It is to this last class that we must refer the lymphatic
vessels.    The success of injecting them is so variable ; the
quicksilver employed for that purpose is so inconvenient, in
consequence of the fluidity it retains; in a word, it is so rare
that it can be made to penetrate to the last ramifications of
these vessels, even in one limb, that it is only by repeating
these operations for a long time, and on a great number of
subjects, that it has been possible to become acquainted with
the whole of this vascular system.      Natural pieces, prepared

with the     greatest care and success, soon alter, because the
mercury     aoandons    their upper parts to accumulate itself in
the lower, the vessels of which it dilates and ruptures.
Young anatomists then cannot, without the assistance of the
arts of imitation, acquire elementary notions on this object.
The cafe is the fame in regard to preparations of the nervous
system, though less difficult to be made from bodies, but
which, by desiccation, are soon rendered indistinct, and al
most useless.
     It has long been found that anatomical preparations, exe
cuted in wax, are those which exhibit, in the clearest man
 ner, the qualities of such objects, namely, all their dimen
sions and all their colours; while other imitations, such as
 common sculpture, engraving, and even painting, besides
 <U+2666>hat they are not of a nature so delicate      as thole of wax,
 cannot express, at the fame time, these two orders of qua
 lities.   Hence this method has been exclusively preferred to
 all others, and has been employed to form collections al
 ready celebrated.      But several of them, while they give us
 reason to   admire   the hand of the artist, leave ro< m some
 times for regretting that it was not directed by the anato
 mist familiarised with all the details of dissection.
     The union of these two kinds of talents in the person of
 C. Laumonier, associate of the Institute, has given great
 merit to three pieces which he submitted to the inspection of
 the Class; namely, a lower extremity, in which he has re
 presented the muscles, the superficial veins, the extremities
 of the arteries, and the lymphatic vessels; a head, exhibit
 ing the cranium open, and the brain covered on the one side
 by the dura and pia mater, and uncovered on the other.
 The face and neck are prepared in such a manner, as to (how
 chiefly the facial nerve, the eight pair, and the cervical
 branches. Another head, open at the height of the orbits,
 presents a section of the posterior lobe of the brain, and a
 portion of the cerebellum, cut above its tentorium.         It was
  prepared with a design to exhibit the origin of the great sym -
  pathetic nerve, and more particularly the cavernous ganglion,
  discovered by the author, and described with all its com
  municating branches in the Journal de Vbyjique.
      These pieces, executed by the order of government for the
  School of Medicine,      form a continuation    of others which
  have been deposited there for some years,     and which   are not
  inferior in point of merit.

 Chemical and Medical Experiments          on the Diabetes   Mellitus.
    Life, that physical, mechanical,       and chemical process, so
 complex,   exhibits  in its  aberrations,   as in its perfect accom
plishment, phænomena         which  are  as  much   interesting to the
philosopher   as the  physician.    It  is  under  this double point
of view that C. Nicolas, associate member of the Institute,
and professor of chemistry in the central school of Calvados,
and Dr. Guedevilie, have considered the diabetes mellitus, or
the ptbyfuria
               faccharina.
    The presence of the saccharine matter, which, for a long
time, was found only in the sugar cane (Arundo faccharifera,
Linn.), has, by the labours of modern chemists, been dis
covered not only in many other vegetable substances, such as
the mallow, the juice of the maple, beet-root, &c. but also
in the mineral kingdom, where C. Vauquelin has proved its
existence by his analysis of the emerald and aigue-marine.
Some products of the analysis of milk had stiown an ana
logy between it and sugar.       Dr. Willis remarked, that, in
the morbid affection in question, the first symptom of which
is a superabundant evacuation of urine, this fluid assumed a
sweet saccharine quality, instead of the acrid and pungent
savour which it has in general.
    C. Nicolas and Dr. Guedevilje, in the course of their
practice, having met with patients attacked by diabetes, un
dertook a comparative analvsis of the urine voided in the dia
betic state and in that of health. They ascertained, by care
ful experiments, the existence of the mucous saccharine
matter in the former : they extracted from it acetous acid
and alcohol, while in the second it is not susceptible of fer
mentation, either vinous or acid.
    The memoir of C. Nicolas and Dr Guedevilie, which
may be considert   J  as a complete treatise on the diabetes mel
litus, contains a history os the causes ascribed to this disease,
and the means employed to combat it since the days of Hip
pocrates to the present time; and an exact description of the
symptoms it exhibits at its different stages ; the principal re
sults of their important labour on this disease, observations
of which would be less rare were it not for the negligence of
many physicians, who commit into the hands of quacks and
urine doctors the unfortunate patients attacked by it.
    The principal cause of the diabetes mellitus, which seems
to be most frequent in countries where cyder, or liquors of
that kind, is drunk, is a spasmodic and continual deviation

of   the unanimalized nutritive juices to the urinary organ,
which alters also the gastric, pancreatic, biliary, &c. juices.
It seems to be peculiar to muscular temperaments. Its feat
is placed in the system of digestion ; and the urinary organ,
by the excess of its evacuations, supplies the want of other
excretions and secretions which are suspended.
    The urine which passes, as already said, has the vinous
and acetous fermentation, gives alcohol of a disagreeable
odour, a crystallized sugar, the nature of which is not yet
well known, instead of urce, uric and benzoic acid, which
it ought to contain. Ammoniacal and phosphoric salts show
themselves in it only in very small quantity ; the blood of
phtysuric patients is exceedingly serous, and contains scarcely
any ammoniacal and phosphoric salts.                 These phænomena
furnish the following indications : —
    lst. To remove the spasmodic state.
    ad. To restore to the nutritive juices the principles of ani-
malization.
    And, to accomplisti these ends, to select the food and re
medies from substances which contain azot and phosphoric
salts..
    From these indications C. Nicolas and Dr. Guedeville
have prescribed to the subjects of their different observations,

        Observations    made on the Summit       of Mont-PcrJu.
    The beauty of sites exhibited by mountains, and in parti
 cular the hope of reading on those awful masses the history
 of the revolutions which they seem to have witnessed, or at
 least of their results, continually attract towards their sum
 mits those who have once experienced the charm of these
 mtditations, which might be called antediluvian.
     C. Ramond, whose particular study it has been to make us
 acquainted with the Pyrenees, and particularly Mont- Perdu,
 has confirmed by a new tour, that this mountain overlooks
 all the surrounding peaks.
    * Those who have seen Dr. Rollo's and Mr. Crgick (hank's valuiMe
 works on the Diabetes Mellitu*, will be not a little surprised to find them
 not even quoted in the preceding notice, though they present every one of

                                                                        The

       Olservations made on the Summit    of Mont-Perdu.        281
    The ridge of it consists of beds of black marble, filled with
siliceous nodes, which here and there contain heaps of (hells,
the summit seems to have none of them, but they are found
a little further down.       These beds or banks, which are ge
nerally parallel, follow the principle direction of the chain,
and are subject to flexions more or less considerable on each
side of this direction.      They are almost all vertical, their
mean inclination being about 80° to the south.
    The cap of snow which covers the peak is only about six
feet in thickness,      because the steepness of the lateral decli
vities does not admit of its accumulation ; but, in parts where
the ground is less steep, the thickness of the snow is 40 or 50
feet, and it is more considerable in the valleys, which catch
the snow as it rolls down from the surrounding declivities.
    The summit of Mont-Perdu presented to C. Ramond two
plants of the phanerogamia kind, the Aretia alpina, Linn.,
and the Saxifraga retu/as, Gorian.          Lower down he found
the Cerajlinum alpinum, the Saxifraga grœnlandica, and the
R.inunculus pamajjifolius. He is of opinion that it is not the
height of the peak, but the want of earth proper for vegeta
tion, that renders plants so rare on the summit.            He saw
scarcely any thine; but a few remains blasted by lightning and
buffeted by the winds; and       if,amidst this destruction, occa
 sioned   by the combined action of the most powerful meteors,
a   rock still in its place offered vegetables   a  firm support,   it
                    is by
 was covered        turf and plants in such  a  state of vigour, as
 proves that    it   neither the want of air, nor the lowness of
 temperature, that banishes them from these regions.
     The revolutions which this part of the globe has experi
 enced appeared evidently to C. Ramond, to have been oc
 casioned       the rending of the primitive mass, the salient and
               by
 re-entering angles of which are still    so   entire and so  (harp,
 that he thinks       the cause which disjoined them should ope
                      if
 rate exactly in     contrary direction, they would unite in such
                      a
a   manner, that the joining would be imperceptible.
   These characters, peculiar to the mass of Mont- Perdu, "make
 it,  savs Ramond, like an istand of     a   few leagues in extent,
 raised  by  some revolution on the back of the Pyrenees."

    Dr. Nauche, president of the society, with the senators
 Aboville and Lesp;nasse, has made        curious observation,
                                             a
 which   isof some importance on account of the inferences
 that may be deduced from it.      He has found that      it

 by directing to the nervous trunks, which distribute them
 selves to these organs, or which communicate with them, the
 two extremities of the pile, of the circle of cups or of the gal
 vanic trough. He remarked that, by making the application
 a bath charged with a saline solution, a strong galvanic balb
 may be obtained, the effects of which are mild, and some
times more advantageous than those obtained by other pro
cesses.

     In   the last sitting  of the Galvanic society, M. Robertson
repeated experiments         on the combustion of phosphorus and
metals, by means of a very large pile composed of plates of
copper and zinc.          M. Gantherot announced that platina is
a worse conductor of the galvanic fluid than iron.           Medical
applications were not neglected, and among the useful
results the following were mentioned; The cure of a gutta

     On the 21st of August, the society proposed the following
new prize questions.
     1st.  What are the phænomena observed in regard to
the origin and progress of waves, inlaying the foundations
of piers, at greater or less distances ? What means have
from time to time been discovered, and tried with more or
less advantage      to restrain or to lessen the destructive conse
quences of the course of the waves ? What can be deduced
from these phænomena, for explaining the cause of waves;
and what use can be made of this knowledge, to improve the
means already adopted for subduing the waves, or to render
them more powerful ? — To be answered before the 1st of
March,      1804.
     2d.   What is the reason that the experiments in regard
to the conducting power of bodies for caloric, are so uncer
 tain and often contradictory ? and what is the surest and
 properest method to ascertain the quantity of this conducting
 power both in solid and fluid bodies? — To be answered be
 fore the 1st of March, 1803.
      The prize for each question is a gold medal of the value
 of 30 ducats.       The papers mult be transmitted, post paid,
 under the usual conditions, to the director and first secretary
 of the society, Oliver Christian Eiekma.

  a cancer in her lips, and the gum was affected.           The Eu

this time wisliing to make use of the bag above mentioned,

celebrated Pallas, enriched by the contributions of Linnæus,
and his numerous literary friends.         With the minerals are
several new substances, and the rarest productions of the Si
berian mines. Among the antiquities arc various inscriptions
and bas-reliefs, relative to observations made in the plain of
Troy, and which were announced by M. Chevalier, in France,
in the last edition of his work. The medalic series contains
several coins of Greece, and of the kings of Parthia, hitherto
unknown. The manuscripts are in Hebrew, Coptic, Arabic,
Abyssinian, Persian, Turkish, and the language of Thibet
Tartary: and in the Greek and Latin languages are several
manuscripts of the classics, of the gospels, and the writings
of the earliest fathers of the church.      In addition to these,
the collection contains Greek vases, gems, sculptures, and
many remarkable Egyptian monuments, from the ruins of
the city of Sais, discovered by these travellers in the Delta
after the evacuation of Egypt by the French : also numerous
original drawings, maps, charts, plans, models, and feeds of
many rare and useful plants; the habits, utenlils, idols, of
the inhabitants of the Aleutan isles, brought by Billings to
Russia after his expedition to the countries lying between
Kamtfchalka and the north-west coast of America, with
many geographical observations, the publication of which
was so long withheld by order of the Ruffian government.
    ON    THE APPARENT        ATTRACTION       OF FLOATING
          bodies.    By   a Friend to Physical Inquiries.
    It is a well known fact, that when bodies which are afloat
upon water come within a small distance of each other, they
will suddenly russi together: this sudden approach has usually
been attributed to a mutual attraction of the floating bodies;
and it is common to float two cork balls in a vessel of water,
for the purpose of demonstrating this supposed attraction.
A few years ago the following experiments were made, with
a strong persuasion that the abovementioned circumstance
was not owing to the attraction of the cork balls ; and if any
one who is now of opinion that it is owing to a mutual at
traction of the balls, will make the experiments themselves,
it is probable that they will have doubts on the subject, or
totally alter their opinion.
    1. June 1797. Two cork balls (one larger than the other
considerablyj were floated on water : when brought near
                                                            each

                          Galvanism.
each other, they approached in the usual manner, as if by
some mutual influence.     This was expected.
   2. The larger ball was stuck on a piece of wire, and was
holden near the smaller one, which was floating whilst this
(the larger one) was entirely out of the water. There wa?,
under these circumstances, not any apparent attraction what
ever.
   3. The larger ball on the wire was then totally immersed
in the water, and, though near the other ball, there was not
any apparent attraction.
   4. The ball on the wire was then raised partly above the
surface of the water near the floating ball ; then the small
ball approached, and the usual appearance of attraction took
place.
   The following is offered as an explanation of the above
facts; and is supposed to be the chief, if not entire cause, of
those effects :
   Round each cork ball, when floating on water, may be
seen an elevated circular mass of water, raised probably from
the same cause (whatever that may be) by which water rises
in bread, sugar, &c. : now it appears that when these two
circular masses or rings of water touch each other they unite,
and, by endeavouring to form one mass, carry the two cork
balls with them until they touch.

   On the 20th of November professor Aldini repeated, in
two courses, at Mr- Wilson's anatomical theatre, Great
Windmill- street, formerly that of the celebrated Dr. Hunter,
the   galvanic experiments which he performed before the
French National Institute, and lately at Oxford.      The first
course, destined for the medical students, was opened by
Mr. Wilson, who presented professor Aldini to his pupils,
with some observations on his interesting discoveries.     The
second course, which commenced immediately aster, was
honoured by the presence of his excellency general Andreoffi,
ambassador of the French republic, accompanied by several
gentlemen of his suite; M. Argyropoli, charge d'affaires of
the Ottoman Porte, Sir William Hamilton, Dr. George
Pearson, Dr. Lettsome, and a great many other gentlemen.
Mr. Cuthbertson assisted the professor in arranging the ap
paratus, and Mr. Hutchins, a medical pupil, provided the
anatomical preparations. The experiments were performed
with neatness and precision, and gave much satisfaction to
the spectators, who testified their approbation by loud and
repeated applauses.

J7 ROM some experiments made upon the schieferspath,                                  I
was induced to believe that it consisted of lime combined with
a much greater quantity of carbonic acid than, according to
the analysis of Bergman (Eng. edit. vol. i. p. 32.) is contained
in  carbonated lime.        I refer to his analysis of this substance,

     In   order to ascertain the quantity of water, which, as above
stated,       is
               very considerable,  the following experiments were
made      :
   Exp.      100 grains of pure carbonated
              I.                                lime (double re
fracting spar) were exposed,                  in
                                    silver crucible, to

for about twenty minutes.        On weighing them when cold
they were found to have diminished i*8 grain.           will here          It
after be stiown that    part of this loss was probably water
                                 a                                                    :
yet   aportion of      to be attributed to the disengagement of

carbonic acid; for, upon putting the remaining carbonated
lime into water coloured blue       syrup of violets, the solution
                                                   by
instantly afiumed    deep green colour. Hence
                            a                         appears that    it
this method     not to be relied upon in order to diflipate water

               400 grains of carbonated lime were introduced

    Exp. III. To find the quantity of carbonic acid contained
in carbonated lime, I mg.de use of a vessel nearly similar to
that described in "page 365 of the 13th volume of the Phi
losophical Magazine.
    Into this vessel was put a sufficient quantity of nitric acid
of the specific gravity 1*40, noting at the same time the
aggregate weight of the vial, tube, and acid ; and ico grains
of fragments of carbonated lime were gradually added to the
nitric acid. When the last portions of it were decomposed,
on weighing the vial, &c. it had received an addition of 56
grains.        Hence 44 grains, which were carbonic acid, were
expelled.       On repeating this experiment with quantities of
carbonated lime greater than 100 grains, proportional results
were afforded.
    E.xp. IV. To determine the quantity of lime, ioo grains
of Carbonated lime reduced to powder were put into a platina
crucible, and strongly heated in a wind-furnace for about two
hours : the residuum was pure lime; it weighed 55*9 grains.
Upon repeating this experiment I obtained a residuum weigh
ing 5505 grains. These results differ but little: their mean,
55-475, is therefore assumed vas the quantity of lime con
tained in ico parts of the carbonate.

    In comparing the above with the analysis by Bergman
 there appears a difference of 10 of carbonic acid and nearly
 10-5 of water.          Kirwan, (Mineralogy, vol. i. p. 87.) on
 remarking the difference of the quantities of carbonic acid
obtained by himself and Bergman, supposes the latter em
 ployed sulphuric acid to disengage the carbonic : and this
 conjecture seems well founded; for, if carbonated lime be put
 into sulphuric acid, the sulphate. of lime formed, and falling
 down insoluble, so envelops a part of the carbonated lime
 that the complete action of the sulphuric acid is prevented:
 ami as it does not appear that Bergman obtained the water
 by direct experiment, he seems to have assumed its quantity
    * The experiments there related upon the satin
                                                        spar were repeated ;
 but it did not appear to contain more than the usual proportion of carbonic
 acid.
                                                                       from

from the deficiency occasioned by the incomplete action of
the sulphuric acid.
   Still apprehending' that results so dissimilar might arise
from inaccuracy in the method I had employed, more mi
nute attention was paid to the disengagement of the carbonic
by the stronger acids. The following experiment was insti
tuted to determine the quantity of muriatic acid carried over
by the effervescence it excited. This acid was preferred to
the nitric for two reasons : being very dilute, and its action
consequently increased, the error is shown in its greatest de
gree ; and small quantities of it are much more readily de
tected than of nitric acid.
   Exp. V. 200 grains of fragments of carbonated lime were
put into muriatic acid of specific gravity V17 in the vial al
ready mentioned, having a Woulfe's apparatus so adapted
that the carbonic acid disengaged might pass through water.
After the effervescence had ceased, the vial containing the
muriate of lime was heated in water for nearly an hour, in
order to expel the carbonic acid, which, although disengaged
from the lime, was held in solution by the water of the dilute
muriatic acid. By these means the loss was *6 more than
when nitric acid of 1*40 was used, occasioned by the more
rapid effervescence.
   To the water through which the carbonic acid had passed
nitrate of silver was added, which occasioned the formation
of such a quantity of muriate of silver as, from comparing
the degree of turbidness, was nearly equalled by '6 of mu
riatic acid. The flight dissimilarity evidently resulted from
the evaporation of the water of the muriate of lime by the
heat employed to extricate the last portions of carbonic acid.
   The stronger effervescence which a dilute acid excites, is
not the only inconvenience attending it; the water is capable
of combining with a quantity of carbonic acid, which ren
ders it necessary to employ heat, as in the above-mentioned
experiment, which is totally unnecessary when a concentrate
acid is made use of.
                  Analysis of the Scbieferfpatb.
   Some fragments of schieferspath being put into muriatic
acid, strong effervescence took place, and nearly the. whole
was soon dissolved : the solution was colourless ; a very mi
nute quantity of a finely divided white substance remained
undissolved.   The solution, divided into parts, exhibited with
reagents the following appearances:
   Pruffiate of potash, a blue precipitate.
   Tiucture of galls, a dark brown precipitate.

    Ammonia, a small quantity of reddish brown precipitate*
    Oxalate of ammonia, a copious white precipitate.
    Sulphuric acid arid sulphate of soda both produced plentiful
white precipitates 3 the latter not immediately : the solution,
therefore, contained neither strontia nor barytes.
    Carbonate of potash also occasioned a plentiful white pre
cipitate: upon heating the solution aster filtration no further
deposition took place, as would rTare done had the solution,
contained magnesia.
    The insoluble white residuum was boiled in sulphuric and
aitric acids, but neither of them diflblved any part of it :
 potafli dissolved it entirely : had it been alumina, its state of
 extreme division would have admitted of its easy solution in
 acids : it therefore appears to be silica. The fame appearance
 took place with solution of the schieferspath from Germany.
    From these preliminary experiments it appears that the
 schieferspath is a carbonated lime intermixed with oxide of
 iron and a very small quantity of silica ; so small, indeed,
 that, had it not always appeared in every solution which was
made of the foreign as well as the English, I should have
been induced to suspect that its presence was rather acci
dental, than necessarily entering into the composition of the
mineral.
    Employing the method which has already been mentioned,
 200 grains lost by solution in nitric acid ot 1-40 specific gra
vity 86*8 grs. of carbonic acid, equal to 43*4 per cent. Now,
according to the analysis just given of carbonated lime, 44
parts of carbonic acid are united to 55*475 of timer hence
43 -4 of carbonic acid must be combined with 54*718 of
lime, forming together 98*118 of carbonated lime.
    The nitric solution was considerably diluted with water, in
order to effect more readily the subsidence of the silica ; which
being carefully collected, after repeated washing, and dried in
a glass vessel by the heal of an Argand's lamp, weighed *i of
a grain, equal to '05 per cent.

    2dly, To those of your readers who have visited the tops of
high mountains,       it   unnecessary to describe the effects of the
                           is
diminution of atmospheric pressure.                M. de Saussure,. who
has publiflied an interesting account of his journey up Mount
Slanc, states   it    most forcibly.       He found that the mercury
in his barometer funk to 16 inches and line (17*145 inches
                                                        a
English), and that the air had consequently little more than
half the pressure of that on the plains. In such situations, the
arteries on the surface of the body, deprived of their accus
                                                                        tomed

         Account  of Mr. Smith's Air-pump Vapour-hath.           295
tamed pressure, do    not, as usual, resist the impetus given to
the blood by the      contraction of the heart, which has been
found to occasion     difficulty of respiration, violent retching,
and even vomiting      of blood.
    I  need not tell   you, that the pressure of the atmosphere .
in its mean state is equivalent to a weight of 15 pounds to
every square inch.       It has thence been computed, that the
pressure of the circumambient fluid upon the surface of the
whole earth is equivalent to the weight of a globe of lead 60
miles in diameter.       If every square inch of the human body,
therefore, sustains a pressure of 15 pounds, every square foot
must sustain that of 2160 pounds; and according to this cal
culation, every ordinary sized man has to support a weight of
between 15 and 16 tons for his common load. Such an
enormous pressure, if not counterbalanced by the elasticity of
the air within our bodies, would crush us in a moment.             If
a portion of this pressure be removed from any part of the
body, as is the cafe, for instance, when a leg or arm is en
closed in the cylinder of this Apparatus, and the air partially
extracted, the effect of this unequal pressure soon becomes
perceptible to the patient.       Should the exhaustion be carried
 to its utmost extent, it requires no stretch of imagination to
 conceive the effects that would be produced !
    The quantity of atmospheric pressure on the human body
 sometimes    varies near a whole ton, from natural causes.
 When it is diminished so much, many people, particularly
the nervous, find themselves inactive and irritable.            It is •
 somewhat surprising that the spring of the internal fluid,
 mentioned above, as counterpoising atmospheric pressure,
 should exactly balance it when artificially augmented, and
 even when naturally diminished, but not when artificially
 diminished.     Thus, though we perceive no evident disten
 sion of the blood -vessels on the surface of the body from
 the natural diminution of atmospheric pressure; yet the case
 is widely different when the diminution is artificially pro
 duced, as can be effected to any extent within the cylinder
 of this Apparatus. Thus animals in the receiver of an air-
 pump become immediately uneasy, and can live but a very
  short time in air artificially deprived of no more of its pressure,
 than by the barometer, appeared to take place on the top of
  Mount Blanc.      I am aware that this phænomenon may be
  accounted for on other principles; namely, that a certain
  quantity of oxygen gas diffused through a given space, will not
 ¦sustain animal life half so long as twice the quantity diffused
  through the same space. There may be something in this;
  but, 1 humbly think, it is not sufficient alone to account for
                                  T4                              the

animal.                                                       ,
   What proportion of these consequences is to be attributed
to retarding the impetus of the blood returning to the heart,
and consequently producing an earlier collapse of that organ,
I leave to anatomists and physiologists to determine.
    It was once the fashion among physicians to explain the
functions of the human body by mechanical principles alone ;
to consider it as an hydraulic machine, and its fluids as as
cending and descending by the ordinary powers of such en
gines.     From having applied the laws of dead matter to.lhe
functions of the living body too extensively, they bewildered
themselves, and contradicted each other.           Nevertheless, in
this age of perfected anatomy and improved physiology, we
find Dr. DaTwin, who is said to have done as much for the
latter science as fir Isaac Newton did for natural philosophy,
proposing
             " to still the action of the heart and arteries by
mechanical means."         This, he supposes, may be effected by
suspending a bed so as to whirl the patient round, with his
head nearest the centre of motion.         For this purpose, a per
pendicular shaft might have one end pass into the floor, and
the other into a beam in the ceiling, with a horizontal arm,
to which a small bed might be attached.              The effects of
whirling a patient in this situation, so as by the centrifugal
force to propel' the blood from the superior into the inferior
parts of the body, would rertainly be considerable,         and, he
observes, might probably add to the means of curing fevers.
    Be this as it may, the relief which many persons have ex
 perienced from the use of the Air-pump Vapour-bath, autho
rizes me to affirm, that it is capable of producing, with ease
 and safety to the patient, all the good effects which Dr. Dar
 win could possibly expect from his centrifugal machine.
     It would neither be compatible with my attainments, nor
 your plan, to describe the medical uses of the Air-pump Va-
psur-batb. I (hall therefore barely mention, that it has been
 found extremely beneficial in a variety of diseases specified in
 a treatise lately publistied, intitled, " Facts and Observations
 respecting the Use of Smith's Air-pump Vapour-bath               in
 Gout, Rheumatil"m,Palsy, Stc. &c."
     Lastly, It only remains that I offer you some explanation
 of the mechanical principles of the Apparatus, according to
 the refereuces on the annexed plate.

     The construction of the machine just described, is adapted
 to the leg or arm only.        Its principle, however, may be ex
  tended, and one might be made to include a greater portion
  of the body. Such an attempt is making. One of the most
  obvious consequences of its application must be, a temporary
  expansion of the vessels of the part from whence so great a
  pressure is removed.       This must powerfully assist nature in
  removing    obstructions   formed in them, which often speedily
  produce    inflammation,      and terminate in suppuration and
 abscess.
    Dr. Hamilton, of the London Dispensary, has observed,
 that the mode in which it must act is agreeable to found the
 ory, and that the more it is applied to practice, the oftener
 will facts occur to recommend it. That eminent physician

         only views it as valuable to remove local affections of
 the extremities, but also to afford relief in other parts of the
 bodv, where obstructions may have taken place."           In the
 fame letter he observes, that " the machine, by having a
 condensing pump fixed to      it,

 done merely      reversing the valves in the pump.

XL VII.      Memoir    on tbe Supply and Application of the    Blow-
     pipe.    By Mr.     Robert Hare jun.           Member     of tbe
     Chemical Society of Philadelphia.
                         [Concluded from p. 245.]
The           hydrostatic blow-pipe may be filled with any of
the gases, by exhausting them from the inverted jars of the
pneumato-chemical apparatus : and if it be desired to confine
different species of gas, by closing the cock of communica
tion between the compartments, one of them may be filled
with one kind of gas, and afterwards, by turning the hood,
the other compartment may be filled with another kind. To
make this understood, let a, fig. 5, be a pneumato-chemical
tub, with a (helf c, and an inverted glass jar b. Suppose
that the tub were silled with water, and the jar with gas.
Lute the pipe J, fig. 1, to the mouth of the suction-pipe at I;
pass the syphon L under the jar, as may be observed in fig. 5,
and then extend the bellows. The bellows will become filled
with the air of the jar ; and this being discharged into that
compartment of the calk which is over the open fide of the
hood, the bellows will be ready for another extension ; the
repetition of which would soon exhaust the jar of its air, al
though it should be of the largest size.
     This method of filling the machine is very convenient in
a laboratory well supplied with pneumato-chemical apparatus.
But it is a principal convenience of the hydrostatic blow-pipe,
that it may be filled with any gas, immediately from the re
tort, bottle, or matrass, made use of in obtaining it. Let D,
 fig. 6, be a separate representation        of the pipe D, fig. 1.
Let B be a matrass containing the substance from which the
 air is to be obtained, and let C be a syphon luted to the neck
 of the matrass. The air issuing from the matrass must be
 emitted from the mouth of the svphon at the lower end of
 the pipe D.       Suppose that this pipe were in its proper situa
 tion at D, fig. 1, the air issuing from the matrass would be
   ,                                                       discharged

                     application     of the Blow-pipe.                599
discharged     into that compartment of the cask under which
the mouth of the syphon should be placed, and if the cock
at Y should be closed, this compartment alone would become
filled ; but if this cock should be open, the air would divide
itself equally between both compartments.               It must be ob
vious, that while one matrass and syphon are employed in
filling one compartment with one species of air, the bellows,
or another matrass and syphon silled with different substances,
may be employed in filling the other compartment w'ith an
other species of air; ana thus the oxygen, and hydrogen
gases or oxysren gas, and atmospheric air, may at the fame
time be confined in the sarne vessel without their mixing with
each other.
    Those who desire to experiment largely with oxygen gas
will find it advantageous to make use of a cast iron matrass,
with a short and large neck narrowing inwards, and about
fifteen inches of a gun barrel. The neck of the matrass being
made large and stiort, it will not only be easily silled, but will
be readily freed from any caput mortuum which may be left
in it. The gun-barrel must be ground to fit the neck of the
matrass.
    The syphon for conveying the gas into the cask may be
fitted to the gun-barrel with a cork.
     The philosophical world has been for some time acquainted
 with the intense heat produced by combustion supported with
 oxygen gas.        By means of the hydrostatic blow-pipe, every
 artist may,     with   little trouble and expense, avail himself of
 the intense     heat  produced by this combustion *.
     Probably there are not at present many operations in the
 arts which require greater heat than may be produced by the
 ordinary means ; but it is certain that the knowledge of a
 process cannot precede an acquaintance with the heat neces
 sary to effect it; and this most intense fire being placed
 within the reach of the artist, it is highly probable that cafes
 may be discovered in which it may De applied with conve
 nience and utility.
     The most convenient way of making use of oxygen gas for
 small operations, is to supply one of the compartments of the
 hydrostatic blow-pipe with that gas; to retain the gas thus
 confined for those moments when the greatest heat is re
quired; and, by means of the other compartment, to make
    * In  1 former page    I mentioned the gasometer of Lavoisier as being
 too complicated for ordinary application to the supply of oxygen gis.    I
 should al'o have noticed the apparatus of Sadler and the gasometer of
 Seguin ; but, if I am not mistaken, these, although vci) ingenious inven
 tions, are liable to the fame objection.
                                                                       use

   300                   Memoir    on the  Supply and
   use   of atmospheric air when the           heat produced       by it i$
   sufficiently intense.       It must be obvious, if the conical
   mouths, 0,o, of the pipes M, N, O, m,n, o, fig. r, be fur-
  tiished with straight mouth-pieces, that any lamp or candle
   placed on the stand TV may be readily shifted from one
  mouth-piece to the other, when it shall be desired to expose
  any subject successively to the heat produced by atmospheric
  air and oxygen gas.
       If it be wished to make use of the heat produced in the.
  combustion of charcoal with oxygen gas; after having con
  fined a sufficient quantity of this gas, it will be necessary to
  fix in the conical mouth of the pipe, communicating with
  the compartment containing the gas, the larger end of a
  common brass blow-pipe, the orifice being directed down
  wards.      Under this orifice the body to be acted on must be
  placed, supported by a piece of charcoal, in the form of a
  parallelopiped, the charcoal being ignited in the part conti
 guous to the body. Things being thus arranged, by turn
 ing more or less the cock ofthe pipe in which the blow-pipe
  shall be fixed, a stream of oxygen may be precipitated on the
 burning spot, with the proper degree of rapidity *.
      This method of supporting the combustion of carbon with
 oxygen gas is nearly the fame as that by which the celebrated
 Lavoisier performed his experiments ; excepting that in the
 place of the hydrostatic blow-pipe he made use of his gaso
 meter.
      In the introduction to this paper it was mentioned that
 some experiments had been performed which seemed to in
 validate the opinion that the employment of larger quantities
 of oxygen gas would be the only means of increasing the
 power of caloric. I shall proceed to give an account of these
 experiments, but will first retrace the ideas which led to them.
     In operating with the combustion of carbon and oxygen
 gas, great evils were observed to result from the difficulty of
 placing the subject of the operation in the focus of the heat,
 without interrupting the stream of air by which this heat was
 supported.      Not only was the focus widened by this interrup
 tion, and the intenleness of the heat thereby lessened ; but
 the stream of air oxidated those substances which were com
bustible, and cooled those which were otherwise, in the places
where it impinged previously to its union with the charcoal.
    * In detailing the uses of the hydrostatic blow-pipe, it may be proper
to mention the facility which it gives to the employment of the gales for
medical purposes.     When this machine is silled with anjr gas, the bag to
be made use of in respiring it may be inflated by fixing it to the mouth of
the pipe as delivery cumir.unkating   with the gas.
                                                                    Added

                  Application of the Blow-pipe.                30 J
Added to this, the charcoal was so rapidly consumed, that the
substance adted on became so much buried, that it was diffi
cult to follow it with the eye, or the orifice of the pipe : and
some substances were observed to run into the pores of the
coal, and elude examination.
    To avoid these evils, it was thought desirable that meant
might be discovered of clothing the upper surface of any body
which might be subjected to this species of operation with
some burning matter, of which the heat might be equal to
that of the incandescent carbon, with which the lower iurface
might be in contact ; or by which bodies might be exposed
on solid supports to a temperature equal or iuperior to that
of the porous charcoal uniting with oxygen.
    It soon occurred that these desiderata might be attained by
means of flame supported by the hydrogen and oxygen gases ;
for it was conceived that, according to the admirable theory
of the French chemists, more caloric ought to be extricated
by this than by any other combustion.
    By the union of the bases of the hydrogen and oxygen
gases, not only is all the caloric of the oxygen gas evolved,
But also a much larger quantity, which must be necessary to
give the particles of the hydrogen their superior power of re
pulsion. The producl of this combustion is water in the state
of steam, which retains heat so slightly, that it acts merely as
a vehicle to deliver it to other bodies.      What is necessary to
preserve   to  water its form  of  fluidity, is the only portion of
the caloric extricated in this combustion, which is perma
nently abstracted.
    The combustion of carbon with oxygen gas has been
hitherto considered as the hottest of all fires.        The caloric
evolved in this cafe proceeds from ihe oxygen gas alone,
 while the product of this combustion is carbonic acid gas,
 which abstracts the large quantity of caloric, necessary to give
 it the form of permanent air, but which adds nothing to the
 heat of the combustion.      Hence it is evident, that more ca
 loric is evolved, and less abstracted, in combustion supported
 by the hydrogen and oxygen gases, than in that supported by
 oxygen gas and carbon.
     However, the intenseness of the heat of combustion is not
 only dependent on the quantity of caloric extricated, but also
 on the comparative smallness of the time and space in which
 the extrication is accomplished.          But in this respect the
 aeriform combustible has obviously the advantage over those
 which are solid, as its fluid and elastic properties render it
susceptible of being rapidly precipitated into the focus of
                                                       combustion,

$0X                Memoir on the Supply and
combustion, and of the most speedy mixture with the oxi
dating principle when arrived there.
    The opinion of the intenseness of the heat produced by the
hydrogen and oxygen gases thus upheld by theory, derives
additional support from the practical observation of the great
beat of a flame supported by hydrogen gas while issuing from
a pipe ; and also of the violent explosion which takes place
when it is mixed with oxygen gas and ignited; for it appears
that this explosion can only be attributed to the combination
of an immense quantity of caloric with the water which is
either held in solution by these gases, or formed by the union
of their bases.
    Such was the reasoning which originated the desire of em
ploying the flame of the hydrogen and oxygen gases. But
before this could be accomplished it was necessary to over
come the difficulty of igniting a mixture of these aeriform
substances without the danger of an explosion.        It was for
the purpose of surmounting this difficulty that the hydrostatic
blow-pipe was furnistied with two compartments, by means
of which the machine might be at the fame time charged
with different species of air, without any possibility of mix
ture. One of these compartments being supplied with oxy
gen and the other with hydrogen gas, two common brass
blow-pipes a, b, fig. 8, were joined at their orifices to two
tubular holes in the conical frustum of pure silver c, of which
the mean diameter is one-third, and the length is three-
fourths of an inch. The diameter of one of these holes is
large enough for the admission of a common brass pin. The
other hole is a third less. They commence separately on the
upper surface of the silver frustum near the circumference,
and converge so as to meet in a point at the distance of a line
and a half from the lower surface.       In the space between
the lower surface and the point of meeting, there is a per
foration of the fame diameter as the larger hole. The man
ner in which this perforation and the tubular holes commu
nicate one with the other, may be understood from the lines
in the form of the letter Y, in the transparent representation
of the silver conical frustum at d. The pipes ab were then
fitted into the mouths O, o, of the pipes of delivery, fig. i ;
so that the blow-pipe inserted into the larger hole of the frus
tum fliould communicate with Uie compartment containing
the hydrogen gas, and that the other mould communicate
with that which contained the oxygen gas. The cock of the
pipe communicating with the hydrogen gas was then turned
until as much was emitted from the orifice of the cylinder

was then turned, until the light and heat appeared to have
attained the greatest intensity.          When this took place, the
eyes   could  scarcely    sustain the  one, nor could the most refrac
tory   substances    resist the  other.
    However, it is worthy of notice that the light and heat of
this combustion do not become evident until some body is
exposed to        it,from which the light may be reflected, or on.
 which the effect of the heat may he visible. This             not the

  It    isin this different appearance of these different species
 of combustion that we may discover the reason why philoso
 phers have neglected the one, while they have bestowed much
 attention on the other *.
     In lieu of the conical frustum represented at cd, that at
 de may be used. The tubular holes of this last-mentioned
 frustum do not meet, but deliver their air, at separate orifices,
  into an excavation in the lower part of the frustum.             The
  dotted lines represent the tubular holes, and the arched line
  the excavation.        This   is about three lines in diameter, and
  enters into the silver about the fame distance.

 colour of the light extricated do not seem to be so much dependent on the
 quantity of oxvgen gas consumed, as on the nature of the substances heated
 or burned.     In this, therefore, we may find support for the idea, that the

     I (hall now describe the changes effected on the most fixed
 and refractory substances by the flame of the hydrogen and
 oxygen gases.
     In order to avoid 3 tedious recurrence to an awkward
 phrase, I shall generally, in the subsequent part of this paper,
 distinguish the flame of the hydrogen and oxygen gases by
 the appellation of gaseous jiame.
     By exposure to the gaseous flame, either on supports of
 silver or of carbon, barytes, alumine, and silex, were com
 pletely fused.
     The products of the fusion of alumine and silex were sub
 stances ver}' similar to each other, and much resembling white
 enamel.
     The result of the fusion of barytes was a substance of an
 ash-coloured cast, which after long exposure sometimes ex
hibited brilliant yellow specks.      If it be certain that barytes
 is an earth, these specks must have been discoloured particles
of the silver support, or of the pipes from which the flame
issued.
     Lime and magnesia are extremely difficult to fuse, not only
because they are the most refractory substances in nature, but
from the difficulty of preventing them from being blown on
one side by the flame : nevertheless, in some instances by ex
posure on carbon to the gaseous flame, small portions of these
earths were converted into black vitreous masses. Poflibly
the black colour of <hese products of fusion mav have been
caused by iron contained in the coal ; for in the high tem
perature of the gaseous flame, a powerful attraction is reci
procally exerted by iron and the earths.
     Platina was fused, by exposure on carbon, to the combus
tion of hvdrogen gas and atmospheric air. But the fusion of
this metal was rapidly accomplistied by the gaseous flame,
either when exposed to it on carbon or upon metallic sup
ports.
    A   small quantity of this metal in its native granular form,
being llrewed in a silver spoon, and passed under the gaseous
flame, the track of the flame became marked by th» con
glutination of the metal ; and, when the heat was for some
time continued on a small space, a lump of fused platina be
came immediately formed.
    About two penny-weights of the native grains of platina,
                                                              when

                   Application   of the  Blow-pipe.              305
When     subjected   to  the  gaseous   flame on carbon,     became
quickly fused into an oblate spheroid as fluid as mercury.
This spheroid, after being cooled, was exposed as before, ft
became fluid in less than the fourth of a minute.
    Had I sufficient confidence in my own judgment, I should
declare, that gold, silver, and platina, were thrown into a
state of ebullition by exposure on carbon to the gaseous flame;
for the pieces of charcoal on which they were exposed became
washed or gilt with detached particles of metal in the parts
adjoining the spots where the exposure took place. Some of
the particles of the metal thus detached exhibited symptoms
of oxidation.
    As the fusion of lime and magnesia by exposure on carbon
was accomplished with great difficulty and uncertainty, it
became desirable that means might be discovered of effecting
this fusion with greater ease.
    By the union of the base of oxygen with iron, the whole
of the caloric of this elastic fluid is supposed to be extricated.
This consideration, together with sonre practical remarks on
 the heat of burning iron, induced me to employ the com
 bustion of this metal in conjunction with that of the hy
 drogen and oxygen gases.
     Some pieces of iron wire, each of about half an inch in
 length, were quickly thrown into fusion and rapid combus
 tion by exposure on carbon to the gaseous flame. When
 either lime, magnesia, barytes, aiumine, or silex, were thrown
 on the iron in this state, they became instantlv melted and
 incorporated with the metal.        It remains a queilion whether
 in this cafe the earths were fused or dissolved, and whether
 the substances which resulted from their union with the iron
 were mixtures or combinations.           If they were combinations,
  according   to the  present nomenclature,      they should be deno
 minated ferrurets.
     The difficulty of igniting some substances which are only
  susceptible of combustion at very high degrees of heat, has
  hitherto excluded them from the laboratory.            By means of
  the gaseous flame, such substances may be employed with
  the greatest facility in small analytical operations.
     Of the na'ure of the substances above described are the
  carburets of iron and some peculiar species of native coal.
     Among the carburets of iron, the English plumbago is
  esteemed the best.       Some pieces of this substance, obtained
  from the best English black-lead pencils, were readily thrown
 Into combustion by exposure to the gaseous flame, either on
  carbon or on some larger pieces of American plumbago.              It
  was found that either lime or magnesia was fusible when

exposed to the fire thus produced.   This, however, may have
been caused by the iron contained in the carburet ; for the
fused earths and plumbago generally adhered to each other.
   There is a peculiar species of native coal found on the
banks of the L'ehigh in this state, which it is extremely dif
ficult to ignite ; but when exposed to a high degree of heat,
and a copious blast of air, it burns, yielding an intense heat
without either smoke or flame, and leavinglittle residue. By
exposure to the gaseous flame on this coal, both magnesia and
lime exhibited strong symptoms of fusion.      The former as
sumed    a glazed and somewhat globular appearance.        The
latter became converted into a brownish semivitreous mass.
   The heat of the gaseous flame 13 very much dependent on
the proportional quantities of the gases emitted. On this
account, the perforations in the keys of the cocks N, n,
fig. 1st, should be narrow and oblong, to admit of a more
 gradual increase or diminution in the quantity of gas emitted.
    I have now concluded my communications on the subject
of this paper, and shall be happy if they have been found
worthy of the time and attention bestowed on them by the
society.

      other dioptric Property          of that Mineral          Substance. By C. P.
      TorElli dbNarci,                      attached    to   the Council of Mines.* .
JLvOUBLE refraction, that singular property of rock crys
talt, and of several other minerals, has long engaged the at
tention of mineralogists and philosophers, though they em
ployed it in no other manner than as a distinguishing cha
 racter.   C. Haiiy says     " It would be difficult to find a
                                   J:
 more striking character than that deduced from double re
 fraction, since it depends on the essence of the minerals in
 which it exists."
    C. Rochon is the first philosopher who employed this pro
 perty of rock crystal to measure small angles ; and he read on
 the 26th of January and 9th of April 1777, to the Academy
.of Sciences, two memoirs on the application he made of                                   it,
 and the exact results he obtained.     This discovery must be
 of the greatest utility,   means should be found to construct

ft within the reach of those who might have occasion to mea
sure angles with it.
      Adesire to accomplish this object induced me to undertake
some researches in regard to the cutting of rock crystal, and
experiments on its double refraction, founded on those made
by Beccaria and Rochon.        With rock crystal alone I formed
iriediums doufly refringent.    This is the name which Rochon
gives to these instruments cut cylindrically and composed of
two or three prisms of this substance, which are perfectly
achromatic, and produce very strong double refraction.                I
constructed    one with three prisms, 111 which the angle of
double refraction is one degree eight minutes: and I find
 that larger may still be obtained.
    I mail not here indicate the direction in which cut my       I
different prisms of rock crystal in order to obtain the maximum
of double refraction, because I have still some experiments to
 terminate before I can acquire a thorough knowledge of them.
Among those which I cut for my experiments, there is one
Which produces effects so singular that I think it my duty to
 describe it.
    This prism, the section of which is an isosceles triangle,
 has one of its angles obtuse, and of more than 100 degrees.
 When one looks through the two faces which form the ob
 tuse angle, and in a direction parallel to the face opposite to
it,  the object appears neither displaced nor sensibly coloured,
 but only inverted in such a   manner, that what       on the right
                                                        is

on the right below the vertical one, appears to be situated on
the left. By continuing to look at this letter,       the prism be

galleries.
     I
     shall conclude this note with a succinct account of some
experiments which I made with the isosceles prism of rock
crystal already mentioned.      By applying it to a simple ca
mera obscura, the objects painted in an inverted position, when
this prism is hot used, are made to appear in their proper
situation. By adapting it to astronomical telescopes, the fame
effect will be produced in rejjard to objects, which, when seen
through the two convex glaflesthatcompose                     it,
                                                 appear inverted.
   This prism supplies the means of shortening telescopes de
stined to view terrestrial objects, because,        employing       by            it
with     aconvex eye-glass only, and an object-glass simple or
achromatic, instead of three, four, or five eye-glasses, objects
which without its interposition wouhl have appeared inverted,
will be seen in their proper position. By these means, one,
two, three, or even four eye-glasses would be saved, and the
telescope might be sliortened Dy nearly the whole length oc
cupied,      by
             these eye-glasses.  Light also will be gained; for
this prism occasions no loss in this respect, the matter of
which         formed being exceedingly transparent
             it   is                                   nor will               ;
any thing be lost in regard to distinctness  for, as the prism

is very near the eye, the faults which might arise from any
inexactness in the polisliing of its two surfaces will not be
sensible.
     In employing this                 must be remembered, that

it, he will appear in the telescope as          going from left to

  XLIX.     Preparation      of      the Phosphuret          of Lime.    By
                       J.   B.   Van Mons *.
PhOSPHURET            of lime affords to the amateurs of amusing
chemistry  a curious  compound, on account of the property it
has of disengaging, when a few bits of it are thrown into
water, a quantity of gaseous bubbles, which, on reaching
the surface of that liquid, inflame spontaneously with a beau
tiful white flame, and give rise to successive detonations,
which may be compared to a running fire of musketry. But
the preparation of this phosphuret is often unattended with
success on account of the air, which, by following the usual
process, cannot be excluded from the vessels, and which ox
idates and even acidifies the phosphorus ; in which cafe, the
combustible losing its action on the water, no detonating gas
is engendered ; and the correction, by which the inconve
nience of oxidation is avoided, by putting the phosphorus at
the bottom of the vessel, and the lime at the top, does not
give a homogeneous product, but a saturated phosphuret, by
the vaporization of the phosphuret, which brings it to a state
improper for uniting itself with the lime.        These different
obstacles may be avoided by proceeding in the following
manner:
   Fill a small glass matrass, with a flat bottom and a long
narrow neck, two-thirds, with one part of carbonated lime
(white marble, washed chalk, or prepared oyster- shells).
Place the matrass in a sand-bath, and apply a heat capable
of expelling the carbonic acid from the lime. When you
think that the decarbonization is near an end, introduce in
portions a third part of phosphorus, at very small intervals,
and constantly maintaining the matter at a dark red heat.
The phosphorus fused, and prevented from burning by a re
mainder of carbonic acid gas which is disengaged from the
lime, diffuses itself throughout the whole mass of the mat

present   an even surface ; for they break irregularly, and be
come divided at the point of fracture into very minute spi-
culæ, which also assume a somewhat rectangular shape.
    The small spiculæ or fibres are transparent and colourless,
with a considerable degree of lustre; but the unbroken part
of the stone possesses less lustre than the separate spiculæ, and
much less transparency, from a want of compactness, and
from the effect of many minute cracks.
    Its hardness is not easily determined, on account of brittle-
ness ; but when a piece of it is rubbed against glass, though
the fibres crumble down very quickly, yet the glass is slightly
scratched at the same time.        Small fragments of it can be
broken with the fingers, or crushed by pressure, into very
slender spiculæ, which are sharp, and apt lo penetrate the
hands when touched.        Although the cohesion of its compo
nent parts be so weak, yet it bends, and yields in some mea
sure before it breaks, and is not easily ground to powder in
a mortar.
    I found the specific gravity of different pieces of the speci
men, taken in distilled water at the temperature of 6o°, to
vary from 2 643 to 2*740.
    This stone has the property of appearing luminous in a
dark place, both by friction and by heat.        A very flight de
gree of friction produces this effect ; for a person can easily
distinguish a phosphoric light, even if he draws his singer
across it.   When struck with a hammer in such a manner
that small fragments are driven off, they appear luminous in
pasting through the air, and continue to shine for a moment
after falling on the ground ; and a hard body drawn over it
leaves a track of light, which remains a second or two visible.
When a piece of the stone is pounded quickly in a mortar, a
strong light is emitted; but after being wholly reduced to
powder, it no longer shines.
    The light which it gives by flight friction, is fully equal to
that produced by two quartz pebbles rubbed or struck against
each other strongly.
    Small fragments of this zeolite placed on a piece of hot
iron or of clay, also become luminous, and shine with nearly
as much brightness as common blue fiuor does, when heated
in the fame manner. By being made red-hot, however, it
 is deprived of the property of giving light afterwards by heat,
 though it still, appears faintly luminous by fiction.       In all
 these experiments it is a reddish white lights which it emits,
 accompanied at times with reddish momentary kind of flashes.
     It can be melted without difficulty into glass. When a
                                U4                            small

jll                         Chemical Analyjis of
small piece of it is heated gradually with the blow-pipe, it
first becomes white and opaque ; a number of fissures are then
formed, by which its bulk appears somewhat increased; and,
after the flame is made sufficiently intense, it melts into a glo
bule of colourless glass, the transparency of which is imperfect
on account of many minute air-bubbles. -Although thus
fusible by strong heat, yet a very low degree of ignition
scarcely affects it. A piece of the stone, after having been put
into a crucible, and exposed for a short time to a fire which
made it just visibly red-hot, was not altered in appearance,
and had not lost more than i-J^th part of its weight.                      In a
temperature,      however,     about   20°  ot   Wedgwood,        I found   that
a fragment      of  this   zeolite   became     opaque,     and  more   easy to
pulverize     than  in  its  natural  state ;   at  90° it  did not   melt,  but
was glazed op ihe surface, adhered to the crucible, and had
begun to sink down ; and at 120° melted into an imperfect
glass of a light greenish yellow colour, deficient in trans
parency, which acted strongly on the erucible.
     In temperatures sufficiently high, it loses from 4J to 5
per cent, of its weight; but to produce this effect, the heat
must be equal at least to 200 or 25" of Wedgwood.                       Part of
the    volatile matter     thus   driven   off,  is  carbonic   acid;   for the
 zeolite, when reduced to pqwder, and mixed with acids, pro
 duces a slight effervescence.           1 found, by three different ex
 periments,     that  the   loss of  weight     after the effervescence was
 about 3 per     cent.;    consequently,     the    remaining 2 or 2! parts
may      be presumed     to  consist  of  moisture.
      This substance produces a jelly, as most other zeolites do,
 with the stronger acids. When ground to powder, and mixed
 with the sulphuric, nitric, or muriatic acid, the mixture be
 comes a firm jelly in a few minutes, provided the acids are
 hot much diluted, or used in too great quantity. That which
 is formed by the action of t.he nitric or the muriatic acid, is
 nearly transparent ; but the stone contains so much lime, as
 yvill presently be shown, that with the sulphuric the- jelly is
 white and opaque, on account ot the sulphate of lime which
 is generated.
      The prehnite in which it was inclosed, as already men
 tioned, is of a light green colour, with some lustre, and
 & considerable      degree of transparency.               It gives fire with
 steel, can be readily melted with the blow-pipe, and froths
 up much before fusion.
      Having made these preliminary experiments respecting the
 general properties of the zeolite, I subjected a portion of it, in
  the next place, to analysis, to ascertain of what earths it was

were the methods by which it was analysed:
     1. One hundred grains, reduced to fine powder in a mortar
of flint, were mixed with 500 grains of muriatic acid and
1000 grains of distilled water. The powder was immediately
attacked by the acid ; some heat and momentary efferves
 cence were produced, and in a few minutes the filex appeared
 floating in a loose and very divided state. The mixture being
 heated on a sand-bath, became in a short time a thin trans
 parent jelly.     I exposed this jelly to a gentle heat (less than
 2000 of Fahrenheit) till it became nearly dry.              Water was
 then poured on        it,
                         and the mixture, after being digested for
 some time, was filtered.         The undisiblved part collected on
 the filter, when sufficiently washed, was dried and heated
 red-hot for  a    quarter of an hour.                It
                                                   weighed 51 grains,

 poration a white salt remained, which was heated e;raduaHjr
 in   a crucible to volatilize the muriate of ammonia formed in
 the course of the analysis.           When white vapours ceased to
 rife, the heat was increased to redness, and a salt was left
 which weighed 17 grains. On redissolving it in a small quan
tity of water, and boiling the solution with carbonate 01 am
monia, a minute portion of carbonate of lime was precipi
tated, which weighed one grain; equal to about half a grain
of pure lime. Iobtained the salt by a second evaporation;
 and after it had been exposed again to a very low red heat, it
 weighed 16 grains, and consisted wholly of muriate of soda.
     According to Mr. Kirwan's experiments, 16 parts of mu
riate of soda in crystals contain 8*5 parts of soda ; but the 16
parts above mentioned, by having been dried in a red heat,
and consequently freed from water of crystallization, would
contain somewhat more than 8*5 parts of soda. However,
the proportion of soda in 100 parts of the zeolite may be
fiated at 8\5 parts, which, though probably rather less than
the real quantity, must be very nearly correct.
     Having finished the experiments just described, I analysed
the zeolite a second time ; and made use of nitric acid, for
the purpose of ascertaining whether any muriatic acid en
tered into its composition.          By the test of nitrate of silver, I
found that some traces of the muriatic acid could be distin
guished, although the quantity was very small. With regard
to the proportion of the earths, the results of the second
analysis corresponded almost exactly with the former.
     I also exposed some of the zeolite to the action of the sul
phuric acid in the following manner, with the view of ob
taining the soda only, the earths being disregarded.                     One
hundred grains *, reduced to fine powder in the flint mortar,
were mixed with 250 grains of sulphuric acid, diluted with
twice its weight of water.           Some heat and very slight effer
vescence were produced, and the mixture soon became thick
and gelatinous.        It was then evaporated slowly to dryness in
a sand-bath in a cup of Chinese porcelain ; and the dry mass
was pulverized and boiled for half an hour with water, and
filtered. Having washed the undissolved residuum sufficiently,
I   boiled the filtered solution with carbonate of ammonia,
which precipitated some earthy matter. After this had been
separated by filtration, the solution was evaporated to dryness
    •  I made use of small quantities only of the zeolite in all theft experi
ments;    because, as the specimen appears to be the only one of the kind
which has been found, I wished to preserve as much of it entire as pos
sible.
                                                                           by

ky  a gentle heat ; and the saline mass left was put into a cru
cible, and heated slowly to redness.         A white salt remained
in the crucible, which weighed 19 grains. To free this salt
from any remains of earthy salts which might be mixed with
it,
 I    dissolved     init  small quantity of water, added some car
                               a
bonate of ammonia, and boiled the mixture for               few mi           a
nutes,      by
            which means        flight earthy precipitate was thrown
                                      a
down.      This being separated as before, the salt was again
collected        by
                 evaporation, and heated to redness.            now               It
weighed 17 grains, and was found on examination

   By Mr, Kirwan's estimation, 17A parts of dry sulphate of
soda contain nearly eight parts of alkali        consequently, from
                                                               ;
 loo parts  of  the  zeolite there   have been obtained     the pro          by
cess last described eight parts of soda. -This result corre
sponds with the former, in which the alkali was collected in
the state of muriate of soda, as nearly as can be expected in
such experiments        and;     must be remembered, that the pro

  gravity than this stone, are more infusible, and are consider
  ably different in their composition *. Besides, such kinds of
  tremolite as I have examined cannot be decomposed by acids
  even when boiling, and must be heated with potash or soda
  before their component parts can be separated ; but the sub
  stance in question is completely decomposed by acids, like
  the greater number of zeolites, in a verv few minutes, and
  without the assistance of heat. For these reasons it appears
  to me to be a zeolite.

      Metals and Earths en the Colouring Matter of              Cochineal,
      By M. Hermstaedt f.
     X  O  prepare the cochineal for these experiments, two ounces
of Mexican cochineal of           the first quality, being reduced to
 fine powder, were boiled in a tin bason with 74 ounces of
 distilled water.      The liquor was then filtered and measured :
it had lost two ounces by evaporation. It was then divided
into portions of %\ ounces for each experiment.
      A piece  of kerseymere dipped in this tincture when taken
out was of     a lilac colour.
      Exp. I. A saturated solution of very pure cobalt in nitric
acid was dropped into a portion of the tincture of cochineal.
The tincture became very clear, assumed a yellowish red co
lour, but remained diaphanous.                After twelve hours there
was deposited a precipitate of a sulphur-red colour; which,
however, was in such small quantity that it was impossible to
collect it.
      Exp. II. Part of the solution of cobalt in nitric acid was
   '
diluted with water heated to ebullition in a glass vessel, and
kept boiling for three minutes, with a piece of kerseymere
34 inches square. The kerscvmere thus prepared being then
immersed in the warm tintture of cochineal, immediately
assumed a saturated bright red colour, leaving the tincture

a bright morJore colour.
   Exp. HI. A neutral solution of cobalt, in sulphuric acid
was added to the tincture of cochineal. The tincture assumed
a darker colour, and a violet precipitate was deposited.         A
piece of stuff impregnated with this solution of cobalt, and
then dipped in tincture of cochineal, acquired a saturated
violet colour.
    Exp. IV. A neutral sulphuric solution of uranium gave
with tincture of cochineal a precipitate almost black; bat
when a piece of stuff was dipped in the fame solution, and
then dyed with tincture of cochineal, it assumed a very agree
able grayish colour inclining to green.
    Exp. V. A solution of cobalt in nitric acid, treated in the
same manner, gave the same results; but with this differ
ence, that the colour on the stuff was a little brighter.
    Exp. VI. Fifteen grains of tungstic acid were put into a
glass vessel, and fix ounces of distilled water being poured
over it, the whole was reduced         by
                                     evaporation to four ounces.
The solution assumed       a turbid aspect, and     ablueisti white
colour.    A part of this solution being poured into tincture
of cochineal, communicated to          itbright violet colour.
                                            a                     A
piece of kerseymere,     being boiled for three minutes in this
solution, was immersed in the warm tincture of cochineal           :
when taken out        was of
                     it        bright ponceau (poppy) colour.
                               a
    Exp. VII. Fifteen»grains of concrete molybdtc acid were
dissolved in water as above.           It
                                       dissolved entirely, and the
solution became clear and transparent.         Being dropped into
the tincture of cochineal,     a dark violet precipitate was ob
tained.    A piece of kerseymere boiled in the acid solution
assumed    a colour approaching to bright green, which, when
the stuff was dried in the fun, passed to a gray inclining to
bright blue. A piece of kerseymere impregnated with the
same solution, being immersed in warm tincture of cochi
neal, aflumed    a very agreeable violet colour.
    Exp. VIII. Arsenic acid, being mixed with the tincture
of cochineal, the dark red colour of the latter was transformed
into yellowish red, but without any deposit being formed.
 A piece of kerseymere was then boiled for three minutes in
a   very dilute solution of the same acid, and the stuff thus
 prepared was immersed in warm tincture of cochineal.          The
 stuff immediately aflumed       bright scarlet colour inclining
                                   a
 strongly to yellow. Drying, and, in particular, pressing with
a  hot iron, made this colour lose little of its brightness, and
                                        a
 causedit  to become darker.

Jl8     ASisn of some lately   discovered Metals and    Earths
    Exp.  IX. A    solution of arscniate of soda slightly acidu
lated   was   applied as a mordant to another piece of kersey*
mere, and by immersion in tincture of cochineal a dark
mordori colour was obtained.
    Exp. X. The fame was repeated with alkaline arscniate of
soda : an agreeable lilac was obtained.
    Exp. XI. Common white arsenic dissolved in water, gave
a lilac colour somewhat dark.
    Though the author intended only to try the action of the
metals lately discovered on the colouring matter of cochineals
results before obtained from lead induced him to subject this
metal also to some new trials. He undertook at the fame time
to ascertain how far the use of nitrate of tin is indispensably
neceflary in dyeing common scarlet, by endeavouring to sub
stitute for that salt muriate of the same metal.          These re*
searches gave rife to the following experiments :
    Exp. XII. A solution of acetite of lead being poured into
tincture of cochineal, a violet blue precipitate was formed.
A piece of kerseymere prepared with acetite of lead was then
immersed     in the same tincture, and a very agreeable violet
colour   was  obtained.
    Exp.  XIII.  A solution of fine English tin in pure muriatic
acid   was   exposed for four weeks in an open vessel to the ac
tion of the air. A piece of kerseymere being boiled in this
solution, and then immersed in warm tincture of cochineal,
it assumed a bright scarlet colour.
    This result is the more remarkable, as it has hitherto been
believed that it was impossible to dye scarlet without a solu
tion of tin in aqua-regia ; and indeed the red obtained by
employing common muriate of tin inclines to violet.           It ap
pears,  therefore,  that  the oxygen  of  the nitric acid brightens
the colour. As the fame state of oxidation may be communi
cated to muriate of tin by exposure to the air as by nitric
acid, the expense occasioned by the use of this acid and
that of sal-ammoniac may be spared by substituting muriatic
acid, which is much cheaper.
    Exp. XIV. A piece of kerseymere was boiled for three
minutes in a neutral solution of muriate of barytes, and then
immersed in tincture of cochineal.       The stuff assumed a dark
colour, which, after being washed and dried, changed to an
agreeable violet.
    Exp. XV. Nitrate of barytes employed as a mordant gave
a ponceau red exceedingly agreeable.
    E*p. XVI. Acetite of barytes tried for the fame purpose,
                                                                gave

              on the Colouring      Matter os Cochineal.            319
gave a dark red       ponceau ;    which, however,       possessed great
brightness.
    Exp.  XVII. A       pieoe of kerseymere was dipped for three
minutes in    a solution of muriate of strontian, and then im
mersed in a bath of cochineal.           It assumed a dark colour;
which at first imitated that of scarlet, but which by drying
passed to crimson.
    Exp.  XVIII. A        neutral solution of nitrate os strontian
produced    a  bright reddish brown.
    Exp.  XIX.      Acetite of strontian produced a bright pon
ceau.
    The results of these experiments prove, not only that the
metals and earths subjected to trial possess a certain chemical
affinity for the colouring matter of cochineal, and are capable
of fixing it on stuffs, out that they possess also the property
of producing with the fame pigment very different shades.
They prove besides, that the nature of the acid, which serves
 as a solvent to these substances, exercises a great influence
on the (hades produced.
    The results obtained with the oxide of arsenic and the acid
 of that metal, are no less worthy of attention. The difference
 of the colours produced is particularly remarkable. The oxy
 gen, no doubt, had the greatest (hare in this phænomenon,
 as this principle manifests,        in a very evident manner, its
 great influence in the production of scarlet by the muriate of
 tin oxidated by the air.
 LII.  On   the   Manner of Hunting and Sporting by the English
    in Bengal.       Communicated by Colonel G. Ironside *.
 J? EW parties of pleasure can be more agreeable than those
 for hunting, formed by ladies and gentlemen in Bengal, par
 ticularly at some distance from the presidency of Fort Wil
 liam, where the country is pleafanter, and game of every
 kind in greater plenty.        Any time between the beginning os'
 November and end of February is taken for these excur
 sions ; during which season the climate is delightfully tem
 perate, the air perfectly serene, and the sky often without a
 cloud.

 modation of the company, to some verdant spot, near to a
grove and rivulet, previously selected, elephants and camels
are borrowed ; small country carts, oxen, and bearers hired,
at no considerable expense, the price of all kinds of grain,
and wages of course, being exceedingly reasonable. Nor does
the commanding officer ot the troops within the district often
refuse a guard of sepoys to protect the company from the
danger of wild beasts, (for such generally resort to the haunts
of game,) or the depredations of still w ilder banditti, now and
then pervading the country.
   The larger tents are pitched in a square or circle, while
those for the guards and servants usually occupy the outer
space.    Every marquee for a lady is divided into two or three
apartments, for her camp-bed, her closet, and her dressing-
room ; is carpeted or matted, and is covered with a spreading
fly, for defence against rain, or exclusion of casual heat, the
air ventilating powerfully between the vacuity (about two
feet) of the tent and its canopy in unremilted undulation.
The doors or curtains of the marquee, wattled with a sweet-
scented grass, are, if the weather chance to become sultry,
continually sprinkled with water from the outside; and a
chintz wall, stained in handsomely- figured compartments,
encompasses the whole.
   For the supply of common food, if no village be very near,
petty chandler shops enow are engaged by the family banyans
                  to accompany them, glad to profit of such
(house stewards)
an opportunity of gain.    Liquors and every species of Euro
pean articles are provided by the party themselves.
  Horses are employed for the conveyance of the srentlemen,
and palanquins for the ladies, with their female attendants ;
and, where the roads will admit of   it, close and open English
carriages  also.
   Part of the morning sports of the men, commencing at
dawn of day, consist in rousing and chafing the wild boar,
the wolf, and antelope (or gazelle), the roebuck, the musk,
the red and other deer, hares, foxes, and jackalls     : besides
the common red, the spotted and the small moose, there are
ten or twelve sorts of hog or short-bristled deer.    Boars are
usually found amongst the uncultivated tracts, or the more
regular plantations of sugar-canes, which give to their flesh
the finest flavour imaginable.    Wolves and jackalls are seen
prowling    and  lurking, at  break of day, about the skirts of
towns and villages, or retiring from thence to their dens
within woods; or within pits, hollows, or ravines, on the
downs.     Hares llieltcr

The hog, roebuck,   anil musk deer, conceal themselves amongst
the thickest heath and herbage, and the antelope and large
deer rove on the plains.    All these animals, however, resort
not rarely to the jungles (or very high coarse and implicated
grass), with which the levels of Hindustan abound, either to
graze, to browse, or in pursuit of prey.
    A country of Asia abounding in such variety of game,             is,
of course, not destitute of wild beasts the principal of which
                                             ;
are the tiger, leopard, panther, tiger cats, bear, wolf, jackall,
fox, hyæna, and rhinoceros.      The leopards are of three or
four kinds.
    Or the gentlemen divert themselves with shooting the same
animals; as also common partridge, rock partridge, hurrial
or green pigeons, quail, plover, wild cocks and hens, cur
lews; black, white, and gray peacocks         florikens, storks of
                                                 ;
several kinds and colours, together , with water hens, Bra-
miny geese, cranes, wild geese and ducks, teal, widgeons,
snipes, and other aquatic fowl, in infinite abundance       ;many
of them of extraordinary shape, of glowing variegated plu
mage, and of unknown species whose numbers almost cover

the water whilst they swim, and, when alarmed, and flushed
from the lakes, like  a  elbud, absolutely obscure the light.
    The foxes are small, slenderly limbed, delicately furred
with  a    soft brown hair, and       no means rank in smell
                                      by                             ;
feeding principally upon grain, vegetables, and fruit.        They
are exceedingly fleet and flexible, though not strong or per
severing.    When running, they wind in successive evolutions
to escape their pursuers, and afford excellent sport.        Their
holes are usually excavated, not in woods, but on hillocks,
upon  a   smooth green sward or lawn, where, in        morning or
                                                        a
evening, they are seen playing and frisking about with their
young. They feed generally amongst the corn, and are osten-
 est found within fields of mustard      or linseed, when       has
                                                                it
sprouted up high enough to conceal them.
    A minor critic, on perusal of Æsop's or rather Pilpay's
fables, ridiculed the idea of foxes feeding upon grapes     ;  but,
 had he consulted any Asiatic natural history, he would have
learnt that they subsist upon grain, pulse, and fruit, particularly
grapes and pine-apples when within their range, much mere
 than upon flesh or fowl.    Or, had he turned to the Bible, he
would have there found the following passage in confirmation
of it: — Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the
vines, for our vines have lender grapes." — Canticles, c. ii.

brown colour, clumsier mape, and not so pointed about the
jiose.    In nature, they partake more of the wolf than of the
dog or fox. Their real Asiatic name is shugaul, perverted
by English seamen trading to the Levant (where they are in
plenty on the coasts of Syria and Asia Minor) into jackalls.
    Ot the partridge there are several kinds, one with a white
belly, and another something like grouse, only more motley
feathered.
    Plover too are various ; and, when the weather become*
warm, ortolans traverse the heaths aud commons in immense
flocks.
    There are no pheasants in the woods of Bengal or Bahar
nearer than the confines of Assam, Chittagong, and the range
of mountains separating Hindustan from Tibet and Napaul.
But there, particularly about the Moruug and in Betiah,
 they are large and beautiful, more especially the golden, the
burnislied, the spotted, aud the azuie, as well as the brown
Argus pheasant.
    As for peacocks, they are every where in multitudes, and
of two or three species. One tract in Orisi'a U denominated
Alore-bimje, or the Peacock District.
    Cranes are of three forts'', and all of a cærulean gray : the
very lofty one, with a crimson head, called Jams', the small-
ell, called ettreurrab, (the demoiselle of Linnæus and Busson,)
 uncommonly beautiful and elegant, whose snow-white tuft,
 behind its scarlet-glowing eye?, is the appropriate ornament
for the turban ot the emperor alone ; aud the middle-fized
onc with a black head, the common grus. They return to
 the northern mountains about the autumnal equinox, after
cessation of the periodical rains, with their young, in myriads
of flights, frequent as the wood pigeon in North America;
and lometimes, w hen the wind is very violent, flocks of them
mount to a vast height in the air, and there wind about in
 regular circles, seemingly with much delight, and venting
ail the time a harm discordant scream, heard at a considerable
distance.
    In the wilds of Hindustan certainly originated the common
domestic fowl, for there they are discovered in almost every
forest.    They are all bantams, but without feathers on their
legs   ; the cocks are in colour all alike, what sportsmen call
ginger rid ; they have a sine tufted cluster of white downy
leathers upon their rumps, are wonderfully stately in their
gait, and tight like furies. The hens are invariably brown.
 It is extremely plealant, in travelling through the woods early
in   a  morning,   to hear them crowing,     aud  to perceive  the

     Florekins are amongst the non descripta, I believe, in or
nithology.      A drawing can alone exhibit an adequate repre
sentation of this fine bird; it harbours in natural pastures
amongst the long grafs, on the extremity of lakes, ai>d the
borders of swampy grounds, lying between marshy soils and
the uplands.       Hence its flesh seems to partake, in colour and
relish, of the nature and flavour of both the wild duck and
 the pheasant ; the colour of the flesh on the breast and wing
 being brown, but on the legs perfectly white, and the whole
of the most delicate, juicy, and savoury flavour conceivabfe.
     There are only three claws to its feet ; the roots of the fea
 thers of the female are of a fine pink colour.
      When the cock rises up, some fine black velvet feathers,
 which commonly lie smooth upon his head, then stand up
 erect, and form a tuft upon his crown and his neck.
      When set by dogs, it lies close, and scarcely ever rises till
 the fowler is so near as almost to tread upon it. The nest of
 it is made amongst the grafs.
      You read of them in descriptions of antient knightly festi

  were then native of England, I am uncertain,
t     The height of the cock florekin of Bengal, from the ground,
  when he stands, to the top of his back, is seventeen inches.
      The height from the ground to the top of his head, when
  he holds it upright, is twenty- seven inches.
      The length from the tip of his back to the end of his tail,
  is twenty-seven inches.
      In no part of southern Asia did I ever hear of woodcocks ;
  but amongst the breed of snipes there is one called the painted
  snipe, larger than ordinary, and which well compensates for
  want of the former.
      Fishing, both with lines and diversity of nets, is the em
   ployment ef other sets of the party ; or the hawking of he
   rons, cranes, storks, and hares, with the falcon ; and of par
   tridge and lesser birds, with the sparrow and sm-*]l hawks.
       Ladies now and then attend the early field : if it be to view
   the coursing or hawking, they mount upon small gentlest (for
   they are all gentle) female elephants, surmounted with arched-
   canopied and curtained seats ; otherwise they ride on horse
   back ; more frequently however in palanquins, under which,
   as well as under the elephants and horses, the birds, (parti-

the hawks, and the little foxes, whin hard pressed by the
dogs, often       fly
                 for shelter and protection.  In general, how-
aver, the ladies do not rife betimes, nor stir out till the hour
of airing.
   The weapons in use on these expeditions are, fowlinc-
pieces, horse pistols, light lances or pikes, and heavy spears
or javelins   ;and every person has, besides,   aservant armed
with    scymitar
          a       or sabre,  and arifle witha bavonet,  carrying
a  two-ounce ball, in the event of meeting with tigers, hvæ-
nas, bears, or wild buffaloes. Some of the ladies (like Tha-
kstris or Hypolita, quite in the Diana style,) carry light bows
and quivers to amuse themselves with the lesser game.
    The dogs are, pointers, spaniels, Persian and European
greyhounds, and strong feroctous lurchers.     Near Calcutta a
few gentlemen keep English hounds; but their scent quickly
fades, and thev soon degenerate.
     But
       the liveliest sport exhibited when all the horsemen,
                           is
elephants, servants, guard, and hired villagers, are assembled
and arranged in one even row, with small white flags (a*
 being seen furthest) hoilted pretty high at certain distances,
in order to prevent one part of the rank from advancing be
fore the rest.    Proceeding in this manner, in     a regular and
progreflive course, this line sweeps the surface like   a net, and
impels before       all the game within its compass and extent.

          a
riety of animals issuing at once from their coverts     :some are
driven out reluctantly, others force their way back into the
brake. During this scene of development, rout, and di
spersion, prodigious havock     is made by the fowlers, falcon
ers, and huntsmen, whilst the country people and children,
with sticks and staves, either catch or demolish the fawns,
leverets, wild pigs, and other young animals, which have
returned into the coppice.
    Instances occasionally occur, where the natives of the      vi
cinage petition the gentlemen to destroy    a  tiger that has in
fested the district, to the annoyance and devastation     of their
flocks and shepherds, and perpetual alarm of the poor cot
tagers themi-lves. Although an arduous and perilous adven
ture, and what the gentlemen all profess, in their cooler mo
ments, to reprobate and decline, yet, when in the field, they
generally comply with the solicitation, and undertake the ex
ploit.    Their instant animation, not unattended with emo
tions of bnceenevole and compassion, presently supersedes every
dictate of prudence, and, spite of their predetermination, they
                                                          proceed

proceed   to the assault,     the villagers all the while standing
aloof.    If conducted    deliberately, with circumspection, and
with the aid of the sepoys, they soon accomplish their pur
pose, and bring in the most dreadful and formidable of all
tremendous beasts, amidst the homage and acclamations of
the peasantry.      But should they lose their presence of mind,
prolong or precipitate the conflict, act with incaution, or at
tack the exasperated infuriated savage with tumult and con
fusion, the event is often fatal, by his seizing, lacerating, and
crushing, every creature within his reach ; nor ceasing to rend,
tear, claw, and destroy, to the very moment of his destruction,
or of his flight.                  ,                          N
    Sometimes do the natives entreat the gentlemen to rid
them of wild buffaloes, (the largest of all known animals, the
elephant excepted,) that have laid waste their cultivation ;
and at others, to clear their vast tanks, or small neighbouring
lakes, of alligators, which devour their fish, or do mischief on
shore. So much hazard is not incurred, however, by achieve
ments of this sort, as from the encounter of a tiger; for though
the hides of those creatures resist a ball from a firelock at
common musket distance, they are by no means impenetra
ble to (hot from a rifle, or other pieces with a chamber, or of
a wider calibre.
    A drum, with a banner displayed from the hall-tent, gives
signals to the company for their meals.
    Breakfast is a most delightful repast : the sportsmen return
keen, fresh, ruddy, and voracious: and the appearance of the
ladies in simple loose attire, the eiegant dishabille of clearest
muslin with plain floating ribbons, and dishevelled tresses,
captivate to fascination.         Nor is the palate less gratified:
English,     French,   Italian,   and    Dutch viands, all combine to
provoke    it,   by   aprofusion   of  cold  victuals, salted and dried
meats and si(h, hams, tongues, sausages, hung-beef, fallads,
chocolate, coffee, tea, fresh milk, preserves, fruit, and egsrs,
rendered still more grateful         bythe most sprightly cheerfulness
and Auroral gaiety.
.   After breakfast, conveyances of different sorts are prepared
for an airing, not merely for the sike of airing only, but to
view some natural or artificial curiosity or manufacture some     ;
 noted town, distinguished mosque,             celebrated pagoda, re

 prospect    from   the  summit    of   rugged  cliffs,   impending over

    Between the airing and an early dinner, the hours are ir
regularly disposed, as chance may dictate, or caprice suggest.
Some play at cricket and quoits, swim, jump, fence, run a
match of horses, or shoot at a mark ; whilst others direct the
mountaineers and woodmen (who rove about in bands for
this express purpose) where to inveigle, entangle, or kill
beasts, birds, fist), and snakes, for which they are furnished
with variety of implements, such as matchlocks, tiger- bows,
spears, darts in grooves, balls in tubes, pellet-bows, limed
rods, stakes, and buflies; fascinating allurements, such as
painted, spotted,       and foliagcd screens, bells, nets, and
torches, bundles of twigs, rushes, and reeds, artificial ducks
and decoy birds, with traps, gins, springs, snares, and other
stratagems and inventions of wonderful enchantment, inge
nuity, mechanism, and contrivance.
    It is somewhat extraordinary, but nevertheless a fact, the
influence of fascination poflefled by the tiger, and all of his,
 (the feline) species, over many other creatures. 'Spied by deer
particularly, they stop at once, as if struck by a spell, while
the tiger lies still, his eyes fixed on them, and quietly await
ing their approach, which they seldom fail to make gradually
within his spring ; for the large royal tiger cannot run speed
ily or far. The glow of their eyes is fierce and powerful.
I   myself once passed a royal tiger in the night near a wood,
and could plainly perceive the scintillations from his eyes,
He was deterred from approaching us by the light of flam
beaux, and the noise of a small drum which we carried, and
¦was beat by a servant for the purpose of scaring him away.
    Wherever tigers roam or couch, a number of birds conti
nually collect or hover about them, screaming and crying as
 if to create an alarm. But the peacock seems to be particu
 larly allured by him ; for the instant a flock of pea-fowl per
 ceive him, they advance towards him directly, and begin
 strutting round him with wings fluttering, quivering feathers,
 and bristling and expanded lails.         Of this enticement the
 fowlers also make their advantage ; for, by painting a brown
 cloth screen, about fix feet square, with black spots or streaks,
 and advancing under its cover fronting the fun, the birds
 either approach towards them, or suffer them to steal near
 enough to be sure of their mark, by a hole lest in the canvas
 for them to fire through.
     Several other instances of the fascination of animals I have
 myself been witness to in Bengal. Three dr four times, where
                                                              a line

                    by the  Engli/b in Bengal.                      327
a line  of troops were marching in a long uninterrupted series,
passed   a  herd of deer; I observed that when their attention
was taken off from grazing, by the humming murmuring
noise proceeding from the troops in palling, they at first and
for a while flood staring and aghast, as if attracted by the
successive progression or the files, all clothed in red.             At
length, however, the leading stag,
                                         "   vir gregis ipje," striking
the ground, snorted, and immediately rushed forward across
the ranks, followed by the whole collection, to the utter dis
may and confusion of the soldiery : thus running into the
very danger one naturally supposes they must have at first
been anxious to avoid.       The men, who were apprised by the
sound of their approach, stopped, and made way for them.
Over the heads of the others, who were heedless and inatten
tive, they bounded with wonderful agility, and fled over the
plain.
    Driving one evening along the road in a phaeton, and
pretty fast, I perceived a young heifer running near the car
riage, with her eyes intently fixed upon one of the hind
wheels; by the whirling of which the animal seemed com
pletely struck and affected.        Thus pursuing her object for
about a quarter of a mile, she, by a sudden impulse, rapidly
darted forward towards the wheel, which then striking her
nose, the attention of the creature became interrupted by the
violence of the friction, and was, of course, withdrawn : she
then immediately stood stock still; and presently after turned
about stowly and made off.
    Beyond all other animals, however, serpents possess most
eminently this occult power ; frequently are they seen re
volved on the branches of trees, or on the ground, meditating
their prey, either birds, squirrels, rats, mice, bats, frogs,
 hares, or other animals.
    The ladies, as they are inclined, cither read, walk, swing,
 exercise themselves in archery, or at sliuttlecock in the groves;
 or they sing and play in their tents.         Others, whilst at work,
 are read toby their companions; of all amusements, perhaps,
 the most delectable.
    At the end of a convivial dinner, every foul, provided the
 weather prove sultry, or they find themselves fatigued, retires
 to repose.
    On rising from this  siesta, (of all listless indulgences the most
 soothing, comfortable, and refresliing, and ccrtainlv molt

Favourite games. These, with domestic sports, antics, gam

the amusements, fifteen or twenty clays; and the dissolution
of them is as generally lamented, with heart-felt regret, by
the individuals who compose them.
LTII.  Observations upon the Monsoons, as far as they regard
   the Commerce and Navigation of the Port of Bombay *.
Our       readers will not require to be told that our year is
divided into two grand seasons, or, as they are called, the
south-west and north-east monsoon ; that the first generally
prevails from May to the middle of September inclusive, the
other during the remaining months; yet we must premise
this as an introduction of what follows.
   We need scarcely to observe, that during the south-west
monsoon all the ports and roadsteads on this side of India
deny approach ; so much so, that between the 15th of
May and the 1st of September ships are precluded by their
policies from touching upon the Malabar coast, or from lving
in Surat roads between the 1st of May and the jst of Sep
tember.     Generally speaking, the monsoon is considered to
extend from Dunder-head, the southern extremity of Ceylon,
to the Persian Gulf ; in order to attain which, they who
should sail at this season would be obliged to make what is
called a southern passage, that    is,
                                    go first to the south of the
equator before they could stretch over to the westward         a
                                                               ;

                                                               to   '

to Bussorah about two months.           The fame objection exist*
against sailing al this season to any part of the Arabian coast.
As for the Red Sea, it is considered in vain to attempt enter
 ing it at this season ; nor can it be said to be favourable to
sail now to the Cape, the Mauritius, or any port to the west
ward.
     To the other side of India, on the contrary, it is now the
 most advantageous period of departing.         From the middle of
 April, even to the middle of August, a voyage to Madras may
 be made in about 1 a or 15 days ; to Bengal from 15 to ao
 days : after this time it becomes exceflively tedious, from the
 necessity of keeping to the eastern side of the bay, to avoid
 the violent weather on the Coromandel coast.         For the same
 reason the south-west     monsoon   is eligible to leave  Bombay
 for any of the ports in tbe Gulf of Bengal or the Streisrhts of
 Malacca ; hence also it is the season tor sailing to China :
  after the 20th of August, however, what is called the direct
  passage to China becomes      very precarious, with much pro
  bability  of finding blowing weather in the Chinese seas.
     With regard to the ports from which sliips may be expected
  to arrive at Bombay during this monsoon, it may be laid
  down as a general rule, that the quarters favourable to fail to *
  during any season, are those that it is unfavourable to expect
  arrivals from, and vice versa : hence from the Persian Gulf,
  the Red Sea, the Cape of Good Hope, and the westward in
  general, this is the most seasonable period to expect arrivals:
  from Muscat a trip may now be made in 10 or 12 days, from
  Mocha in 20 days, and Suez in about a month.             It should
  be remarked, that after September the Red Sea admits of no
  egress ; (hips consequently remaining there beyond that time,
  must continue there all the north-east monsoon, and are said
  to have lost their passage: on this account, the 25th of Au
  gust is the latest day to which our cruisers are allowed to re
  main at Suez.       From the Cape a passage may be made in
  five or six weeks ; from the Mauritius, in three weeks or a
  month.
      The south-west monsoon is also the most favourable season
  in which a passage may be made from Batavia or any ports
  to the eastward through these southern streights : from Ba
  tavia to Bombay, in particular, a passage may be made in
   about 35 days. From Madras and Bengal, during the south
   west monsoon, it is necessary to make the southern passage
   in order to reach Bombay : this will require, in a passage
   from Madras, from 30 to 40 days, and from Bengal from
  45 to 60 days, from the necessity of working out of the river,
  aud beating down the bay to clear Acheen Head.          From the
                                                            Streight*

 330                          Observations     upon the Monsoons.
 Streights of Malacca it is an arduous task to sail for this port,
 or even to any one on the peninsula of India, owing to the
 difficulty of working round Acheen Head.
    We have now to treat of the north-east monsoon, or the
season which may be considered as included between the 15th
of August and the 15th of April; in which the first circum
 stance that occurs to us to remark                          is,
                                                     that our coast     ren               is

tion   ;
                   is a
               now considered the most eligible period for sailing
              it
to the Persian Gulf, and in general to all ports to the west
ward.      To Muscat the trip           generally 15, and to Bussorah
                                               is
28 days.       The time suitable for sailing to Mocha and Suez
    from the middle of February to the middle of March, when
a is
   passage may be made to the first in                days, to the second

in 25.        If shipa be  delayed  till the   latter end  of March or the
beginning      of April,    the passage   becomes     more    tedious, being
then obliged to make the land to the southward of the island
of Socatra before the gulf can be entered, on account of the
southerly winds which prevail, and                   current felting to the
                                                             a
northward.         After the 15th of April,            ship bound to the
                                                                   a
Red    Sea  would    be  very likely   to  lose   her passage.
    Between the 15th of August and the 15th of September                                            it
may be considered favourable to sail to Madras and Bengal                                              ;
but after this time the season              suspended, owing to the set

season may be deemed unfavourable to the coast of Pegue
and the Streights of Malacca; but for the Streights of Sunila,

LIV.       Method     of obtaining     inodorous    Benzoic Acid.        By
                              M. F.    Giese».
Th        E benzoic acid, such as we obtain it in the dry or
humid way, always retains a peculiar strong agreeable odour,
which has hitherto been considered as a particular character
pf this acid. The numerous experiments I have made on
this acid show that chemiRs in this respect have been in
an error, and that the benzoic acid may be deprived of all its
odour without injuring its principles or altering its nature.
     I was led to this observation by remarking, that the same
acid extracted from the urine of graminovorous animals,
Mrhen deprived of all urinous odour, is perfectly inodorous.
This circumstance induced me to believe that the odour of
the benzoic acid might be foreign to it ; and to ascertain this
fact I made the following experiments:
     I united odorous benzoic acid to a solution of potash, and
then precipitated by muriatic acid. On each repetition of the
experiment the odour was sensibly diminished, and after the
third it had totally disappeared.
     As the acid retained all its characters, this seems to prove
that in these operations it had experienced no particular mo
dification f. This result was previoufly indicated by its ac
quiring, in the progress of the experiment, the odour of ben
zoic acid obtained in the humid way, which is much weaker
 than that of the fame acid obtained by sublimation.
     I afterwards invented another method, more direct and
less troublesome, for depriving this acid of its odour.                 It is
 founded on the greater solubility of the benzoic acid in spirit
 of wine than in water; and on the solubility of the benzoic
 oil, which is the principle of its odour, in diluted spirit of
 wine.       This method is as follows :
     Dissolve benzoic acid in as small a quantity as possible of
 spirit of wine : filter the solution, and drop water into it until
 no more precipitate is formed, or until the precipitate formed
 begins to be redissolved.          Separate the liquor by filtration,
 and dry the acid, which remains on the filter, at a gentle
 heat.

   DOUBTS were made as to ribs being set edgeways,                              so
different from all other animals of our earth    yet such    ;the          is
fact, as appears not only from the insertion of their heads,
but from their curvature; also from their sides, wherein                        is
the groove into which the cartilages,             by
                                           which they are con
nected, were inserted. These ribs appear to be of the fame
form and to be      the fame position as the ribs of fishes, and
                       in
so  designed for the same purpose, to resist an external corn-
pressure of more weight and force than the pressure of the
atmosphere.
   The printed description lest     totally undecided whether
                                            it
this animal had hoofs or toes.    On examining the setting on
of the foot, appears that
                it             hath the eight usual bones, in
                                    it

                                                                                as

                        On the Mammoth.                        333
as appears from the form      of the end-bones,  it had nails, not
claws.
    The position given to the Lisks seemed doubtful ; but, on
a view of the fact, it is decisive that they could not have been
placed otherwise.      They are of a spiral curvature of one
quarter   turn : they are so inserted into the head as to go back
alongside    the shoulders,  but al such a distance, as, by the
turn of the head with some curvature of the body, to reach
the sides and hinder parts, and from their construction and
position point out evidently, at least to me, that they were
weapons of defence against such of its enemies as might at
tack it in the flank or rear, and of destructive offence also in
 such case.    Of this more hereafter.
    The neck is so short that the animal could not reach the
 ground with its mouth: the line from the withers to the end
 of the under -jaw is about one-third of the line from the wi
 thers to the ground.     I did not take an actual measure of
 this, but I will venture to assert it from my habit in drawing.
     This animal, if a grazing animal, might indeed, as the
 moose deer do, feed on young shoots of the woods, or the
 bark; or, by going into morasses up to the breast in water,
 feed on the long grasses and water-plants which grow there
 in : but it is decidedly a carnivorous animal. The woods of
 the earth in which this animal could live, move, and sustain
 its being, must have been totally different from such as at
 present cover the face of the earth ; otherwise his enormous
 form, with the post tion*of his tusks, must have rendered him
 incapable of penetrating or pasting through them.
     Now here let the ingenuity and wit of our philosophers
  most renowned as naturalists search into the fact, and tell
  us what sort of animals could have heen his prey, and where
  such could exist in sufficient abundance to sustain this enor
  mous animal ; and if any such ever did exist, which we now
  know nothing of, how he could, be his capacity for velocity
  supposed to be what it may, how he could hunt them in woods
  into which he could not penetrate, and through which he
  could not pass.
     The question then arises and remains in doubt, Where
  must we look for his habitation and his food ? Not being
  able to find either in the present state of the earth, my re
  search is led to seek it under some other state of this planet.
  In searching for such state of things, I go to the first informa
  tion we can obtain of the history of this fact, in the divine
  book of Genesis, written under inspiration : and there I am
  taught that the original stale of this planet, in the firjl period
  of its existence, was that of an aqueous planet. The waters,
                                                                over

 over the face of which the Spirit of God moved, covered the,
whole surface of the globe, and had remained in that state,
for two uncertain periods, until the working of nature under
the command of God forced up and elevated the earth in
parts, so that the waters were gathered together, which took
place in a third period of the progressive existence of this our
planet.
    But apart al! authority, any true philosopher, who meets
by tracing back the operations of nature in her progressive
advance to the present state of the planet, will find it in its
first period an aqueous planet ; will find that light or caloric,
or whatever that first power was, specially gave course lo other
powers; and that the powers of evaporation, both expansive
and attractive, were aud are the causes of the separation of
the elastic fluid, the atmosphere ; that the earth has been
thrown up from the bottom of these waters by various ex
plosions and volcanic eruptions : and that the earth became,
under these processes, in its vegetative state, a fit habitation,
first, for the fowls of the air and all flying insects; and next
for the beasts of the field and all creeping things ; and lastly,
for man, exactly according to the philosophic description
given in the divine narrative. But while he considers this
advancing progression, he will find nothing to decide as to
the length and continuance of each of these periods. That
these periods are not to be understood as days, is part of the
fact.    Because three of these periods were past, according to
the narrative itself, before that division of time took place,
which was not till the fourth period.
    I shall now, grounding myself on the fact as above stated,
assume that this planet was, in its first period of existence, an
aqueous planet', and finding nothing to decide or determine
the continuance of this period, assume also that it continued,
according to the course of nature in her progression, in this
state for an indefinite period ; and further, that in this period
and in this state of the planet " God created great whales
and every living creature which moveth, which the -waters
brought forth abundantly after their kind." I find it difficult
to conceive that these waters, which are descriptively said
thus to bring forth Jo abundantly, fliould remain for four
periods of the planet's existence totally unproductive till the
fifth.   The only way that I find to reconcile this difficulty
in the divine narrative,     is, that these marine beings are
omitted to be noticed until they are classed with another
living terrestrial creatures under one head, according to the
order of method, not the order of time, in the fifth period,
when the earth became       a proper habitation for such terres

                          Oh the Mammoth.                            335
trial creatures.   Whether the general denomination of great
ivbales, so peculiarly expressed here, extended to the levia
than, the behemoth, and other species of great animals,                     I
am not critic enough to judge : but that there were several
other great animals in these waters is a fact.
    On this ground I am disposed to think that, if any remains
of any great animals are found amid the wreck which the
parts of this planet have suffered in the revolutions of its na
ture, whose species are not now to be found in living exist
ence, and to whom the present state of the earth could nei
ther give an habitation or food, even a cautious naturalist
may, on theory founded in a combination of circumstances,
fairly suppose that those great animals had their existence
under the circumstances of the first period of this planet as
an aqueous one, and were destroyed by the revolution which
converted it into a terrestrial one ; and that even those who
were not destroyed in that catastrophe must have become an
nihilated, as the present state of the earth is not suited to
their existence.
    The skeletons of this species of animal, which is by a Ruf
fian word denominated mamouth or mamoud, as being enor
mous like the elephant, and which might just as properly have
had the name leviathan, or behemoth, given to             it,
                                                          are found
in different and distant parts of the world, and under different
climates, as on the banks of the Ohio, in the dominions of the
state of New York, and on the banks of the Obie in Siberia.
This circumstance again points out that these animals must
 have inhabited some element wherein the climates did not
vary to the degree in which they now do on the earth, and
whereby there was     a general free communication from one
fide of the globe to the other, which doth not now take
place. Moreover, as the earth         now constituted, and as the
                                     is
animals thereon exist, the indigenous animals of Europe and
of America, howsoever similar in' their external apparent
classes, are variations in the one country from what they are
in the other.
    Besides the skeletons of these animals called mammoth,
 there have been found in other regions of the earth parts of
other skeletons of enormous animals.          The skeleton of one
such, which    is now in Spain, was found in South America.
This, from the drawing made of            it,
                                           appears to differ from
the mammoth     :  but, having been accustomed to doubt the
 vagueness of draughts,    I  can suppose that this may, on exa
mination, be found to be of the fame nature          *.

     There are also found, in different regions in the earth, the
 exuviæ     and remains of animals of a scale in magnitude
  much beyond those it affords in its present state, about which
 it seems almost impossible to fix any line of conjecture. They
 are found in all strata, the marine ones chiefly in calcareous
 strata : this skeleton lay in a calcareous stratum.
    The supposition that this animal was a marine one, and
 dwelt in the ocean, relieves the account of it from all diffi
 culties as to its habitation and food. What the woods of the
 present earth deny, the ocean gives full and free course to —
 all its enormous animal capacities of motion. The abundant
supply of the ocean could give food for this carnivorous ani
 mal, and food which came within its power to attain, on the
 banks of flat fish, and in the beds of shell fish. This removes
 all difficulty as to its sustenance.  That the ocean did bring
 forth such food in such abundance, the phænomena of the
 marine animal composition of the strata of the present state
 of   the earth evinces.
      That this animal was carnivorous appears to be a decided
 fact   it might therefore live in an element where was no
        ;
 grazing food: from its enormous bulk it would require a sup
 ply of animal food which the earth could not give, and which
 could only be found in the abundanee which the waters bring
forth.
    There are parts in the debris of the skull which have some
 comparative resemblance to the whale, as to the purpose of
breathing under water; and from the width of the jaws,
somewhat similar to that of fish, one may imagine, when
imagination is set to work, that this animal might have had
in those parts some glands calculated to carry on the fame
operation as the gills of fish perform.     The ribs, as observed
above, more similar to those of fish than to those of terres
trial animals, are by their construction and position ordained
to resist a much heavier and more forcible external compref-
sure than the atmosphere creates.
   I stiall make no apology for any part of this theory, be
cause, being declared to be theory, every one is at liberty to
approve or disapprove the whole or any part thereof; yet I
cannot but think that some very sober analytic philosophers
may repose their imaginations if not their conviction upon
it,  until the present or some future system of philosophy sup
plies them with       better.

Mr.    Peale, a young American, by whose persevering industry it
was dug up, without faying in vcrv truth, and not in compli

can arise from an object of this fort, from the modest scien

  LVI.     Remarks   on  the present  State  of Aerojlatlon.    By
                      Mr. G. j. Wright*.
 SUBSEQUENT to the discovery of marine navigation, the
daily proofs of aerial flight, as witnessed among the feathered
tribe, served to suggest to the amients the probability of
piercing the unexplored regions of the atmosphere : various
have been their attempts for this purpose, which (agreeably
to the then pre-eminence of mechanical over the other
branches of philosophy) were confined to the invention of
machines to aslist man himself in imitating the motions of
the feathered race, but more particularly to the contrivance
of flying automata, as may be learnt from the writings of
many authors.
    To   enumerate and particularize these inventions would be
of   no avail, especially as the bare recital of many of them
 would at once confirm their abfmlity ; so that we may reckon
nothing to have been practically concerted toward aerostation
till the experiment of one Gusmari, a Portuguese friar, who
is reported, early in the 18th century, to have launched a
paper bag into the air; which however soon fell, after attain
 ing the height of 200 feet.
    Many doubts have arisen respecting the truth of this state
 ment, principally from the supposed unacquaintance of the
 philosophers of that e;irly period with the qualities and vary
 ing densities of aerial fluids, as also the little probability that
 an clastic fluid could be confined, for anv length of time, bv
 paper, of which it has been aliened that the pores are indeed
 impermeable to air, though water eatiiy percolates them:
 hence it has been inferred that the particles of water are finer
 than those of air. 'Tis certainly true that .air may be con
 fined by paper, provided such air be destitute of moisture, and

incapable of exerting     a chemical action thereon : but if water
passes   the pores  of paper, it is most probably occasioned by
its first effecting a solution of the mucilage, by which means
the rest of the fluid finds an easy passage ; for, the hotter the
water, the quicker does it percolate; and this is not attributable
to any supposed attenuation of the individual particles of the
fluid, but to an actual solution of the paper itself; otherwise
the strength of each single fibre would remain unimpaired
by the difference of temperature in the water ; the contrary
to which the manufacture of paper itself will evince.
    The difficulty, therefore, os obtaining the gases in a state
 osdrvnelrf in so large a quantity as       if>
                                            required for aerostatic
 experiments, will ever remain an impediment to the use of
p<iper for any other than balloons of small diameter, and on
 the principle of Montgolsier.      Two brothers of this name,
 natives of France, considering the difference in the specific
 gravity of heated and cool air, justly imagined, that isa bag,
 sufficiently large, were filled with the former, the weight of
 the inclosed heated air and bag together would be less than
 an equal bulk of atmospheric air of ordinary temperature, and
 that such an apparatus would ascend till        mould attain that
                                                  it
 elevation where the respective gravities would correspond.
    Experiment fully verified the opinion they had formed,
 and M. Filatre de Rozier was the first to make trial of its
security.
   The inconveniences peculiar to machines rendered buoy
ant   by heated air, arose from the impoflibilitv of keeping up
the elevated temperature of the inclosed air without the con
tinued renewal of fuel, and that in large quantity     whereby
                                                             ;
the travellers were exposed to great danger from the occasion
ally sudden and unavoidable expansion of the flames, and their
inability to command that uniformity of rarefaction       neces   so
sary to the safety of the voyage.
   As aerial chemistry had been before this time making rapid
advances,   so the philosophical world, through the indefati
gable  labours   of the honourable Mr. Cavendifli, had been
made acquainted with the properties of inflammable air,
whose    specific gravity, in    tolerably pure state,
                                 a                         at least
                                                                 is
twelve times lighter than atmospheric air. Doctor Black
first applied this newly discovered gas to balloons,         by
                                                         suggest
ing its inclosure in an air-tight bag, as capable of raising                it
self into the atmosphere, agreeably to the common hydrosta-
tica) axiom, that bodies immersed            in
                                              fluid heavier than
                                                  a
themselves must inevitably float in that fluid       and that, as
                                                         ;

lighter body will continue to rife till its gravity lhall corre

spond with that      of  an equal bulk  of the fluid in which it is
immersed.       Although Dr. Black undoubtedly first suggested
the    propriety of applying inflammable air to aerostatic pur
poses, Mr. Cavallo had the honour of first putting it into
practice, which we find him to have been engaged in per
forming in the year 1782: but his experiments went no
further than a demonltraiion'of the doctor's suggestions; and
the ascent of soap-balls filled with inflammable air (as being
the first experiment of the kind) is an original idea, for
which we are indebted to him.
     The first inflammab!c-air balloon was launched on the
continent by Meflrs. Roberts and a Mr. Charles in the year
 1783; and the greater expediency of these latter machines
over those elevated by heated air, soon raised them lo that
pre-eminence thev seemed justly entitled to: yet even with
these there was conjoined the disadvantage of not being able
to raise or lower them without a loss of ballast in the first, and
of gas in the latter cafe. This fu<rirested the idea of inclosing
a bag of heated air in one of inflammable air, whereby, on
varying the temperature of this inner balloon, the whole ap
paratus could be raised or lowered ad libitum, without loss of
gas or ballast.     But as the vicinity of fire to hydrogen air and
 common air endangers a mutual explosion, so this unfortu
 nate plan deprived the world of that most intrepid philosopher
M. Pilatre de Rozicr, who has the honour to bear the palm
of aerostation, in being the first man who ever abandoned him
self to the atmosphere in a balloon.
     If we consider the natural disposition of Frenchmen, ever
 prompting them to the pursuit of novehv, we stiall not be
 iurprised to find them warm advocates for the progress of this
 new art; eccentricity in the choice of their researches and
 amusements having been ever a prominent trait in their na
 tional character.      Enlivened by the native softness of their
 climate, their dispositions partake of that gaiety which is to
 be found only in a country like theirs, where a less fluggish
 atmosphere and more uniform temperature tend to preserve
 a conilant vivacity of mind.          A latitude so favoured with
 serenity of season produces an abundance of vegetables and
 fruits, the want of a ureater mixture of which in the diet of
 Englislinien causes the more prevalent fedateness of their
 manners, subdues a tendency to volatility, and keeps them
 from wandering from one pursuit lo another.              Jlcnce we
 are less likely to witness among ourselves that sudden enthu
 siasm for the progress of any new art, and especially of this
  (to some) seemingly unimportant one: we have therefore had
 \ery few instances he; e of IriHoon excursions undertaken by

really philosophical men ; and, except Mr. Baldwin, none
have contributed aught to the science.        His treatise *, com
piled   from   the memoranda    of a single voyage, is without its
equal, and under such a philosopher the art must soon have
attained all the perfection it could be capable of ; while its
present low state can be attributed only to the impossibility of
finding his rival. The treatise of Mr. Cavallof is an excel
lent book for practical purposes ; and in these two volumes
we find all the yet ascertained facts relating to aerostation      ;                  J
the pamphlets compiled by others being ot no value, as con
taining for the molt part a repetition merely of trifling occur
rences of no avail to future balloonilts.
    Subsequent to the experiment of Messrs. Charles and Ro
berts, many voyages were undertaken, both in France and
this country, during the years 1784 and 1785 : and after the
public curiosity was in some measure abated, the pursuit itself
iunk in the general opinion, and received attention only from
a Mr. Blanchard, a French gentleman, who for years before
had been devising various methods to                         fly
                                                        mechanical   by

 ages, and who, in his several attempts to improve the art,
has met with some unfortunate accidents)           the original in

     The second æra of aerostation may be said to commence
 with the eltablilliment of the aerostatic school at Meudon, in
 the vicinity of Paris    ||
                           ;and the first immediate service of                            a
 balloon appears to have been derived in the battle of Fleurus,
 in the Austrian Netherlands, where from an elevated station
 the French aeronaut beheld the movements of the enemy                                    j

                On the present State of A'eroftalion.          341
 rations of the combined armies. Various reports have at
 times reached us concerning the pretended flourishing state
 of this aerostatic school ; but during the few years of its esta
 blishment no improvements appear to have been made further
 than the composition of the varnisti, which is brought to the
 greatest perfection ; and Mr. Garnerin informed me the esta
 blishment itself is now given up.
    We rind then that the apparatus itself has undergone no
 confirmed improvement ; perhaps from the pursuit being ge
nerally attended to by enthusiasts in novelty, strangers to ge
 nuine science natural or mechanical.       Thus an aeronaut in
the present day is compelled to go in the direction of the
 wind ; and in descending, calmlv sits in his car to be knocked
against every tree, house, or hedge, that may come in his
way. So long, therefore, as aerial adventurers are liable to
such dangerous dilemmas, it is no wonder we find so few in
clined to repeat their voyages; as the transitory enjoyment of
a view above the clouds, is seldom sufficient to incite a second
attempt under such threatening circumstances.
    The restoration of peace affording to foreigners an oppor
tunity of visiting this country, whether prompted by curiosity
or to exhibit the productions of their inventive genius, this
crisis proved a means of again exciting the attention of the
English public to the almost forgotten subject of aerostation,
as revived by the advertisements of Mr. Garnerin ; a man of
an ingenious turn of mind, without that collateral acquaint
ance with the several sciences on which rests the only sure
foundation for improving the arts, and especially this pecu
liar branch of philosophy, which seems to be b\s\\z\\ve forte.
    Having made a number of aerial voyages, his mechanical
acquaintance with the requisites for insuring success was con
firmed by frequent experience; but further than this we do
not find him to have attained.      He is also the first aeronaut
that has succeeded in a safe descent by the parachute — an ex
periment which is of the first consequence to the progress of
aerostation.    The late voyages made in this country by this
latter gentleman are fresh in the memory of every one, and
we have only to regret that so experienced an adventurer
should possess so small a share of the knowledge requisite to
raise aerial navigation to the perfection it might perhaps
otherwise soon attaiif.
    As an advocate for ascertaining the issue of whatever may
be dubious in the present state os our knowledge, I felt anx
ious to seize so happy an opportunity of investigating what
degree of diminished pressure the human constitution could
support, as presented in the intended experiment with the pa-

rachute : for this reason I offered to Mr. Gamerin, that, as
 his balloon was capable of carrying four persons, it would be
 fully adequate to the conveyance of two, together with the
 parachute and ballast : under such circumstances it would be
necessary to suspend the parachute beneath the car; and my
intention was to occupy the latter myself.                  An offer so ad
 vantageous for securing Mr. Garnerin's machine (otherwise
 left at random) was rejected by him, from J.he acknowledge
 ment of his doubts respecting the event of so novel an expe
 riment.      But I trust this experiment will not long remain
 unattended to by such as may have an opportunity of per
 forming it : the effects subsequently taking place from the
 loss of a weight of upwards of 200 pounds at an elevation of
  io.coo feet, are not so terrific as might be imagined; as
 during this after-ascent no danger could attach to the ma
 chine ; for, its neck being open, and thereby affording an exit
 to the gas, now somewhat more expanded by the absence of
 the mechanical pressure of the 20 pounds just lost, yet gra
 dually still more expanding itself as it attains in this ascension
 a zone of air of lesser density, would necessarily prevent any
 Tupture from that cause ; while, if the aeronaut found his re
 spiration too much affected to allow his attainment of the ut*
 most height surmountable under these circumstances, he could
 have nothing to fear so long as he has the valve at command.
 Neither have we any cause for apprehension from the velocity
 likely to take place, if the traveller is not too near to the body
 of the balloon, or in a fitting position; in both which cafes
 it is doubtful whether the approximation to a vacuum * in
 the wake and immediately in the vicinity of the lower pole
 of a large spherical body, ascending with great velocity, might
 not endanger asphyxia, from the suddenly diminished density
 of the air received into the lungs f.
     At the fame time, to such as descend by a parachute from
 a balloon left at random, I would advise an attention to the
 iollowing simple precaution, which cannot fail of insuring the
    * Agreeably to what we learn in projectiles, that a bodv moving with a
 velocity of 1200 sect in a second, leaves behind it an ;,ctual vacuum ; also
 exemplified in the common exercise of swinging, where a slightly suffo
 cating sensation is experienced in the retrograde motion us the machine,
occasioned by the person sitting in the wake formed by the recoil of hit
own body.
    t  As 1 have no intention to speak in this place of the effects likely to
ensue to an aeronaut in cases where, the valve being unexpectedly found out
of repair, he is obliged to remain at the then unavoidable equilibrium, I
lhal! reserve these points of discussion as the subject of a paper I propose to
transmit at a future opportunity, in immediate reference to the probable
effects of diminislicd atmospheric pressure on the animal system.

speedy descent and recovery of the latter.      In ascending with
a parachute according to the present construction (the aero
naut being out of the reach of the neck of the balloon), it will
be advisable to leave the neck open about a foot or more :
           to the ascent procure a cord whose length must equal
 lalf the perpendicular circumference of the balloon when at
[>revious
its full distension ; attach one end of the cord to the zenith
of the balloon externally, or to the netting immediately over
it, and (leaving      itdetached throughout the whole of its re
maining length) to the other end fasten          weight of about
                                                            a
20 pounds.     I  fay, when the separation between the para
chute and balloon         made, the latter, being destitute of any
                            is
other poise, will gradually yield to this above-mentioned
weight, and      by its means the open neck of the balloon will
progressively be made to ascend         while the zenith will be
                                                   ;
drawn downwards, the machine thereby inverted, and the
pressure of the external atmospheric air will           (hort time  in   a
force out the inflammable gas, and the whole bag quickly
descend *.
   It would appear, from the above short review of the state
of aerostation, that we have as yet made no further progress
than the attainment of the means of rising into the atmo
sphere, of ascending and descending         very limited number
                                                        a
of times, and of departing from the machine in safety in case
of any immediate wish on the part of the traveller when his
stay therewith appears hazardous.      As these are matters suf
ficient to dispel apprehension from the minds of those who
may be inclined to attend to this branch of philosophy,                                 it
may not be amife to subjoin those requisites and precautions,
an attentipn to which will not fail to enable the amateur to
pursue this modern discovery with expedience and economy.

the price     of this silk, though more moderate in France, is in
this country so high* as to augment the expense of a middling-
sized balloon almost to a prohibition to any but the wealthiest
individuals.         I do not fee, therefore, why strong cambric
muslin, rinsed in drying oils, (previous to sewing the pieces
together,) should not fully answer every purpose.                After pro
viding the necessary quantity of the stuff, and each piece hav
ing been properly prepared with the drying oil, let the cor
responding edges be sewed together in such a manner as to
leave about half an inch of one piece beyond the edge of the
other, in order that this may, in a subsequent row of stitches,
be turned over the latter, and both again sewed down toge
ther : by so doing, a considerable degree of strength is given
to the whole bag at the seams, and the hazard of the gas
escaping doubly prevented.              Having gone in this manner
through all the seams, the following method of Mr. Blan-
chard is admirably calculated to render them yet more per
fectly air-tight.         The seam being doubly stitched as above,

over it on the outside; upon this latter pass several times a

varnished on the outside with merely drying linleed oil, adding a small
quantity of neat's-foot oil to prevent its being sticky.   The 't/itcirjt/iatr/i,

    t  In rendering oil drying for aerostatic purposes we should avoid the
use of metallic oxides, as litharge, &.C., which rot the stuff of the enve
lope ; besides that hydrogen gas, by gradually reducing the metals, cor
rodes such varnisti, turning it black, and in time causing it to crack. The
best method to prevent these inconveniences is to allow the oil to stand for
 several  weeks over unslaked lime, nr to dissolve in it a small quantity of
 gum-sandurac, gum-lac, mastich, seed-lac, or common resin; all of which,
 when finely powdered, may be dissolved in linseed oil by well boiling,
 thus communicating to the oil the property of drying, yet retaining elasti
 city.   Silk and canvas for umbrellas, &c. are varnished with a solution of
 either resin or gum-lac, melted with trying linseed oil to the consistence of

                       * have been
varnishing balloons                  variously modified ; but,
upon the whole, the most approved appears to be the bird
lime varnish of M. FaujasSt. Fond, prepared after Mr. Ca-
vallo's method         as   follows       :
  " In order   to render linseed oil drying, boil  with two ounces     it,
of sugar of lead and three ounces of litharge for every pint           f
of oil, till they are dissolved, which may be in half an hour.
Then put pound of bird-lime and half-a pint of the drying
              a

about gallon, and let
         a                     boil very gently over

about half or three quarters of an hour then pour upon            :                               it

about an hour longer, stirring           frequently with an iron or

 mention also the greater inconvenience in the latter case,
 arising from the establishment of a complete current of atmo
 spheric air through the balloon by the neck and valve toge
 ther (the neck being generally left open a few inches), where
by a quantity of the lighter gas is carried off greater than one
¦would imagine.          To obviate this, the neck and valve should
never be both open at one time ; and I apprehend the acci
 dents frequently occasioned by the usually rapid descent and
rebounding of a balloon, are to be attributed to an inattention
 to this precaution; the gas being violently carried out of the
valve by a current of air running through the balloon, and
this current increasing with the velocity of the descent; so
 that, when the valve is again closed, the balloon is found to
have decreased in levity much more than was wished for.
    The car for balloons may be left to the option of the ama
 teur, remembering that light weight, and the property of
 floating if descending over water, be attended to.

                 compared  with  those  of Gluclne.            347
to   chemists,  it is here needless to repeat what has been
already said on that subject.
   As the other is interesting on account of its novelty, we
shall lay before our readers the observations made on it by
the author.
   Though the mineral substance I discovered, says he, con
tains yttria, it could not be classed in a system of minera
logy as a species of earth, on account of the more abundant
mixture it contains of another substance equally remark
able, and which must increase the class of metals, already
very numerous. I found this substance in two fossils, ob
tained from different places : in one of them, it was united
with irou and manganese ; and in the other, with the former
of these metals and gadoline.
   This new metallic substance is distinguished by its inso
lubility in all acids.     The only re-agent which has any
 action on it is caustic fixed alkali. When subjected to heat
with this alkali, if the mass be then lixiviated, it partly dis
solves in the water, and suffers itself to be precipitated from
that solution, by means of an acid — but without the preci
pitate being in any manner attacked, whatever be the quan
tity of the acid employed. When separated by the filter,
and dried, it remains under the form of an exceedingly fine
 white powder, which does not change its colour even at
a red heat.     If the remaining mass be treated with acids,
the fame powder is obtained.        Its specific gravity, after be
ing brought to red heat, is 6*5'.o. It is fusible by the blow-
pipe, by the addition of alkaline phosphate and borate of
soda, but communicates no colour to the flux.
   Exposed to a strong heat in a crucible, without any other
mixture than pounded charcoal, it is reduced to a button
moderately hard, having some metallic splendour at its sur
face, but a dull blackish fracture.         Acids have no other
action on this kind of reg'-ilus, but that of bringing it to the
state of white oxide in which it was before.         The circum
stances of the reduction, as well as the specific gravity of
this singular substance, seem to assign it a place among: the
metals, and I have sufficient reasons for being persuaded
that it is none of those already known.            The substances
with which it might be confounded are the oxides of tin,
tungsten, and titanium, which are soluble in caustic alkalies,
and which, under some circumstances, resist acids.              But
the oxide of tin is easily dissolved and reduced : tungsten
immediately discovers itself by its solubility in ammonia,
and by the blue colour which it communicates to phos
                                                              phate

 our to borax,
Fihate                 and becomes            soluble in acids by fusion with,
carbonate of potash*.
   Before I describe the chemical analysis which I under
took of the two substances, which I consider as ores of the
new metal, it is proper I should give a description of their
external characters.     In order to avoid circumlocution, when
necessary to name them I shall venture to give them a ge
neric denomination.       Taking advantage of the usage which
admits mythologic appellations, and to express the property
which the new metal has, of not becoming saturated with
the acids in which it is immersed,         I shall apply to it the
name of Tantalus.        For the ore composed of tantalus, iron
and manganese I propose the name of tantalite; and for the
ore containing yttria, that ofjyltrotantalite, which will not be
found longer than that ofjtderolitanite.
   The specimen of tantalite was given to me by M. Geeger,
director of the mines; who assured me that this substance
has been known since 1746, and considered as a problematic
variety of the garnet of tin, (zinngraupen.)            It is found
near the farm of Brokaern, in the paristi of Kimito, and go
vernment of Abo, in Finland, in a large mountain on the
borders of the Baltic.       The matrix is composed of white
quartz   and mica,   with  veins  of red feldspar in large laminæ,
matters of which the sides of the vein are formed : the tita-
                                              the form of garnet.

is found incrusted in a granitic mass : but though the consti
tuent parts of granite are found there from time to time, it is
no less certain that the real matrix is nothing else than feld
spar, as is evidently seen in the large mine ot Ytterley.                The
mica and quartz found there form distinct parts, and do not
enter into combination with the feldspar* ; but in general it
is a rock of feldspar, intersected by large veins of mica, in a di
rection almost perpendicular; and it is in the proximity of these
veins that the gadolinite as well as the yttrotantalus must
 be sought for.        The first is generally found attached on one
 fide to a vein of argenteous mica, and the rest of its volume
 enveloped by feldspar.          The second never adheres immedi
 ately   to  the  mica.     The   clumps (rognons) which it forms,
 become enveloped with a thin crust of feldspar, separate from
 the grand mass by thin strata of grayish black mica.                     The
 veins charged with these rognons are rarely insulated ; several
 of them are found together, separated only from each other,
 and from the principal rock, by similar sides of mica.                      It
 was thus that I for the most part found these substances
 placed by nature, and it is very rarely that they are found in
 grains disseminated throughout the rock of feldspar.
     The largest rognons which 1 found of the ore of the yttro
 tantalus had not attained to the size of a walnut.                       The
 fracture of them was granulated, of an iron black colour, with
 a metallic splendour.
      Its hardness is not considerable ; it can be scraped by means
 of a knife, but with difficulty.
      When powdered it is of a grayish colour.
      It exercises no action on the magnet.
      I found its specific gravity to be 5*130; but as it was not
 possible for me to find a piece entirely free from feldspar, I
 suspected that its real gravity must be a little more consider
  able.
      We (hall terminate this extract by a short view of that
 part of M. Ekeberg's memoir, which relates to the analysis
 of the gadolinite, and the comparison of the yttria with
 glucine, which in several works has been considered as being
 of the fame nature.
      Gadolinite, when pure, is sufficiently compact to strike
  fire with steel.
      It is found crystallized in au imperfect manner, like some
  kinds of garnets.
      It contains glucine.

 353          On  the Change which Carbonic Acid Gas
    Besides the distinctions established by Klaproth and Vau-
 quelin between the gadoline and glucine, these two earths
 appear to be different by the following peculiar properties :
    The specific gravity of gadoline differs considerably from that
of glucine, which is onlv 2*967, while that of gadoline is 4*842.
The last earth is the heaviest of all the earthy substances
known, since it surpasses by 0*482 the gravity of barytes,
which weighs only 4*000.
    It is soluble in alkaline carbonates.
    It is absolutely insoluble in caustic alkalies.
    It is not, like glucine, precipitated by succinates.

   of the fame Gas     by Hydrogen Gas.         By   Theodore de
   Saussure*.
I.   Change which Carlonic       Acid Gas experiences     by the    Elec
                              tric Spark.
JDr.       PRIESTLEY had observed that carbonic acid gas
dilated by the electric spark, and experienced a modification
which prevented it from being entirely absorbed by lime water,
or by alkalies. C. Monge examined with the greatest care
what took place in this experiment, and found that the gas
produced by electrisation was inflammable gas.              I stiall here
describe in a few words the principal results of this observa
tion : A column of carbonic acid gas, of 34 inches, contained
by mercury, rose to 35 inches and a halt, after having been
traversed for a long time by electric sparks, which circulated
between iron conductors.          It could not be dilated any more
by further electrisation. The wires as well as the mercury
were oxidated.        Potash could only absorb 21 inches and
a half of this column of acid gas: the remaining 14 inches
were inflammable gas.         C. Monge accounts for these phæ-
nomena by supposing that the carbonic acid gas dees not
experience the least alteration in its principles, and he rea
sons nearly as follows : The conductors and the mercury, by
decomposing the water held in solution in the carbonic acid
gas, produce two opposite effects, of which nothing is ob
served but the difference.        1st. The volume of the acid gas
is diminished, by being deprived of the water which it held
in solution.    2d.  The volume of    the elastic fluid is augmented,
by the development       of the hydrogen gas of the water de-

composed.          The   residuums    of   gas after the operation are a
mixture of hydrogen gas, resulting from the decomposition
of the water, and carbonic acid gas deprived of water.
    Thisverv ingenious explanation* was without doubt the
only one which could present itself at the time when it was
given.       Had it been just, it would have been necessary, by
restoring to the acid gas condensed by desiccation the water
it had lost, to dilate it again, and to augment about 12 inches
the column in question. As C. Monge did not submit his
explanation to this decisive proof, I thought proper to at
tempt it.
     I caused to circulate for 18 hours electric sparks in the
bulb of a matrass which contained 13 cubic inches of pure
carbonic acid gas, and without any mixture of water super
abundant to that which it might naturally hold in solution.
The mercury, in which the inverted matrass was immersed,
rose to about the half of its neck.                After electrisation, the
metallic fluid was found oxidated black, as had been observed
 by Monge and Priestley ; but my conductors, which were
 of copper, were not sensibly altered.               The elastic fluid had
 experienced a small dilatation, which appeared to me not to
 exceed the tenth part of a cubic inch.                I then made about
 a grain of waters to pass in contact with the aeriform gas
 contained in the matrass.            I let it remain there for several
 days,     without    perceiving any dilatation in the volume of the
 gases,    the  residua   of the operation. I then moistened, with a
 drop     of  water    which    I introduced, the whole inside of the
 matrass — but in vain — the mercury constantly remained at
 the fame height.           I however found, on absorbing by potash
 the residuum of the acid gas, that a cubic inch of carbonic
 acid gas had disappeared, and had been replaced by a quan
 tity nearly equal, or rather superior, to the inflammable gas.
 The 20 cubic centimetres occupied in the neck of the ma
 trass a column four inches in length ; and the acid gas, had
 the supposed explanation been just, would have been dilated
     '*
        It supposes that the carbonic acid gas may hold in solution a great
 quantity of water.       But this assertion is not proved by any other direct
 experiment.       Dr. Priestley was not able to calcine carbonate of barytts
 but by the help of a current of aqueous vapour, which he caused to cir
 culate on that earth brought to a red heat.       This iclult may be explained
 bv the affinity alo.'e of the water for the barvtes.      It is b fides possible
 that the carbonic acid gas dissolves at a red heat a certain quant tv of
 water, and dilates much in this solution, without producing these effects
  at the temperature of the atmosphere.
      + It is needless to observe here, that water can absotb no mere than its
  own volume of acid gas with the pressure of the atmosphere, and that
  the drop of water inticluced into the matrass could not produce by this
  absorption anv sensible change in the volume of the classic fluid.

 35 a              On the Change which Carbonic Acid Gas
  through all that space.             I
                           then thought that this inflammable
 gas did not arise from the decomposition of the water, but
 from that of the carbonic acid itself by the metal.  I indeed
 found that this gas was not hydrogen gas, but carbonous gas
 perfectly pure.     I burnt loo parts ot it on mercury, with
 about a third of oxygen gas.       I did not perceive water after
 this combustion, which left for residuum 77 parts of car
bonic acid gas.
    The dilatation which the latter experiences by electrisa
tion may be explained by the different densities of the car
bonous gas and the carbonic acid gas.          I was not able to
verify   the observation  of C. Monge respecting the dilatation
experienced by     the carbonic  acid gas, after electrisation over
mercury.
    If it was not possible to reduce entirely the acid gas into
carbonous gas by these processes, it was because the first
strata of metallic oxidation presented an obstacle to further
oxidation, by preventing the points of contact.         The deve
lopment of the carbonous gas produced therefore an analo
gous effect.
   It results          then from
                          my observations, that the change
which carbonic   acid gas undergoes by electrisation does not
arise from the decomposition of the water, but from the par
tial decomposition of the carbonic acid gas, which becomes
carbonous gas, giving up a part of its oxygen to the metal
introduced in these experiments.
    II.   Decomposition         of Carbonic Acid Gas   by   Hydrogen Gas.
     It   was long supposed that carbonic acid gas could be
 decomposed by hydrogen gas; but no one was able to
 effect
          I it,
            though many experiments were made on that sub
ject.      had   observed, that     mixture of equal parts of hy
                                          a
drogen gas      and  carbonic   acid  gas, contained            by
                                                            mercury
and left to itself, had decreased in volume in the course of                  a
year. When          then caused the residuum of acid Ml to be
                       I
 absorbed       potash, and had burnt the hydrogen gas, found
                  by                                                 Ti
that there was formed in this combustion carbonic acid gis                    :
 but these results were not very sensible and what took place
                                                   ;
in this operation was to me mere conjecture.             Since that
time     have been able to confirm in
          I                                 decisive manner this
                                               a
first observation,         by
                        causing the electric sparks to circulate in
a  mixture of carbonic acidgas and hydrogen gas.            In few        a
                                                                                  ( (

 state of carbonous gas.     The following are the details of one
of these experiments          introduced into

                Some Account    of Richard Kirwan, Esq.             353
about nine lines in diameter, and closed by mercury, a mix
ture of four parts in volume of carbonic acid gas, and three
parts of hydrogen gas.          The space occupied by the two aeri
form fluids united formed a long column of seven inches, so
that each part in volume of the glass corresponded               to one
inch in length of the column. I caused the electric spark to
circulate by iron conductors.           The condensation of the gas,
which at first took place very rapidly, became always slower;
after twelve h;>urs electrisation, its progress was almost insen
sible.      The very sine drops of water, formed during the ope
ration in the upper part cf the tube, disturbed its transpa
rency. The column os aeriform fluid was reduced to four
inches.        It then experienced in its length a diminution
equal to three inches. I then introduced into it potash, which
could absorb only one inch of carbonic acid gas. The three
remaining inches were carbonous gas almost pure.              I  burned
by    means    of  the electric  spark,  ]oo parts of it with    oxygen
gas, and they left for residuum 64 parts of carbonic acid gas.
     It is seen, then, that three inches of carbonic acid gas were
decomposed, and passed to the state of carbonous gas, by
combining a part of their oxygen with the hydrogen gas in
troduced.         It is seen also that the latter, by losing the
elastic state to form part of the water resulting from this com
bination, produced the condensation observed in the volume
of the two gases.
     It is to be remarked, that the mercury and conductors in
this experiment were not considerably oxidated.
     It has long been observed, that hydrogen gas, confined by
water in contact with atmospheric air, decreases very slowly
in volume, and then burns with a flame less vivid. It has
been supposed that this gas filters through the water in the
atmosphere; but there is nothing to support this explanation.
In my opinion, it is more probable that the carbonic acid
gas of the atmosphere filters alone through the water, ac
cording as it is decomposed by the hydrogen gas, which de
creases in the ratio of this decomposition.

  LX.    Observations on the Law of the Expanjion of Water at
     Temperatures below 42° ; extrafled from a Paper on the
     Power of fluids      to  conduB Heat.           By  John Dalton*.
  1V1 Y     first attempt    was    to ascertain      the  precise degree     of
 cold at which water ceases to be further condensed, and like
  wise how much it expands in cooling below that degree to
  the temperature of freezing, or 32'.               For this purpose I took
 a thermometer tube, such as would have given a scale of 10
          • From                     Rmil

356      Exfanston of Water at Temperatures below 42 Degrees.
inches with mercury from 32°to 2120, and filled it with
pure water.      I then graduated it by an accurate mercurial
thermometer, putting them together into a bason filled with
water of various degrees of heat, and stirring it occasionally.
As it is well known that water does not expand in propor
tion to its heal, it does not therefore afford a thennometric
scale of equal parts, like quicksilver.
     From repeated trials agreeing in the result, I find that the
water thermometer is at the lowest point of the scale it is
 capable of, that        is,
                       water    of the greatest density, at 42^ ° of
                                     is
 the mercurial thermometer.          From 410 to 440 inclusively
the variation       issmall as to be just perceptible on the scale;
                         so
but above or below those degrees the expansion has an in
 creasing ratio, and at 32J      amounts to i-8th of an inch, or
                                     it
 about T^th part of the whole expansion from 42^ ° to 212", or
 boiling heat. During the investigation of this subject, my at
 tention was arrested      the circumstance, that the expansion of
                               by
 water was the fame for any number of degrees from the point
of greatest condensation, no matter whether above or below
      thus, found that32°, which are 10J- below the point of
                                                                  °

 above the said point; and       did all the intermediate degrees on
                                     so
both fides. Consequently, when the water thermometer stood
 at 530,  it was impossible to fay, without       knowledge of other
                                                                  a
circumstances, whether its temperature was really 53' or 32°.
Recollecting some experiments of Dr. Blagden in the Philo
sophical Transactions, from which            appears that water was
                                                         it
 cooled down to 210 or 22° without freezing,           was curious to I
fee how far this law of expansion would continue below the
 freezing point, previoufly to the congelation of the water,
 and therefore ventured to put the water thermometer in
 to  a  mixture of snow and salt, about 25° below the freez
 ing point, expecting the bulb to be burst when the sudden
 congelation took place.       After taking      out of     mixture of
                                                              it           a

  which was raised thus to the top of the scale was not thrown

This experiment      was repeated and varied,      at the expense  of
several  thermometer bulbs; and it appeared that water may
he cooled down in such circumstances, not only to ai°, but
to 5 or 6°, without freezing, and that the law of expansion,
above mentioned obtains in every part of the scale from 43!-0
to :o° or below; so that the density of water at io° is equal
to the density at 75°.
LXI.     Remarks on certain Properties of Barytes in its Com
    bination with Mineral Acids ; and on two new Salts never
    before described.    By  J. Hume,     Esq."
 Jl ROM a number of experiments I have occasionally made
on barytes, but chiefly on it when combined with mineral
acids, I have been led to draw some conclusions and observe
 phænomena, which, I believe, have hitherto been either to
tally unknown, or so very imperfectly detailed, as, no doubt,
 to have frequently been a source of error.         This earth, for I
 am not yet disposed to class it with alkalies, certainly possesses
 peculiar habitudes, or rather, when compared with those of
 other earths and alkalies, and its own combinations com
 pared with each other, some singular anomalies, which I
 have never yet seen pointed out by chemical writers.
 Amongst many others, the following appear the most pro
 minent, and therefore demand first to be noticed.
     i. That sulphate of barytes is completely soluble in sul-
          acid ; forming a saline Jluid or acidulous sulphate, ana-
   ogous, in some of its characters, to phosphate of lime and
 f»huric
  many other salts, with capacity for excess of acid ; decom
  posable by water alone, which returns it to simple sulphate;
  and this salt never has been enumerated by any author.
     2. That carbonate of barytes is also totally decomposed by,
  and soluble in, sulphuric acid, forming, of course, the same
  ecidulous sulphate.     Respecting any figure this new salt may
  put on, I have not yet been able fully to determine ; but I
  strongly suspect it may, under particular circumstances, be
  made to crystallize.
     3. That nitrate of barytes, not in crystals only, but even a
  saturated aqueous solution, is perfectly insoluble in nitrous
  acid  of the usual specific gravity.
     4. That   carbonate of barytes may entirely be changed into
  nitrate by nitrous acid in its concentrated state. The converse
  os this has hitherto been maintained.

   5. That muriate of barytes is virtually insoluble in mu
riatic acid.
   6. That carbonate of barytes may be rendered into muriate
by concentrated muriatic acid.
   7. This may not appear to be, with propriety, placed after
the others; it ought nevertheless to be named, since no au
thor has given any account of it. It          that sulphate of         is,
strontian has also   capacity for super- saturation; forming,

                                     ;
 palpable truths had escaped their notice: yet, on                careful                     a

apparently flatly contradicted C. Fourcroy, yet, on a closer
inspection of the work, (2de edition conJLLrablement aug

    In January 1799, the Discovery, being stationed       Ka-             in
rakakooa bay, Mr. Menzies was desirous of making         bota          a

some. other gentlemen of the expedition, and, in particular,
of ascending   a conical mountain in the neighbourhood, called
Whararai. For this purpose he was furnished with nume                 a

fidelity as the  whole troop performed their labours with ala
crity.   Mr.   Menzies     had a portable barometer of a simple
construction, by which he ascertained the height of different
places as accurately as the time would allow.                 The ifland
appeared   to  be   in  general in a  state  of  high  cultivation : the
provisions for the journey consisted of live nogs, poultry, dried
fisti, yams, and cocoa-nuts, in quantities that loaded more
than twenty men. They left the sea-fide the 17th of Janu
ary, after coming by water to the foot of the mountain, the
barometer     standing at 30*10, the thermometer at 8i°, at
noon. The road was through lava and other volcanic pro
ductions for about three miles : here the plantations of bread
fruit trees began, and the country was fertile and pleasant ;
the night was passed in the uppermost village, consisting of a
few scattered huts.       Beyond this was a thick forest, skirted
by fruitful plantations of bananas and plantains : about three
miles within the forest, the elevation appeared to be 2600 feet
above the sea.       The thermometer was 59°, at noon. The
natives constructed a number of small huts, which afforded
 shelter to the whole party for the night at the upper extre
mity of the forest.       Here the thermometer was at 580, in
 the evening : the uniformity of temperature at heights consi
 derably different, Mr. Menzies attributes to the shelter of the
 forest, and the evaporation from the trees.               But the next
 morning    the   thermometer     was   at  43°.     The  summit   of the
 mountain was rugged and barren : Mr. Menzies arrived at it
 in a few hours from the last station.            It afforded a very ex
 tensive view of the island, although parts of it were hidden
 by clouds: its most conspicuous features were two other
 mountains, of which the summits are covered with perpetual
 snow, bearing E.N. E. and S.E. bv E. of Whararai. On
 this hill there is a very deep crater of a volcano, with ashes
 and cinders appearing quite fresh : the natives consider it as
 the habitation of evil spirits, whom they attempt to pacify
 by offerings of various kinds.        The party of travellers spent
 the whole of this and the following day on the mountain,
 and passed the night in caverns thatched with plantain leaves,
  and strewed with grafs and mats for the occasion.              The so-
  phora tetraptera was in flower, as a small shrub ; in the lower
  parts of the island it becomes a tree, of which the natives
  make their spears, and which takes a fine polish. The do-
  donæa viscosa thrived on the summit of the hill ; and a small
  shrubby geranium was found there.             The height appeared to
  be 8dco feet above the sea.       The thermometer was lower at
  fun-set than at seven in the morning.
     Mr. Menzies descended on the south-east side of the hill,
                                                                      and

  and arrived in the afternoon at a deep cavern, where he passed
  the night.   Hence he made a fruitless attempt to ascend the
  snow-clad mountain, on the other side of the valley, in which
  the natives accompanied     him with the greatest reluctance :
  the fame cavern received him the following night.           The
  centre of the island between the three mountains is barren
  and uninhabited : it appears to be elevated about 5000 feet
  above the sea.   Returning towards the lhore, the party ar
 rived the next evening at a village nine or ten miles from
 Karakakooa bay, surrounded by fields and plantations in the
 highest possible (late of cultivation; its elevation appeared to
 be about 2oco feet.     Here they were entertained by an ex
 hibition of much grace and great activity in the performance
 of a female dancer belonging to a strolling party. The next
 day was the last of the excursion ; and the natives were dis
 missed with rewards of knives, files, scissars, looking-glasses,
 and tape, of which a small portion was surrendered by each
 to the king.    The barometer now stood at 30*12, and the
 thermometer at 740.
     On the 13th of January the Society resumed its sittings
 after the Christmas holidays.        An interesting paper, by
 Charles Hatchett, csq. on the alloying of metals, was read
 on that evening, and continued on the evening of the 23d.
 It results from his experiments that platina should not be
 employed as an alloy for gold, as it makes the gold assume a
 white colour. A number of experiments were made with
 pieces of gold coin, to ascertain the effects of the excess of
motions similar to what they experience by rubbing in the
pocket, and by being transported from one place to another.
By these it was found, that copper in the proportion of 1 -i 2th
was the best alloy for gold; and that the deficiency found of
late in the gold coin was not owing to the wear of circulation,
as, in a quantity of guineas rather loosely packed, and sent lo
some distance by the coach, the wear was all upon a few, and
on those the impression was quite obliterated: yet thev were
not found much deficient in weight, the work being by the
action pressed in, and not as it were filed off.

     ROFESSOR PICTET              presents his most sincere respects
to        Tilloch,   and embraces the opportunity of a friend to
fend him one or two communications,           which may prove in
teresting.
    In the sitting of the National Institute of December 29, a
letter was read from M. Mollet, professor of natural philo
sophy at Lyons, in which he announced two facts which
appear to be new.           The first is the appearance of a small
 light  in  the  air which    surrounds the orifice of an air-gun
                                                                 when

    364                                 Galvanism.
    when discharged in the dark.        This experiment does not al
 ways succeed ; and the cause of the differences observed in
-this respect is not yet known.
     The second fact 13 the inflammation of any combustible
matter, such as a small bit of linen rolled up, when put into
 the narrow canal in which the lower extremity of a pump
 for condensing the air generally terminates. Two or three
 strokes of the piston are sufficient to inflame                   it,
                                                           according as
 the current of air produced           more or less rapid.

                                    a

 less success.     He considers       as much superior to cinchona,

                                    GALVANISM.
       Professor Aldini repeated his experiments on Galvanism at
    the Anatomical Theatre, St. Thomas's Hospital, during the
    last month.    As the professor does not speak the Englisti
    language, Mr. Astley Cooper explained to the gentlemen
    present.    The Galvanic            troughs, consisting         of   123     pairs of
                                                                                    silver

                              Galvanism.                       36*5
stiver and ziric plates, of two inches square, with the metallic
communications, were under the direction, of Mr. Pepysjun.
     The first series of experiments was on frogs.       The head
being severed, the sciatic nerves and the whole of the muscles
of the thighs and legs were laid bare ; a portion of the verte-
bræ was cut away between the two nerves, leaving a small
portion    as a holding part.
     E\p. I. The     prepared limbs being held by the portion of
the vertebrae, the muscular part of the thigh or knee was
 brought by the operator in contact with the nerves.          Con
 tractions instantly took place without any metallic commu
 nication.
      Exp.  II. Two    prepared frogs were laid on the surface  of a
 dry earthen plate, the opposite knees and the vertebræs
 communicating; as soon as a metallic arc was made by a
 bow of wire, touching the nerve and muscle of one of the
 frogs, violent contractions took place in both.
      Exp. III. Three prepared frogs were laid in the fame
 order as in Exp. II, only the parts of the animal were not
 in contact, except by a streak of water drawn by the finger
 from one to the other across the plate.             As soon as a
  metallic communication was made between the nerve and
  muscle of one, all the three were thrown into motion, and
  at the same instant.        If glass bars or metallic ones with a
  small portion of wax on one end are used, no contractions
  are excited.
       Exp. IV. A prepared frog being held by the foot and a
  portion of the vertebrae, and the other foot being brought in
  contact with a silver waiter, such violent contractions were
  excited as to cause the limb apparently to leap along the plate.
       Exp. V. The operator having hold of the feet of a pre
  pared frog with one hand, and by wetted hands communicat
  ing wilh three persons or more, the last person completed the
  circle by touching the vertebrae; in doing which contraction
   instantly took place.
       E\p. VI. Two prepared frogs being laid in the order be
   fore mentioned on an earthen plate, a third was laid between
   them reversed, the toes touching the vertebrae of the two.
   On a metallic communication being made, the two outward
   ones violently contracted, without any sensible effect on the
   middle one, though it served as the conductor to one.
       The second series was on a decapitated dog, in which the
    troughs were made by a flexible metallic conductor to com
    municate with the desired part.
        Exp. VII. A wire of tin communicating with one end of
   "the trough being introduced into the rectum      of the animal,
    the head being placed against the fevered trunk, the commu
                                                             nication

  g66                             Galvanism.
  nication was made into the ear by a wetted wire, or flexible
  conductor, joining the opposite end of the troughs. The con
  tractions were so violent as to throw the animal forward on
 the table.
     Exp. VIII. The communications were exactly as in the
 last experiment, but the head was separated about fix inches
 from the trunk, and only communicated by the moisture on
 the table. On forming the circle, the contractions were
 nearly as before.
     Exp. IX. The head being removed, the communication
 was made with the spinal marrow; upon which the intercostal
 muscles were excited sufficiently toexspire and inspire the at
  mospheric air with such force, as to blow out a lighted taper.
     Exp. X. Rabbits which had been decapitated exhibited
 several of the before-mentioned phænomena. Two trunks or
 two heads placed together experienced contractions on the
 communication being made.
     Exp. XI. A portion of the diaphragm being laid on an
 earthen plate, was subject to contraction on the communi
 cation being made.
     Exp. XI s. The heart was not subject to contraction by the
 Galvanic shock; but was affected mechanically, as it usually
 is by glass, resin, or any insulating pointed body.
     Exp. XIII. Galvanic attraction was made sensible by the
 operator holding a prepared frog by its feet, placing the other
 hand on the spinal marrow of the dog, and bringing the
 sciatic nerves of the frog nearly in contact with the exposed
 ribs of the dog : the nerves were instantly attracted, and
 contraction took place.
     Exp. XIV. The contraction of the pupil of the eye, by
connecting the optic nerve with one end of the pile and
touching the iris with the other conductor, was shown. This
experiment was proposed by Mr. Babington.
     The surgeons and pupils of Guy's and St. Thomas's Hos
pital very handsomely           presented the professor with a gold
medal*, as an acknowledgement of his attention and appli
cation in elucidating several of these compound experiments
to their complete satisfaction.

   The following account of some experiments on a human
subject we copy from the newspapers :
    "  The body of Forster, who was executed on Monday the
       of January for murder, was conveyed to a house not far
17th
distant, where it was subjected to the Galvanic process by
professor Aldini, under the inspection of Mr. Keate, Mr.
Carpue, and several other professional gentlemen. M. Aldini
showed the eminent and superior powers of Galvanism to be
far beyond any other ilimulant in nature.               On the first ap
plication   of   the   process to  the  face,  the  jaw of the deceased
criminal began to quiver, the adjoining muscles were horribly
contorted, and one eye was actually opened.               In the subse
quent part      of   the  process,   the  right   hand  was  raised and
clenched, and the legs and thighs were set in motion.                    It
appeared    to  the   uninformed     part of  the  by-standers  as if  the
wretched man was on the eve of being restored to life. This,
however, was impossible, as several of his friends, who were
under the scaffold, had violently pulled his legs, in order to
put a more speedy termination to his sufferings.             The expe
riment, in fact, was of a better use and tendency. Its object
was to show the excitability of the human frame, when this
animal electricity is duly applied. In cafes of drowning or
suffocation,     it promises to be of the utmost use, by reviving
the action of the lungs, and thereby rekindling the expiring
spark of vitality.       In cafes of apoplexy, or disorders of the
head, it offers also most encouraging prospects for the benefit
of mankind.         The profeflbr, we understand, has made use of
Galvanism also in several cases of insanity, and with complete
success.     It is the opinion of the first medical men, that this
discovery,     if rightly managed and duly prosecuted, cannot
fail to be of great, and perhaps, as yet, unforeseen utility."
    To render the preceding account more interestlo^j»e shall
relate the following, either new, "or not commonly known,
facts.
    1. Taking the cessation of excitability to the Galvanic sti
mulus as the criterion of life, the heart is not the ullimum
but the primum moriens ; for, while the muscles of the limbs
were excited to strong contractions for even 7 hours' apparent
death by suspension of a hot-blooded animal, the heart was
utterly incapable of being excited to action, either by applying
the extremity of the metallic arc to the surface or to the in
terior os this organ.
    2. The kings were equally inexcitable as the heart.
    3. Not only were the muscles, but the skin and cellular
membrane, excited to action by the Galvanic stimulus.
                                                                  4. The

3^8                            Galvanism.
      4. The contractions of   the muscles were excited by the
metallic  arc  or   wire applied to the nerves supplying such
muscles ;  but  the  nerves themselves were not affected, not
even the largest nerve of the human body, the sciatic nerve.
   5. Motion or raising up of the arm was produced (as if by
volition) by the Galvanic stimulus.
   6. A milky or coagulated matter was formed by repeated
contractions of the muscle in contact with the copper wire,
or wire of copper plated with silver : and the same appearance
was seen when a plate of tin foil was interposed, for then this
white matter was formed on this tin foil.
   7. When the parts ceased to give out motion, or less mo
tion, the motions were renewed with augmented force by
wetting them with solution of sal-ammoniac.
   8. It is scarcely necessary to remark, that the Galvanic sti
mulus excited contractions in parts which gave out no action
to sulphuric acid, volatile alkali, and other stimuli.
                   Of  praSical Uses of Galvanism.
                        the
      The      in common life of new facts are not always im
            uses
mediately apprehended ; so that, although nothing very con
clusive can be said, the present facts may be hereitter of great
utility.    In the meanwhile we observe :
    1. That Galvanism may be a most powerful aid in restor
ing the vital actions suspended by submersion, by suspension,
&c. although it does not act upon the lungs ana heart ; but
if,at the fame time that     excites the muscles in general, warm
                              it
oxygen gas be applied to the lungs, and frictions and the hot
bath be employed, much more may be effected than without
Galvanism.
   a. In many diseases consisting          cessation of action, the
                                               in

    1. Hildebrandt, in a series of experiments on the action of
both the carbonate and pure ammonia on copper, found no
solution take place without the presence of atmospheric air.
 Hahnemann had ascribed the action to the carbonic acid ob
tained from the air, but this he has proved is without foun
dation.    If the oxide of copper is used, a blue solution is pro
duced without the admission of the atmosphere.
   2. According to Vauquelin,      the boracite called magnesio-
ealcareous borate by the French chemists, is not a triple
compound, consisting of boracic acid, magnesia and lime.
When transparent and crystallized, he finds in it none of the
latter substance, but only boracic acid and magnesia. When
opake, it is rendered so by lime, not in chemical combina
tion.
   3. An analysis of the waters of Plombiers, by Vauquelin,
gives per pint :
            1 gr. i-6th of sulphurated   soda.
                  5-8ths of muriated   soda.

            1  gr. 1- 1 2th of carbonate of soda,
                   i-half of animal matter.
This animal matter is like albumen, and is only held in
solution by the soda; as an acid instantly separates          it,   and
causes it  to precipitate.
   4. Brugnatelli recommends nitric ether to be prepared in
the following way: — Into         tubulated retort put one ounce of
                                     a
sugar  and   two  ounces   of  alcohol    to the retort adapt
                                                 :            a   large
receiver covered with wet cloths; secure the joint with pasted
paper, then pour
                       inthree ounces of concentrated nitric acid
by  the tubulure: ebullition takes place, and an excellent ether
of an orange colour passes into the receiver, which will not
redden vegetable blues:- as soon as the ethef        is  all received,
nitrous gas     is evolved     the receiver must be immediately
                               :
changed.      By treating the residuary sugar with more nitric
acid, oxalic acid very pure will be obtained.
  5.   Mr. Dabit, in the Annales de Cbimie, No. 127, gives an
account of some experiments on the residuum of sulphuric
ether,, from which he          induced to believe, that he has dis

conclusions upon the phænomena presented by its saline
compounds.
    In saturating the residuum of ether, mixed with water,
with carbonate of lime, be obtained a solution which gave
by evaporation a salt that crystallized in parallelopipeds,
having but little taste, and being soluble in ico parts of cold
water. This salt was decomposed by sulphuric acid. By the
action of oxygen gas, or of nitrous acid, it was converted
 into sulphate of lime ; and, by being healed with charcoal,
 it gave a sulphuret of lime.
     When it was mixed with a solution of carbonate of pot
 ash, soda, or ammoniac, a double decomposition took place,
 and the stronger acid combined with the alkalies.
     Mr. Dabit nas noticed some of the properties of its alka
 line combinations, which are extremely analogous to those
 of  the sulphites.   He   proposes to call the acid the oxygenated
  sulphureous acid. But the application of the name will most
  probably be generally considered as premature; and new
  characters will be required to distinguish it from the sul
  phureous acid, before its existence as a peculiar body can be
 implicitly admitted.
     6. Dr. Benzenberg, in an essay on the improvement of
  object glasses for telescopes*, warmly recommends that the
  glass be suffered to cool in the pots without stirring, and
  that the mass be then divided in a horizontal direction, so
  that the variation of density may be regular, and then, by a
  proper form of the glasses, the errors of refraction may be
  corrected. The idea is not new, but it does not appear to
  have been carried into practice.      Dr. Benzenberg considers
  achromatic telescopes as promising much more than reflec
  tors, and thinks that they intercept much less light.
     7. Mr. Sprenger of Jever gives an accounts of his method
  of administering Galvanic electricity in cafes of deafness. A
  small ball is applied to the external orifice of the ear, and a
  much larger one is held in the patient's hand ; the commu
  nication is then formed and interrupted alternately by means
  of machinery, once in every second, for about four minutes
  daily, for a fortnight or more. He asserts that he has thus
  restored the fense of hearing to forty-five persons, and to four
  of them that of smell also. All who were completely deaf
  experienced relief, almost without exception; but a partial
  deafness did not appear to receive the fame benefit.       The ear
  was silled with wool, to avoid taking cold.         The degree of
  advantage obtained was estimated by an instrument invented

1)oint                                      These experiments
relate to a subject so important that they must not be passed
unnoticed, however improbable it may appear that Galvanic
electricity should have any material advantage over electricity
otherwise excited, and however we may be disposed to believe
the report of other observers, that the relief is in general in
considerable      and only temporary.
                           ARTIFICIAL         COLD.
   Mr. Lowitz (Journal de Cbimie et de Pbyjique, by Van
Mons,) concludes, from various experiments on artificial
cold, of which a particular account is to be published in the
Transactions of the Academy of Petersbourg,
   1.   That the principal cause of the cold produced during
the solution of salts in water, depends upon some agency of
their water of crystallization ; for salts deprived of this wa
ter, instead of producing cold, produce heat.
    2. Amongst the liquid acids, the muriatic acid is most
efficacious for forming freezing mixtures ; the nitrous acid
is next to it in order; and the sulphuric acid is least pow
erful.
   3. The liquid acids produce cold only because they oc
casion a quick solution of the snow, or salt, of the freezing
mixture.
  4. Caustic potash and the muriate of lime surpass very
much, as cooling agents, the acids and the other saline sub
stances.
  5. The best proportion of the mixture of snow and muriate
of lime, is two parts of the first to three parts of the last,
mixed as accurately as possible.
   6. Five pounds of muriate of lime are sufficient to freeze
thirty-five pounds of mercury.
   7. The deliquescent salts are much more proper for pro
ducing cold than the efflorescent salts.
   8. That the deliquescent     salts may produce the highest
possible degree of cold, it is necessary that they contain the
greatest possible quantity of water of crystallization ; and that
they be used in fine powder.
       The snow employed mould' be that which has newly
  Jl.
    en, light and dry; and the experiments should be made
at the commencement of        frost, and not during
                                 a                     thaw.

            PRESERVING    ANIMAL SUBSTANCES.
   Mr. Chauffier employs, for preserving animal matters from
putrefaction, a solution of oxygenated muriate of mercury,
kept constantly in a state of saturation. The preparations
remain immersed in it for a certain number of days; and,
after they are thoroughly impregnated with           it,
                                                may be dried

                                        a

M. Alexander von Humboldt, in which he gives an account
of the progress of his travels through South America.           It   is
written from Contreras, near Ibagua in New Grenada. Be
fore he left Carthagena he paid       visit to the forest of Tur-
                                        a
baco, celebrated for the size of its trees some of them are

lejia mocondo, before observed     by
                                   Jacquin, who travelled in the
time of Francis   I.    M. von Humboldt, who had proposed to
go to Peru, could not resist the desire he entertained of pro
ceeding to Santa-Fe-de-Bajota     lo fee the celebrated botanist
Mutis, 72 years of age, and one of the friends of Linnæus.
    Thus, instead of proceeding         by
                                       sea to Guayaquil, which
was much more convenient, ne pursued the route to Quito
by land through Santa-Fe.       He first navigated, for forty-five
dayB, along   the river Dela Madelaine, amidst the most dread
ful tempests and the most dangerous cataracts.        During this
part of his journey he constructed          topographical chart of
                                             a
the country on four folio sheets,      copy of which was kept
                                        a
by the viceroy. When he arrived at Honda, in five degrees
north latitude, he visited the mines of Mariquita and Sainte-
Anne. In that country he found considerable plantations of
 cinnamon and nutmeg-trees and whole forests of the' tree
                               5
 which furnislies cinchona, and of the almond-tree, called           by
 botanists caryocar amygdaliferum.
    M. von Humboldt was at that time accompanied                by   a
                                                               young

                            Sails of Iron.                                 373
young Frenchman named Defieux, to whom the Spanish
government had entrusted the care of these plantations. Our
travellers at length reached the entrance of the Cordilleras
(la Bocca del Monte), climbed up the first eminences, and
came to the plain of Baiota, one of the highest of the globe.
This plain was formerly a lake, containing a surface of 33
square leagues: in the middle of it is situated the town of Santa-
Fe. M. von Humboldt was received here as if in triumph :
fixty persons on horseback came to meet him ; and the vene
rable Mutis had prepared a house for him near to his own.
The king of Spain devotes 10,000 piastres per annum to this
botanical establishment.    For fifteen years past, thirty drafts
men have been employed in it under the airection of Mutis.
They have executed 3000 drawings in folio, which are
finished with all the delicacy of miniature painting. M. von
Humboldt could compare the botanical collection of Don
J. Celestino Mutis only to that of Sir Joseph Banks. M. von
 Humboldt measured the altitude of the mountains which
surround Santa-Fe, several of which rise to the height of
 2000 and 2400 toises.     From Santa-Fe he was to proceed
 to Quito, and thence to Lima.         He was to be at Acapulco
 in the month of May last year, and, after travelling through
 Mexico, he was to return to Europe by the Philippines and
 the C«pe of Good Hope.      Such a journey, undertaken by so
 enlightened  a man, promises the happiest results to science.
                        SALTS OF IRON*.
   The sulphate, muriate, and acetite of iron, at their mini
mum of oxidation, may be obtained in a very easy manner
by means of the artificial sulphuret of iron. When artificial
sulphuret of iron is acted upon by muriatic acid, or sulphuric
acid in a state of dilution, or acetous acid, the sulphureted
hydrogen gas, disengaged during the process of solution,
prevents any hyper-oxygenated salt from being formed by the
action of the atmosphere ; and a clear fluid, in all cases, of a
shade of green, is obtained, which, when freed by heat from
any sulphureted hydrogen dissolved in          gives it,perfectly
                                                                  is a
white precipitate with the alkaline prussiates, and    not found
to alter the colour of solution of galls.
   To form the least oxygenated nitrate of iron,       means of   by
the artificial sulphuret, an acid of specific gravity not greater
                                         a
than I'I2 must be used and the solution must be made with

 phurated hydrogen, by being boiled for minute or two, and

then nitrated, it is found similar in its colour and physical
properties to the weakest solutions of the other oxygenated
salts.
    When the    sulphate and muriate of iron, at the minimum
of oxidation,   are obtained in the solid form, by evaporation
from their solutions, they appear in regular crystals, which
in each salt are a different (hade of a very pale green colour;
their tastes are exactly similar, being astringent, and leaving
in the mouth the sensation of sweetness.
    The least oxygenated nitrate of iron cannot easily be pro
cured pure in the crystallized state ; for when the solution of
it is heated for any length of time, a new arrangement of its
principles takes place ; portions of the acid and of the water
of the solution are decomposed ; in consequence of which
ammoniac is formed ; and an oxygenated nitrate of iron, with
excess  of base, is deposited.
    Amongst the salts of iron, at the minimum of oxidation,
I  have found the muriate the most convenient for exhibiting
the experiments of Proust, and in eudiometrical processes
 with nitrous gas.     It is more soluble in water than the sul
phate, and very much more soluble in alcohol.             D.
