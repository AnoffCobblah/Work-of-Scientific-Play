   The second principle is the equation of the curve surface of
the liquid under the influence of the capillary force.     When
a liquid is elevated above the general  level by capillary action,
the surface is always concave upward; on the contrary, it is
always convex upward, when the liquid is depressed below
the level. In either case, the distance of any point in the curve
surface from the level, is proportional to the sum of the cur
vatures estimated in any two directions at right angles to
one another. To speak more precisely,           normal     drawn     let  a                   be

amination; but to the law of the phaenomena, considered as
a general fact allowed to be consonant to experience.              Now
one of the most curious points in Laplace's theory of capillary
action*, is a demonstration, deduced from the equation of the
curve surface, which proves that the volume of elevated fluid,
or the space made void by the capillary force in the case of a
depression, is proportional to the interior periphery of any
cylindrical or prismatic tube immersed in the fluid. ' And it is
correct to affirm generally, that what is called Dr. Jurin's
theory, is no other than a mathematical consequence flowing
from the two principles we have laid down.
    There is one set of facts very proper to bring the exact
agreement of the mathematical theory with nature to a severe
trial. We allude to the depression of the mercury in the tubes
of barometers of various diameters.            The accuracy requisite
in modern     philosophical     pursuits   has drawn the attention of
experimentalists to determine the quantity of the depression,
in order to derive the true height of the mercury, from the
observed height.       In tubes from about one tenth of an inch in
diameter, to seven or eight tenths, the convex curvature of
the surface and the depression are found to vary very quickly
and notably; and the comparison of the theory with such a
series of connected experiments, cannot but furnish a delicate
test of   its
            exactness.     Here, however, difficulty occurs. The    a
mathematical determination                         of
                                       the depression       problem                is   a                of

any given matter.
   In the glass tubes of which barometers are made, 43° is
very nearly equal to 496, and 3 to 7; and the value of z at the
surface of such tubes, or the sine of the inclination of the mer
cury to the horizon, may be taken equal to 0-735.           These
numbers, which are very convenient, accord nearly with the
results of the best experiments, or at least approach to them
within the limits of the errors to which       such experimental                     all
determinations are liable.

III.  On the Thermal Waters of     the Alps. By R. BAKEweLL, Esq.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
      Gentlemen,
               we approach a range of lofty mountains, like that
WHEN    of the Pennine Alps, and observe the calcareous strata
on the outer part of the range, bent and contorted in various
directions; when we further observe beds of limestone and
puddingstone alternating and placed in an elevated position,
as we advance to the central part of the range; and that the
beds of granite in the central part are frequently vertical; we
feel assured that their present contorted or vertical position
is not the original one.       The opinions of geologists have been
much divided respecting the cause or causes that have elevated
 mountains and given a vertical position to beds that once
 formed the bottom of the ocean. Those who maintain that sub
 terranean heat has expanded and broken the solid crust of
 the globe, and has raised from vast depths the ancient bed of
 the ocean, appeal to a cause that is known to exist, and which
 seems sufficient to explain most of the various appearances
 which alpine regions present.
    In opposition to this theory, it is asserted that there are no
 remaining vestiges of the action of subterranean fire in the
 Alps;—but this I am convinced is erroneous. It is true that
 from near the source of the Rhone, to the foot of the Little
 St. Bernard, there does not occur any known rock of a vol
 canic character, with the doubtful exception of some rocks in
 the valley of Sass, and in the Valorsine.        I  have examined
 various parts of this range on the northern side of the highest
 mountains in the Alps, along a line of one hundred and twenty
 miles; and though I could discover no indications of the ac
 tion of subterranean heat in the rocks themselves, I was greatly
 surprised to observe, the numerous thermal springs that are
                                                          abundantly

          Mr. Bakewell               on the Thermal Waters              of the Alps.          15
abundantly gushing out at the feet of the primary mountains,
near the junction of the mica-slate, or the dark schist passing
into mica-slate with the lowest calcareous beds of that vast
series of limestone strata, which forms the outer ranges of the
Alps. Numerous as these hot springs are on the northern
side of the Alps, and not unfrequent on the southern side also,
it appeared to me remarkable, that they had hitherto been re
garded as isolated phaenomena; and their geological position
had not been noticed. It is true, some of the warm springs in
the Valais and in Savoy had been long known and visited,
but the greater number have been discovered since Saussure
published his Voyages dans                  les
                                   Alpes; and      appears probable,
                                                                   it
that they  would  every   where      found near the junction
                                             be                     the                  of
primary and secondary rocks, were            not for eboulements that
                                                         it

                                                   that torrents from
the glaciers have mixed with them, and reduced their tem
perature. Since         visited Savoy
                           I                1821 and 1822, another

of  Chamouni,              at

thermal springs were discovered            that branch in     the Alps            of
which extends to Grenoble.
I    shall here briefly enumerate the principal known thermal
waters    inthe Pennine Alps, and add some observations and
inferences, which trust will   I      acceptable  be  several     your  to             of
readers.
   NATERs       the Haut Valais.-The warm spring rises under

The thermal waters rise in great abundance from two springs
situated at the foot of a lofty calcareous mountain, and are
near the bottom of the great calcareous formation that forms
the outer range of the Alps: there are also numerous hot
springs in the vicinity, which the Sardinian government will
not allow to be opened.            Of the mode of douching at these
baths,      I
           have   given   a    particular   account in the first volume
of my Travels in Savoy, Switzerland, and Auvergne. The
thermal waters of Aix were well known to the Romans.

the warm saline springs at Moutiers ceased to flow for forty
eight hours. When the water returned, the quantity was
said to be increased, and the saline impregnation was weaker.
Former and more formidable agitations of the earth are re
corded in the Haut Valais, particularly in the district where
the principal hot springs are situated.         The last earthquake of
consequence in the Valais took place in January 1803.
     Iam informed that several of the retired valleys on the
Italian side of the Alps, at the foot of the central chain, are
subject to earthquakes, during which the ground has opened
or sunk down in various parts, though these effects have been
too local to excite attention at a distance.          From these facts
it seems as reasonable to infer that the thermal waters of the
Alps owe their high temperature to subterranean fire, as that
the hot springs in countries that have formerly been volcanic,
derive their warmth from an internal unextinguished, but
quiescent source of heat.         No person who has attentively ex
amined the     lofty  granitic  plain  to the west of Clermont Fer
rand in France, and observed the granite in various parts
pierced through by ancient volcanos that have poured cur
rents of lava over         surface,   its seen other parts where the
                                                             or

no one,      say, who has observed this, can doubt that the hot
              I

tains of the Alps the temperature may be slightly increased by
a cause hitherto unnoticed. In the upper part of the secondary
formations covering the granite, there are beds of gypsum,
and this gypsum is anhydrous; but when exposed to air and
moisture, it combines with water, and passes to the state of
common gypsum : and during this combination we may sup
pose heat to be evolved, but the process must be extremely
slow, and the heat evolved must be totally inadequate to raise
the temperature of powerful streams to 126°.       Saussure found
the temperature of the water in the lower part of the salt
mines of Bex, which are situated in the vicinity of gypsum,
to be four degrees of Reaumur higher than the mean tempe
rature of the earth.     It is not improbable, though Saussure
 was not aware of the circumstance, that this small increase of
temperature in the mines of Bex might be partly owing to the
 combination of water with gypsum: however, an increase of
temperature it is well known, is observed in deep mines, far
removed from the gypsum formation.
   In reply to what                  I
                         have advanced respecting the thermal
waters in the Pennine Alps, it may be said that few thermal
springs have been yet discovered in the northern range of the
Alps which form the Bernese Oberland; but the difference in
the geological structure of the two ranges will,      conceive, be              I
sufficient to explain why hot springs are more rare in the lat
ter, than in the southern range.      Most of the highest moun
tains in the Bernese   Alps   are covered with secondary strata;
and the  valleys are chiefly excavated in these strata, or in enor
mous beds of sandstone and conglomerate, that form a thick
intervening mass between the surface and the primary rocks,
sufficient to obstruct the rise of thermal waters; for it has be
fore been stated, that all the thermal waters in the Pennine
Alps issue from the primary rocks, or near their junction with
the lowest calcareous strata.

entirely on the influence of the quantity X, it is clear that p
which transforms one solution into the other must also de
pend on X, and for this reason cannot be arbitrary. Con
sequently the very first assumption of Lagrange is erroneous.
and the arguments which he founds on this assumption pro
ductive of error.   It is most extraordinary that mathemati
cians have for upwards, I believe, of half a century suffered this
to pass unobserved and uncorrected; and, as if to crown their
conduct with absurdity, have actually praised Lagrange's me
thod as the most perfect and general that could be given.
                 Verification of our own Solution.
   The simple manner in which we have, step by step, deduced
our general formula of solution cannot, we presume, leave a
doubt as to its truth. But since we have shown the failure of
Lagrange's method by differentiating one of his examples, it
is but fair that we should apply the same test to a similar ex
ample given by our own method.

     The metals used by me in the construction of the receiver
and conducting tubes, were, plate iron and tin, painted, to
prevent oxidation; and they were found to last several years.
   The above remarks are not intended to discourage im
provements in such instruments, but to prevent an erroneous
impression upon your readers.

     [We think that Mr. Taylor's expressions can hardly be
considered as intending to propose his instrument to super

   He describes his object      indeed         as

32               Dr. Prout    on the ultimate Composition
 ing before the Royal Society, a few observations on the origin
 and object of the whole series may not be deemed irrelevant.
    Many years ago I published an anonymous paper, contain
 ing some views, at that time new, connected with the doctrines
 of chemical proportions”.       Though this paper, for reasons
 which need not be here stated, was drawn up and published
 in a very hasty and imperfect manner, it attracted some no
 tice: and the views therein advanced gradually gained ground,
 and at present appear to be generally admitted in this country+.
 When this paper was published, it was my intention to have
 pursued the subject further, but I soon found my progress ob
 structed by insuperable difficulties. The first and chief of
 these was the want of accurate data; and the infinity of ob
jects comprehended by chemistry prevented the hope of ac
 quiring, by individual exertion, however unremitting, a suffi
 ciency for the establishment of general laws.        Professional
 duties still further limited my exertions, and at length obliged
 me to relinquish chemistry in general, and confine my atten
 tion solely to the chemistry of organized substances; a sub
ject that has occupied the greater portion of my leisure hours
 for the last ten or twelve years.
    Organic chemistry is confessedly one of the most difficult
departments of the science; and though much has been done,
 and more attempted on the subject, it is yet in a very imper
fect and unsatisfactory state; and it must be frankly admitted
that physiology and pathology have derived less advantage
from this most promising and really powerful of the auxiliary
sciences, than might have been expected.         To explain this
perhaps would not be difficult; but as the explanation would
be misplaced here,        Ishall merely observe, that, dissatisfied
 with the old modes of inquiry, I determined to attempt a
different one, and keeping in view the notions              I
                                                       had origi
nally formed respecting chemical combinations, proposed to
myself to investigate the modes in which the three or four
elementary substances entering into the composition of orga
nized bodies are associated, so as to constitute the infinite
 variety occurring in nature.
    With these views my first object was to determine the ex
 act composition of the most simple and best defined organic
 compounds, such as sugar, and the vegetable acids; a point
 that had been several times before attempted, but, as it ap

 peared to me, without complete success.       About the same
 time also albumen and other animal    products,  as urea, lithic
acid, &c. were examined with similar views. The subject of
digestion, however, had for a long time occupied my particular
attention; and by degrees             I
                              had come to the conclusion, that
the  principal  alimentary matters employed by man, and the
more  perfect  animals, might be reduced to three great classes,
namely, the saccharine, the oily, and the albuminous: hence,
it was determined to investigate these in the first place, and
their exact composition being ascertained, to inquire after
wards into the changes induced in them by the action of the
stomach and other organs during the subsequent processes of
assimilation. In conformity with this plan, the object of the
present communication is the consideration of the first class
or family above mentioned, namely, the saccharine.
Preliminary observations on the analysis of organized                            substances.
    Vegetable substances contain at least two elements, hydro
 gen and carbon; and most generally three, hydrogen, carbon,
 and oxygen. Animal substances are still more complicated;
 and besides the above three, usually involve a fourth element,
 namely, azote, to which they appear to owe many of their pe
 culiar properties. These general facts have been known ever
 since the elements themselves have been recognized as distinct
 principles, though the determination of the exact proportions
 in which they enter into any particular substance, has always
 proved a most difficult problem. To enumerate                that has          all
 been done       on
                 this subject would       loss   betime; and   of need                it

   The modes in which chemists have attempted to combine
oxygen with the hydrogen and carbon of vegetable substances
have differed very considerably.     The illustrious Lavoisier
attempted their union by burning the substance at once in
oxygen gas, a method subsequently followed by Saussure and
others.   Afterwards the metallic oxides were employed for
the purpose; and Berzelius in particular informs         that                                   us,           so

subject, in a detailed manner, to be instructive to men of business and
practitioners.   It is evident, from the repeated instances of dreadful
explosions, failures, and misapplications of capital, which have hap
pened (even recently), that engineers as a body are not yet suffi
ciently informed on this branch of their art. Whilst on the other
hand, the continued success of the best engineers proves that real
skill does exist amongst them, and may be expected to be attainable
by others, with study and proper instruction.
   As a means of such instruction, the present work cannot fail to pro
duce public good.
   The importance of a scientific guide to students and young prac
titioners cannot require to be pointed out. Merchants, manufac
turers, and men of business, who must call in the aid of engineers to
construct engines and apply steam power for them, may easily gather
as much knowledge from such a work as will enable them to dis
tinguish between those who are competent to execute what is re
quired, and others who will be likely to lead them into similar errors
to those by which so many have suffered.      And it will be a most im
portant aid to practical engineers, in directing those studies by which
they may render themselves competent to execute what they under
take.
    At present, many who are well acquainted with the mechanical
 structure of steam-engines, and are even accustomed to make them
 in established forms which they have copied from others, have only very
imperfect and even incorrect notions of their operations when in use;
they are in the condition in which a physician would be who had only
studied the anatomical structure of dead animals, without much know
ledge of the physiology and pathology of their living functions. Such
 engineers often succeed very well in their ordinary business, and ac
quire a reputation which their knowledge will scarcely bear out, when
they are required to depart from their established models, and make
such modifications of their parts as is necessary for applying steam
power to new purposes.                                                                                ...   ',

                   of the seconds' pendulum in London and
difference in length
Paris; by Capt. E. Sabine, Roy. Art., F.R.S.”
• The author commences    this paper by a brief statement of
the existing state of the determinations of standards of length
in the two countries; and he observes that an attempt made by
 M. Arago in 1817 and 1818, to bring into immediate com
parison the standards of the two countries, proved inconclu
 sive, from the rates of the pendulums not having been obtained
with sufficient exactness.      The author having obtained from
 His Grace the Master-General of the Ordnance a general leave
of absence from his military duties, so long as he could be use
fully employed in scientific pursuits, conceived he could in no
way better satisfy the condition than in carrying into effect this
purpose. Accordingly, being provided with two pendulums,
one made by M. Schumacher, another the property of the Board
of Longitude,-he set out for Paris, whither the pendulums were
forwarded to him. The comparison was made in Paris at the
 Royal Observatory, in the Salle de la Meridienne, on the spot
in which M. Biot's measurement had been made, and every
proper facility and assistance was afforded him. The coinci
dence clock was compared every twelfth hour by M. Mathieu,
with the transit clock of the Observatory. On the 27th of April,
the weather having set in mild and steady, the experiments
 were begun.      The results are stated in the form of appended-
tables, of which a detailed account is given.
    Each of the pendulums, when not used in observing co
incidences, was employed in determining             rate      journey

a  comparison     of M. Biot's and Capt., Kater's direct measure
ments of the seconds' pendulum, in Paris and in London,
comes out 11*76; or conversely, the length of the seconds' pen
dulum observed by the former in London transferred to Paris,
by an assumed retardation of 12°, gives a length differing from
M. Biot's by 0”00028. Borda's agrees within Oin-O0079 with
M. Biot's; and Capt. Kater's, so transferred, holds very nearly
a mean between the two, but approaches rather nearer to
Biot's than to Borda's.                 .              -

    The peculiarity noticed by the author, consists of a valvular
apparatus formed by delicate angular processes of the mucous
coat of the lower part of the ductus communis choledochus and
 of the pancreatic duct; which he detected by slitting open
 these tubes under water, and washing off the adhering mucus.
 The effect of this structure is to prevent any retrograde mo
j.

       delicate probe may be made to descend through the ducts
 with facility,          its

tion but not to exclude the air, at the end of eight months
the sulphuric acid was found saturated with copper, and the
bar covered with a thin crust of black oxide. With nitric
acid there was also a considerable deposition of protoxide of
copper on the bar, together with a little crystallized sub
nitrate, and a very minute quantity of metallic copper. With
the muriatic acid, depositions similar to those with the nitric
acid took place, the submuriate being very abundant, and cry
stallizing as in the native specimens of this mineral from Peru.
   The author considers the complicated results produced by
the presence of atmospheric air as referrible to electro-che
mical action, arising from the reaction -upon each other of
the combinations       formed.
   A paper was likewise read, entitled, “On the structure of
the knee-joint in the Echidna setosa and the Ornithorhynchus
paradorus; by G. Knox, M.D.F.R.S.E., communicated by
 Sir James MacGregor, F.R.S.”
   After a short review of the labours of comparative anato
mists on the animals which are the subject of this memoir, the
 author describes a peculiarity of structure which was discover
 ed by his brother in the knee-joint of the Echidna, consisting
of an extension of the ligamentum adiposum, or re-duplica
tion of the synovial membrane transversely across the whole
joint, dividing it into two cavities which have no distinct com
munication with each other. The articular surfaces of the up
per cavity are the patella and the anterior portions of the con
dyles of the os femoris, while the lower are formed by the  in
ferior and superior surfaces of these condyles, the upper sur
face of the tibia, and the semi-lunar cartilages.  In the Orni
thorhynchus paradorus, the double fold of the synovial mem
 brane extends only half-way across the joint, thus constituting
an intermediate link of gradation between the Echidna and
Man, in whom the ligamentum adiposum is wholly within the
                           -
Joint.

      We have also to lament the loss of two of our Fellows, con

   the Earl of Morton, and the Bishop of Carlisle.
      The first-in addition to his own merits possessing a stron
  hereditary claim to our regards, as the descendant of Lor
   Morton who presided over the Society about sixty years ago,
  —assisted in our labours; and contributed his aid, with Lord
   Macklesfield and other distinguished persons, in 1752, to as
   similate our Style or Calendar to that used by the continental
  nations of Europe. To the individual of whom death has now
  deprived us, we owe much gratitude for his uninterrupted
  countenance and attention during a long series of years: and
  in the Transactions for 1821 will be found a communication,
  by Lord Morton, of a curious fact in physiology.
     Dr. Samuel Goodenough, late bishop of Carlisle, has ever
  sustained the character of a sound and elegant scholar.          En
  trusted with the education of distinguished personages, and
  having qualified them for the first situations in the state, he
                                                ºf:
 fairly and honourably ascended to the summit of ecclesiastical
  preferment. To classical and theological learning, Dr. Good
 enough added a very intimate                    of natural history,
  as is manifested by a communication to the Linnean Society,
 where his labours have thrown a steady light over an exten
 sive genus of aquatic plants, left by                all

gret.-Colonel Beaufoy may be considered an exception. That
gentleman is well known to have devoted his time and attention
to practical astronomy; and having confined himself to certain
departments, in these he is said to have greatly excelled. His
observations of stars occulted by the moon, and of eclipses
of Jupiter's satellites, are believed to form the most complete
series any where to be found; and such observations are very
essential for completing the theories of these respective bodies.
—And here it is not irrelevant to mention, that, by the libera
lity of his son, (professionally engaged in other pursuits and in
other countries,) the instruments so well used by Col. Beaufoy
are now bestowed on the Astronomical Society.
  Two Fellows of the Society demand, however, our special
notice—The Rev. Abram Robertson, and The Rev. John
 Hellins.
    Dr. Robertson first appeared in the town of Oxford as a
 practitioner of medicine: but his abilities and mathematical
 attainments    soon attracted    notice.     He   was induced to       be
             gº
 come a member of the University; was admitted into orders;
received a chaplainship of Christ Church; and became lec-                    .
turer in            first to the College, and afterwards to the
 University. In due course Dr. Robertson became professor
 of    mathematics, and finally astronomer at the Radcliffe Ob
 servatory.    We have in our Transactions various proofs of
 Dr. Robertson's diligence and abilities. Two papers “On a
 demonstration of the laws given by Sir Isaac Newton for ex
panding a binomial.” This expansion, justly esteemed of the
ºutmost importance as the foundation of every other, and as
 developing the whole system of fluxions, has received various
 elaborate demonstrations, the great author having simply con
tented himself with the annunciation. Among those of the same
 date none are more clear or satisfactory than the one given by
 Dr. Robertson: nor does it detract from his merit, that sub
 sequently others have been devised in the general expansion of
functions, more concise, and perhaps more immediately urgent
 of conviction on the mind. We have a third paper “On
the precession of the equinoxes.”     A fourth, showing “A              di
 rect method of computing the excentric from the mean ano
 maly.” Ahd a fifth, demonstrating “A theorem in spherical
 trigonometry, given by the late Dr. Maskelyne.”        But the
 great work of Dr. Robertson is his Treatise on Conic Sec
tions;-following the geometric method of Apollonius among
 the ancients, and of Hamilton in our own times, by deriving
 all the properties from the cone itself.  As        an

   The Rev. John Hellins was one of those extraordinary men,
who, deprived of early advantages, have elevated themselves
by the force of genius and of industry to a level above most
persons blessed with regular education. Mr. Hellins at one
time computed for the Nautical Almanac.             He afterwards
assisted at Greenwich.    And what is now perhaps almost un
known, he furnished the late Mr. Windham with             the calcu               all
lations and tables          on
                       which that   gentleman    brought      forward

    Professor Volta has enjoyed the rare and enviable felicity
of  founding    a new science. Mr. Galvani had indeed observed
the extraordinary effects            peculiarly modified electricity,
                                        of                                                      in

                               electricity chemically produced; and
this   opinion   has been     satisfactorily    demonstrated           the        by            in

perturbations re-establish themselves in short intervals: but
others of less magnitude are extended by the peculiar form of
their coefficients through periods extremely long. Those mea
sure what had previously been termed secular equations, sup
posed to vary as the squares of their distances from some as
sumed epoch.       Since the Méchanique Celeste has enlightened
the world, empirical equations have disappeared; and others
corresponding with the true principles of rotary movements
have assumed their place.          Among these, as similar in their
nature, may be included the two great equations of Jupiter
and Saturn, each corresponding to the attractive power of the
other planet, as is ascertained by the periods and distances of

    The attention of our great philosopher        was by a natural pro
gress carried on to a consideration of            the tides, which ex
hibit phaenomena in apparent direct opposition to their cause;
and which remained utterly incapable of solution till the dis
coveries of Newton disclosed the powers of centrifugal and
centripetal forces.      La Place, in the investigation of this most
interesting, curious, and important problem, has not only taken
into account the declinations and parallaxes of both the great
luminaries, but also the oscillations of fluids in transmitting
motion as connected with their depths.               And hence he has
been enabled to form a          probable    conjecture   respecting the
depths of our great oceans.           From    investigating   the laws of
 Nature as displayed by the heavenly bodies, La Place de
scended to a subject not less difficult or intricate, the action
of particles on each other in capillary attraction, and in the
transmission of sound.         And in a separate work he has ex
hausted, by the most ingenious expedients, a subject scarcely
 less profound than either of the former,          the doctrine of pro
 babilities.    I  do not notice  separate   memoirs and communi
 cations to Societies, most of which are embodied in his subse
 quent works.        He is said to have contemplated a rigorous
 mathematical survey of the atomic theory, as developed by
 definite proportions.       But the fate common to humanity has
 interposed. La Place has lived sufficiently long for his own
 fame: but no extension of his life would have satisfied the
 expectation or the demands of science.            The time is not ar
 rived, nor can I presume to assign to this extraordinary man
 his rank among those that are no more.             Yet, speaking from
 this place and on this occasion,      I will say, that Newton holds,
 and ever must hold, the highest station in the fane of philo
 sophical renown. That to him
                 Non viget quicquam simile aut secundum.
  But although the second niche must remain unoccupied, yet
  one approximating to that of Newton will hereafter become
  the elevated station of La Place.

  The principle of varying or modifying chemical energies
by those of electricity has been applied by the invention, in a
manner the most philosophical, and on a scale the most ex
                                                                                -
tensive.
   The copper sheathing of ships and vessels had been found
to corrode in the short period of a single voyage, being con
verted   into an oxide through the medium of some acid, or at
least of a decompounded substance, occupying the negative
extremity of the electric scale. The copper must therefore be
positive in respect to the body decomposed or attracted.     A
reference was made by the Government to the Royal Society,
with the hope of discovering some remedy for this most serious
evil.   Grounded on a perfect knowledge of chemical and of
electric powers, it immediately occurred to the illustrious dis
coverer of their relations one to the other, that if a substance
                                                                                         bybe

induction,       be
                 rendered less positive, and therefore indisposed
to  combine with any other negative body.                       .
   Experiments the most satisfactory were then made                                 on

the one displayed by the original discovery          of magnetism itself,
in the connection that it bears to         electricity and in the induc

experiments should be repeated in different places, and espe

     Lieutenant             Foster, well known to this Society by
the cooperation he afforded to Captain Basil Hall in deter
mining the number of vibrations made by an invariable pen
dulum near the equator, and at several other stations; having
 shared in the dangers of Captain Parry's second voyage,
 eagerly seized the opportunity afforded by a winter residence
 at Port Bowen, on the eastern side of Prince Regent's Inlet, in
 lat. 73° 14', to ascertain the rate of an invariable pendulum,
 to conduct an elaborate course of experiments on magnet
 ism; and in addition to these, observations on refraction.
     One is utterly astonished at the magnitude of these labours,
 and at the accuracy and care with which they were conducted,
 (as is manifest from internal evidence,) in a situation where
 comfort and ease were unattainable, and where peculiar dif
 ficulties presented themselves at every step.            It is impossible
 for me to give an abstract of Mr. Foster's most ample and
 detailed communication: I must refer every scientific inquirer
  to the paper itself. Among                 its
                                        important contents are:—The

     Nov. 9.—Mr. Baily presented a paper “On the right ascension
 of y Cassiopeas.” . As this paper is a short one, and of an interesting
 nature we shall give it nearly in the words of the author:
     “On comparing the Catalogue of Stars, recently published by
 this Society, with the Catalogue of 100 principal fixed stars given
 by Mr. Pond, at the end of the Nautical Almanac for 1829,            I  was
 struck (he says) with the considerable difference which appears in
 the AR of y Cassiopea, , Mr. Pond making the AR of that star up
 wards of one second (in time) more than the Catalogue printed by
 this Society.             I
                  At first imagined that some error might have crept
into the calculations of the Society's Catalogue, notwithstanding
they were made by two computers, independent of each other, and
afterwards revised by our indefatigable secretary, Mr. Stratford.
I  therefore, for my own satisfaction, went through the whole com
putations myself, and was pleased to find that there was not the
slightest difference in the results.    I next reduced the whole of the
observations of that star made by Mr. Pond at the Royal Observa
tory at Greenwich, and found them to agree very nearly with the
result, deduced by Mr. Taylor, who makes the mean of 10 ob
servations to be = 0" 46" 13°,23 reduced to Jany. 1, 1825: whereas
the Society's Catalogue gives only Oh 46m 12,13 on January 1,
 1825; being a difference, as already stated, of 1,1. Bradley has
on the very day that the medal was delivered, His Royal Highness the
Lord High Admiral was graciously pleased to advance Mr. Foster to the
situation of a commander, and to assign him a ship for a voyage of scientific

5 observations of this star, and Piazzi has 46. It is scarcely possi
ble that Bradley should be in error one second of time: and still
less probable that the mean of 46 observations by Piazzi should be
erroneous to such an amount. The result of Bradley's observations
(after, allowing for the effect of precession) differs 8",5 in space
from those made by Piazzi; which quantity, divided by 45 (or the
interval of years between the two observers), will make the annual
proper motion of the star, if it really have any, about 0", 19 in
space.    But, this is not confirmed by the recent observations of
 Mr.  Pond;   and we must look elsewhere for a solution of the diffi
 culty. That the position of a star of the third magnitude should
 be so undecided at the present day that      AR cannot      satisfac   its                      be

66                        Astronomical Society.
     A paper  was read “On double object-glasses; by M. Littrow.”
     The first part of this communication is devoted to the derivation
  of the equations expressing the conditions proposed by Mr. Her
 schel for the destruction of the aberration of sphericity in a thin
 double object-glass, by the ordinary processes in use among the
  German geometricians for such investigations. The author states
 himself to have entered on this investigation with a view to disse
 minate a knowledge of the theory alluded to in his own country;
 but being induced thereby to resume some former investigations of
 his own, he takes the opportunity to communicate to the Society
 his own principal results.
     Taking for granted the well-known expression of Euler for the
 aberration of a lens of two surfaces, and developing it in descending
 powers of the distance of the radiant point from the lens, he obtains
 expressions, from which, by proper management, and substitution
 of similar quantities for a second lens, he derives the two final equa
 tions (A) and (z) demonstrated by Mr. Herschel.           He then                 pro
 ceeds to the main object of his paper. This may be briefly stated
 to be the embodying of the relations expressive of the refraction
 of a ray through any four spherical surfaces, however situated,
  (provided they have a common axis), in trigonometrical equations,
 in which no quantity is regarded as small, and of course nothing
 neglected. These equations are in themselves sufficiently simple
 when undeveloped, and in that state may very readily be applied
 to determine whether any proposed construction of an object-glass
 really does satisfy the essential geometrical conditions of a perfect
 telescope, by producing a rigorous union of different coloured rays,
 and rays incident on different parts of the object-glass. Accordingly
 the author instances their application to a construction recently
 proposed by a German optician, as of peculiar excellence. In this
 construction the indices of refraction of the crown and flint lenses
 being respectively 1:53 and 1.60, and their dispersive ratio 0-25, the
thickness of the crown lens 0:01, that of the flint 0, and the lenses
 being supposed in contact, the radii of the surfaces are
       For the crown...... 1st surface (convex) 0.69281
                              2nd surface (convex) 2:255319
       For the flint........ 1st surface (concave) 1.543030
                              2nd surface (concave) 5-768005
Substituting these data in         his
                                  equations               he
                                                 finds that they satisfy
sufficiently well the conditions     achromaticity, but that they are
                                         of

of trial and error, a method perfectly correct in theory                    as well as
easy in practice.
   M. Littrow exemplifies this theory by applying it to that parti
cular case when the indeterminate problem is limited by the condi
tion of Klügel, viz. that the refractions at the first two surfaces
shall be as small as possible, in which case the first or crown lens is -
in fact wholly given, and it only remains to determine the radii of
the flint.  He takes into consideration the thickness of the former,
but not the latter, lens, and neglects also their distance inter                                                                  se.

of His Majesty's principal officers of state—a man, whose qualities of
head and heart have rarely been equalled, never surpassed; and of
whom both the Society and the British nation may honestly be proud.
Such a Monarch and such a Minister will never be backward to further
the interests of Science, when paramount claims shall happily cease to
divert the current of national treasure into other channels, and when
increasing prosperity shall relax the strict bands of public oeconomy,
by which their natural impulses are at present checked and circum
scribed. If proof be wanting to support this assertion, we need only
turn our eyes a short space northward, for indisputable evidence of the
inclination of His Majesty's Government to further the views of the
Zoological Society: and it is peculiarly gratifying to me to inform
you, that in addition to the ground already allotted for the gardens
and vivaria, final arrangements have been very recently completed,
for the grant of the lake and                  its

                                            RUSSIAN PLATINA-SAND.
    Professor Breithaupt has given the annexed mineralogical ex
 amination of this substance.
           I
       was favoured by M. Schwetzau with a quantity of the platina
 sand, washed out of the sand of Nijnotaguilsk, in the government
 of Perme, in Siberia. Of this Siberian sand there are two kinds:
 the one is ferriferous, and contains platina; the other, which is
 purer and more quartzy,     afforded principally     remarkably fine wash
                   -                          -

    The platina-sand, even at first glance, appears composed of grains
of different kinds.                        I
                        separated, by the eye, the following minerals:
 1. Platina. 2. Gold. 3. Irid-osmine.            4. Silver-white flat grains.
 5. Iserine, or magnetic iron-sand.
    The grains, from their appearance, could not have rolled far, and
must have been found at no great distance from the place of their
 origin, for many of them are very sharp-edged, or even bristled
with points.
    1. Platina-grains.—I attempted to separate these from the iserine
grains, by means of the magnet; but was surprised to find that not
only the iserine, but also many of the platina-grains, adhered to                                                  it.
I  found that some                     of
                        the platina-grains were magnetic, others not:

           figure was nearly that           ellipse, with the ends

      The colour      the body resembled that

much more brilliant, were continually issuing from the ball of the

eight, or possibly ten seconds.

was it accompanied by any perceptible coruscations during the hour of
observation.
   In the mornings of the 22nd and 23rd the ice lay pretty thick on the
ground, and icy efflorescences appeared on the inside of the glass windows
(being the first time this autumn), which were succeeded by a frosty haze on
the latter day, and a light shower of snow in the evening. This was the
earliest fall of snow observed here during the last twelve years.     Several
showers of snow also fell in Northumberland on the 21st, and much more
fell between London and Manchester on the 22nd and 23rd.

INobserved   a paper by Mr. Henry Stokes “On some new
double chromates.”    The three compound salts which he de
scribes as double  chromates, in fact contain merely a small
quantity of chromate of potash, or rather of chromic acid in a
state  of mechanical mixture. They are the three salts which
I   have described in my First Principles of Chemistry, vol.                                                    ii.

                                        determine the nature         all                     of
the salts formed. The rest was the result of an obvious cal
culation.
   From Mr. Stokes's experiments would appear that similar
                                                       it

The excellent twenty-inch     telescope of this instrument is fur
nished with   cylindrical rings,  a delicate spirit-level, and very
fine  adjustable  (steel?) cross-wires.—It is supported in the
Ys of a cradle (common to theodolites of this description)
having a horizontal axis four inches in length. A clamp and
tangent screw, fitted to one of the supports of this axis, serve
to give a slow vertical motion to the telescope”.        The lower
of the six-inch horizontal circles is divided (on silver) into
thirds of a degree, capable of being read off to half-minutes by
means of the two opposite verniers of the upper circle and a
pair of double magnifiers. The latter are very conveniently
fixed to a ring moveable about the rim of the under circle.
The upper circle is also provided with a clamp and tangent
screw for slow horizontal motion, and has a couple of spirit
levels placed at right-angles to each other, which with the
four screws of the parallel plates enable the observer to render
the plane of contact of the two circles parallel to the horizon.
On the upper parallel plate is fixed a third clamp and tangent
screw, intended, no doubt, to bring the cross-wires of the te
lescope, the circles being clamped together, with some parti
cular degree coincident with the zero of one of the verniers,
exactly on the observed object.

equal to Uminus P, and the correction must be applied to P
with the negative sign, in order to make USP greater than
 UTP by the angle of correction SPT. These corrections
being applied to the readings for the different signals, we
form a new register, whence we can immediately find by sub
traction (as before) the angular distance of any two of the sig
nals as observed from S in lieu of T.
    On referring to the distances of some of the more remote
signals from the theodolite-stations as measured from different
bases, discrepancies, amounting in some instances to upwards
of 100 feet, will be remarked. These differences were occa
sioned in a great measure by the signals having a diameter
too inconsiderable for the distance, so that the vertical wire
in lieu of bisecting, appeared to efface them *. The formula
adopted for obtaining a proper mean of such of the different
measurements of a distance as were remarkably discordant,
requires to be explained.
    In order to find the distance between the point e and the
 inaccessible object a, measure from e in different directions

any number of bases, as ABC, and observe at the two ex
tremities of every base the inclination of that base to a line
passing through the point of observation in the direction of
the inaccessible object.       With these data we shall be able to
calculate from each base an independent measure of the re
quired distance;—but supposing the observations to have been
subject to a small uncertainty, limited, for instance, to one
minute, required the probable error of each of the respective
calculated distances?
    By trigonometry, 180° minus the sum of the angles taken at
the ends of any one of the bases will be equal to the subtense

XV.     On   Mr. Herapath's Method for  the Integration                                 of Linear
                Equations with constant Coefficients.
THE    integration of linear equations with constant coeffi
  cients engaged the attention of analysts very early in the
progress of the Integral Calculus. The subject has been treated
of so often and so ably, that we can hardly expect any addi
tion to our knowledge of it either new in principle, or very
interesting in the details. . It would not therefore have been
necessary to notice particularly the communications of Mr.
Herapath published in the last two Numbers of this Journal,
if he had not fallen into an inadvertence respecting Lagrange's
investigation, of which it seems proper to advise the public.

Of these three parts Mr. Herapath has calculated only the

first, which      says must separately satisfy the proposed equa

might have been rightly inferred that must separately satisfy     it

YoUR   Correspondent Mr. Herapath has endeavoured to
  prove that Lagrange has fallen into an error in his in
tegration of linear differential equations, and expresses his sur
prise that mathematicians have for upwards of half a century
suffered this to pass unobserved.      Skilful mathematicians will
not take Mr. Herapath's word for his bold assertion without
examination, and will then easily detect the fallacy of his rea
soning: but as your readers are not              them mathemati                 all   of

                                           Qf     Sugars.
  Many analyses of sugar have been published by different
chemists, no two of which agree with each other. These dis
crepances   have doubtless arisen from various causes, though
one cause has probably been some real or accidental difference
in the composition of the sugars employed”.           How many
distinct varieties of sugar exist I do not pretend to know, but
there are at least two, (independently of the sugar of milk,
manna, &c. which belong to another series,) and probably
there are several others; and it is to the mixture or combination
of these in different proportions, and the frequent presence of
foreign bodies, that a good deal of the confusion respecting
the composition of sugar has undoubtedly risen.
   Cane Sugar.—The strongest and most perfect sugar that                                                     I
am acquainted with, is sugar candy carefully prepared from
cane sugar. This, purified by repeated crystallizations from
water and alcohol, and deprived of the little hygrometric
                                I
   * Some years ago published an analysis of sugar, in which the propor
tions of carbon to water were stated to be to one another as 40: 60.             was                    I
not aware at that time of the differences       existing   among   sugars,   and the
results given were founded on the analysis of a specimen of remarkably fine
looking sugar candy, a quantity of which I had purchased and kept by me
for several years for the purposes of experiment”.         At length my stock be
came exhausted, and I was surprised to find on analysing other specimens,
that they in general contained upwards of one per cent. more of carbon
than what I had before examined. This induced me to recur to the notes
of my former experiments, but I could detect no material error in them;
and though       I
                 readily admit that the apparatus I then employed was much
less  susceptible                                          I
                   of accuracy than what now use, cannot help thinking    I
that the candy itself was partly in fault, and that it was prepared from an
imperfect sugar, probably from the East Indies.
   There was also another circumstance which contributed to mislead me,
not only in this but in             all
                              my other results, viz.     inaccuracy an    the weight        in

which very nearly coincides with what by calculation it ought
to have given, on the supposition that the loss of weight was
owing to the escape of water, a circumstance indeed of which
there could have been little doubt. Starch however in this
state still retains water, a portion of which may be separated
by subjecting it to higher temperatures.      Thus, after having
been  exposed    as above  for twenty-four hours to the tempera
ture of  212°,  on  being further submitted to a temperature be
tween 800° and 350° for six hours longer, it lost 2:3 per cent.
more, and analysed in this state gave very nearly

                 Lignin, or the Woody Fibre.
   Messrs. Gay Lussac and Thenard first showed that the hy
drogen and oxygen in this principle exist in it in the propor
tions in which they form water, a result fully confirmed by
my experiments.     The variety of forms in which lignin occurs
in different woods is so great, that an examination of them all
would be quite out of the question; I therefore selected two,
viz. the woods of the Boa and Willow, which appeared to pre
sent the greatest contrast; the one being among the densest,
the other the lightest of the woods.   These were both treated
exactly in the same manner; that is to say, they were first re
duced to the form of a coarse powder by rasping, then well
pulverized in a Wedgwood mortar, and afterwards sifted.
Being by these means reduced to the form of impalpable pow
ders, they were boiled in repeated portions of distilled water
till that fluid came off unchanged: a tedious process, requir
ing several days to accomplish perfectly. After this they were
similarly treated with alcohol, and finally again with distilled
water. They were now exposed to the atmosphere, when in
a dry and favourable state; and when they ceased to lose
weight were submitted to analysis, and found to consist                                           of

108                     Dr. Prout   on the ultimate Composition
 that the hydrogen and oxygen exist in it in the proportions in
 which they form water. Some experiments which                made                       I
 many years ago appeared to render this probable; but from the
 difficulties attending the analysis of this acid, and the uncer
 tainty arising from the properties of the oxideofcopperformerly
 stated,      I
             was unable to satisfy myself completely on the sub
ject. On repeatedly burning, however, a very fine specimen
 of the acetate of copper, in a given bulk of oxygen gas, with
 the apparatus described at the commencement of this paper,
 it was found that the volume of the gas underwent no change,
 and hence, that the above opinion was correct.

    Some travellers        #.
                           reported, that water-spouts rise out of
the  sea; having   observed them, perhaps, only when the spout
had descended and was in contact with the surface; or it might
happen, that in such a case the tornado might be first generated
below ; and before the clouds were acted on, a column of spray
would be seen to rise and approach the clouds, before a co
lumn of water is formed in them of sufficient density to de
scend. Similar appearances are sometimes seen on shore, when
columns of dust, or, as the writer has often witnessed, even
cocks of hay are carried up into the air by whirlwinds to a
great height.
    So frequent were these meteorous appearances during this
part of the voyage, that on one occasion (when in sight of
 “The Rabbit and Coney,” two small islands in the Straits, well
known to navigators), no less than five water-spouts were seen
from the ship at the same instant! some of which were falling
 on the land, and others on the sea;—the nearest to the ship
 being computed to be at the distance of five miles. The writer,
 who attentively observed these phaenomena, used an excellent
 perspective glass, and on one occasion had an opportunity of
 seeing one while the sun shone upon it (about 7 A.M.), which
 appeared to be tubular; as the sun's rays were reflected in a
 double parallel stripe along that part of the spout on which
 they shone, viz. one stripe reflected from the exterior side next
 the sun, and another less bright from the interior surface (as
 was supposed) of the opposite side. This, however, is only a
 surmise; but from similar motions of fluids which may be seen
 at any time, there may be reason for supposing that the spout
 is not solid: for instance, if a hole be made in the bottom of
 any vessel, and plugged up with the end of a stick;            the     let
 vessel    be
           filled with water and the plug withdrawn, the water
in  escaping through the aperture soon assumes         circular
                                                              a               or
 rathera  spiral  motion, the descending   column  draws,     more     or
 properly speaking, admits after            inverted cone
                                           it   an              air,   of
 reaching from the surface         of
                                 the water    the holeto   which  at          it
escapes.
     The   idea preventing the approach (for these phaenomena
                     of
are seldom   stationary)         of
                               water-spout upon

                                   be
from the gun   would counteract and break the sweeping cur
rent of     §.tornado, and thereby dissipate the motion-em
bodied fluid, and     course prevent
                          of                    its
                                         effects.

    Many ideas occur             the beholder
                                          to             such “elemental      of
strife.” Moses hath told us, that soon after the creation “there
went        up mist from the earth, which watered the whole face
                 a
of  the ground;” and this necessary alternation                   the ascent                   of
and descent of the element of water has continued ever since.

IT     cannot fail to strike every philosophical observer of na
     ture, that the greater number of changes which take place
in the universe are effected only in a gradual manner; that
each event is connected by insensible differences, both with
the one which immediately precedes, and the one which im
mediately follows                 it;
                          and that we may hence infer that the

           Dr. Roget                 on a Violation                   of the Law of Continuity.                                      119
      The simpler illustrations of this law                                                are obvious, and must
readily occur to those who seek for them; but it is important
to familiarize the mind to them, with a view of preparing our
selves for the inquiry to what extent the principle admits of
being carried, and whether it be really, as it is pretended, a uni
versal law. It appears to obtain without exception in                       those                                           all

  120    Dr. Roget on a Violation of             the    Law of Continuity.
    Not content with establishing the universality of this law by
 induction, Boscovich has endeavoured to prove it by other
 arguments, of a still more positive nature, derived from abs
   tract considerations. This universality, he says, arises ne
   cessarily from the very nature of continuity. The limit which
  joins the precedent and the consequent of any thing is com
   mon to both, and is therefore indivisible.        Thus, a superficies
   separating two solids has no thickness, and is that in which a
  transition from the one to the other occurs; a line, dividing
  two portions of a continued superficies, has no breadth; a
  point, discriminating two segments of a continued line, has no
  dimension of any kind.        So it is with regard to time: for the
  limit of two consecutive portions is common to both and                         in
  divisible; and as every change of a variable quantity from one
  magnitude to another must be made in time, so every change
  must participate in the continuity of time.           But to every mo–
  ment of time, a certain magnitude of the variable quantity cor
  responds, and the limit of two moments of time is common
  and indivisible; therefore the limits of two magnitudes, corre
  sponding to these two moments, must, in like manner, be com
 mon and indivisible.        Moreover, it is impossible for any quan
 tity to have two magnitudes at the same time, and when con
 tinually varying, that it shali have the same magnitude at dif
 ferent times; much more impossible, therefore, that in the                       li
 mit of two moments of time it shall have two magnitudes, the
 one course pending to the precedent, and the other to the
 consequent moment; or shall not have gone through the                            in
 termediate magnitudes in the intermediate moments of time.
 For the same reason, a body cannot have two velocities at the
 same time, and therefore cannot have two velocities in the                       li
 mit common to two moments of time; and when continually
            of its
 changing        velocity, cannot have the same velocity         different

continuity is essentially universal, and that a breach of it is
metaphysically, as well as physically, impossible.
   The severest test to which the validity of this mode of rea
soning can be put, is to apply it to the pure mathematical re
lations of space and quantity, to which, if the law of continuity
have any necessary existence in the nature of things, it ought
to apply with the greatest rigour. We find, accordingly, that

    A portion of the slag was digested in aqua regia: the greater
part of it was dissolved, with evolution of sulphuretted hydro
gen gas, whilst a considerable number of the small cubes of
titanium remained undissolved, having a perfect metallic lustre.
 But besides these, there remained in the residuum a blackish
powder, containing grains and minute laminae, nearly of the
colour of silver, and having a metallic lustre, to which I shall
return in the sequel. Another portion of the slag was ignited
with nitre, in order to oxidate the titanium. The melted mass
dissolved in water gave a beautiful green solution, which, when
exposed to the air, soon assumed first a deep red, and then
a dark violet colour, and at last lost all colour *, whilst por
tions of the protoxides of manganese and iron were deposited.
Subsequently, this deposit (marked a) and the sides of the
vessel became covered with fine crystalline iridescent laminae
and needles, probably titanate of potash precipitated by the
substances having attracted carbonic acid from the air.
    The residuum of the dissolved mass in the porcelain crucible
was washed and dried, by which it assumed the colour of iron
rust. It was partly dissolved in muriatic acid, and thereby
gave a solution of iron, and left a blackish powder (b).       The
filtered strongly  alkaline re-acting liquid  was  evaporated, and
mixed with nitric acid (c). After standing somewhat longer,
it gave crystals of nitre, and then others of an indistinct form.
They were mostly white, somewhat opalescent, not easily solu
ble grains of salt, cracking and decrepitating between the
teeth, and which, with salt of phosphorus, were melted before
the blowpipe into a clear bead, which within the flame re
ceived no colour, either by itself or mixed with tin.      The so
lution was rendered somewhat turbid      by  caustic ammonia,  and
white flakes were deposited.     Boiled and dissolved with pot
ash, and acidulated with muriatic acid, infusion of galls pre
cipitated it of a dark yellow; but hydrosulphuret of potash and
ferroprussiate of iron gave no precipitate; which leads me to
suppose that those grains of salt were tantalate of potash.
    The fluid c had the following properties. With an alcoholic
infusion of galls, a yellowish-orange precipitate was formed,
                                    É.
which was dissolved on being heated; and when it was con
 centrated, it gave a brown              which remained clear on
     *
shown that the iron between the laminae of the cubes of pure titanium had
been mechanically interposed; whence (like Wollaston) he also explains     its
magnetism.
 *  The cracks  of the crucible contained beautiful orange-red efflorescence
                                         a
in needles, which were not examined. Were they manganesate         of potash,
or           oftitanium with sulphuret  ofpotassium? (Wid. Berz.Jahresber.

cooling.     Sulpho-cyanate of potash dissolved in alcohol pro
duced a red colour; with a greater addition, a dark rose colour;
but with impure sulpho-cyanate of potash (still containing ferro
prussiate of potash), a greenish white precipitate; with the
ferroprussiate of potash itself a dark grass green precipitate,
which was in part dissolved in the remaining liquid, giving it
the same colour; and it was also dissolved by nitric acid. This
last solution turned gradually brownish green". Another so
lution made with muriatic acid, gave, by contact with a cylin
der of zinc, the usual indications of titanium.
    The black powder b was digested in aqua regia, which ex
tracted the iron and manganese, leaving however a consider
able proportion of a black powder, which under the burnisher
gave an iron-gray streak of a metallic lustre, became inflamed
even before it arrived at a red heat, and yielded a whitish sub
stance, which, with a few deviations, bore the characters of
 tantalic acid. These deviations were probably produced by a
 small portion of manganese, which was indicated in the trial
 by the blowpipe.
    I  subsequently obtained, through the friend above men
 tioned, a larger quantity of slag containing titanium. It had
 a still greater quantity of large and small regular cubes of
 titanium, which were affixed on the outside as well as to the
 inner cavities of the slag. They had nearly              the same regu
 lar form and the rose       copper   colour,   except            a all
                                                           few very small
 groups, which tended somewhat                     orange tint, and had

both these metals are so scarce, especially tantalium, I have
thought it of use to call the public attention to this slag.
    It is not improbable but that the titanium originated by re
duction from prototitanate of iron and manganese, and the
tantalium from the tantalates of the same bases (tantalite). It
would be a very meritorious performance, and highly important
to the geology of Silesia, if any one would institute a strict ex
amination of the iron ore which yielded this slag, as well as of
byits
    locality, and the process     smelting             of

 Greenwich since the erection of the new transit instrument, and as
computed by the solar tables of Delambre, which are used in the
computation of the Nautical Almanac, with a view to the discovery of
the errors in the elements of those tables.       The result of the compa
rison at first indicated the necessity of a correction of the epochs of the
sun's longitude, and of the longitude of the perigee, and perhaps also
of the equation of the centre. But upon pursuing the examination
through a series of years, it became manifest that some other source of
irregularity existed, and that this could be no other than an erroneous
 estimate of the masses of some of the planets, especially of Venus
 and of Mars.      A more critical examination showed that there was
 also an error in the assigned mass of the moon. It was found necessary
in these investigations to take into account an error which occurred in
 the tables with regard to the secular motion. It results from the au
 thor's researches that the epochs for 1816, and those for 1821 to 1825,
 ought to be increased respectively by 4",734 and 5",061 ; that of the
 perigee increased by 46",3, and the greatest equation of the centre
 diminished by 0",84; the mass of Venus should be reduced in the
 proportion nearly of 9 to 8, and that of Mars nearly in the proportion
 of 22 to 15. On a comparison of these results with those which have
 been derived from an examination of some of Dr. Maskelyne's ob
 servations as given by Burckhardt in the Connaissance des Tems for
  1816, they are found on the whole to agree in the most satisfactory
 manner.                            -
    Dec. 13.—A paper was read, entitled, “On the measurement of
 high temperatures; by James Prinsep, Esq., Assay Master of the
 Mint at Benares, communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D. Sec. R.S."
    In the commencement of this paper the author describes the many
 abortive endeavours of former experimenters to obtain instruments for
 the accurate admeasurement of high temperatures,          and afterwards
 describes several attempts of his own to effect this very desirable ob
ject.    In the course of his inquiries a remarkable fact presented     it
 self in the change which occurred in an index constructed on the
 compensation-principle, and formed by two slips of metal, the one
 of silver, the other of gold, originally quite pure, and united without
 any alloy.    In the course of a few years, although it had never been
 subjected to a very high temperature, the surface of the gold became
converted into an alloy of silver, the impregnation        extending gra
 dually to a considerable depth in the gold, and destroying the sensibi
lity of the instrument to changes of temperature.
    After trying various plans, he gave the preference to the one
founded on the following principles: namely, that the fusing points
of the pure metals are fixed and determinate; that those of silver,
gold, and platina, comprehend a very extensive range of tempera
ture; and that between these three fixed points in the scale, as
many intermediate ones as may be required, may be obtained by
alloying the three metals together in different proportions.        When
such a series of alloys has been once prepared,         the heat of any
furnace may be expressed by the alloy of least fusibility which it is
capable of melting. The determinations         afforded by a pyrometer

of the snail being perfectly smooth, there are no appendages to do
the office of feet; and the whole of the body moves at once, and not

Mr. Main was enabled to observe a muscular motion; but this, in

animal's motion cannot be caused by impulses in the direction of                                                                      its

      The object of this paper is to describe the geological structure and
 relations of a group of rocks which the author characterizes as “aber
  rant from the slate district of Cumberland,” and extending about
  fifteen miles towards the east under the summits of Greygarth, Ingle
 borough, and Pen-y-gent,           a tract remarkable for the variety and sin
 gularity of     its geological appearances, among which the proofs                                  of
 dislocation are peculiarly striking and important.

 of the Ribble, ranges an almost continuous line of argillaceous rocks,
 generally fissile, and belonging to the third division of slates above
 mentioned.       This tract is bounded on the north by the elevated strata
that support the summits of Greygarth and Pen-y-gent; and on the
 south (in consequence of great dislocations) by millstone grit and the
 coal measures.        If the rivers Lune and Wharfe are included, no fewer
 than nine streams cross the district from north to south, and exhibit
 very distinctly the structure and relations of the rocks; the greater
 number of the streams cutting through the limestone and millstone
 grit, exposing the subjacent slate, and finally passing                       the de                        off

dykes in Northumberland; and of carbonate of strontian in the lead
measures at Fallowfield near Hexham, by William Hutton, Esq. of
 Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
    The author discovered “Chlorophæite” in a basaltic dyke near the
 river Coquet, about two miles N.E. of Felton, in the form of small
 nodules, which upon fracture exhibit the changes of colour and ap
 pearance mentioned by Dr. MacCulloch, who first found this mineral
 in the Isle of Rum.      This substance has also been observed by the
"author at  Coaley  Hill near Newcastle, in the steatitic or earthy form,
 and but  rarely crystallized.

 Dec. 14.—Aletter was read from Maj. Hodgson the Surveyor-General
of India, dated from Calcutta, April 18, 1827, accompanied by two
copious lists of astronomical observations. The first contained a series
of transits of the moon and some of the principal fixed stars, as ob
served at his own house (situated 5 seconds in time, east of the
Flag-staff of Fort William) from November 18, 1826 to March 20,
1827, both inclusive. The observations are above 300 in number :
and the stars observed are not those which are usually denominated
moon-culminating stars, but consist of some of the principal stars
only; and many of these situated occasionally at very considerable
distances from the moon in declination.          In fact, the list of moon
culminating stars has never yet been computed early enough to en
able it to be sent to such distant places in sufficient time for the ob
servations.    It is therefore to be feared that correspondent observa
tions of  many    of the stars observed by Major Hodgson may not be
found at the observatories in Europe. The results of the transits are
regularly computed by Major Hodgson, agreeably to a printed form,
where every step of the process is minutely laid down, and of which
he has forwarded to the Society two examples.        It is Major Hodgson's
intention to continue his observations for one whole year at least,
and to transmit them to the Society, together with the daily compu
tations showing the results.       The instrument employed was a 31-inch
transit by Dollond; but he is in expectation of a more powerful one
shortly from England. The second list contained a series of upwards
of 200 observations of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites taken by gen
tlemen in the civil service, and by officers of the Bengal army, at dif
ferent times and at different places.      The dates extend from July 18,
1795 to April 11, 1827; and the names of the observers are given,
together with the length, the aperture, and the magnifying power, of
the telescope employed.         Major Hodgson states that he shall trans
mit several others as soon as he can collect them :      for (he observes)
“observations       ofthis kind have been        of
                                                 much use  in   determining
geographical positions        this widely extended country; and the pro

  A paper    was also read, entitled “On the computation of the geo
centric  places of the planets for ephemerides:" by J. F. Littrow.
   The usual mode of computing the geocentric places of the planets
for ephemerides consists in instituting a first computation of their
heliocentric positions, which are then reduced to geocentric by well
known formulae. To avoid the very laborious calculations entailed
by this process, Prof. Gauss devised a method much more expeditious,
and which gives at once the geocentric right ascensions and declina
tions, as well as the distance of the planet from the earth, in terms of
the co-ordinates of the earth and planets at the instant of observation.
The equations expressive of these relations are stated by M. Littrow,
and are extremely simple. By them, the right ascension (a), the de
clination (?), and mutual distance (£) are given directly as follows:
                            tan a      _=   _Y + y
                                             X+r

X, Y, Z being   the co-ordinates of the earth, and r, y, z of the planet.
  Now it is obvious, that if we neglect the perturbations (on which
neglect it will be observed the application of this method mainly de
pends),     all   these co-ordinates are, ultimately, functions respectively                                 of
the mean longitudes          of the earth and planet, and their values may

  While we request you to accept our congratulations, we deeply
lament the occasion of our illustrious townsman's resignation.
   Be pleased, Sir, to take an early opportunity of conveying to Sir
Humphry Davy our condolence on his illness, and our sincere wishes
for his restoration to perfect health, and to the exercise of those
faculties which he has employed to the noblest purposes—the en
largement of the boundaries of human knowledge, and the gaining
for his name the most enviable kind of immortality (such is his own
estimate) “that which is connected with the gratitude and blessing
 of his fellow-creatures."
   May the enjoyment of health enable you, Sir, to continue for
 many years in the discharge of the high situation in which you
 have been so honourably placed, with happiness to yourself, with
 satisfaction to your associates, and with benefit to the world.

learned   through   the Bulletin Universal for     September,   p. 178,   that
Signor Bellani had observed the same fact in 1813, and published it

    “Sulphur presented the same phaenomena as phosphorus; frag
 ments of sulphur always produced the crystallization of cold fluid por
 tions.   Having withdrawn the bulb of a thermometer which had been
plunged into sulphur at 120°, it came out covered with small gobules
of sulphur, which remained fluid at 60°; and having touched these
one after another with a thread of glass, they became solid; although
several seemed in contact, yet it required that each should be touched
separately. A drop of sulphur, which was made to move on the bulb
of a thermometer, by turning the instrument in a horizontal position,
did not congeal until nearly at 30°; and some drops were retained
fluid at 15° i. e. 75° of Reaumur below the ordinary point of lique-
faction.”—Quarterly Journal, Jan. 1828, p. 469.
                ELEMENTARY NATURE           OF BROMINE.
    Iodine colours a solution of starch blue, bromine renders a similar
solution orange colour. M. A. de la Rive added a few drops of bro
mine to a solution of starch coloured blue by iodine, and obtained a
compound which gave two distinct colours with starch—one brown,
the other yellow; the difference of colour corresponding with the two
bromides of iodine described by M. Balard. These compounds of
iodine and bromine, dissolved in a solution of starch, were subjected
to the voltaic pile : immediately the yellow solution became blue
about the negative pole and orange about the positive pole, indicating
the separation and places of the iodine and bromine.     Thus the small
est quantity of iodine may be discovered in bromine; but when the
experiment was resorted to, to prove whether the idea thrown out,
that bromine was a compound of chlorine and iodine, was founded in
fact or not, it gave no such indication, and a solution of bromine in
starch electrified for along time together, gave no appearance of iodine.
Hence M. de la Rive concludes, that bromine contains no iodine, but
is an element analogous to iodine and chlorine. When bromine and
iodine are combined, the former passes to the positive pole, and is
consequently more negative than the latter; which accords with the
observation of M. Balard, that it should occupy a place between chlo
rine and iodine.       According to the Bulletin Universel, when the
letter to M. Arago, containing an account of the facts above referred
to, was read to the Academy of Sciences, that body decided that the
assertion of M. Dumas, that bromine was a compound of chlorine and
iodine, should be considered as retracted, and that it should be so
entered upon the proces-verbal of the sitting.—Ibid. p. 466.
             QUANTITY OF BROMINE IN SEA water.
    One hundred pounds of sea water, taken up at Trieste, treated by
chlorine, ether, &c. according to M. Balard's process, produced five
grains of bromide of sodium, or 3.278 grains of bromine. It would
appear, that in the sea water of Trieste, the bromine is unaccompanied
by any iodine; and the same is the case, according to M. Hermbstadt
with the waters of the Dead Sea. In the water of the Mediterranean,
on the contrary, iodine always appears with the bromine—Ibid.p.466.

             ELECTRICITY OF           THE ATMOSPHERE. GASES AND
     M. Pouillet concludes from numerous experiments: Ist, That
gases give out electricity, when they combine together,          when they                               or
unite with solid      fluid bodies; and

always gives out positive electricity, and the combustible body, what
ever  it may be, gives out negative electricity; and reciprocally, when
a  compound       decomposed, each

electricity which    had given out,
                            it            the opposite state     electricity.

charcoal which is contained in vegetables does not give out less elec
tricity than charcoal which burns freely, one may conclude, says
M. Pouillet, as my direct experiments tend to prove, that over a sur
face of vegetation 100 metres square, more electricity is produced in
a day, than is necessary to charge the strongest electrical battery.—

                     NEW CHLORIDE OF MANGANESE.
   M. Dumas obtained this compound by putting a solution of man
ganesic acid into contact with sulphuric acid and fused common salt,
Water and the new chloride are formed; the former is retained by
the acid, the latter volatilizes in a gaseous form, with a greenish tint,
and when passed into a tube cooled to 5° or 4° of Fahrenheit, it con
denses into a liquid of a brownish-green colour. The most simple
process appears to be to form a common green chameleon, to convert
it into red chameleon by sulphuric acid, and to evaporate the solution,
which will give a residue consisting of sulphate and manganesate of
potash. This mixture acted upon by concentrated sulphuric acid
produces the solution of manganesic acid, into which the common salt
is to be thrown in small pieces until the vapours which rise are co
lourless; the latter effect is a sign, that              all

cated with the battery and galvanometer by platina wires; and the
deviation of the needle was scarcely sensible.     A few drops of bro
mine were then added to the water, which soon imparted a yellow
colour to the water; being now included in the voltaic circuit, the
galvanometer needle was deviated 70°, and an abundant disengage
ment of gas took place from the platina wires. There were oxygen
and hydrogen in the usual proportions, showing that water only had
been decomposed.     From these experiments it results, that a body
which conducts voltaic electricity very imperfectly, namely, pure water,
may be rendered a good conductor by holding in solution a very mi
nute quantity of a perfectly non-conducting substance, namely, bro
mine : the same fact occurs with iodime, and iodine and water.

                EFFECTS OF HEAT UPON SULPH.U.R.
   According to M. Dumas fused sulphur begins to crystallize between
226° and 228°; between 230° and 284 it is as liquid as a clear var
nish, and of an amber colour; at about 320° it begins to thicken, and
acquire a red colour; on increasing the heat, it becomes so thick,
that it will not pour. This effect is most marked between 428° and
572°; the colour is then a red brown: from 572° to the boiling point
it becomes thinner, but never so fluid as at 2489; the deep red brown
colour continues till it boils.   When the most fluid sulphur is sud
denly cooled, it becomes brittle ; but the thickened sulphur similarly
treated, remains soft, and more soft as the temperature has been
higher. Thus at 230° the sulphur was very liquid and yellow ; and
cooled suddenly by immersion in water, it became yellow and very
friable; at 374° it was thick, and of an orange colour; but by cooling
became at first soft and transparent, but soon friable and of the or
dinary appearance : at 428° it was red and viscid; and when cooled,
soft, transparent, and of an amber colour; at the boiling it was deep
brown red colour; and when cooled very soft, transparent, and of a red
brown colour. It is not necessary, as is sometimes stated, to heat
                                                           to all
the sulphur a long time to produce this effect;    depends upon tem
perature.    The  only precaution necessary          is,
                                                   have abundance                                 of
water, and divide the sulphur into small drops       portions, that the
                                                              or
cooling may    be rapid.  If   it   be

    General Observations.—The weather to the 24th inclusive was remark
ably mild for the season, but windy and wet, five inches and a quarter of
rain having fallen; and on several days before the winter solstice it was
remarkably dark, from there being no opening in the prevailing strata of
 clouds to admit the passage of the solar rays.
    Early in the morning of the 12th there was a thick fog, which gave out
a   very  strong sulphurous smell: the 29th was also distinguished by a cold
 dense fog throughout the day and might.                                           -
     The last spring tides were high in Portsmouth harbour, and along the
 southern coast, also at Liverpool, and along the western coast, in conse
 quence of so great a fall of rain, with accompanying south and south-west
 gales. The highest spring tide was a few minutes before 12 P.M. on the 18th,
 although it was the first after the change of the moon. The rain on the-
 18th, 19th, and 20th continued fifty hours without intermission.
     On the 21st and 22nd, thunder storms, with lightning and hail, were ex
 perienced in several places in Hampshire.
     On the 25th a parhelion appeared at mid-day on the western side of the
 sun, when the cirrocumulus and attenuated cirrostratus clouds were beauti
 fully tinged with faint prismatic colours thirty degrees distant from the
 sun's centre.
     The marimum temperature of the external air occurred in the nights of
 the 3rd, 7th, 9th, 13th, 15th, 17th, 21st and 23rd, instead of in the days.
 These frequent occurrences rendered the circumstance remarkable and de
 serving an explanation.        It seems to be influenced by the sun's position in
 the zodiac at this time of the year; the temperature of the ground at and
 near the surface; and the inosculation of the sea air with that over the
 land in the evening, just before the coming on of rain from the western
 side of our meridian.        1st. The sun's meridional altitude in this latitude in
 December varies from 16 to 173 degrees, and from so great an obliquity
 of his rays, or so small an angle, that from this altitude they make with
  the horizon, only three or four degrees of thermometrical heat are pro
  duced near the earth's surface, more than the temperature of the ground.
 2ndly. The temperature of the atmosphere in a wet December like the
 present, depends very much on the temperature of the ground, and the
 quality of the prevailing vapours, which, if humid and accompanied with
 mild currents of air, then the temperatures of the ground and air are
 found to coincide nearly. 3rdly. If under these circumstances of tempera
  ture and condensing state of the lower medium of the atmosphere, the
  sea air should unite with the land air on the approach of rain after sunset,
  on any day in December or January on which the temperature of the air
                                                                                 has

has been rather low, there is a great probability, from the sea        being                                           air
warmer than the land air, that the marimum temperature will happen                                                                in
the night instead      the day.
                             of    in
  Long solar lights and shades were very conspicuous half      hour before                                  an
sunset on the 30th, and moved round the sun,        westerly direction, like     in   a
the spokes      large wheel
                 of   a       slow motion. This singular appearance was
                                                in
 no doubt caused               by
                        brisk wind blowing against the eastern side
                                    a                                                                                         of   a

rays had previously impinged and were reflected)         give     revolving       so      as   to           it   a

   These reflected rays repeatedly varied       length, perhaps from the un

         Sir,
    THE  following trifle, extracted from my memorandum-book
      of many years standing, may perhaps (as a mere curiosity)
    be favoured with a place in your Journal. It exhibits an easy
    method of deriving these bodies from a modern discovery in
    spherics; and it illustrates the extreme generalization attached
    to algebraic expressions.
       Montucla and other writers on mathematics, attribute to
    Albert Girard, about the year 1629, the discovery of this very
    curious property of the sphere:—That if the whole surface of
    the sphere, or what may be considered as           subtense from   its
                                        of of by
    the centre,      be
                   represented     eight right angles;   then will the
    subtense from the centre      any figure,      the surface    on
                                                                   the                 of
    sphere bounded        by
                         arches    great circles, equal the excess                           of
    the spherical angles above the plane angles formed             the                 by
    chords  of               discovery applied      recent times with
                                                                  in

                three planes     the least must meet
                                       at                each solid          at

    angles, and consequently the sides would expand themselves

 into one plane. The same would take place with four squares
 and with six equilateral triangles.
    The solid angles or points of               solids bounded   all      regular                   by
 equal and similar sides, must then consist either                  three, four,
     five equilateral triangles. Of three squares.
    or or                                                             tetragons,            or of
    of   three pentagons. And consequently the number                       these                        of
 finite bodies cannot exceed five.                  -
    That five such actually exist,             thus proved.     is
    When three equilateral triangles meet                      point, the three   in   a
 equal spherical angles must,               complete space, amount each

 gles therefore          each spherical triangle will equal four right
                              of

                        be                                                                                        of
 plane triangle.         The solid angle therefore               the centre            at                      of a
 each     spherical    triangle   will subtend one        quarter   part       the                        of

     If   four equilateral triangles meet                  point, the angle at   a                               of
 each     spherical    triangle   must,   for the same reason,                this                  be   in
 case     aright  one.   Consequently,      the three angles         each sphe               of
 rical triangle will equal three right angles,                  one right angle   or   be
    in
    excess         the three angles
                    of                                   of
                                               plane triangle. The solid

 subtend      one-eighth    part     the surface of      the sphere, and the of
 solid must be an octaedron.
     If five equilateral triangles meetin point, the angle              a    each                        of

XXVII.      On the Ellipticity of the Earth as deduced from Ex
  periments with the Pendulum.      By J. Ivory, M.A. F.R.S.*
  N the Conn. des Tems 1830, lately published, there is a no
    tice of experiments made with an invariable pendulum, by
M. Duperrey, in the course of a voyage round the world. The
places of observation are not numerous, and one only, namely,
Toulon, is a new station. But, in the present state of this                                                 in
quiry, no less instruction is to be reaped from the repetition
of the experiments at the old stations, than from the extension
of our knowledge by new observations.          If we could com
pare the lengths of the pendulum determined          different ob
servers on the same spot, the errors to which such experi
ments are liable would become known, and we should be able
                                                                                      .

the earth can be investigated by this mode of experimenting.

   The pendulums in this table at Ascension and the Isle of
France coincide very nearly with the lengths previously de
termined by Captain Sabine and M. de Freycinet.       From
some cause or other, they are both anomalous, and they are
treated as such by M. de Freycinet and M. Duperrey, being
left out in computing the ellipticity which they adopt. But
the other three pendulums fall within the limits laid down in
this Journal for October 1826, and increase the number of
instances that come under my formula to 31, out of 40 the
total number of experiments that have been made.       My for
mula was originally constructed from 26 experiments; and
                                                       of it by
all the pendulums since determined      M.      Freycinet, Mr.      de
Foster, and M. Duperrey, agree with      within the prescribed
limits, except      in
                  the three instances   the islands     Mowi,                    of
Guam, and the Isle        France, which are greatly irregular
                             of
and irreconcileable with the other experiments.          there                 It    is

   At Port Jackson       the pendulum determined by M. Duperrey
is less than the      length    found by M. de Freycinet, and ap
proaches nearer to the pendulum at Paramatta, to which it
ought to be very nearly equal: and this proves the justness of
the remarks            I
                    made relative to this point at pp. 351, 352, of
this Journal for November 1826.
    Comparing the results obtained by M. Duperrey and M. de
Freycinet at the same stations and on the same spot, the pen
dulum of the former observer at the Falkland Islands is longer
than that of the latter by 00233; and, at Port Jackson and
the Isle of France, the pendulums of the former are respec
tively less than those of the latter by .00145 and '000.95. We
may therefore conclude, that such experiments are liable to
an error amounting from 002 to 003 in the length of the pen
dulum, or from two to three vibrations in a mean solar day.
We are sure that the error may amount to the quantity men
tioned; but it may be much greater. At Ascension the dif
ference between the pendulums of Captain Sabine and M. Du
perrey is very small.
    In deducing the ellipticity of the earth, M. Duperrey com
bines his own experiments with M. de Freycinet's, exclusively
of those made by other observers. The results he obtains
vary between the limits gig and gºn. Upon the whole he
concludes that the two hemispheres of the earth are similar,
and he fixes definitively upon gåg, or gºn, as the ellipticity
common to both. But on examining the calculations of M. Du
perrey, it will be found that the ellipticity he adopts, depends
entirely on the equatorial pendulum determined by M. de                                            .

                                   we suppose that the pendulum at
 Rawak errs in      excess,    which is very probable, and diminish
its  length    by  correcting     the possible error, the ellipticities
will come out of less quantity in                    all

to f. The mean of the nine stations must be an approxima
tion sufficient for our present purpose. Let 01330 be sub
stituted for A in the equation (2), then = -2057, which will               f
serve for a first value of f. Now put
                             a = 01330,                          A =       a +        S,

s and r being the corrections of the approximate quantities:
then since A and                     f
                        must satisfy the equation (2), and a and
b likewise satisfy the same equation, we get,

error is at Drontheim, and it is       nearly as much with the ellip
ticity gia. The next greatest error is at San Blas; but this
would be considerably diminished by adopting the length
found by Captain Foster, viz. 39.03881, instead of the mean
of the lengths found by that gentleman and Captain Hall,
which stands in the table.        The excess at Galapagos is little
greater than the defect at Drontheim; and as we know that
the former pendulum was determined in unfavourable cir
cumstances, the experiment seems to be sufficiently well re
presented by the formula.          We may therefore affirm that, if
we    adopt   Captain Foster's  pendulum     at San Blas, the formula
represents 35 experiments out of 40, within the limits of the
probable errors: for the difference between the observed and
 the calculated lengths is less than what would arise from an
 error of 2 vibrations in a mean solar day, except at Sierra
 Leone, Jamaica, San Blas, Bourdeaux, and Spitzbergen, where
 the error is 24 vibrations; and at Drontheim and Galapagos,
 where it amounts to 3% and 4 vibrations. But at the five ano
 malous stations, the errors are between 6 and 10 vibrations in
 a dav.
     Without laying any stress on the mode of investigation we
 have here followed, it cannot,        I think, be denied that the el
 lipticity gºrz represents the observations much better than
 gºa; it ought therefore to be adopted until another shall be
 found, if it be possible, that will represent the same observa
 tions still better, or until future experimental researches shall
 have corrected and enlarged our present knowledge on this
 subject.     What other reason can be alleged for preferring one
  ellipticity to another?
      But if the experiments can be represented within the limits
  of the probable errors, what becomes of the splendid specula
  tion about local attraction, which connects the apparent in
  equality of
                #.      with the variation of the soil. It is evident
  that we can have no measure of the excess or defect of gravity
  caused by the attraction of the adjacent matter, if the errors
  of observation be sufficient to account for the irregularity in
 the length of the pendulum. This theory too is quite uncer
  tain, so long as there remains any doubt about the exact quan
  tity of the ellipticity.    At Maranham and Trinidad, Captain
  Sabine makes the observed pendulums gain upon the calcu
  lated ones upwards of 4 vibrations in a mean solar day; in
  my table the acceleration is only 14, which may be attributed
  to the inaccuracy of experiment. According to the same gen
                                                               tleman,

             as deduced from Experiments                          with the Pendulum.                      173
tleman, the observed pendulum at Spitzbergen falls short of
the calculated one 3; vibrations in a day;-in my table the de
fect is only 24. The density of the matter near the surface of
the earth, varying at the different stations of the pendulum,
must in some degree influence the time of vibration: but the
speculation is premature; and there is good reason to think,
at least in far the greater number of cases, that the effect in
question will never be separated from the unavoidable errors of
                                                                       -
 observation.
    What has just been said will not, however, apply to the five
anomalous experiments,                      all
                                      which show  of     excess      gravityan                 of

                                                     experimental error.
 Besides,      two at    the stations the pendulums have been veri

                    is                  all the five cases, and

 pagos, there             excess
                         is     an    gravity; and, according
                                                  of                      my                         to

                      like  excess,  though    much less       quantity,              in                     at
  Rawak, Sierra Leone, and Jamaica. On the other hand, there
 appears          to     be

 three      defect;
            of       and we    may   suspect    that there     some cause
 of  error, different from local attraction, tending           make these             to is

        The thermometers            I use are two double registers,               one made
    by Newman, and the other by Cary, which are placed in a
    north-eastern aspect, in such a manner as not to be acted
    upon by reflected heat.
        My rain-gauge is placed in my garden at the level of the
    ground, entirely free from the influence of buildings or trees.
    The gauge is exactly six inches diameter at the edge of the
    brass rim at the top. The basin is made of pewter 2% inches
    deep.       The tube attached to the basin is three inches long,
    tapered to about ºth of an inch at the point. The measure is a
    glass cylinder graduated to a quarter of an inch of water, or
    1784 ºr grains, nearly 1784.796 grains.

        Gentlemen,
          finished another new                 Decade,
                                       viz. the eleventh,
HAYING
  of new Succulent Plants, which may now commence a se
cond century of them,         I
                           lose no time in forwarding it to you,
as  under; hoping   it may  soon find a place in your very useful
Annals.
   The Decade contains, as usual, a regular and scientific dis
tribution and description of ten distinct species of Succulent
Plants; all, as far as my long experience enables me to deter
mine, perfectly new and unrecorded. And no less than eight
of these fine plants are from our old and most productive
source, the Cape of Good Hope; where Mr. Bowie, detected
them, and succeeded in transmitting them to the royal gardens
of Kew, where they are now flourishing, and where the de
scriptions were made from the living plants.
    Of the native countries of the two remaining plants which
constitute the Decade,         I
                           am not quite so certain.   But if they
are not both from North      America,  one of them at least, viz.
the Yucca, is probably from thence, as the greater part of                 its
noble genus has been found there.
                              remain, Gentlemen, yours, &c.

fresh water and marine shells intermixed. This deposit” may
naturally be allowed to mark the highest tide of those days. And
if it is found that the present levelof high water is below the more
 ancient one in the valleys, it is proved at once that the ocean has
receded at that particular district; but if the levels are found to
 be nearly the same, it will be proved that the sea has been ex
 cluded, and thus set the question completely at rest: at present
 I lean towards the latter opinion, from circumstances in some
degree similar on the Kentish coast near Hythe. The sea was
known to have come much nearer the hills formerly, than it now
does; but the level of the Military Canal proves that the level
of high water has not decreased, and that the change has taken
place by the formation, by the ocean, of natural barriers of
shingle, over which it very rarely flows, and even then in such
small quantities as to be harmless; whilst the lower parts of
 Romney Marsh are liable to inundations to a great extent when
 ever a breach is made in Dymchurch, or the other walls:
thus adding proof that the sea has not decreased on this coast,
 but is kept out by natural and artificial boundaries.
    It would add to the proofs, if the mean of the low water
 level was also carried on, and the bottom of the ancient sandy
 deposit bored to, and measured.

  XXXI.      On the Measurement by Trigonometry of the Heights        of
    the principal Hills in the Vicinity of Dent, Hawes, and Sed
    bergh, in Yorkshire.        By JoHN Nixon, Esq.
                           [Concluded from p. 95.]
 THE        vertical angles were measured by the horizon-sector,
        described in the Philosophical Magazine, vol. lix. p. 130.
    At Noughtberry Hill the instrument stood upon a large
 square board screwed firmly to the tripod of the larger theo
 dolite, and at Pen-y-gent it was placed upon the well-built
 wall crossing the summit of the hill; but at the other stations
 a flag firmly fixed upon the signal-tower reduced to an alti
 tude of about four feet, formed the rude yet incomparable
 stand.
     Formerly the minute error of adjustment of the levels, which
  was found to vary with the temperature, was ascertained when
 on the point of setting out for the station, and a register of the
 thermometer kept contemporary with the observations.               To
 this plan two objections existed: the error of adjustment might
      I
    * mean the upper surface of the one Mr. Robberds mentions, in speak
 ing of the soil of the meadows and marshes; as “the lowest bed of their
soil is sand in which marine shells are found.”                         -
                                                                  have

have varied on the route; and the thermometer would rarely
indicate the precise temperature of the levels, necessarily                                                            ex
posed on bright days during a pair of observations alternately
to the sun and the shade of the instrument. Some time ago
the original levels were replaced by two superior ones (by
Dollond), with tubes so nearly cylindrical as to require little
or no correction for temperature”. To avoid the other source
of error, when the instrument had acquired at the station
the temperature of the air, the telescope was placed with
in     Ys
       its      slight angle
                     ata          elevation+. The left index being
                                                   of

                                    elevation read off, the telescope
was inverted, and the right index similarly levelled and read off.
The telescope was subsequently taken out              the Ys, and re                   of
versed      position,
                in    when the indices were once more levelled
and read off. With the levels correctly adjusted, the angle                                                                of
inclination would       the same  be    the four readings;     by  the                                       or  if
sum     the two angles read offbefore the telescope was reversed,

                   the two succeeding measurements,           compen

           error would    exist; otherwise one-fourth        their dif                                of a
ference would give the mean error            the levels, additive to,   of
 or                              elevation, according
                                                   or of
   subtractive from angles                                 the second                             as

           of                     fell short    the first pair.  Thus          of
at Dod Fell the readings were:                                                              -

 192    Mr. Nixon      on the Measurement by Trigonometry          of the
pendicular to DC, draw through D the corresponding hori
zontal line DH'. The angle formed at E or D by the meet
ing of a straight line passing through any point, and a hori
zontal line situated in the same vertical plane, is termed the
elevation or depression of that point, according as it lies
above or below the horizontal line: thus the angles HED,
H'DE are both depressions. To find by trigonometry the
difference of altitude of DE, no more data are required than
the lineal distance EE' or DD', and the depressions HED,
H'DE; or, simply, either of them, provided we have also
given the terrestrial arc EVE, or angle ECE. Through C
draw a line perpendicular to the chord of equal altitude or
level E'E, which line, from the properties of the circle, will
bisect the contained arc (at V). Make EC’ parallel to WC,
whence VCE or half the arc will be equal to CEC.                        As
HEC and EEC are both right angles, the horizontal line
EH will be elevated above the chord of level EE by the angle
HEE = CEC= half arc. It is also similarly demonstrable
that the horizontal line DH' must be elevated above the chord
of level DD by the half arc DCV"-VCE, and that the angle
DDE, as the chords DD, EE are parallel, will be equal to
DEE) the angular difference of level. The depression at the
upper station will consequently exceed the angular difference of
level by the half arc, and the elevation at the lower station will
be equally in defect; whence the depression must exceed the
elevation by the contained arc, and half their sum will be equal
to the angle DEE. When both angles are depressions, that
at the upper station (or larger one) is the half arc plus DEE,
and the other is the half arc minus DEE, so that their sum
equals that of the half arcs, and half their difference the angle
DEE. With this angle, the distance EE, and the angle
EDE(=90°plus half arc"), we get the side ED or difference
of altitude. When one only of the angles is given, the dif
ference of the half arc and the depression (considered as an
elevation when the former exceeds the latter), or the elevation
increased by the half arc, will give the angular difference of
level+.

                                          of the Law of Continuity.

THE   severest test to which the validity of this mode of
 reasoning can be put, is to apply it to the purely mathe
 matical relations of space and quantity, to which, if the law
 of continuity have any necessary existence in the nature of
 things, it ought to apply with the greatest rigour. . We find,
 accordingly, that            all
                           the changes        magnitude   of    those quan

 tities  of which the value        dependent
                                          is          that          on
                                                               certain other
 quantities, accompany corresponding changes                    these latter
 quantities        inmanner strictly conformable with the law
                        a                                                                                    of
 continuity.     The same exact correspondence also obtains
                                                                    allof
 with   regard     the geometric relations

angles, surfaces            .#
                           volumes.       Thus,        the trigonometrical
lines which are functions            the arcs of   circles,  undergo regu
                                                                 of

  of the figure C, until they both coalesce in the centre. In
  the next series of changes, we find them again separating
 from each other; but instead of moving in the same line as
  before, we observe them starting off, each in a new direction,
 CP and CO, precisely at right angles to their former lines of
 motion, AC and BC; and this change of direction is made
 abruptly, per saltum, and by an angular motion. Are not
 these changes direct violations of the law of continuity?

XXXIII.         Additional Discussion respecting the Ellipticity of
    the Earth as determined by Experiments made with the             Pen

INlengths
       deducing the figure of the earth from the observed
              of the pendulum, I have always thought it neces
sary to leave out a few of the experiments that were incon
sistent with the rest.         The inconsistency is proved by com
paring the pendulums on the same parallel, or nearly on the
same parallel; in which latter case a small correction must be
made for the difference of latitude.           It is evident that, if the

                     respecting the              Ellipticity of the Earth.                                    207
pendulums when thus compared are excessively irregular, we
never can deduce from them, by any mode of investigation
whatever, any conclusion respecting the figure of the earth,
 in which much confidence can be placed. On this ground                                                            I
always rejected such of the experiments as were irreconcile
 able with the rest; and I thought this proceeding the more
justifiable, both because the experiments set aside were al
 ways very few in comparison of the whole number, and be
 cause those that remained were brought within the compass
 of inequality to be expected in experimental quantities. The
 results obtained on this principle, are already before the
 public, and therefore need not be particularly mentioned.
  My present intention is to solve the problem, by taking in                                                      all

    and this they have done without having an ulterior view to
    their structure and functions, and the relations subsisting
    amongst them. Much less have they kept in view the end of
    generalizing the particulars they are accumulating; but they
    continue to heap together a “ rudis indigestaque moles,” until
    they are actually overwhelmed by their materials.              To build
    up science skilfully, the combination should go on with the
       §
    collecting, or the superstructure will exhibit neither use nor
    beautv.
            Roscoe has clearly illustrated, the comparative merits of
   the artificial and natural arrangements in Botany in a former
    volume of the Transactions *; and has satisfactorily proved,
   in my estimation, that however admirable and comprehensive
   the system of Jussieu may be, yet it ought not to supersede the
   use of the Linnaean arrangement. The two great masters of
   botanical science propose different ends, and ought not to be
   regarded as rivals. The President of this Society has also
   constantly pressed upon the attention of the student the same
   important fact.
      In some respects it is not to be regretted that the absolute
   sway which the name of Linnaeus has had among English na
   turalists is somewhat abated: for although authority is an ex
   tremely useful bond of union, and has in this instance esta
   blished among us a nomenclature which nothing short of ho
   mage to the founder could probably have made current, yet it
   has brought with it the ordinary evils attendant upon great
   names.      The range of the pupil has been limited by that of
   the master; and it has been considered a species of hetero
   doxy to dissent from the established opinions. The danger
  to be now apprehended            that those who adopt other arrange

and with equal safety. It does that at once which is constantly
going on in ordinary language, the modifications of it to                 ex
press the classes of external objects.        The invention of new
 terms suited to express new ideas in an abridged and com
pressed form, is a slow process, and in most cases is the                 re
 sult of convenience.      There is no convention to attain the           ob
ject, because nobody can arrest the subtile means that are
 employed.      But the naturalist being without terms, or at most
 with so few that they are within his power, attempts to anti
 cipate the slow process usually working in language, and forms
 at once his instruments of reasoning; and systems and me
thods can be regarded as no further useful, than as they are
 assimilated to the ordinary process of abridging the labour of
 thought adopted by mankind in other subjects of a like nature.
     Naturalists err greatly who imagine they are employing
 terms possessing some new and distinct properties; whereas all
 they can do is to hold the subjects of natural history together in
 a loose manner by the use of the words species, genus, order, and
 class; thus presenting certain characters to the mind as se
 parate objects of contemplation by means of abstract terms, of
 a similar though somewhat more precise import than those
 which are employed by the rest of mankind in treating general
 subjects.    A stricter use may be made of these words by na
 turalists than by metaphysicians, because the business of the
 one is to examine characters and qualities more nicely than
 the subjects entertained by the other will admit of          Never
 theless, the one cannot employ these abstractions as instru
 ments of reasoning in a different sense from the other. There
 is no magic about them in the hands of a naturalist more than
 there is in any of the thousand general terms in the mouths of
 the vulgar. “Rose” and “Grass” were generic names be
 fore the flood, and will continue to be so in spite of systems
 and methods.        The naturalist has attempted only to carry
 this   necessary   operation of the mind somewhat further and
 with more precision, and has thus exposed himself to errors,
  which the vulgar have escaped.       Thus, although there are but
  two modes of    reasoning;  namely,   by the use of words expres
  sive of an individual and         its
                                   attributes,             by
                                                      general words
                                                     or

  attributes; yet naturalists have used their terms         different

correction of the constants.-The mechanical power of compressed
gases is examined; and it is inferred,that the steam of water possesses
greater advantages for use in an engine, than the vapour of any other
liquid.-Rules are next given to find the volume the steam of a
given quantity of water occupies at a given force and temperature ;
the laws of the mixture of steam and air, as in the air-pump of an
engine; and the laws of the motion of steam in the passages, &c. of
engines, with the loss by cooling; and a curious inquiry respecting
the temperature of condensation which affords the maximum of
useful effect in the old atmospheric engines; illustrated by a re
ference to Mr.Watt's experiments, with a model of one. The sec
tion concludes with the investigation of the formula for the escape
of steam at safety-valves.
   The third section is on the generation and condensation of steam,
and the apparatus required; first treating of combustion and com
bustibles, with an extensive table to show the relation between the
heat afforded by bodies, and that which their constituent elements
would give: then the conditions favourable to the process of com
bustion are considered, and the quantity of the gaseous products,
with rules for the supply of air, and size of chimneys. The relation
between the surface of boiler to be exposed to heat, and the quan
tity of steam to be generated; and of the capacity of the boiler to
the effective power of the engine, are also exhibited, and compared
with practice; and then rules given to fulfil the essential conditions.
The different species of boilers, fire-places, safety-valves, and other
apparatus, are then described; and the section closes with the prin
ciples of condensation, the quantity of water required to produce

        The Elements of Geometry, with Notes.         By    R. YouNg.                     J.
    The   great  excellence of Euclid is well known to consist in the
completeness     and perfect accuracy, as well as the general sim
plicity and elegance of his demonstrations, admitting no assumption,
no step in the process of his reasoning that has not been previously
established, and at the same time, with this requisite, usually adopt
ing the shortest course for arriving at his conclusion. It is not, how
 ever, pretended that this admirable work, so long and so deservedly
 received as the text-book for instruction, is absolutely free from de
fects. Even the very rigour of his proofs is sometimes the source of
so much intricacy and abstruseness, especially in the equally difficult
and important branch of the mathematics, the doctrine of propor
tions, as to form a serious and discouraging obstacle to the progress
of the learner. The want of success in every attempt hitherto made
to lessen this difficulty, might seem to render the task hopeless. The
aim of Mr. Young, however, in the work before us, has been, with
out impairing the completeness and satisfactory nature of his de
monstrations, to contract and facilitate the labour of the student as
much as possible by simplicity and conciseness, and also to add to
the extent and accuracy of his geometrical knowledge. Nor do we
hesitate to recommend his treatise, not certainly as superseding the
use of Euclid, but as a useful auxiliary to that great work.         His ob
servations on the theory of parallel lines; his demonstration of the
converse of every proposition where this is possible, and showing                                                      its
failure, where         not; the labour
                       it                   has bestowed        he

            in                                  singular, and deservesis                                               to
 be  noticed. Mr. Thomas Simpson,                            Geometry, has
                                                                                            of of

book, one which Mr. Young has proved                absolutely false. Thisto   be
is the more remarkable, as, though the work             which     occurs has        in              it
been       in
          the hands                of
                          geometers more than seventy years, this error
has hitherto escaped detection. Even Dr. Robert Simson, the edi
tor     Euclid, though entertaining
       of                                                        no

those species the introduction of which may be traced to artificial
causes, regarding those alone as indigenous which are coeval with the
soil, Agriculture, Medicine, and even Religion, have each swelled
our list.  Coronopus didyma is not found in England but at ports,
and seems to be a particularly migratory species.   It may be found,
he says, in almost every latitude where ships frequent;-at Lisbon,
Madeira, Rio Janeiro, the Cape, Sydney. He thinks the same dis
position may be witnessed in many of the Cruciferae, and adduces as
instances, Sisymbrium Irio, and Thlaspi campestre. Whether the cause
of such phaenomena is to be sought for in the structure of the seed,
or in the pabulum necessary to the growth of the plant, remains to
be determined.       The Blatta orientalis (common Cock-roach), and
the Norway Rat, which has eaten up the old Black Rat, are instances
from the animal world, showing a similar tendency.
    In order to ascertain whether a species be indigenous, it is of im
portance to ascertain upon what stratum, or in what places, it ter
minates         its
               range.    Many southern plants         finds terminate their  he

 struck, was referred to as an illustration of the nature of reciproca
 tion. The honour of this discovery was given to Messrs. Noble and
 Pigott, pupils of Dr. Wallace.          Reciprocation by undulations com
 municated through the air, or through solid bodies, was then illus
 trated, and the nature of stringed instruments explained.             '       :::
    After this, followed matter of a more original nature. It was stated
 that columns of air could reciprocate to vibrating bodies, when their
 vibrations could accord with those of the latter; in illustration of
 which, a flute was made to speak, simply by approaching a vibrating
 tuning-fork to          its
                       embouchoir. Other columns                            of
                                                           air were also made
to  produce intense sound                         by
                                     reciprocating with tuning-forks which
were themselves inaudible. An elementary model                       instrument       of   an
to      constructed upon this principle was also exhibited.

Having been long convinced that this opinion is not correct, I have
made some experiments upon the principal salts which are efflorescent
in a high degree. Crystallized sulphate of soda, exposed to the air even
when it is not very dry, readily loses                 water             all   its

                    HEAT GIVEN OUT DURING COMBUSTION.
   M. Despretz read at the  Academy of Sciences, on the 15th and 22d
of October last, a memoir   on the heat given out during combustion.
By means of a new method of observation, he found that hydrogen is
the body, of which a given weight gives out most heat, and the me
tals least. The result will be opposite if we refer the results to the
same weight of oxygen.    It is remarkable that carbon, which in burn
ing does not alter the volume of oxygen gas, produces three-fifths of
the heat developed by the metals, iron, zinc, and tin, which reduce
the oxygen to the solid state.  Hence it is in the act of combination
that we must seek for the principal cause of the development of heat,
and not in the approach of particles.
   In his second memoir, M. Despretz has shown that the quantity of
heat developed by a certain quantity of a body which burns without
changing the volume of the gas, is the same, whatever be the density
of the gas.-Le Globe. .

             Meteorological Observations for January 1828.                                                       337
eleven days of frost. We have had thirty-two wet days more in this
year than in 1826,   and the quantity of rain is greater by 14,926
inches. The writer of these remarks has carefully registered obser
vations on the weather in this town for upwards of five years. He
subjoins a summary from 1823 to 1827, both years included. From
observations made by the late John Gough, and by John Dalton of
Manchester, he inferred the mean annual quantity of rain for Kendal
was 51:8 inches. The average for the five years alluded to, will be
found to be 57-310 inches. The difference may arise from two causes:
—one, the difference of altitude in the places where the observations
were made, above the level of the sea; but though that does not
 exceed many yards, yet even so small a difference will affect the
amount of the mean in a series of years.          The observations from
which the former mean was calculated, were taken from twenty dif
ferent years, though not twenty successive years.        Assuming       the                                  all

    General Observations.—The first part of this month to the 17th was very
wet, and generally stormy, 6'385 inches of rain having fallen here; the lat
ter part was dry, with a humid atmosphere. From the 2nd of December
last to the 17th instant, upwards of a perpendicular foot of rain fell here,
and during that period heavy rain frequently fell throughout England, but
chiefly along the southern shores; also along the shores of Ireland and Scot
land, in consequence of the S.W. winds and gales having prevailed two
thirds of the time, and having often been crossed by upper winds: the re
sult was an overflowing of the rivers, and a general inundation of the low
lands. Even the level roads and lands near the hilly districts in Hampshire,
and the adjoining counties, lay under water several days about the middle
of the month, which rendered them impassable to foot-passengers.
    On the 1st instant, 1.89 inch of rain fell between the hours of 8 A.M. and
 6 P.M., accompanied with a brisk gale from the S.E. in the morning, and a
very hard gale from the North throughout the afternoon and night. That
 depth of rain in so short a time is with us unprecedented; but nearly the
 same depth fell here in 24 hours on the 29th of August 1821.-A more
violent gale and rain in the afternoon, (as the latter frequently came down
in torrents), have seldom been experienced: and in consequence of the
 then highly saturated state of the ground, the level roads and fields about
 the town and neighbourhood lay under water several hours, and carriages
 were prevented from travelling in the roads till the rush of water from the
 higher ground had subsided. On the morning of the 5th, icy efflorescences
 appeared on the inside of the glass windows; and at mid-day a bright par
 helion was observed on the eastern side of the sun, 22% degrees distant
 from his centre, From the 6th to the 10th the atmosphere presented a
 snowy appearance, and on the latter day one inch and a half of snow fell
 here, with a gale from the North-east.      Early in the afternoon of the 11th
 a thick fog came on, but was soon dispersed by a change of wind to
 the West; and from a sudden rise of temperature the ice and snow were
 dissolved in four or five hours. While the thaw was thus rapidly going
 on, and immediately after the fog cleared away, a dense stratus, two or
 three feet in height from the ground, formed in the town and            vicinity,              its
 which viewed               an
                     hour before sunset from       height    twenty feet, had an

               Meteorological Observations                                 for January                   1828.            239
midnight vivid lightning appeared in the W.S.W. horizon, preceded by
two winds crossing each other, the upper one from that point, and the
lower       one from the South-east.                      Several black thunder-clouds                            also     ap
peared at the same time at a great distance to the westward, which, with
a rapid fall of the quicksilver in the barometer, indicated an approaching
storm. The thunder-storm and hurricane are said to have come on at
Plymouth soon after midnight, and to have lasted three hours with in
creasing violence, so that not only the ships and vessels at that port re
ceived considerable damage, but those in the Atlantic Ocean, over which
the hurricane came, as since ascertained. At 4 o’clock the following
morning a very heavy gale from the S.W. was felt here, accompanied with
heavy rain, vivid lightning, and long peals of thunder, from half-past five
till half-past six: and in three hours afterward the storm was very awful
at Dover, and severely felt in the Straits; so that it was more or less vio
lent along the whole southern coast.         It is remarkable that the morning
tide here, and at Plymouth, on this occasion, was very nearly as high as
any of the following spring tides, notwithstanding it was a neap tide.

XXXIX. A        Letter to the Editors relating to the Ellipticity of
     the Earth as deduced from Eaperiments with the Pendulum.
     By J. Ivory, M.A. F.R.S.
         Gentlemen,
  N examining the calculations in the articles relative to the
   ellipticity of the earth, inserted in the last Number of this
Journal, I have detected a small arithmetical error, which, al
though of little moment, it may be proper to correct. The
                                                               -
equation at the bottom of p. 170, viz.
                                  2.973 r     = —-00061,
should be,                        2°973 T     =   –
                                                  ’00033:
consequently,            r = — 00011,                 s   = +    00005,
                         f = 2056,                  A=         01335;

But the error just corrected is so small as not to affect either
the reasoning deduced from the formula at the top of p. 171,
or any of the results obtained by                     it.

larity has hitherto been experienced beyond the tropics; and
even between the tropics there are only a few stations at
which so great an excess of gravity has been observed as ex
cludes them from belonging to the same surface as the other
experiments.                  I

the   great   anomalies alluded to, are so well ascertained as to
render any further inquiry unnecessary in regard to their ex
act quantity, or to the causes which produce them: and the
determination of these points in preference to any other, seems
to claim the attention of the experimenter; because it must
 fix in a great degree the complexion of the whole theory.

   In September 1825, again traversed the line from Craike'
by Wass Bank to Helmsley; in September 1826, the Rev.
W. V. Vernon and myself twice observed with attention the
country about Ebberston and Snainton; and in October 1827,
I very carefully reviewed with a barometer in my hand the
whole line from Scarborough to Brandsby.                               -
   The roads from Craike and Brandsby to Helmsley, and from
Helmsley to Scarborough, are lines remarkably well adapted
for inquiring into the stratification of the country in question,
and slight deviations to the right and left are easily made.
   Some results of these several investigations I now beg to sub
mit to the consideration of the Society.
   Four strata or formations as usually enumerated, are seen
along the north side of the Vale of Pickering.
       Kimmeridge clay.
       Coralline oolite.
       Calcareous grit.
       Oxford clay.
                                                                       -
   Of these the Kimmeridge clay, coralline oolite, and calca
reous grit, may be considered as well identified by imbedded
fossils with the strata bearing those names in the midland and
southern parts of England. The Oxford clay is defined by                                        its
position between the well identified calcareous grit and Kel
loways rock, and contains besides some ammonites which                                          lo
cally serve         to
                 characterize               it.

Mr. Smith and myself had always considered                  mark this          to a
stratum. The     clay  here   thin, contains minute  layers      brown                of

     The vacancy left by the motion of the body is filled by

the motion of the fluid; but, with a loss of the force necessary
to maintain an equilibrium among the parts of the fluid, equi
valent to the force producing this motion in the fluid. The
increase of resistance from this cause has been termed the
minus pressure                of the fluid.
  5. The sum                  of the direct resistance, and that due to the de
ficiency of equilibrium, called the minus pressure, is the total
resistance when the friction is neglected.
    6. If fluids were devoid of friction they would be perfectly
elastic, differing only in the degree of compression produced
by a given force; hence, in considering the effect of collision
on a fluid, it must be esteemed an elastic body. The coherence
and friction of natural fluids render their elasticity in a slight
degree imperfect, but not sufficiently so to interfere with the
application of rules founded on                 perfect elasticity    its   most                                in

   9. Of the Minus Pressure—It is obvious, from the property
of figures having parallel sides, that the quantity of fluid re
quired to fill the vacancy left behind the body when it moves,
is a constant quantity, whatever be the form of the body; there
fore the deficiency of pressure will vary only with the velocity
the fluid must acquire to follow the retiring surface.    But if
c be the  angle  that surface makes with the direction of the
motion, the velocity will be v sin c; consequently, the motion
of the fluid being established, the resistance from the defi

   These ratios are likely to be altered a little by the effect of
friction; and if the cylinder be reduced in length till it becomes
a thin plate (fig. 9. and 10.), a still greater alteration is caused
by the interference of the two motions of the fluid. The ef
fect is easily observed by moving differently-formed bodies in                                                          -

the friction of water were made by Col.Beaufoy”, from whence
it appears that the friction of water is very nearly as the square
of the velocity; and about 0032 pounds for one foot of surface
moving at the rate of one foot per second.         It is somewhat
greater than this in slow motions; most likely from the effect
of cohesion being sensible in small velocities. The experiments
made by the Society for the Improvement of Naval Archi
tecture do not appear to be so nearly in the ratio of the square
of the velocity, but at the velocity of four nautical miles per
hour the resistance is exactly '0032 pounds (see Dr. Young's
Nat. Phil.        ii.     p.   229).             The         head     of     water equivalent                 to    this

  I have    no doubt that there is an error somewhere                                   in the
mode of trial which gave the resistance stated in the account
of these experiments, for they do not agree with others.
   26. Col. Beaufoy made some experiments on the resistance
 of water, which appear to have been conducted in a similar
 manner. . He found the resistance of a square foot, moving at
the rate of one foot per second, to be 1:2949 pound; according
to my mode of calculation, it should be 1:45 pound.
   27. Borda, from an experiment made in sea-water, makes
the resistance of a foot of surface 13 pound Fr., at a.velocity
of about one foot per second; and Bouguer, as quoted by
 Robison, makes the resistance 1:44 pound Fr. My mode of
calculation gives 1-785 pound Fr. for the resistance of sea
water, to a surface one foot square moving at the rate of one
foot (French) per second.
   28. Mr. Bevan has given me an account of some trials he
made to ascertain the resistance of a canal boat on the Grand
Junction Canal. The length of the boat was 69.57 feet;                                          its

   It will be remarked, that in air as in water, the hemisphere
with the convex side foremost differs most widely from the
result of calculation. The sphere is very near, and the near
coincidence of the actual resistance, as well as the ratio, is
worthy of notice.

confusion in what he writes, arising from his not distinguish

IT   was the opinion of Linnaeus, and continues to be the opi
   nion of some of his disciples, that genera are actually founded
in nature as much as species. “Naturae opus semper-est
species et genus.” Phil. Bot. § 162.      “Genus omne est na
turale, in primordio tale creatum, hinc pro lubitu et secundum
cujuscunque theoriam non proterve discindendum aut conglu
tinandum.”           159.

and when they are so multiplied, it may be suspected that
many of them are arbitrary and artificial. This attempt at
breaking down good orders and genera into many subordinate
and loosely defined groups, and encumbering them with names,
involves the subject in obscurity, and may well be questioned
as contrary to his main design of presenting those compre
hensive views which are afforded by a natural system.
    Mr. Brown has adopted a different mode in his Prodromus.
He has attempted to combine no further than his knowledge
would warrant, not even employing the terms class or order as
the names of his groups. As his object is chiefly synthesis, he
keeps his diagnostic characters apart, thus leaving the mind
less embarrassed when it is in pursuit of analysis.            It must be
admitted indeed, that his work cannot be employed with any
success by the inexperienced, or even by those who have oc
cupied themselves only in searching for species; but to have
made it subservient to this purpose, would have been to have
 rendered it less beautiful and complete as a work of synthesis.

268          Mr. Bicheno    on Systems and Methods
up well-defined genera and orders because they contain a large
number of species.      If we find a large genus, for instance, as
Erica, agreeing in some well-marked characters of structure,
form, station, and properties, it appears contrary to the end
proposed by the natural system, to divide and subdivide the
 species into small groups, and to give each of these the same
 value as is now possessed by the whole. This is frittering away
 characters  which are essential to the use of a genus, and de
 stroying our power over it when we proceed to generalise.
 The value of generic terms consists essentially in the distinct
 conceptions we have of them; but if we go on to multiply them,
 as is at present the fashion, we render it as impossible to cir
 cumscribe them, as it is to parcel out the colours of the rain
 bow; and instead of making Natural History familiar and
 popular, it will require the compass of a man's life to master
 the terms we employ.      If indeed the object be to analyse,  di
 vision may be very convenient, because the inquirer may be
 otherwise bewildered in the multitude of particulars.     It does
 not follow from hence that the student of the natural system
 may not avail himself of subordinate groups by whatever cha
 racters they may furnish; only the giving them equivalent
 names, and making them co-ordinate, is destructive, as it ap
 pears to me, of his system as a means of general reasoning.
    In no department of natural history are the inconveniences
 arising out of this confusion of analysis and synthesis more felt
 than in Entomology.       The multitude of species included in
 this kingdom of nature is so great, that it requires the most
 skilful arrangement to enable the student to determine them:
yet it is unquestionably the worst furnished with assistance in
 this way; —a defect which may be attributed chiefly, I appre
 hend, to the attempt which both we and our continental neigh
 bours have made to combine the natural with the artificial
 system.   We have aimed at analysis and synthesis at the same
time.   A comprehensive acquaintance with this infinitely varied
 tribe can alone enable us to synthesise with safety; and a long
period must elapse before we can hope to embrace within our
synthesis the whole of the insect world.
    In the large views taken by means of the natural system,
our business will for ever be the labour of separating what we
shall know from that which is unknown. The profoundest
knowledge will at last be but a fragment.        Some groups of
nature are so closely related, that they have been observed
from time immemorial. “Whatsoever parteth the hoof and
is cloven-footed, and cheweth the cud,” comprehends a group
of animals so obviously connected, that they must have re
ceived a generic appellation from the remotest period.         As
                                                       knowledge

                         in Natural History.   .            269
knowledge has increased, more and more families have been
separated: still there is always a remainder of unknown things.
Take any natural system, and see if this is not the case.
Hinnaeus in his “ Fragments of a Natural Method” professes
only to separate from the mass those groups which he saw
clearly. Again, his definition of vegetables indicates the same
truth: “Vegetabilia comprehendunt Familias septem, Fungos,
Algas, Muscos, Filices, Gramina, Palmas;” and then, to        in
elude the remainder, he adds, “et Plantas,” defining the last
thus, “Plantae dicuntur reliquae, quae priores intrare nequeunt
familias.” Phil. Bot. § 78. Take up Jussieu's Genera Plan
tarum; and besides his “Plantae incertae sedis,” see how he
is obliged to dispose at the end of many orders his “Genera
affinia,” and “Genera nondum satis determinata.”         This is
true inductive philosophy; yet the same author may be sus
pected of departing from this mode of investigation when he
attempts to edge in his remainder under artificial or sweeping
characters, as he has done in Eleagni and Junci, and when,
falling in with this modern innovation, he invents a multitude
of new orders to embrace every known species of plant.
   The mammiferous animals are arranged with more ease ac
cording to a natural system, in consequence of their number
being comparatively small, and their forms strongly marked.
Nevertheless the system of M. Cuvier, in the Regne Animal,
clearly shows the vain attempt of finding a place for every
thing.    Nothing can be more satisfactory and beautiful than
many of his orders and divisions; yet see how he is compelled
to change his ground when he comes to the Pachydermata,
and to huddle together species very remotely connected.      His
birds also exemplify the same fact, where his order Passeres is
made to include all that his other orders will not hold. “Son
caractère semble d'abord purement négatif, car il embrasse
tous les oiseaux quine sont ni nageurs, ni échassiers, nigrim
peurs, nirapaces, ni gallinacés.” Thus it contains the War
blers, the Shrikes, the Goatsuckers, the Crows, the Creepers;
birds of the most dissimilar habits, and living upon the most
dissimilar food.    The Chough is separated widely from the
Corvi, and Anthus from Alauda.        Now this is what we might
expect from the nature of the subject; only it is desirable that
the remainder of unknown things should be distinctly avowed,
and not reduced to an exact place in the natural system.
Jussieu's was the most philosophic mode, which was to place
this residue at the end.     Linnaeus too was very correct when
he pronounced his natural orders to be a “Fragment;” and
those persons who imagine it to be necessary or advantageous
to find a place for every thing, and to divide and split for the

tion of systems and technical expressions, which have received
their definition beforehand, cannot be employed without the
danger of perpetuating false hypotheses, and an apprehension
on the part of the ignorant, that these inventions give us some
power over nature not belonging to ordinary language.
    The more correct mode would be to exclude from the na
tural method most of these terms, and to employ in their place
 some convertible words of looser import, as indeed M. Cuvier
has to some extent done; such for instance, as group, section,
 division, to express those larger assemblages of approximations
to assigned forms, which are rather predicated than proved;
and in many cases to point them out by mere signs, such as
are used in printing.        Thus, for instance, the word section,
or  any   similar  word,  might    be employed to express the plants
severally comprehended          in the order Graminea, the class
 Compositae, and the division Monocotyledones;             and where the
characters are less      definite,   the   plants   pointed  at might be
assembled under a       simple   asterisk.
   One chief recommendation of the natural system over the
artificial, is the liberty which it leaves to the mind. The one
shuts it in to the narrowest scope of observation, while the
other suffers it to range in search of            the properties belong
                                                                 all

and general truth that the natural system enables                     pur                us   to

bursting of the skin had undoubtedly been produced by the
swelling of the mass on account of the moisture it had ab
sorbed from the meadow, a tension which the thin mem
branous covering could not resist. In such parts too the mem
brane was so concealed by the jelly that it could scarcely be
perceived. Nor had the jelly here any distinct form, or any
traces of organization.    But wherever the mass had remained
entire, and although swelled was still inclosed, it showed a ver
micular appearance of the thickness of a quill and thicker;
whilst in those places where the membrane had burst, the                                           in
side projected in lumps of three-quarters of an inchin thickness.
This vermicular appearance presented several small slightly
indented divisions, and had entirely the figure of an intestine;
the back was marked by a tender vessel of a darkish-brown
colour, which spread with fine veins towards the front, losing
themselves about the middle in small blackish points.        By this
vessel the back of the mass was      entirely contracted, and much-
extended towards the surface, just like an intestine.
   In a dry place the substance gradually shrunk, soon lost                                           its
white colour, turned           brownish yellow hue, became very

 those gentlemen have written their accounts.
    The substances they have respectively examined offer, as
 I  have stated above, qualities so different in their nature, as to
 ascribe to each a different origin; so that cannot agree with            I
 Mr. S. in supposing the substance examined by him to be of
 the same kind as Mr. B.'s, while                           I

 stance, on the contrary, fully agrees with that examined by me.
 Their chemical contents are quite the same; and the                es                               º,
 sential difference between them seems to be, that the substance
 examined by him no longer exhibited any                   structure;
 whilst that observed by me still bore the evident traces of an
 animal production.       But if we consider that this snail-spawn

     N the 14th volume of the Transactions of the Linnean So
     ciety, is a communication written by my friend W. S. Mac
Leay, Esq., intended to prove that the fly, intitled Oistros by
the ancients, was not the insect so named by Linnaeus, but that
it probably belonged to the present Linnean genus Tabanus.
    Being of a contrary opinion, I am led once more to address
this learned Society, to lay before them the grounds on which
it is founded, that naturalists may not incautiously and too
hastily adopt the above conclusion, and that they may avoid
the confusion which change of names and counter changes                                                al
ways produce in science.                            I
                                 am also led to this undertakin

fication of myself wanting as a motive to induce me to re-ex
amine the subject, having formerly sent to this Society a dis
sertation of some extent on the genus CEstrus, unfolding some
curious discoveries in the characters and natural habits of this
singular race of insects +.         --

tifying their descriptions with the modern species of natural
history, would perhaps, in a general way, be better avoided in
the valuable volumes of this Society, as leading to much de
sultory and unsatisfactory discussion: practical subjects and
didactic facts would perhaps better maintain their reputation.
As, however, the Society have in this instance already ad
mitted the discussion, it is but fair and just to allow the reply ,
in the same channel, that the impression, if erroneous, may be s
removed.                                               .   . .      .

284                          Mr. Bracy Clark           on the Insect
 description of the effects it produces upon cattle, and which
 are so singular, that they have afforded incidents to most
 rural poets, ancient and modern : and the truth seems to be,
 that the poets in describing these effects have been true to
nature; while the philosophers, being presented with a wrong
 insect, have only involved the subject in error.
    That it is an Italian insect we have the authority of Valli
 sneri of Padua, who appears to have been the first naturalist
 who bred the true (Estrus Bovis from the grubs found in the
 backs of the cattle; and for the first time, as far as we possess
 any record of the subject, saw with certainty the identical ob
ject that created so much commotion among them.                   He ap
 plied correctly enough the passages of the ancients which he
 thought had allusion to this insect.        Reaumur followed Valli
 sneri in these researches, and bred with great difficulty one
imperfect specimen of the true (Estrus Bovis.             Linnaeus next
followed; but not having ever seen the insect, and not daring
 to describe from figures merely, or the descriptions of others,
he took the large Horse Bot for               the OEstrus Equi

                              called Oistros by the Ancients.                                      285
monies are various, and militate against each other; but none
are descriptive of the true fly, which we now fully know.
Surely such a conclusion is more natural and just, than to sup
pose these conflicting descriptions true, and that the poets and
common observers were false witnesses.
     I
     now proceed to give what Virgil says respecting the name
of it among the ancients, and the tumult it occasions; and of
which no sweat-sucking Tabanus, Conops, or modern Asilus,
can in any way be the cause.
                  “Est  lucos Silari circa, ilicibusque virentem
                   Plurimus Alburnum volitans, cui nomen Asilo
                   Romanum est, (Estron Graii vertère vocantes:
                   Asper, acerba sonans : quo tota exterrita sylvis
                   Diffugiunt armenta, furit mugitibus AEther
                   Concussus, sylvaeque, et sicciripa Tanagri.”
                         -                                  Georg. lib. iii. v. 146.
     From this admirable description, it is clearly manifest that
Asilus was the Roman name for the           which agitates the           fly
cattle; and      equally clear that CEstros was the Greek name
                       it   is
for it.
   Not much weight      due      the observation, that Homer's
                                       is              to
insect was not the modern     OEstrus, because he mentions the
spring        as
          the season                    of
                            appearance, since  its also adds,                       he               in
the same line, Örs   juara waxpé TéAovrai, “when the days are
                                  T'
long;” nor that Shakespeare      did not use the word Brize for
the same insect, merely because        has assigned     appearhe                         its
ance         to
          the month     June, when     of
                                        more often appears now  it
in July. Indeed the alteration                               of
                                      style will account for this
difference.   But the same poet uses the word     another place,                in
where the allusion    too distinctis be mistaken:            to
                  “The      herd hath more annoyance               by   the Brize,
                   Than      by the Tiger.”                                Troilus and Cressida.
And again         old Play, quoted
                       in   an        Archdeacon Nares         by                              in   his
Glossary, the following use    the word occurs,       of
      “I      will put the Brize          in   's   tail, shall set him gadding presently.”

produced. The shrill sharp sound, which Virgil describes,
was,  I dare say, not stated without some real ground; and                                      in

larly large      this insect; but further than this we dare not
                   in
assert, but leave the point for future investigation.      We know
from Linnaeus's own account, that the OEstrus Tarandi,                                           or
Rein-deer Bot, very similar               respects

                                                 which again brings
me into doubt upon this matter.                                   -                                   -
   We next have          observe,
                               to     confirmationin     the  peculiar      of
effects    these insects upon the animals they infest, that those
           of
of  the OEstrus     the Rein-deer, are equally singular and re
                        of
                                                                                      *
markable; and this fact we have from the indefatigable re
             our immortal leader, Linnaeus himself.          He says,
                of of
searches
speaking      the CE. Tarandi,       his Lapland Tour, that
                                              in                                            as   he
was   inbed early one morning,         perceived   hevery ungrateful   a
smell, and when day-light appeared, “there were
                                                                about

                              called Oistros by the Ancients.                                                287
about the cot a thousand of these Rein-deer, driven by old,
men, boys, dogs, and women, who milked these animals.
They appeared to be under the apprehension of some invisi
ble attack: the animals carried their heads aloft, their ears
pricked up and extended, beating the ground, and kicking in
the air with their feet, as though by enchantment.      Then for
a while they would be quiet;                           #.
                                     again, they were seen most
furious, and this with so general and regular a movement, that
no army would have surpassed their exercises in uniformity.”
   Linnaeus further states, in the Lachesis Lapponica, respect
ing the effects produced by this sort of OEstrus, that in passing
   erwards into the Lapland alps he observed a Rein-deer,
which was loaded with his own package, frequently to stop
short and become perfectly quiet and motionless as a pillar of
stone, or one suddenly struck with catalepsy; the head held
straight out, the ears upright, the eyes fixed; nor could he by
any        ill
        treatment      induced     be
                                  proceed; but         to
                                                     little while                     in  a
  hewould   again resume his march. Where,         would ask,                    I                               is
the Tabanus,      Conops, that could produce effects like these?
                         or
or  what naturalist,                    at   all
                             acquainted with the operations                                                      of
Nature herself, could confound the dissimilar effects produced
 by    these several insects?         ºv                                  :

      Linnaeus further says, that the Rein-deer            in
                                                      saw the                                     he

                           true, fully confirms the supposition that
there can be no infliction.

288          Mr. Bracy Clark    on a new Species      of Cuterebra.
wonderfully kept from such an increase as would be fatal to
the animals they feed upon, by the difficulties and imminent
hazards they are exposed to in the act of depositing their eggs.
The teeth of the horse must destroy, one should imagine, nine
tenths of the CE. Equi, hamorrhoidalis, and salutiferus.     The
(Estri seem, however, in the hands of Providence, to make a
double recompense for the sufferings they occasion; first, by
keeping the animals on the alert during hot weather, when
they would be often too idly disposed for their welfare; while
the few larvae which succeed in getting into their bodies, ap
pear to benefit them by their local irritations, stimulating the
stomach to a quicker digestion of their watery food, and
verting diseases by their counter irritations of the skin and
                                                                        di
frontal cavities,   thus producing the effect of issues or vesica
tories, which are powerful remedies in relieving and in pre
venting diseases.
  I   apprehend that I have now sufficiently shown that the
OEstrus of the ancients could have been no Tabanus, and that
it is clear Olivier, who appears to have originated this notion,
and who was followed by Latreille, was mistaken.
    A very extensive enumeration of this genus is seen in a late
ingenious publication, the Systematische Beschreibung of J. W.
Meigen. It is however in some instances not correct; for on
carefully examining the CEstrus lineatus of this writer, intro
duced from Villers, it would appear to be that stumbling
block of systematists in entomology, the CE. Bovis of my enu
meration*, and not of Linnaeus, as he states, who, as we have
repeatedly said, described the CE. Equi for this species.    The
CE. pictus of this author, beautifully figured by Curtis in the
 British Entomology, no. xxvi. t. 106, I rather suspect to be the
faucial bot of the Stagl.
As the   species of the new genus Cuterebra were taken for
(Estri till    I
              separated them, and are closely allied to them in
their habits,      I
                 have ventured at the close of this paper to com
municate to the Society a new and undescribed species lately
received from America, along with some other insects sent m

from the maps already engraved; nor dwell upon the misery of plung
ing, from a tract that we have traversed with the advantage of this
guide, into regions where the survey leaves us, lost, as it were, and
bewildered from the want of such assistance. The sheets of the Ord
 nance Survey which I now lay before you, represent a portion of the
 midland counties, coloured geologically by a gentleman whose activity
 and accuracy of research have made him minutely acquainted with
the stratification of the district around him”; and the maps thus co
loured, are probably as complete specimens of geological illustration
 as ever have been produced.        The knowledge of this observer extends
 with  equal  precision    several miles to the north of the tract here re
presented; but these sheets, you perceive, are bounded by a right
line;—and beyond that line it has not been in his power to extend his
colours, because no good map of the adjacent district is in existence.
In this instance therefore, and no doubt in numberless other cases,
the want of adequate maps may cause the final and irreparable loss
of much geological information: And when it is considered, that
Geology is but one of many departments of useful inquiry, to which
good maps administer, how much they contribute to the advancement
of commerce, and to the comforts and conveniences of life, it will
be unnecessary to urge the enlightened and public spirited persons,
to whose hands this great undertaking is committed, to finish with as
much promptitude as possible what has been so admirably begun.

  positions have been confirmed in a manner which the inventor could
  not have foreseen.
     The most striking modern support of these correcter views, is due
  to Von Buch and Humboldt, and to the facts and inferences derived
 by Dr. MacCulloch from the country which gave birth to Hutton,
 and to his illustrator, Mr. Playfair, and in which were made the expe
 riments of Sir James Hall. More recently, a series of facts observed
 by Professor Henslow, in the Isle of Anglesea", has proved, in the most
 satisfactory manner, the connection of veins of trap with very high tem
 perature; since the change produced upon the strata, through which
 the substances now occupying the veins were injected, has approached
 so nearly to fluidity, as to admit of their crystallization, in forms differ
 ent from any which the components of the rocks, if they had not been
 thus acted on, would have afforded. Sir Humphry Davy's experiments.
 on the fluids contained within cavities in crystals f, are another strik
 ing and unexpected confirmation of Hutton's views: and our own
 Transactions, besides various incidental pieces of evidence derived;
 from this country, supply the testimony of an unprejudiced witness to
 an earthquake on the coast of Chili;, which brings almost before the
 eyes of the reader, the movement and permanent elevation of the land.

land and Mr. Lyell, that the coal formation of that neighbourhood
was in reality the equivalent of a portion of our Oolitic strata; and
demonstrate the remarkable fact, that the same fossils which in En
..
gland occur in oolitic limestone, exist there in strata of quartzose sand
stone and of shale! The whole series indeed, of the phaenomena
developed by recent examination in Scotland and the north of End
gland, gives rise to the most interesting speculations on the questions
of geological identity, and of the relative value in geology of mine
               zoological characters, which has been so ably treated
by Brongniart and other continental writers:—questions, which it is
necessary to keep continually in view, and that acquire fresh interest

      A sketch of the subjects contained in this paper was laid before
 the Society in 1826 (Nov. 17):-They were resumed in a more sy
 stematic and detailed form during two meetings in 1827; and are
 now terminated by the observations read at the present meeting.”
      The contents of the Memoir are presented in the following order:
      PART I.--W-1. Introduction.—The new red sandstone is considered
 as one great complex formation, interposed between the coal measures
 and the lias;–with two calcareous formations subordinate to it,
 one in the lower part of the series (the magnesian limestone), and
 another in the upper part (the muschel-kalkstein). The lower of the
 two calcareous formations is considered in detail; the upper has not
 yet been discovered among the British secondary deposits.
 s    $ 2. External characters of the country through which the Magne
 sian Limestone ranges.—The form of the western escarpment is de
 scribed, and is supposed to exhibit proofs of great denudations; and
 the general character of the soils resting upon the formation is no

 -ºš 3. General distribution of the formation.—The range of the es
 carpment is given in great detail; some errors of the geological
 maps are corrected; and in describing the eastern boundary, the
 enormous masses of diluvium in the county of Durham are briefly
 noticed. . . . . . .    - : , , , , , ; ; * * * * * * * * * * * * * : *** , , , º,
a $4. Outliers—Sixteen outliers from the western escarpment are
 described; the most southern of which is at Conisborough. In addi
...tion to these, there are eight detached patches of magnesian lime
 stone on the line of bearing, which are not considered as outliers.
 The most remarkable of these are seen in the range through Yorkshire.
      $ 5. Relations of the Magnesian Limestone to a succession of Coal
 Measures.—In a general point of view these formations must be
 unconformable, because the overlying beds are extended far beyond
 the limits of the productive parts of the carboniferous order: and
 the fact is also proved by actual sections in several parts of York
 shire and Durham. At the same time there are continuous tracts of
 country where the want of conformity does not appear, and where
 the overlying beds seem almost to graduate into the coal measures.
 Several details are given respecting ancient coal works, in which, in
 more than one hundred places, the coal had been extracted by shafts
 sunk through the magnesian limestone; and it is asserted that the
  quality of the coal is never injured by the presence of the overlying
 formations. Such injury is not only contrary to fact, but seems                -
                                                                                    to

  be a physical impossibility.
    a $6. On the Faults affecting the Magnesian Limestone and Coal
 strata, Trap dykes, &c.—Examples are given of some great faults
                                                                                    :

rocks do not affect the upper. Respecting the age of the trap dykes
of the coal-fields, it is not possible to determine, their epoch in com
parison of the magnesian limestone, where, they range up to the es
carpment; and of such dykes there are only two examples; one of
which does, and the other does not, pass through the beds of the
overlying series.                          * , ºf            **                    tººd                    tº
   PART II.-Internal Structure and       great    Subdivisions of the Magne:
sian Limestone.—Considered as a subordinate part of the new red
sandstone series, this formation admits of five natural subdivisions,
each of which is described in a separate section.                  !: , ; ; , tº u
   § 1. Lower Red-sandstone, or      Rothe-todte-liegende.—In            Yorkshire
this appears generally in the form of a coarse siliceous sandstone, of
a reddish tinge. It is associated with incoherent sand, red micaceous
shale, and sometimes with variegated marls,                 In, Durham, it is
generally represented by a yellowish and nearly incoherent sand. In
some places it cannot be distinguished from the gritstone beds of the
coal measures: but as it commences in the edge of Derbyshire, and
is almost co-extensive with the magnesian limestone, as far as the
mouth of the Tyne, it must on the whole be unconformable to the
inferior order. It              is,

     rovement of the press by Lord Stanhope, to the present time, was
            traced by Mr. Cowper, who at the same time illustrated the
  various inventions by drawings, models, and many of the working
  parts of the present machines: after which a more particular account
  was given of the machines invented by Mr. Koenig and perfected by
  himself and Mr. Applegath”, and of the one recently erected at The
  Times newspaper office.          The extraordinary speed of this machine
  is  such,  that 4000   impressions    on one side can be taken in one hour.
  The disposition of the form, inking apparatus, paper rollers, and
  conveying tapes, were explained upon models and sections.                             -

      Feb. 29.-Mr. S. Solly, jun. gave an illustrated account of the
 analogies and differences between the skeletons of man and birds.
  The accordance between the skeletons was first pointed out, and
 that of man referred to as a standard; and then the departures and
 differences in different animals, with the effects thereby produced,
 were explained. . . . . . . .          .  . ..            -          *  ..."             -

 New cases of reciprocation were adduced, and illustrated; especially
 of one column of air by another, and of beats and chords by co
 lumns of air. The formation of the grave harmonic was referred
 to, and cases of      itsreciprocation mentioned and the theory before

316        Meteorological Summary for 1827.-Hampshire.
 sphere on the mercurial column this year, is rºw of an inch lower
 than that of last year, and ++, of an inch higher than the mean of
 the last twelve years. The yearly maximum pressure is not high,
 nor the minimum comparatively low.
    The aggregate of the spaces described by the alternate rising
 and falling of the quicksilver, is 14:59 inches greater than in 1826.
    The number of changes in the Barometer this year, viz. 266, co
 incides with that of 1826 and 1816, and is only four short of the
 annual average for the last twelve years. Although the aggregate
 of the spaces differs very much in different years, yet the yearly
 number of changes is pretty uniform; and the average time of each
change during the last twelve years, is 32; hours nearly. The
 annual uniformity of these changes, as influenced by the varying
 weight of the atmosphere on the column of quicksilver, might have
 first suggested to meteorologists the idea of the existence of atmo
 spherical tides, as chiefly effected by the moon's attractive force on
 the spheroidal mass of the earth's atmosphere. But these changes
 not happening regularly, compared with the regularity of the tides
 of the ocean in connection with the moon's motion, as sometimes
 they are quick and at other times very slow, at least near the earth's
 surface, a train of imperceptible effects, besides the moon's sup
posed attraction, should therefore be taken into consideration to
account fairly for the atmospherical tides, as the diurnal action of
 the sun's calorific rays upon the atmosphere; the ascending heat
from the earth in the spring and summer months; the rarefaction
of the atmosphere, particularly under the sun's vertical rays and
 about the equator; the consequent perturbations of the air, and
dispersion of dry and moist winds, according to their position, to
 every known place on the earth; and the influence of the seasons
 upon the constitution of the atmosphere in every climate without
                                                    -
the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.
    TEMPERATURE.-In the temperature of the atmosphere we ge
 nerally feel more interest than in the pressure, from the effects it
 often produces in us when too much exposed to the extremes of
 either cold or heat. The heat we sustain beyond the temperature
 of the ground, is the effect of the solar rays on the earth and sur
rounding atmosphere, while the earth moves in that part of            its
                                                                       orbit
which coincides with the northern signs           the ecliptic; for while

moves through the space occupied
                                            by
                                            the southern signs, the mean
temperature     ofthe atmosphere      inthis latitude     almost invariably
                                                           is

                                             degrees below the mean          of
January. Two other deviations also occurred             1826,

                  Meteorological Observations                                 for February            1828.        317
    The mean temperature of spring water at 8 A.M. is only nº of
 a degree  less than the mean temperature of the external air, which
 seems to prove that the additional thermometrical heat near the
 ground in the summer, is balanced by the decrease of temperature
in the opposite season, when the sun's diurnal arc with us is much
shorter, and his rays more oblique.
    The difference between the annual mean temperature of the air
as taken daily at 8 A.M. and 8 P.M. is only 24, or a quarter of
a degree.
    WIND.—The scale of the prevailing winds this year deviates very
little from that of last. High winds prevailed in January, February,
March, April, October, and December; but in the other months
the winds were comparatively light.    The number of strong gales,
or the days on which they have prevailed this year, is as in the fol
lowing scale:
                  N.        N.E.        E.         S.E.       S.      S.W.         W.       N.W.     Gales.

  Here the number from the S.W. is remarkable, as usual. The
weather in January and February was cold; and in March, Sep
tember, October, and December it was wet, but rather dry in the
other eight months.
  The amount of evaporation this year is considerably under the
depth of rain, from the atmosphere near the ground having been
more than usually humid in the summer months.

    General Observations.—This month has been calm and generally mild,
and although it has rained more or less on seventeen different days, yet the
amount at the ground is very little more than one and a half inch in depth;
therefore it has generally been light.
    From the 10th to the 18th instant, the weather was rather cold; and on
the 11th and 12th, sleet and granulous snow fell.              In the morning of the
14th it snowed three hours, and the depth was about 2% inches, which dis
solved in this neighbourhood in two hours with a temperature from 37 to
41 degrees in the shade.          In the evening of that day about 20 minutes
before 7 o'clock, a very large meteor, in the form of a cone on                    side,                             its

                Mr. Galbraith               on the Figure            of the Earth.                     323
titude; and consequently the diminution of gravity from this
cause, in proceeding from the pole to the equator, will also be as
the square of the cosine of the latitude. But the square of the
sine increases as the square of the cosine diminishes; therefore
the increase of gravity in proceeding from the equator to the
pole, will be as the square of the sine of the observed latitude
nearly. A little consideration will readily show, however, that
this is correct, on the supposition of the earth being a perfect
sphere, and is only an approximation not far from the truth in
the case where the compression is small. The centrifugal force,
therefore, is strictly proportional to the ordinate to the polar
axis which involves the compression,—the verything we are in
quest of Now as this is supposed to be the unknown quantity,
it must be assumed equal to about sºn, what it is already known
to be nearly; we may infer that the centrifugal force decreases
as the square of the sine of the reduced latitude exactly. The
difference arising from these two suppositions is undoubtedly
small; but in very nice disquisitions, minute quantities ought
not to be entirely disregarded.
   The length of the pendulum is as the force of gravity; and
it has generally been inferred, from suppositions not                  from                      far
the truth, that the length         the pendulum from the equator

of the earth at that latitude, a diminution of density, &c. This
has occurred to me from some of my own computations, as
well as from those of others which         have seen, but which          I
seem to disappear when the proper (the reduced) latitude is
employed. In order to obtain correct results, the formulae
should possess                all

   From a review of the whole, it appears that the ellipticity is
somewhat greater than it has generally been supposed, though
the difference is not very great. It seems also probable that
the discordancies of the results derived from the formula for
computing the length of the pendulum are not very consider
able, and are so irregular that no general protuberance, or
uncommon diminution of the force of gravity, is any where
likely to follow from the observations by the pendulum.
   The only doubt that remains, is perhaps the effect of com
bining the lengths of the pendulum on stations of very differ
ent specific gravities, where a preponderance of dense or light
materials is likely to prevail.
   It is to be feared that the lengths of the pendulum near the
equator are rather in excess, as the stations have been, generally
speaking, on bases of considerable density; and by this means
rendering the equatorial pendulum too great, the excess of the
polar above the equatorial pendulum too small, and conse
quently the compression too great; though more numerous
experiments near that circle are still wanting to decide this
                                                                            º

exact quantity of compression by the various arcs on the me
ridian, and the parallels now executing throughout Europe;
though I am inclined to believe, that measurements of arcs of
the meridian near the equator, and as close to the poles as
convenient, will be more decisive.        In the execution of these,
however, care should be taken to select proper portions of the
meridian under uniformity of geological character.          Some of
the extensive plains in the North of Russia and in South
America, appear to me to be the most eligible; though have                                          I

unchanged in every point after the evolution. From this fol
lows, as a particular case; that in a curve surface which can
be evolved in a plane, the measure of curvature is always =0.
From this is immediately derived the characteristic equation
of the surfaces capable of being evolved in a plane; namely,
if z be regarded as a function of y and a

an equation which, indeed, has long been known, but in the
author's opinion has never yet been rigorously demonstrated.
   These propositions lead to a new view of the theory of curve
surfaces, and open a wide uncultivated field of investigation.
If surfaces be considered not as bounds of bodies, but as bodies
onedimension of which is evanescent, and at the same time flexi
 ble but not expansible, it will be conceived that two essentially
 different classes of relations must be distinguished,—those
 which suppose a definite shape of surface in space, and those
 which are independent of the various shapes which the surface
 is capable of assuming.       It is of the latter that the author
 treats; and it appears by what has been observed above, that
 the measure of curvature is one of them: but it will easily be
 seen that the consideration of the figures which can be de
 scribed on the surface, their angles, their areas and entire cur
 wature, the connection of the points by shortest lines, &c. be
long to this class. All these investigations must proceed from
 this, That the nature of the curve surface is given by the ex
pression of an indefinite linear element of this form w/(Edp”-H
2Fd p. d q + Gd q*).
    The author has inserted in the present paper a part of the
 investigations on this subject, which have engaged him during
several years, confining himself to such as are not too remote
from the point where his labours began, and which may serve
as general auxiliaries for numerous further investigations.           In
this notice we must be still shorter, and be content to give
only as a specimen the following theorems.-If on a curve sur

     FROM
       branes into vibrating   divisions,” says Savart, in the Ann.
de Chim. et de    Phys. (1826. tom. xxxii. p. 385.) “it is evident
that the acoustic figures called by Chladni distortions, form
the transition between a variety of figures of sound which are
not distorted (in which may be reckoned several tones of the
flageolet). As Chladni has only observed the distortions of
figures of sound which are nearest the undistorted figures
(which he considers as fundamental figures), and as he fixed
the number of vibrations merely by the ear, which does not
admit of sufficient accuracy, he might justly assert that the
tone in the distortion of the figures of sound is the same as in
the fundamental figures. But in the tables accompanying his
 Traité d'Acoustique, we find distortions of figures of sound
to which belong semitones, a whole tone, and even one-third
higher than when the figure of sound has what is termed the
fundamental form.” The difference between Chladni and
Savart, according to these observations of the latter,          that             is,

 which the sand remains, varies as in No. 2; and becomes, as the
 tone of the organ-pipe gets still higher, as in No. 3, 4, 5, 6,
 where the boundary lines merely consist of four parallel lines.
In this manner the boundary lines which at first intersected
 each other at right angles, are changed into parallel lines.
 This transmutation may also be effected as represented at - fig.
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
   In the same manner four parallel nodes may pass into two
parallels which have towards the former a perpendicular po
sition, as shown at fig. 8; or four parallel nodes may change
into four others intersected by two more perpendicularly, as
shown in fig. 9. Other remarkable changes of the position
and number of these boundary lines with increasing velocity
of the agitating concussions, are seen in fig, 10, 11, 12, 13.
   From these experiments it may be seen that there is a possi
bility of several transitions of one and the same sand-figure to
another; as        for
                   instance, fig, 10. and fig,            11.

   First. On proceeding from figure nodes intersecting each

in   the comparison          fig. 10, with fig, 11. which both form
                                  of

   Secondly.        If,  the contrary, we have

The transitions are particularly remarkable when the lines
form two curves outward, and one inward,                        or

fork being turned further, it immediately reappears.   If we
distinguish in the prongs of the tuning-fork three different
surfaces; viz. 1. front and back surfaces; 2. side surfaces;
3. end surfaces; we observe this disappearance of sound at
every transition from a front surface to a side one, and vice
versä: again, in every transition from a front surface to an
end one, and vice versá, but no cessation of sound is per
ceived in the transition from a side surface to an end one, and
vice versä.    These phaenomena are not distinctly audible when
there is  any   noise, for which reason the experiments will be
best made at night.
   The following differences in these phaenomena from those
mentioned in the treatise alluded to (in the Jahrbuch 1826,
iii.   p.

 These equations are next to be reduced to two, the number of
 the unknown quantities, by employing the method of the least
 squares: thus
                      +    "º          = 277.842s       – 408:678      t.
 And, by solving these equations,
        Ds =      –
                 6;       A = D + Ds = 60856

 Returning now to the original equations (B), and substituting
the values of A and s, we shall obtain the errors, E°, E°,
E°, E°, or the quantities that must be added to the given
measurements on the left sides of the equations, in order to
make both sides exactly equal; as follows,
      E” =   — 20,        E* =    + 10,          E° =   — 7,       E* =     + 13.
The  greatest error is in the Peruvian arc, which appears to
be too great, as has generally been surmised.   But the small
ness of the errors proves the consistency of the different mea
surements; and shows that the four portions of the meridian,
although very remote from one another, belong to one and
the same elliptical spheroid.
     If
     we now substitute the data                  of   the Swedish measurement
in the formula (A), we shall get,
      98870 +   E° = A (1-622022                 + 0.8378.     e   – 0.022.      3.):
 and, by substituting the values of A and s, it will appear that
the error E = + 5. This measurement is therefore very
consistent with the other four; and, as it seems liable to no
just objection, it adds to the evidence in favour of the ellipti
 cal elements that have been found.
   The degree of the meridian bisected by the parallel of 45°, is
 111115 metres at zero of the thermometer.   This result is dedu
ced from the actual measurement of the meridional arc between
the parallels of Greenwich and Formentera, and is indepen
dent of any assumption about the figure of the earth.      To re
duce this length to fathoms at the temperature of 62° of Fahr.,

     must be multiplied by7     which gives 60758                            fathoms.
Now, if we put A = 45°-i-#, W = 45–3, we shall                              have,       in

        Measurements            of different Portions of the Meridian.                                                  347
or, in numbers 60856 (1–'001629) = 60757 fathoms, which
is only one fathom less than the observed quantity.
   There is also another measurement with which we may
compare the elliptical elements that have been found. A por
tion of the parallel to the equator in latitude 45° 43' 12", little
short of 13° in amplitude, has been measured, and the most
probable length of 1° of longitude on that parallel has been
fixed at 77865".75*.         The large arc was measured in six
portions, the difference of longitude between the extremities
of every portion being ascertained by means of signals made
by exploding gunpowder.                               If
                                       we compare the six degrees,
deduced from the several partial arcs, it must be allowed that
their differences are great and irregularif.       There must there
fore be considerable      uncertainty   in the arithmetical mean of
such irregular quantities; which mean is only three metres
less than the most probable value of a degree. The length of
a degree deduced from the four partial arcs contained within
the territory of France, which together exceed 7° of longi
tude, is 77885"'75, or 20 metres more than the length de
duced from the whole arc of about 13°f.           It is to be observed
that the errors of longitude at the intermediate stations accu
mulate as the arc is extended; so that there is not the same
advantage in measuring a large arc of the parallel, as in the
case of the meridian; for, in one instance, the total amplitude
is affected by the sum of the errors at              the intermediate                 all
stations; whereas,       the other,
                                in         affected only     the errors                                 by

 Now, put x = 45° 43' 12", and                                 a degree             of longitude at that

               42487.8 x (1 + 001661) = 425574 fathoms.
 But 77865".75 reduced to fathoms at 62° of Fahr. is equal to
 42578-2 fathoms, which is 20 fathoms more than the calcu
lated quantity.  If this discrepancy appear very great, we shall
only remark, that it is very small in comparison of the differ
ences of the degrees deduced from the partial arcs, and that
it supposes not quite so much as 1", of time, for the sum of

ment s; at the equator, the compression s has greater influ
ence on the length of a meridional arc, than at any other po
sition on the surface of the globe; and it follows that two arcs
of considerable extent, in the situations mentioned, combined
with other good measurements in our possession, must lead
to a very exact determination of the elliptical elements of the
figure of the earth. One remark it seems important to add;
namely, that the ellipticity cannot be determined with any
precision by combining different degrees of the meridian mea
sured in England; because the element sought has little                                         in
fluence on the lengths of such degrees. And this observation
may be extended to                all

   “Sometimes a combination of several individual crystals is
seen.    One end of the crystals is always fractured, while the
other often shows a tendency to a summit.
   “Besides the marked cleavages of E, those of B' and B are
also perceptible. Besides the cleavages, we perceive fissures;
also transverse fissures, which are sometimes irregular and
sometimes corresponding to the planes D'.”
   The fracture of diopside is imperfectly conchoidal and splin
tery. The angular pieces which are detached from it are fre
quently tabular and prismatic.
   Its colour is a pistachio-green or olive, but sometimes runs
in the same prism from greenish white to colourless.
   The crystals are usually translucent only, sometimes trans
parent. Small detached laminae can always be seen through,
and are slightly coloured. The fissures in the interior of the
crystals sometimes produce a play of colours.

     have not been able to perceive a double refraction in these
crystals. . The external planes as well as the cleavage-planes
show a glassy and pearly lustre. It scratches fluor spar, and is
scratched by felspar.

the residuum digested with water and muriatic- acid, a large
quantity of silica remained undissolved.
   Carbonate of soda precipitated from the solution when cold
some oxide of iron with a few traces of alumina; but oxalate
of potash precipitated much oxalate of lime, which was partly
ignited and partly mixed with caustic ammonia.    A very small
quantity of deutoxide of manganese was found mixed with the
lime. After this, carbonate of magnesia together with a little
manganese was precipitated, by means of carbonate of soda,
from the hot solution; and subsequently, by means of triple
phosphate of soda and ammonia, a considerable quantity of
magnesia.

            The composition of the      mussite indeed, according to Lau
         #.      differs considerably from that of our diopside: we might,
         ...
           owever, presume that this difference partly arises from the
         less perfect state of chemistry with respect to those substances
         in Laugier's time. It is possible, too, that the same circum
                       produced the smaller difference from the composi
         tion of our mineral which appears in the analysis of the ma
         lacolite or sahlite examined by Vauquelin+.
            Among the other existing analyses of minerals referred to
         pyroxene or augite, according to which other formations of
         augite-substance are proved, we must consider, with respect
         to the diopside of Fassa, several examinations made by Von
          Trolle Wachtmeister Hisinger, Von Bonsdorf, and H. Rose.
          From the comparison of the results of these analyses enume
         rated in the well-known treatise of Professor Rose, “On the
         Pyroxenet,” with those of the analyses just-mentioned of Lau
         gier and Vauquelin, and with those obtained by me on the
         composition of the diopside of Fassa, for which purpose I have
         prepared the following table; it seems that           the minerals                              all

           trod upon.   By Lieut.-Col. MILLER, F.R.S.*
            is a very simple contrivance, and will easily be un
THIS   derstood from the figure. A spring is attached to the
 upper part of the shell, which produces ignition by falling on
a copper cap; and a support is placed under the spring, moving
 on a hinge, with a handle attached to the support; so that by
 treading on the handle, the support is withdrawn, the spring
falls, and explosion follows. The sides of the shell must be
 of equal thickness, for the better splintering; and as an oval
form will be the most convenient for fixing the spring.            The
following construction is given:
                Length of shell............... 8 inches.
                Breadth of ditto ............. 5°5

   Shells of this description, it is conceived, might be made to
perform the duty of sentinels on many occasions, by giving
notice of the approach of an enemy, and presenting a con
siderable obstacle to his advance by their explosion. They
might accordingly be used with advantage in the ditches of

 with, and in some specimens the prism is so shortened that
 the pyramids appear to be nearly joined base to base. Co
 lumnar hexagonal prisms of opaque quartz are of frequent
 occurrence, forming the nucleus, round which the other cry
 stals are often clustered, or stalactitic chalcedony deposited.
 Of the transparent crystals, some are colourless; of the rest,
 the colours are ferruginous (this most common), clear topaz
 yellow, dark red passing into black; smoky brown (cairngorm);
 various shades of purple, violet, or rose-pink (amethystine
 quartz), and bright ruby red: these last are minute and very
 perfectly formed crystals, lining cellular quartz. The finest
 specimens of the amethystine quartz occur (very sparingly) in
 geodes, in the loose head; the rest are found clustered in
 rounded, reniform, or radiated masses, lining cavities, and in
 vesting and invested by chalcedony.
    Flint—In amorphous masses, and passing into chalcedony,

 quartz; stalactitic (this occasionally incloses distinct globules
of water), mamillated, botryoidal, and lenticular. The prevail
ing colours, various shades of ferruginous brown passing al
most into black; but occasionally, specimens are met with of
clear yellow; pure milk-white, passing into pearly and trans
lucent white; caerulean, passing into peach-colour, and light
gray; and fine plum-colour (the last from a bunch of manga
nese).     Frequently two or three successive coatings, some
times of the same, sometimes of distinct colours, invest each
other, between each of which a thin lining of clay is often               in
terposed; some of the white and caerulean varieties are hydro
phanous; others have a very delicate coating of aluminous
matter, which causes their colour to deepen considerably on
the application of moisture.      Pseudo-morphous crystals of this
substance also occur, formed within cavities from which other
crystallized substances have been by some natural cause, (pro
bably solution,) removed.        Irregular masses of siliceous mat
ter that have obviously invested, either wholly or partially, cry
stals of iron-ore. Iron-pyrites, quartz or garnet, are of frequent
occurrence.      I have specimens of the substance in moulds of

tube has moved, measuring an angle equal to 90° less by the
angle c(XS.
     f the arch AS and the tube be graduated, the correspond
ing divisions are easily noted as the mercury rises or sinks,
and the divisions can be marked on the former at leisure.
    Because in the tubes commonly to be obtained, the distance
cS, of the point of suspension above the axis of the tube, must
be very small, the adjustment is rendered comparatively easy,
by making the axle of a piece of thin steel wire bent in the
                -
form of fig. 2, the inner part of the curve being as nearly as
       Fig. 2.         S ................S.---------------

possible half the circumference of the tube; the curve being
underneath, the axle is fastened to the tube by a thread wound
four or five times round both, and they may be secured from
slipping by a drop or two of varnish.                     Now it is evident that
by increasing or diminishing the distance between the points
of support or bearing hooks, the centre of gravity c will be
more or less sunk below the points of suspension S, and the
distance cS will be obtained without the trouble of filing.                   A
knife-edge is however undoubtedly preferable to the wire.
   To find the centres of gravity on the tube, it is only neces.
sary to sling it in a horizontal position, by means of a thread
fastened to it at each end, and put over a pin: then a plumb
line, hung from the same pin, will cross the tube at the centre
of gravity, the place of which should be marked on the glass
by a file or diamond. The arch WPV" may be of pasteboard,
wood, or metal, and should be attached to the wires SP. At
P is a loop.or ring by which the instrument is suspended.
   If  the figure of the tube be altered, and the bulb contain
spirits of wine in the upper part and mercury in the lower, it
is evident the distance between the centres of gravity at any
two temperatures, and consequently the power of the instru
ment, will be much increased.              The shading in the subjoined
figure shows the portion of the bulb and tube to be occupied
by the quicksilver when the temperature is low.

   It may be added that thermometers of this construction might
perhaps advantageously accompany wheel-barometers in large
apartments or halls. .         I  am, Gentlemen, &c.

    Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and of the Histo
    rical Society of Pennsylvania, &c. To be completed in Sir Parts.
Th;         subjects which this work will bring before the public are
       arranged in the Museum of the Honourable East-India Com
pany. They consist principally of a general series of Lepidopte
rous insects from the island of Java, accompanied by an exten
sive set of drawings representing their metamorphosis, the history
of which is detailed in the Introduction. To this will be added
various subjects contained chiefly in a collection of insects from
Ceylon, presented by M. Jionville, and in a smaller miscellaneous
collection from continental India, presented by Claude Russell,
Esq., the brother of Dr. Patrick Russell. It is likewise the author's
intention to include such additions as may be made from time to
time to the Museum during the progress of his work, from the ter
 ritories of the Honourable Company in the Eastern World.
     The work will be published in royal quarto, and will consist of
 six parts, each containing about eighty pages of letter-press; the
 distribution of the subjects being the following:

consistent with the preservation of the style of publication in which
the work has been commenced. Those preparatory arrangements
which are inseparable from every undertaking of this nature have
in some measure retarded the first part, but the publishers are en
abled to engage, with every prospect of success, a regular conti
nuation of the work: accordingly they announce the appearance of
the second part early in July next, of the third, at the commence
ment of the ensuing year, and of the remaining parts at intervals
of six months. According to this plan, the whole will be completed
                                                                     -

    We congratulate the admirers of British Entomology on the long
expected appearance of Part IV. of Mr. Haworth's Lepidoptera
Britannica, which is at last completed.
    This comprehensive and valuable work consists of 609 closely
printed octavo pages, and 36 of Preface, and has been divided into
four parts; to the first of which was appended above 200 similar
pages, called Miscellanea Naturalia.
    Complete new-wrought descriptions and synonymies of                the all
known British Lepidoptera are given throughout          Latin; together

   The ship which met with the accident of which the effects are
the subject of this communication, was the American packet the
New York, of 526 tons, commanded by Captain Bennet.             She
sailed from New York for Liverpool, on the 16th of last April; and
on the morning of the 19th was struck by lightning, which shattered
 the main royal mast, and gliding down the iron chain main-top-sail
  tie, burst the iron bands on the main-mast head.                   It was thence
  conducted by the iron main-top-sail sheets, to the iron work of
 the pumps.       It then entered between decks, demolishing the bulk

 copper.    In one instance, in which the crystals had a purplish tint, a
 trace of muriate of cobalt was detected.        From the observations
 made by the author at different periods, he concludes that the dense
 white smoke which rose in immense columns from the stream of
 lava, and which reflected the morning and evening light of the
purest tints of red and orange, was produced by the salts which
were sublimed with the steam. It presented a striking contrast to
the black smoke arising from the crater, which was loaded with
earthy particles, and which in the night was highly luminous at
the moment of the explosion.        The phaenomena observed by the
author afford a sufficient refutation of                         all

  of these parts, both in the virgin     and in the impregnated animal; to
  gether with the author's opinions respecting the physiology of certain
 structures which have been hitherto unnoticed, and of others which.
  have been incorrectly or imperfectly described by former investigators
  of this interesting branch of natural science.
     The author first pointed out the anatomical peculiarities which he,
 had discovered in a dissection of the pouch and mammae of a young
 and unimpregnated kangaroo; by which it appears, that, in the virgin
 state, the two upper nipples only are found to be developed, and that,
 beneath each of these a minute circular aperture, resembling in ap
 pearance the mouth of a follicle, occupies the exact situation in which
 the lower teat is known to exist in the adult impregnated animal
 The mammae are described as consisting of double glandular struc
 tures on each side; they are situated directly behind the follicular
 openings already mentioned, and are closely confined to the posterior
surface of the integuments.           Each double mamma is formed by an
upper and smaller gland, which is attached by               excretory ducts     its                           to

                                excretory duct could        traced.   The folli be
cular apertures which occupy            the pouch the situation
                                                  in                  the lower                of

their papillary terminations. He further states, that          artificially                   by
everting the parts, two perfect teats are produced      the precise situa       in

        those which are found       after life.   inhas been however as    It
 certained that this extraordinary change occurs only during the first
gestation, since after being once developed the teat remains perma
nently formed and projected.

commend to the Society to elect him a member for life.
   The Council wish to observe, with respect to the measure so re
commended,      that though it may seem equivalent to the acknowledge

of some scientific bodies are deemed honorary members, yet they

mentioned, as a proof of the liberal spirit which animated those mem

on the integration of equations of differences, in the Turin Memoirs

 . The Council cannot conclude this Report, without an earnest ex
hortation to the members of the Society, collectively and individu
ally, to cooperate by their active exertions in the great cause for
which the Institution exists.         They entreat them to remember that
every one who possesses an instrument, whose claims rise even not
above a humble mediocrity, has it in his power to chalk out for him
self a useful and honourable line of occupation for leisure hours, in
which his labour shall be really valuable, if duly registered: that those
who possess good instruments, have a field absolutely boundless for
their exertions. To such they would hold out the brilliant examples
of many other of the members and associates of this Society, of a
Bessel, a Struve, as showing what may be accomplished by perse
vering industry, and how little reason there is to apprehend the fail
ure of matter for their researches.          They would strongly impress on
the minds of      allobservers, however, whether private             public, the

 you have just heard, I have now to call your attention to the subject
 of the honorary marks of this Society's approbation, which it is part
 of our business at this meeting to bestow. The selection of objects
 on which such distinction may most deservingly and most usefully
 be conferred, has been, in this instance, of much interest and some
 difficulty,+not from a paucity of claims, but from their variety and
 magnitude. On                   all
                             sides, both abroad and           home, the spirit        at                               of

been sung by poets, and celebrated by the pen of the most accom
 lished of civilized travellers; and the shadowy lustre of the Magel
}.    clouds, has supplied imagery for the dim and doubtful mythology
of the most barbarous nations upon earth. But it is the task of the
Astronomer to open up these treasures of the southern sky, and dis
play to mankind their secret and intimate relations. Apart, however,
from speculative considerations, a perfect knowledge of the astronomy
of the southern hemisphere is becoming daily an object of greater prac
tical interest, now that civilization and intercourse are rapidly spread
ing through those distant regions,—that our own colonies are rising
into importance,—and that the vast countries of South America are
gradually assuming a station in the list of nations, corresponding
with their extent and natural advantages.           It is no longer possible to
remain content with the limited and inaccurate knowledge we have
hitherto possessed of southern stars, now that we have a new geo
graphy to create, and latitudes and longitudes without end, to de
termine by their aid. The advantages too, to be obtained, even for
the perfect and refined astronomy of the north, by placing nearly a
diameter of the globe, between the stations of observatories,                  and
taking up the objects common to both hemispheres, in a point of
view, and under circumstances so every way opposite to those which
exist here, have been strongly pointed out by a venerable and illus
trious member of this Society, in an elaborate paper published in                           its
Memoirs, and would alone suffice           justify

solstices    of 1823, were communicated by Sir Thomas Brisbane to
this Society, in a letter to our late worthy president, together with a
considerably extensive series of observations of principal stars, chiefly
those visible in both hemispheres, and which have undergone a care
ful reduction and close scrutiny in the hands of Dr. Brinkley, the
details of which, as well as the original observations, are printed in
the first part of the second volume of the Transactions of this Society,
and which justify, in the eyes of that experienced observer, as they
must in those of every practical astronomer, a decided opinion of the
 great care and skill with which they have been made.
    A great number of occasional observations,—such as eclipses, oc
cultations, and observations of the planets Venus and Uranus, near
 their conjunctions and oppositions, and of comets from the same
 source,—are also printed in the same volume. One of the most re
 markable single results we owe to the establishment of Sir Thomas
 Brisbane's observatory, consists in the re-discovery of the comet of

rance that wheresoever his future fortunes may lead him—whether
 in the land which has already witnessed his meritorious labours—to
complete and extend them, or in his native country, which is both able
and willing to appreciate his value, to put the finishing stroke to the
noble fabric he has been mainly instrumental in raising, by taking a
leading part in the less exciting, but not less useful or indispensable
work, of reducing the observations already made :-in either case he
will be attended by our best wishes for his prosperity and happiness,

the rough manuscripts to her cottage at the dawn of day, and pro
duced a fair copy of the night's work on the subsequent morning;
she it was who planned the labour of each succeeding night; she it
was who reduced every observation, and made every calculation;
she it was who arranged every thing in systematic order; and she
it was who helped him to obtain an imperishable name.
   But her claims to our gratitude end not here; as an original
observer she demands, and I am sure she has, our most unfeigned
thanks. Occasionally her immediate attendance during the obser
vations could be dispensed with. Did she pass the night in repose :
No such thing; wherever her illustrious brother was, there you were
sure to find her also. A sweeper planted on the lawn became her
object of amusement, but her amusements were of the higher order,
and to them we stand indebted for the discovery of the comet of 1786;
of the comet of 1788; of the comet of 1791; of the comet of 1793;
and of the comet of 1795, since rendered familiar to us by the re
markable discovery of Encke. Many also of the nebulae contained in
Sir Wm. Herschel's catalogues were detected by her during these
hours of enjoyment.     Indeed, in looking at the joint labours of these
extraordinary personages, we scarcely know, whether most to admire
the intellectual power of the brother, or the unconquerable industry
of the sister.
   In the year 1797, she presented to the Royal Society a catalogue
of 560 stars taken from Flamsteed's observations, and not inserted in
the British catalogue; together with a collection of errata that
should be noticed in the same volume.
   Shortly after the death of her brother, Miss Herschel returned to
Hanover.      Unwilling, however, to relinquish her astronomical la
bours whilst any thing useful presented itself, she undertook, and
completed the laborious reduction of the places of 2500 nebulae, to
the 1st Jan. 1800, presenting in one view the results of        allSir Wm.
                              onthose bodies; thus bringing
                                                                 to
Herschel's observations                                          a     close
half century spent
     a                in  astronomical labour.
   For this more immediately, and          to

conviction that the doing so would have been a dereliction of public
duty, it was
   Resolved unanimously, “That a Gold Medal of this Society be given
to Miss Caroline Herschel, for her recent reduction, to January 1800,
of the Nebulae discovered by her illustrious brother, which may be
considered as the completion of a series of exertions probably unpa
ralleled either in magnitude or importance, in the annals of astrono
mical labour.” A vote which I am sure every one whom I have the
honour to address, will most heartily confirm.
   Mr. HERschel.–In the name of the Astronomical Society of Lon
don, I present this Medal to your illustrious Aunt. In transmitting it
to her, assure her that since the foundation of this Society no one
has been adjudged, which has been earned by services such as hers.
Convey to her our unfeigned regret that she is not resident amongst
us; and join to it our wishes, nay, our prayers, that as her former
days have been glorious, so her future may be happy.

                     AT                                        OF   THE
           ROYAL INSTITUTION OF GREAT BRITAIN.
    March 21.—Mr. Millington entered into an experimental account
of  the manufacture of paper, principally with a view of introducing
and explaining by working models the making of paper by machinery,
and especially some recent and important improvements. Numerous
specimens of paper, varying both in quality and size, were exhibited.
    Some experiments on the deceptive appearances of coloured sha
dows were shown in the Library by Mr. Marshall; and a large meteoric
stone having a very peculiar polished metallic fracture was laid with
other things upon the table.
    March 28.—Dr. Harwood gave an account of some parts of the
structure and oeconomy of the Greenland whale, during which he en
tered into the illustration of certain views relative to the blubber and
the skin which he had been induced to entertain, from a close exami
nation of these and other parts of the animal. The specimens ob
tained for illustration from the museums of the Zoological Society,
by Mr. Brookes and Dr. Harwood, were very fine and numerous.
  . The library-tables were covered with objects of interest from the
 East, from the museum of Lady Raffles and the collection of Mr.
                                             -
 Bennett.
    April 18.—Mr. Ainger delivered an illustrated explanation of some
 recent improvements in clock and watch escapements, especially of
 the one invented by Mr. Hardy.       The principles of the four great
 divisions of escapements were exhibited and distinguished.

 = 6-5. ...7.0. Sp. gr. = 3-865. Before the blowpipe, upon char
coal, the tautolite melts to a blackish scoria, which is attracted by
the magnet; with borax it melts to a clear green glass. These and
other reactions show that the mineral consists of silica, black prot
oxide of iron, magnesia, and alumina. It is found in the volcanic
feldspath-rocks, in the neighbourhood of the Lake Laach Sea in
Rhein-Prussia.     The tautolite seems to be related to the chrysolite,
as the Ceylanite to the Spinelle.—Brewster's Journal of Science.

  4.08        On the Causes  of Single and Erect Vision.
  pression of the purple ground must be repeated in two different
  parts of the sentient retina; two scarlet lines must be thence
  impelled, and these made obvious by the intervening horizontal
 impulse between the circles; for could the intervening space be
 absorbed, and each point of scarlet coalesce with each point
  of scarlet, and purple with purple, there would then be but
jour impulsions of colouring, but four varieties, which would
 be inefficient to the observation of two figures. A coalescence
 of similar points of colour may perhaps produce a superposi
  tion or increment of colour, so as to create a superior bril
 liancy in the appearance of the object; but a coalescence of
 points cannot give a sense of the separation of points.      There
  fore for the mind to have a sense of one  figure, there must betwo
 consciousnesses of colour; and to have a sense of two figures,
  there must be five distinguishable consciousnesses of colour.
  However often one colour only be repeated, there will be no
 figure; however often two similar colours be repeated, (no in
 tervening one being supposed,) but one figure will arise; whilst
 to entertain a sense of two figures, five impulsions are necessary.
  I  hold it therefore as an axiom in the laws of vision, that the
 repetition of similar impulsions of colour will not yield a num
  ber of figures equal to the number of such impulsions ; but that
 the number of figures perceived, arises from those proportional
 intervals of the impulsions of colour, which must vary in a certain
 ratio to the number of figures impelled.
     However, therefore, the number of eyes may be multiplied,
 the mind can have no consciousness of any additional number
 of figures, whilst only similar impulsions of colour are yielded
 to 15.
     Let us enter into some further detail. If one scarlet circle
 on the purple ground be painted on the corresponding points
 of two retinae, and thence impelled to the mind, there can still
 only arise the sense of one scarlet circle; for there have existed
 but four physical varieties on the retinae, and but four varieties
 have been impelled to the mind: and it has been proved that
Jive physical varieties are necessary to exist upon a retina, or
 upon retinae however numerous, in order to impel correspond
 ing consciousnesses to the mind, and which would be necessary
 for the mental apprehension of two figures. Let the figures
 without an intervening horizontal colour be supposed to be
 marked thus,
                 6–46.       The intervening horizontal colouring
 necessary to separate the painting of two figures on the retinae,
 is not painted on either retina; it does not exist; and therefore
 no conscious separation of two figures can possibly arise to

 the mind. There exists indeed a certain space between the
 two eyes outwardly on the face, but the colouring of this                               in
 tervening space is not painted on either retina, and therefore
 cannot be noticed by the mind; nor is there any intervening
 horizontal purple presented to the mind: Each point of scarlet
 does but coalesce with each point of scarlet, and each point of
 purple on one retina, with each point of the similar purple on
 the other retina; there is no surplus intervening purple on
 either retina, and it has been shown that “repetitions of similar
 impressions of colour do not yield to the - mind the sense of
 an equal number of figures.”
    But should the scarlet circle be painted on points of the
 retinae which do not correspond, then there will necessarily
 arise the sense of two figures; because in that case dissimilar
 impulsions of colour are carried forward to the mind, and
 yield that proportional variety which determines the obser
 vation of conscious duplicates: for the pictures are then im
 mediately painted upon different parts of their respective
 retinae, and the distance between two objects “will be pro
 portional to the arch of either retina, which lies between the
 picture on that retina, and the point corresponding to that of
 the picture on the other retina".” On this intervening arch a
 surplus quantity of purple would be interiorly and horizontally
 painted, and would thence separate the two scarlet figures:
Jive impulsions would carry five conscious colours to the mind,
 and two separated figures would immediately be observed.
    An illustration of these ideas, and especially of this last state
 ment of Dr. Reid's, might very easily be imagined, by con
 ceiving two small terrestrial globes to be painted with precisely
similar colours: Let them berectified to the same degree of lati
tude and longitude, and similar colours only will appear on the
visible surfaces of each; turn them both so many degrees to
the east or west, still only similar colours will present them
selves; but   let         the globes remain

                  one                               rest, and turn the

to the same degree of latitude and longitude; but the moment
they were separated by an alteration of the longitude of either,

   The following passage is extracted from the Encyclopedia
Britannica, and is a quotation from Dr. Wells's Essay on
Single Vision.               “If
                         the question be concerning an object at
the concourse of the optic axes, it is seen single; because                                            its

  stance from the perceiving mind, denying it to consist either
 in a sensation, impression, or idea, and as possible to be seen
 without the intervention of colour*.
     It appears to me strange, when contradiction is stamped
 upon the very expressions which convey these ideas, that Dr.
 Reid's notions should seem to be the data for the reasonings
 of the author of the “Explanation of Erect and Single Vision,”
 published in the “Library of Useful Knowledge.”
     I must however, in common honesty, here take notice of an
 objection which I have known to be made to the views I en
 tertain on this subject: it                            is,
                                     “that we see objects          different                                   in

                  either eye, when the other          alternately opened               is

     But to return “to the explanation of the Cause of Erect and
  Single Vision, published by the Society for the Diffusion of
  Useful Knowledge*;”—it appears to me to be as much at va
  riance with a sound, metaphysical, demonstrable conclusion
  concerning the nature of the perception of visible figure by the

  mind, as are the authors to whom have alluded; and as much
  so with an acknowledged law,-with a proved physical fact, in
  respect to the time required for the motion of light.
     The author of the “Explanation of the Cause of Erect and
  Single Vision,” says+: “As the lines of visible direction cross
  each other at the centre of visible direction, an erect object is the
  necessary result of an inverted image ;” but this is not the same
  thing with THE PERCEPTION of an erect object. If it be said the
  word perception is understood though not expressed, then the
  mind is supposed to see the very erect object, out of itself, at a
  distance from itself; that                 is,
                                     the mind feels colour, perceives
  visible figure (its result), there, where             not, which       im

  possible.
     Again,   it  is known fact, that the light emitted from the sun,

recede from the perpendicular in the opposite direction to the
jet.—I have made some experiments on a vessel suspended in
that manner; and in order to ascertain the reaction as accu
 rately as possible, I made use of a balance-beam furnished
 with a perpendicular arm of the same length as the horizontal
 arms, as represented at fig. 1. The scales were exactly ba
 lanced, and the end of the rod D made just to touch the side
 of the vessel.-The orifice was then opened, and the water in
 the vessel was kept uniformly at the same height by a stream
 falling gently on the plate E. The scale F having been raised
 by the reaction of the jet, weights were put into it till it was
 brought exactly to the position in which it was before the ori
 fice was opened. The diameter of the vessel was 7 inches,
 and the height BC exactly 3 feet.                              I
                                              tried orifices of various
 diameters from 35 to 7 of an inch. Their exact diameters
 were ascertained by a micrometer, and the time carefully ob
 served in which 30 lbs. of water were discharged through each
 orifice.
    When the orifice was made in a thin plate (ºth of an inch in
 thickness), I found the reaction to be greater than that stated in
 Sir Isaac Newton’s first conclusion, in the ratio of 1-14 to 1.
 There was some variation in the results of the experiments.
 The greatest reaction, however, was as 1-16 to 1, and the least
 as 1-09 to 1, which fall far short of Sir Isaac Newton’s last in
 ference.   The velocity of the water at the orifice (ascertained
 by observing the time in which 30 lbs. were discharged) was
 less than that which a body would acquire in falling freely
 from B to C, in the ratio of -6 to 1.
     I found no constant ratio to subsist between the diameter
 of the contracted vein and that of the orifice; and observing
 considerable opacity in the jet at the contracted vein,             con                           I
 cluded it to be divided into a number of different filaments,

 and gave up           hopesall          of
                                  ascertaining the actual area

 be   PR, which is also the head due to v, the velocity of the
 orifice. We shall therefore have W = v; and if CP represent
 the total moving force necessary to raise the water from C to
 P, CR = AB will represent that part of it which is expended
 in producing change of figure. The greatest velocity, there
 fore, that the orifice, when the machine meets with no resist
 ance, can acquire,    will be  v 4.gx4 h.
    When the velocity of the orifice is less than that, V will be
 greater than v; and V–v, the absolute velocity of the water
 after it has left the machine, will be w/ 8 (4gh + v )—v. The
 head or the moving force expended in producing that velocity
 will be as A/   8 (4gh + 5–0.

we shall find v = W 2gh (w/ 5–1) = 6.3056 v<U+017F>h for the
velocity of the orifice when the machine produces a maximum
of effect; and in that case the above sum becomes = 4472/h.
    We shall therefore have h–14472 h = 5528 h for the maxi
mum of effect, supposing h to represent the whole moving
force of a given quantity of water descending from A to B.
This effect is considerably greater than that which the same
quantity of water would produce if applied to an undershot
water-wheel, but less than that which it would produce if pro
perly applied to an overshot water-wheel.
    Respecting the maximum of effect produced by machines,
I  wish to observe, that in the actual construction of machines
it is necessary to aim at a maximum quite different from that
which is usually proposed in books on the theory of mechanics.
This will perhaps be best ex
plained by examining the sim
ple case where a given weight
P, (fig. 3) connected with an
other W, by a string passing
over the pulley F, descends
vertically and raises W, with
out friction, from the hori
zontal line AC along the       in
clined plane AB.           If we
make AB : BC :: 2 W: P, W will be raised to B in the least

time.*; and upon this principle, the maximum of effect in
machines is usually demonstrated in theory. In practice, how
ever, the object is not merely to raise W to B in the least
time, but to raise it with the least expenditure of moving force.
When it is raised in the least time, P must descend through
a space = AB, but when it is raised with the least moving
force, P descends through a space = }AB only. For, if we
make BD= }AB, and let W ascend along any concave sur
face DEB, of which BD is the chord, it will be raised to B
by the descent of P through a space = BD, and it will be at
rest when it arrives at B. This is so obvious, that it would

LXV.           On the Figure              of the Earth,              as deduced from Measure
    ments      of the Meridian.                    By    J.    Ivory, Esq. M.A. F.R.S.*
     my last communication I have shown that the five por
INtions of the meridian which have been most exactly mea
sured, belong to one and the same elliptical spheroid, although
they occupy very dissimilar situations on the earth's surface.
The almost perfect precision with which the elliptical elements
agree with the actual measurements, is indeed not a little re
markable, and seems hitherto to have escaped notice.     In re
turning to this subject, which is of great importance in the
question about the figure of the earth, my intention is to dis
cuss it more thoroughly, by examining it in every point of
view that may throw light upon                                it.
   The equations deduced from the five measurements are                                                                as

484            Mr. Ivory   on the Figure                 of the Earth, as deduced
Here the factor on the right-hand side is but slightly affected
by the terms containing s, which reduce it to 12:37; and
D  (45°) is found equal to 60757, the same value derived from
the two elements, and very nearly the same that results from
the actual measurement without any assumption about the
figure of the earth".    It is therefore certain that the elements
which have been found represent with great exactness both
the whole arc between Dunkirk and Formentera, and also its
mean curvature.            I
                      have likewise found that the same elements
represent, with small errors, the partial arcs between Dunkirk
and Montjouy, and Montjouy and Formentera. But it is well
known that the four sections of the arc between Dunkirk and
 Montjouy are very irregular; and the causes of the irregu
larity have not been very well explained. . Whatever these
causes may be, they extend their influence to the measure
ments that have been made in England.      Unless      have been          I
misinformed, a re-measurement between Greenwich and Paris
has lately been executed, the results of which, when made
public, will probably help to clear up the perplexing anoma
lies that occur in the comparison of the partial arcs.
   We may now compare the Swedish, or most northerly, arc
with the curvature at the pole. We have,
                           A = D (90°) x (1–5);
and, by substitution, we get,
          98870   = D (90°). (1622022—0.7842. s—0-860.                              s).
From this equation, taking the foregoing value          (90°)            of   s,   D
will      be
      found equal     61051,   toonly three fathoms less than
                                                    or
the value deduced from the two elements; and even this dif
ference will disappear,   we take into account the error
                                 if                      the                            of

observations of the same kind, for the purpose of verification, and
 of a nearer approach to accuracy, the whole time required will not
be more than five minutes, during which it is not probable that any
sensible disturbance can have taken place in the position of the        in
strument from changes of temperature.
    Tables are given containing registers of numerous series of ex
periments made, both by the author and by several of his friends,
with a view to determine the stability of the instrument, and the
degree of reliance that can be placed in the results. In the first
series, out of sixty independent determinations of the zenith point,
there are twenty-five, the error of each of which does not exceed
 one-tenth of a second; thirty-seven under two-tenths; forty-seven
under three-tenths; fifty-five under four-tenths; three between four
and five-tenths; and two a little above half a second. But the author
thinks it probable that the greater part of these errors, minute as
they are, must be attributed to want of power in the micrometer,
which power is directly as the focal length of the object-glass, or
mirror, of the telescope to which it is attached, and which neces
sarily limits the precision of which it is capable.
   The author next gives the results of some experiments with a
collimator made for Captain Foster, having a float of only five inches
in diameter, and with a telescope five inches long: the errors, gene
rally, do not amount to more than two-tenths of a second.
   He then enters into details as to the manner of using the vertical
floating collimator in astronomical observations, beginning with the
portable azimuth and altitude circle described by the Rev. F. Wol
laston in his Fasciculus Astronomicus, and applicable to other similar
instruments. The new collimator affords, also, the most perfect me
thod of adjusting the line of collimation of a mural circle, or of
placing it at right angles to the axis.
   The author next proceeds to describe the method of applying the
instrument to the zenith telescope. In comparing the observations
made by the zenith sector belonging to the Board of Ordnance, with
the zenith telescope used in conjunction with the vertical floatin
collimator, the mean of errors in the former case was 4-0"-54           .#
 –0"-75; in the latter, 4-0'.44 and —0"-66. From observations
made on y Draconis, the zenith distance of which at Greenwich is
O° 2' 6"-36, and at York Gate O90'35".67, the difference of latitude
between the two places was found to be 0° 2'42"-03, that of
 Greenwich being 51°28'38".96, and of York Gate 51° 31' 20".99.
The decimals of a second, by the azimuth and altitude circle and
horizontal floating collimator were 94; by the same instrument
and the vertical floating collimator 76, and by the zenith telescope,
 and the vertical floating collimator ‘99: the mean being '9".
   From the greater degree of precision attainable by the employ
ment of the vertical floating collimator, from the facility of    itscon
struction and application, and the time saved by using      it,the author
deems  it  not unreasonable       toinfer, that, ere long, the use of the
level and plumb-line

   May 4.—The reading of Mr. Morgan's paper On the mammary
organs of the kangaroo was continued, containing further particulars
of the dissection of these parts, as well as of the muscles attached
to the marsupial bones, in the adult and impregnated animal.
These bones, with their ligamentous and muscular connections, were
described, and several errors in Sir Everard Home's published ac
count of these parts were pointed out. The author then stated his
own opinions respecting the use of these structures. He stated that
the marsupial bones are formed, 1st, for the purpose of giving that
firm support to the superincumbent abdominal viscera which the
narrow pelvis of the animal is incapable of affording while in the
erect posture; and, 2ndly, for the purpose of constituting a fixed
point of resistance against which the mammae are squeezed by the
muscular girdle already described as inclosing those glands be
tween their fibres. By this arrangement the female is enabled to
empty by compression the excretory ducts of           mammae, and thus          its
to force their secretions into the mouth      the imperfectly organized
                                                                    of
young, which during the earlier periods            existence appears in
                                                                     of   its

     March 21.-Benjamin Silliman, M.D. LL.D. of Yale College,
 North America, was elected a Foreign Member of this Society.
 Francis Finch, Esq. and Thomas Winter, Esq., both of West Brom -
 wich, Staffordshire, were elected Fellows of this Society.
    A paper was read, intitled “Topographical and Geological No
 tices, from information collected during the Expedition to the North
west coast of America under the command of Captain Franklin; by
 John Richardson, M.D. F.R.S., &c.”
    The expedition under Captain Franklin having arrived at their in
tended winter-quarters on the shore of Great Bear Lake, examined
in 1825 the vicinity of that lake, and the course of the Mackenzie
River from thence to the sea. The author subsequently accompanied
Captain Franklin down the river, as far as Point Separation, in lat.
67° 38'; from whence the latter proceeded westward to lat. 70°26',
long. 148° 52':—the extreme western point seen by the expedition
being in long. 149°37' west.       Dr. Richardson at the same time
went eastward to the mouth of the Copper Mine River, and thence
returned overland and across the Great Bear Lake, to the head    -
quarters.
   This paper contains an account of the specimens collected, and the
geological observations made by both divisions of the party; and
gives in considerable detail a description of the vicinity of Great Bear
Lake, with a more general one of the banks of the Mackenzie and
of the coast to the East of               it;

the eastward being abrupt, but the slope towards the W. more gra
dual. These mountains join the sea on the west of the Mackenzie;
and at their termination are divided into four groups or chains, to
which Captain Franklin has given the names of Richardson's, Buck
land's, the British, and Romanzoff chains.       The land again becomes
lower to the west of the chain last mentioned, and continues to be so
from thence to the remotest point arrived at; no prominent elevations
having been observed to the west of long. 146°.
    2. Another very extensive tract of primitive rocks in the north of
America has nearly the same direction with the range of the Rocky
Mountains, but the two ranges converge towards the north; the
distance between them being, in lat. 50°, 700 miles;–about 220 miles
where it was traversed by Captain Franklin, in going from Hudson's
 Bay to Lake Winipeg –and in lat. 66° only 200 miles. This east
ern primitive tract consists principally of granite and gneiss ; it ex
hibits great uniformity of character, contains no very elevated ground,
 and is in fact traversed by several rivers which arise in the Rocky
 Mountains. It is flanked on both sides by extensive calcareous tracts.
    3. The north-eastern extremity of the Rocky Mountain chain, near
 the mouth of the Mackenzie, consists of grauwacke and other transi
 tion-rocks, interposed apparently between the primary and the cal
 careous districts.     In some of the other places described, a rock
 resembling the old-red-sandstone of England, occupies a similar                                     si
 tuation.
    4. The tract that intervenes between the Rocky Mountains and the
 eastern primary band above mentioned, consists principally of cal

     The remains of the mastodon are by far the most abundant in this
collection, and amount to about 150 fragments.
     Of the rhinoceros there are about 10 fragments.
     Of a small species of hippopotamus, 2.
     Of the hog, l ; and of the ox, deer and antelope, about 20.
     Of the gavial and alligator, about 50.
     Of the emys, 20; and trionyx, 10.
     One fragment of emys is so large, that the animal of which it
formed a part, must have been several feet in width.
     The state of preservation of these bones is very perfect, from their
being penetrated with hydrate of iron, and thereby rendered strong.
Not one of them is silicified, though they have been erroneously
stated to be so, in some of the periodical journals.
      The district in which they were found is a little North of the town

 intersected by ravines, and cemented occasionally into a breccia by
 carbonate of lime, and sometimes by hydrate of iron.                     Over the sur
 face of these hills were scattered the fragments of bones and wood,
 some quite naked and loose, others half buried in the sand and gravel.
 Many fragments of wood lay also at the bottom of the ravines.

 that abound along the whole course of the river within this high
 flood level, and in the great alluvial delta that extends from a little
 below Prome to Rangoon and the gulf of Martaban.
     The recent bones and recent wood which he observed to be stranded
 on some of these islands, were not in a state of progress towards
 becoming mineralized, but were falling rapidly to decay.
•   The existence of so many animal remains analogous to those that
 occur in the diluvium of Europe, in a matrix which so nearly re
 sembles that diluvium, and which so decidedly differs from the allu
 vium, and freshwater, and tertiary strata of the adjacent country,
 seems to authorize us to refer this matrix to a similar diluvial de--
 posit in the valley of the Irawadi, reposing irregularly upon the ter
 tiary and other stratified rocks, that form the basis of that district.
     Besides the tertiary strata above enumerated, there are specimens
 of grauwacke and transition-limestone from several distant points in
 the valley of the Irawadi between Prome and Ava, which render it
 probable that the fundamental rocks of this valley belong to the trans
 ition series.
     On the north of Ava there are chains of primitive mountains
 abounding with statuary marble, associated, as usual, with horn
 blende and mica slate.
     We may therefore consider it as now established, on the authority
 of Mr. Crawfurd's notes and specimens, that the Burmese country
 not only contains the remains of fossil animals above enumerated,
 but also affords examples of the following geological formations,-
 which can be identified with those of Europe; namely—
     1. Alluvium.
     2. Diluvium.
     3. Freshwater Marl.
     4. London Clay and Calcaire grossier.
     5. Plastic Clay, with            its
                                 sands and gravel.

   The first part of the above ephemeris (to the end of the year 1828)
is taken from Mr. Encke's own computations for Paris time 0°.3, as in
serted in Professor Schumacher's Astronomische Nachrichten, No.123.
That part of it which belongs to the ensuing year 1829, is taken from
a letter addressed to the President of this Society by Dr. Olbers, and
is computed for the time of midnight at Paris. The positions are
 computed for every third or fourth day only, at the beginning and end
 of the ephemeris, and for every second day towards the middle: this
 being quite sufficient to enable the observer to find the place of the
 comet in the heavens. The original computations are extended only
 to minutes of space; but the right ascensions are here converted into
 the nearest second of time, for the convenience of the observer.

 comet as possible, particularly in the southern hemisphere, where it

   Lastly, there was read the following communication from the Rev.
Thomas John Hussey, to Francis Baily, Esq.
   “In forming a correct catalogue of the stars situated between 15° N.
and 15° S. declination, and extending from 13° 56" to 15" 4m R.A.
from the catalogues of Piazzi and Bradley, and the observations of
Lalande and Bessel, Mr. Dawson and myself have been much struck
with the difference between the places of particular stars, as laid down
by Piazzi and Bradley, and the places assigned by reducing the ob
servations of M. Bessel. The results obtained from the Histoire
Céleste come as nearly to the standard catalogue as can be expected,
considering the nature of the instrument employed            determining                             for

        many of the above cases it is probable that the difference be
tween Piazzi's catalogue for 1800, and one reduced to that epoch from
Bessel's observations, may arise from error of observation : in others
the almost identity of the observations seems to prove at once the skill
of  the observer, and a proper motion in the star; while again there
is one (No. 2.) which possibly may be regarded as conclusive on the
latter point. I would also suggest two instances of what appear
errors of the press, or perhaps in reading
Bessel's zones.

of modelling in clay, to the last touch required to complete his sub
ject in marble; and the various operations of modelling, casting,
chiseling, and the use and theory of the different instruments used,
were explained and illustrated by examples. For these purposes
clay-models, plaster-casts, and blocks of marble in different pro
gressive states, were placed upon the table, upon which the work
men carried on their several operations.
    May 9.-Mr. Faraday gave a lecture on the production of musi.
 cal sound, with an explication of the principles of action in some
new musical instruments.        He stated his information to be derived
altogether from Mr.Wheatstone, to whom, of course, the new facts
brought forward belonged. The nature of the pitch of sounds was
first explained, and stated to be the quality by which musical sounds
are distinguished from mere noise. The credit of the first philoso
phical account of this quality was attributed to Gallileo, who proved
that it depended altogether upon the number of impulses in a given
time. An experiment by that philosopher, apparently forgotten in
modern times, but described in his Dialogues, was repeated:—it con
sisted in drawing the point of a blade over a metal plate so as to
produce sound, and counting or comparing the dots which are al
ways produced upon the plates, and which are the records of the
number of vibrations necessary to the pitch of sound produced.
    Hook's experiment, in which the teeth of a revolving wheel were
made to beat against a card, was repeated, and the pitch of sound
shown to correspond with the number of impulses in a given time. An
extension of this experiment by Mr.Wheatstone was also described,
in which the harmonics of a stretched string were produced by
holding it against the wheel; the string producing sound whenever
the velocity of the wheel was such that the impulses of the teeth
corresponded in frequency with the vibrations of the string or of
any of   itsaliquot parts.
    Robison's mode     of  producing musical sounds                 by    air
                                                                    passing
through     astop-cock rapidly revolving, was then explained and                     il
lustrated; afterwards, Cagniard

tion; and from these were drawn the explanation              the principles
                                                                   of

Board, gave      an account   of the  rise, progress,  and    present state
of naval architecture. To make his historical observations more
clear, he first stated the elements concerned             the structure of
                                                             in
ships, as stability, floatation, masts and yard, &c. &c., and then traced

results, by teaching him to conjure up inflammatory spirits from
the surface of the “vasty deep,” and to turn water into fire, Sir H.
Davy has shown it is not necessary that Pluto should ascend from
the lowest depths of his empire to produce the phaenomena of vol
canos, and much less so to bring about a chemical union between
silex, alumina, lime, and iron, the chief constituents of basalt or
trap. Nec Deus intersit dignus nisi vindice nodus.
                          ANALYSES                 OF TOURMALINES.
  M. Gmelin      has analysed a great many varieties of this mineral; the
method     adopted   is the following:—The mineral reduced to a fine
powder is mixed with carbonate of barytes, and strongly heated. The
mass is afterwards treated with a sufficient quantity of muriatic acid
to dissolve it entirely, and the solution is evaporated upon a sand
bath to dryness. M. Gmelin ascertained by direct experiment that at
this temperature the quantity of boracic acid volatilized is so minute
that it may be neglected without any sensible error. The silica is ob
tained in the usual manner, by treating the residuum of evaporation
with water.     Carbonate of ammonia is added to the solution, and
after filtration, and evaporation to dryness, the residuum is gradually
heated to low redness.                 In      this manner, no boracic acid can be lost,
because it is combined with ammonia; and thus during calcination at
a red heat, no acid or aqueous vapour is evolved, as in the decompo
sition of sulphate of ammonia. The residuum after being weighed, is
washed with alcohol mixed with a little muriatic acid; the alcohol
being separated is burnt; the operation is repeated until the alcohol
does not give a green flame. All the boracic which is combined with
the ammonia is thus obtained. The residuum again heated and dried,
and the loss of weight determines the quantity of boracic acid.
   Tourmalines are divided by M. Gmelin into three classes: the first
of which contains lithia :—I. Red Tourmaline from Rösna in Moravia;

A NEW METHOD OF SEPARATING MANGANESE FROM LIME AND
        MAGNESIA.—BY PROFESSOR STROMEYER.
  We are     informed in a letter from Professor Stromeyer, that he has
found the   following method successful in procuring the complete se
paration of manganese from magnesia and lime. To an acid liquid
containing the peroxide of iron together with manganese, lime, and
magnesia, the carbonate of soda is added in the usual manner, so as
to precipitate the first, while the three latter oxides are held in solu
tion by an excess of carbonic acid; and in order to prevent any man
ganese from falling, the actual precipitation of the iron is effected by
the bicarbonate instead of the carbonate of soda.       After acidulating
the filtered solution and concentrating it by evaporation, a current of
chlorine gas is transmitted through         On neutralizing the free acid
                                                             it.
by  the gradual addition      bicarbonate   ofsoda, the manganese sub of
sides   inthe form     the red oxide, being thus completely separated

the resulting pure phosphoric acid precipitated a dilute solution of
albumen; but when carefully neutralized by carbonate of soda, and
then mixed with a solution of the nitrate of silver, the common yellow

         LIST  of  EARTHQUAKEs which occuRRED IN 1827.
     Jan.  2.-At   Mortagne (Orne) and the environs. A violent shock
of short    duration,  accompanied with an intense noise.        Chimneys
and household furniture were thrown down. The commotion reach
ed as far as Alençon.       The day was cloudy, the weather thick and
stormy, which is not usual at that time of the year.
      Feb. 9.-At seven o'clock in the evening; in the north-west part
 of Wales and the Isle of Anglesea. The shocks continued from forty
 seconds to a minute; they were sufficiently violent to overturn se
 veral pieces of furniture. A noise was heard like that of a heavy
 laden cart going on the stones.
      April 2–At Bevers, at twenty minutes past one in the morning;
 two strong consecutive shocks.       The inhabitants of Basse-Engadine
 assert that they counted twenty similar shocks during the winter.
      May 29.—At Wajaca, in Mexico; two slight shocks.
      June 3.-At Martinique; a slight shock.
      June 12.—At Tehenacan, in Mexico, at half-past one o'clock; a
 violent shock, with a frightful noise.    Many buildings damaged.
      June 16–At Aquila, in the kingdom of Naples; a shock at five
  o'clock in the morning.
      June 21—At Palermo, at eleven o'clock in the morning. Four
  strong shocks in the space of seven seconds; it was an       -

  motion from the west to the east.
      Aug. 14.—At Palermo, at 2 p.m. Several shocks; they continued
  about eighteen minutes, with very short intervals; the motion was
  always oscillatory.
       Sept. 18.-At Lisbon.    A slight shock.
       Oct. 10.-At Zurich, and all the shores of the lake. At twelve
  minutes before 3 p.m., a strong shock.
       Oct. 15.—At Jassy, at eight in the evening. Two violent shocks,
   directed from north to south, and accompanied by a subterraneous
   noise; two or three days after, the heat was very great.
       Oct 30.—At Corsica, in the cantons of Taravo, Taliano, and Sar
   tène.    Two shocks at twenty minutes past 5, a.m.
       Nov. 30.-At Pointe-à-Petre, Guadaloupe, at three in the morn

bloody rain, said to have fallen about the beginning of July.                  Large
drops were seen both in Paris itself upon the walls of the cemetery of
 the greater church, which is near the walls of the city, upon the walls
of the city, and likewise upon the walls of villas, hamlets, and towns
 for some miles round the city. In the first place, M. Peiresc went to
 examine the drops themselves, with which the stones were reddened,
 and spared no pains to obtain the means of conversing with some
husbandmen beyond Lambesc, who were reported to have been so
astonished at the shower, as to leave their labour and                     for safety                           fly

  count of the paper by the above-named chemists, and proposed to offer
  some remarks upon it in the present Number: the Royal Institution

 them.—R. P.
    “MM. Dumas and Boullay then consider the formation and nature
 of the sulphuric acid, stating the opinions of MM. Vogel and Gay
 Lussac, that it is a compound of hyposulphuric acid with a vegetable
  matter; and also that of Mr. Hennel, that it is an acid in which half
 the saturating power of the sulphuric acid present is neutralized by
 the hydrocarbon in combination. With the latter opinion they also
 class that entertained by Mr. Faraday relative to the nature of sul
 phonaphthalic acid. MM. Dumas and Boullay consider the question,
 and decide in favour of the former opinion; after which they say they
 have observed facts which are better explained by the latter. We
 think it a pity that these philosophers did not refer to Mr. Hennel's

   General Observations.—The first five days of this month were dry and
cold; afterwards it rained more or less every day till the 26th : but the last
four days were dry and warm, in which more progress appeared to have
been made in the blooming and growth of fruit and vegetation, than during
the preceding fortnight.
    The North-east and North-west winds on several days were blighty, the
effects of which maybe traced in the formation of the young wall-fruit, &c.
The 4th and 22nd were very cold days, whose maximum temperature in
the shade was only 46 and 47 degrees, which is three or four degrees
colder than some of the nights. The first swallow appeared here in the
morning of the 21st, and the nightingale was first heard on the 11th
instant.                                         -
    At noon of the 27th three winds       prevailed    in different directions: the
first next the earth, as pointed out by a vane, was from South-east; the next,
which was ascertained by keeping the eye in a line with a fixed object
whose bearing on the horizon was known, and observing the motion of the
passing cumulus clouds directly from the same point, was from South-west
by South; and the upper one, ascertained in the same way by observing the
direction of plumose cirri, was from North North-west.
    The planet Venus, which has now the appearance of a half-moon, was
conspicuous with the naked eye at the same time; and                        distance                its
