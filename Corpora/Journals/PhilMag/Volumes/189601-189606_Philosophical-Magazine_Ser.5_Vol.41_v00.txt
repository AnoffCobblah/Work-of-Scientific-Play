1.  THE        method of experiment and the nature of the
            apparatus employed have been fully described in
previously published papers. Although it appears somewhat
presumptuous to assume, on the part of the reader, a knowledge
of such communications, it would on the other hand seem
redundant to devote many pages to the mere repetition of
what has already appeared in print. We therefore propose
to give an explanatory statement of the theory and methods
employed, but to omit all detailed description of the apparatus.
Full references to former communications will be given when
necessary, so that all particulars can be ascertained by any
who desire them.
   As reference has frequently to be made to the following
papers (by E. H. Griffiths) they are, for convenience, denoted
as follows:—

2         Mr. E. H. Griffiths and Miss Marshall on the
                   2. Description of the Method.
    In order to render our account of these experiments in
telligible, we find it necessary to give the following somewhat
lengthy extract from Paper     W. pp. 270–273 —
    “The method adopted was of such a nature that the results
would not be appreciably affected by
       (1) errors in thermometry;
       (2) changes in the specific heat of water;
        (3) the capacity for £ of the calorimeter;
        (4) loss or gain of heat by radiation, &c.;
 and if these points are borne in mind, they may serve to
 explain some of the contrivances which might otherwise
 appear uncalled for.
    “If the vessel in which the evaporation is taking place is
 kept at a constant temperature, we are independent of the
 capacity for heat of it and its contents; we also dispense
 with the measurements of changes of temperature. Thus, if
 matters be so arranged that the loss and gain of heat through
 out an experiment are balanced, many fruitful causes of
 error are avoided. Of course, the actual temperature of the
 calorimeter during evaporation must be determined, but a
 small error here is of little consequence. The change in the
 value of L is small as compared with the changes in 6. In
 fact, an accuracy of an order of 'o of a degree would be
 sufficient when determining the actual elevation.
     “The heat was supplied to the calorimeter by means of a
 wire whose ends were kept at a constant potential difference.
 The thermal balance could be maintained in one of two ways:—
     (1) If the heat-supply was too great, the electric current
          could be temporarily stopped, or, the rate of evapo
          ration of the water increased. (The latter was the
          method generally adopted.)
     (2) If the cooling was too rapid, the only mode of main
          taining the balance was (in the apparatus about to be
          described) to reduce the rate of evaporation.
     “The liquid to be evaporated was contained in a small
  silver flask, connected with which was a spiral coil of silver
  tubing 18 feet in length. Both flask and spiral were within
 the calorimeter, and the water-vapour, after passing through
 the spiral, emerged from the apparatus at the temperature
  of the calorimeter. Surrounding the flask, and between it
 and the spiral, a coil of platinum-silver wire was arranged,
 and flask, spiral, and coil were entirely immersed in a certain
 singularly limpid oil consisting of hydrocarbons only.

            Latent Heat of Evaporation of Benzene.             3
   “The calorimeter (which was filled to the roof with the oil,
and the equality of temperature maintained by rapid stirring)
was suspended by glass tubes within a steel chamber, whose
walls were maintained at a constant temperature. So long,
therefore, as the calorimeter and the surrounding walls were
at equal temperatures, there was no loss or gain by radiation,
&c. If during an experiment the temperature of the sur
rounding walls changed, the method of experiment involved
a corresponding change in the temperature of the calorimeter,
and, therefore, some loss or gain of heat would be experienced.
The apparatus was so designed that any such change in tem
perature was extremely small (in no case amounting to 150°),
yet, in order to estimate the loss or gain, it was necessary to
know approximately the capacity for heat of the calorimeter
and contents.
   “Small differences between the temperature of the calori
meter and the surrounding walls would, during an experi
ment, be of no consequence provided that the oscillations
were of such a nature that the mean temperature of the
calorimeter was that of the surrounding space, and it will be
found that this condition was fulfilled.
  “In addition to the heat supplied by the electric current,
there is also a supply due to the work done by the stirrer,
and it was in the estimation of this ‘stirring supply that
the greatest difficulties were encountered. Fortunately the
heat thus generated was only about T'o of the heat supplied
by the current, and thus any small error in that portion of
the work becomes of little account.
   “Of the accuracy with which the electrical supply could
be measured there is no question; and even if the value of
the E.M.F. of the Clark cells, or the absolute resistance of
the box-coils given by the standardizations performed during
the determinations of J, is in any way inaccurate, such
errors would now eliminate, since the value of J was deter
mined by means of the same standards as those by which the
quantity of heat developed in these experiments was deter
mined. Hence, by assuming the value of J obtained by the
use of these standards, we get the comparison in terms of a
thermal unit at 15° C., independently of the numerical value
assumed in the reductions.
   “One further correction remains to be noticed.      The tem
 erature of the calorimeter has been referred to as oscillating
about the exterior temperature, and it might happen that at
the close of an experiment this difference was not the same as
that at the commencement—if any such difference existed.
The magnitude of this    ":      2
                                      epended, of course, on the

4         Mr. E. H. Griffiths and Miss Marshall on the
ability of the observer to maintain the thermal balance. In
these experiments the correction was usually small, and in
any case could be determined with great accuracy.
   “Having indicated the nature of the observations, we
proceed to state the relation between the various sources of
loss or gain of heat.
   “Let Q. be the thermal units per second due to the electrical
            supply;
          Q, be the thermal units per second due to the mecha
            nical supply;
          Xq be the total heat-supply during an experiment
            from any other causes.
   “Then, if M be the mass of water evaporated, L the latent
heat of evaporation at temperature 6, and if the electrical
supply is maintained for a time t, and the mechanical for a
time ts,
                      ML=Q,t, +Q.t. -->q.       . . . . (1)
   “Now the D.P. at the ends of the coil was always some
integral multiple of the D.P. of a Clark cell.
   “Let e be the D.P. of a Clark cell, n the number of cells,
and R1 the resistance of the coil at the temperature 61, then
                            8.- : . . . . . . . )
   “If the calorimeter at the commencement and end of an
experiment was at exactly the same temperature as the sur
rounding walls, then, if their temperature was unchanged,
the term Xq would vanish; but although this term through
 out these experiments was of small dimensions, it could not
be entirely ignored.
    “Let 6, and 6," be the temperature of the surrounding walls
 at the beginning and end of an experiment; suppose the
 calorimeter temperature (6) to exceed the surrounding tem
 perature by d' at the commencement and d" at the end of an
 experiment. Then fall in temperature of calorimeter
                      =(6, +d') (60' + d").
                                -
 Hence the heat given out by the calorimeter in consequence
 of this fall in temperature is
                     C,{(6/+d)–(6/+d")},
 where C, is the capacity for heat of calorimeter and contents
 at the temperature 61.
    “If we neglect any small loss by radiation, &c., due to the

              Latent Heat of Evaporation of Benzene.                    5
differences d' and d" between the temperature of the calori
meter and the surrounding walls, we may conclude that the
whole of the heat thus evolved by the calorimeter was ex
pended in the evaporation of water, hence

   We found that the thermal balance was most easily main
tained when the potential-difference was that of 4 cells, there
fore the majority of our experiments were performed with
that potential-difference, the experiments with 5 and 3 cells
being used as a check upon the results. To secure an accu
racy of (say) 1 in 1000 in the total heat-supply, the above
table shows that it was necessary to measure

but as the sign of the last term was in some experiments
positive, in others negative, the above degree of accuracy was
  * This apparently clumsy method of representing the quantity of heat
evolved or taken up by the calorimeter was adopted because, as the
method of experiment involved separate determinations of 60', 60", d", and
d", the actual temperature of the calorimeter at any time could only be
obtained in this manner.

 6         Mr. E. H. Griffiths and Miss Marshall on the
 not essential, since, when taking the mean of a number of
 observations, the effect of any error in Xq would be greatly
 diminished.      We believe that the above order of accuracy
 was exceeded in the measurement of the respective terms.
 In the case of the experiments with 3 cells at 20° an order of
 accuracy of 1 in 50 would be required in the value of Q,t, to
 secure the same standard; hence we do not regard our deter
 minations at that temperature as possessing an equal authority
  with those at higher temperatures.
      4. The Method of maintaining the Space surrounding the .
              Calorimeter at a Constant Temperature 69.
     A full description of the somewhat elaborate apparatus
 designed for this purpose will be found on pp. 374-378 of
  Paper J, and some improvements which were subsequently
  added are described on pp. 274–276 of Paper W. This
  portion of the apparatus did not, for some unknown reason,
 appear to be working with the same perfection this year as it
  did in the summer of 1894. Oscillations in 60 (the external
 temperature), amounting to Ilo" C., were on several occasions
 observed, the greatest change during the whole series being
 '0145°. This, however, was exceptional and, as an inspection
 of our final tables will show, the change in the course of an
 experiment (i. e. in about half an hour) was usually only
 about a few thousandths of a degree at temperatures varying
 from 20° to 50° C.; the constancy of 60 was therefore sufficient
 for our purpose.
     Had it been possible, we should have preferred to determine
 60 by means of a platinum thermometer, as we could thus
 have detected smaller changes; but a third observer would,
 in that case, have been required, and circumstances did not
 permit of this addition".
     The mercury-thermometers used for indicating the tem
 perature of the steel chamber in which the calorimeter was
 suspended were graduated in millimetres, and had been care
 fully calibrated and compared with two Tonnelot thermo
meters standardized at the Bureau International +.                The
stems of these thermometers (where they projected above the
tank-lid) were surrounded by glass tubes up which a stream
    * We believe that such irregularities as present themselves in our
final results are partly due to the employment of mercury-thermometers
for the determination of the changes in 60.

 of tank-water was forced by means of a pump driven by a
 water-motor : thus the stem-temperature was always that (or
 nearly that) of the tank, and the readings were not affected
 by changes of temperature in the room. The actual value of
 60 was of small consequence, an accuracy of To” C. being
sufficient; but it was necessary to read changes of temperature
during an experiment to nearly 0°001 C., and this we believe
we were able to do. A full description of the various pre
cautions taken will be found in Paper A, pp. 55 and 56, and
Paper W, pp. 275,276.
   The observations were taken by means of a reading-tele
scope fitted with a micrometer-eyepiece, which directly divided
1 millim. on the thermometer-stem into 10 parts: thus 0.1 of
a millimetre could be directly read, and 01 could be estimated.
There is no doubt that the actual readings could be taken to
-025 millim., that is about 0°.001 C.
   Thermometer A had a range of 16° to 26°C., and about
27 millim. were equivalent to 1* C.
   Thermometer II. had a range of 28° to 53°C., and about
20 millim. were equivalent to 1° C.
   All temperatures, both when obtained from these and from
the platinum-thermometers, are throughout this Paper ex
pressed in terms of the nitrogen-scale.

   A full description will be found on pp. 276-281 of Paper W,
and drawings and sections on plates 5, 6 of the same paper.
The brief account given in the description of the method
supra is sufficient to indicate the nature of the arrangements
to those who are not familiar with that paper.
   The differences of temperature between the calorimeter and
surrounding walls were determined by means of differential
platinum-thermometers.       A description of the method of
standardization and observation of those thermometers is
given on pp. 52–56 of Paper A, and some further details on
pp. 285-290 of Paper W. Experimental evidence is there
adduced in support of the following statement —“It follows
that differences of temperature could be determined to 0004°,
and differences of 0001° could be detected.”
   The following Table shows the difference in temperature
corresponding to a difference of 1 mean millim, of the bridge
wire whose opposite ends were connected with the thermo
meters :

    By experiments repeated this summer we found that no
change had taken place in the value of the mean bridge-wire
millimetre. A slight change (particulars of which are given
in a subsequent section) had, however, occurred in the position
of the null-point, i. e. in the reading on the bridge-wire when
the temperature of the two thermometers was identical.

   The ends of the platinum-silver coil (immersed in the oil
surrounding the evaporating-flask and spiral) were kept at a
constant potential-difference by means of the arrangements
described in Paper J, pp. 382–388. This potential-difference
was always some integral multiple (n) of the potential-differ
ence of a Clark cell (e). During the spring of this year the
Clark cells used were again compared with the Cavendish
standard (R), which has shown no signs of change since its
standardization by Lord Rayleigh in 1883 and by Messrs.
Glazebrook and Skinner in 1891.
   The mean value of the whole set of 30 cells differs from R,
by 0.00004 volt only; and although individual cells show
larger discrepancies than in previous years, their mean
potential-difference at 15° C. may be taken as 1:4342 volts
 (see Paper W, p. 297). A number of these cells were always
placed in parallel arc: thus when n is given as 4, we were
really using 12 cells as four files of 3 each. The arrangement
for keeping the temperature of these cells at nearly 15° C. has
been described in Paper J, p. 385. During the period covered
by our experiments, some of the days were extremely hot, and

            Latent Heat of Evaporation of Benzene.               9
the tap-water became so warm that when turned on by the
regulator it was unable to keep down the temperature suffi
ciently. The extreme range in the temperature of the cell-tank
during these experiments was from 14°8 to 16°3 C. As, how
ever, the movement was always extremely slow, it is probable
that the tank-temperature closely corresponded to the effective
temperature of the cells, and hence the correction
               e = 1.4342$1 + (15–6) x 00077}
applied by us gave the value of e with sufficient accuracy.
   The time te was determined by means of a chronograph
controlled by an electric clock, whose gaining rate is now less
than 1 in 20,000. Any movement of the keys by which the
current was switched on to the calorimeter-coil was auto
matically recorded on the tape; and thus personal errors were
eliminated. The times could have been read to Ilo of a
second, but it was considered unnecessary to read to nearer
than Ilo, i.e. about 1 in 7000 of tr.
   The value of R1 is expressed in terms of the “true ohm’’ as
given by the B.A. standards, with which (by kind permission
of Mr. Glazebrook) the coils used by us have been directly
compared (Paper J, pp. 407-410).
   The increase in R1 due to the rise of temperature caused by
the current was determined in the manner described in Paper J,
pp. 404–407 (see also Paper W, p. 296).
   The value of J assumed by us was 4,199 (Paper W, p. 314).
We would emphasize the fact to which attention has been
previously directed (section 2, p. 3), namely, that even if, in
consequence of errors in the standards &c., this value of J is
incorrect, it is still the right value to use for the reduction of
these observations, for, provided that no change has taken place
during the past three years in the standards used (and direct
comparisons show no signs of any change which would affect
the results), the values of L obtained by us are independent of
the numerical values of J and R when expressed in terms of
the same units as those assumed during the determination of
the mechanical equivalent.
   The value of Q. t. is thus expressed in terms of a “thermal

   The method adopted for finding Q, (the thermal units per
second due to the work done by stirring) has been fully
described in Paper W, pp. 290–293. It was there shown that
 the value of Q. varied approximately as r" (where r was the

  10      Mr. E. H. Griffiths and Miss Marshall on the
 rate of revolution of the stirrer), and that this relation was
 sufficiently close for the reduction of experiments in which the
 value of r was somewhere between 5 and 6 per second.
     The value of Q, was found to increase rapidly as 61 (the
 temperature of the calorimeter) diminished.       Our recent re
 determinations of Q, have explained a discrepancy which caused
 an uncertainty in the former determination of Q, at 20° and
 50°, and we now find that it was due to an arithmetical error
 in the reduction of the observations. Fortunately, the resulting
 correction in no way affects the conclusions arrived at in
 Paper W.; and our present investigation confirms the accuracy
 of the experimental determinations of Q, obtained in 1894.
 As the extreme differences between any of our determinations
 of Qs at temperatures above 20° (after the arithmetical correc
 tions at the 20° and 50° points) do not exceed 1 part in 70,
 even if we include the values found in 1894, and as the mean
 probable error at any temperature is much below 1 in 100, it
 is obvious that the values of Q, have been ascertained with
 more than sufficient precision.
                8. Xq = C9, £(60'-6") + (d"-a")}.
    We have previously indicated (sect. 4, p. 6) the manner
 in which 6, and 6." (the initial and final temperature of the
 walls of the surrounding chamber) were determined by the
 direct observation of mercury-thermometers. The value of d
 (the difference between 6, and 69, i. e. the calorimeter-tempe
 rature and that of the surrounding walls) was ascertained by
 the differential platinum-thermometers previously referred to,
 and was always small-rarely greater than .01°C. It was
 usually determined by the reading of the galvanometer-swings
 without altering the position of the contact-maker on the
 bridge-wire.
    When evaporating water, the values of d were so small that
 an approximate value of the swing (in terms of a length of the
 bridge-wire) was sufficient. During these benzene experi
 ments, however, we found it impossible to maintain the
 thermal balance with such perfection. The only values of d
 which were of consequence were d' and d" (the initial and
final values), and, especially in the earlier experiments, the
internal temperature (61) rose so rapidly as soon as the last
 drop of benzene had evaporated, that it was found impossible
to switch off the electric current from the calorimeter-coil at
the precise moment necessary to reduce d" to negligible dimen
sions. As a consequence, the final swings (which were read
by means of a micrometer-eyepiece) were often considerable,
and therefore it was necessary to determine their value on each
occasion; for, although throughout a series of experiments at

              Latent Heat of Evaporation of Benzene.                11
the same temperature the value varied but little, the changes
were sufficient to affect the resulting value of Xq in exceptional
cases. In the earlier experiments, especially from Preliminary
to No. VII., when the difficulty of the final adjustment had
not been fully realized, the values of d" were unduly large,
and their equivalent degree-measurements are therefore some
what doubtful, owing to insufficient determinations of the value
of the galvanometer-swings. We feel sure, however, that from
No. VII. onwards any errors due to this cause must be very
small—certainly not so great as 1 in 50; for the value of a
swing of 100 (in terms of a millim. of the bridge-wire) would,
throughout a group of experiments at the same temperature,
vary (for example) from 1:31 to 1:34 millim." This change in
value would produce no appreciable effect on Xq when the
difference between the initial and final swings did not exceed
50 or 60, as was the case in most of our later, and better,
experiments.
   The value of Co, (capacity for heat of calorimeter and
contents) remains the same as last year with the exception
that 0.1 grm. of the oil was removed at the commencement of
July when withdrawing the platinum thermometer for purposes
of re-standardization. As the value of Co, varied with 61 from
304 to 323, this loss was negligible.
   The quantity Xq represents the heat absorbed by the calori
meter and contents, and it should be remembered that it is
by the measurement of a similar quantity that the majority of
the determinations of thermal constants have been made by
previous observers. We were, however, anxious to diminish
the importance of this term as much as possible, for we wished
our values of L to be independent of any thermometric errors.
As shown by Table II, the average value of Xq was only about
#bo of the total heat-supply. In the experiments in which
the value of Xq is less than 1 (of which there are many
examples), we may say that our final results are independent
of such errors, for, as pointed out in Paper W, the value of
 Qs is independent of temperature measurements, since it
depends on the ratio of the rate of rise due to the mechanical
supply to the rate of rise due to an electrical together with a
mechanical supply (Paper W, p. 33.1).
    The values of Co, at 20° and 50° used in this Paper differ
somewhat from those given in Paper W. This difference is
due to the error, previously referred to, in the value of Qs at
those temperatures. Thus
      the value of C, at 20° is reduced from 307.5 to 3052,
and        55       7)     50°     ,        ,     323.1 to 322-0.

This, however, in no way affects the values of L in Paper W,
nor, except in the case of two experiments (viz., Preliminary
and XIX. a., infra), would it, if left uncorrected, have affected
the values of L as given in this communication.
   We believe that the values of Xq are correct to better than
1 in 100; and Table I. (p. 5) shows that an accuracy of 1 in
10 would have been sufficient.
                    9. Measurement of Mass.
   The actual measurement of the mass of benzene evaporated
presented several difficulties which were not encountered when
working with water. A tube resembling a weight-thermo
meter was filled with benzene, placed in an air-tight case just
large enough to contain it, and then weighed against a pre
cisely similar case used as a tare. The weight-thermometer
(termed by us a “dropper”) narrowed at its open extremity
to a capillary tube, which was doubled back on itself for rather
over 1 cm., and again bent near the open end, so that the last
1 or 2 mm. were horizontal. These droppers varied in capacity
from about 4 to 63 c.c., and were filled in the following
manner —The dropper (point uppermost) was lowered by a
fine wire to the bottom of a tube about 43 ft. long, of which
the lower 10 inches or so were filled with benzene, while the
upper 3 ft. were surrounded by a “condenser-tube” through
which tap-water was continually passing. The lower end,
containing the benzene, was transferred at regular intervals
from a vessel of water at about 86° C. to a vessel of cold
water; thus the benzene was alternately boiled and cooled
without any escape of vapour into the room. Five or six such
transferences were generally required to completely fill the
dropper. The containing tube was then placed in a bath at
about 65°C. until the temperature of the benzene was steady.
The dropper was now removed and allowed to stand in the
open air for some time, in order to get rid of any benzene
adhering to its surface. Although simple and effective, these
operations occupied a considerable time, and, as a rule, the
whole of the morning had to be devoted to the filling of the
droppers required for the experiments, which were usually
performed at night.
   Before an experiment the dropper was lowered, by means of
a thread passed through a platinum wire sealed into the closed
end, into the calorimeter, where it stood in a vertical position.
In Paper W (p. 307) it was shown that, when filled with water,
 the evaporation through the capillary opening between the time
of weighing and the commencement of an experiment might
 be neglected. In the case of benzene, however, it was found

            Latent Heat of Evaporation of Benzene.            13
that, for several reasons, loss of this kind could not be dis
regarded:–
   (1) The vapour-pressure of benzene so greatly exceeds that
         of water at corresponding temperatures that the loss
         by diffusion through the capillary was appreciable.
   (2) The surface-tension of benzene is so great that the liquid
         crept up the sides of the capillary to the opening, and
         the consequent loss by evaporation was increased.
   (3) In order to supply the air necessary for starting the
          boiling when the exterior pressure was removed, a
         capillary tube, closed at one end, had been sealed
          within each dropper. It was found that this answered
          very well during some preliminary trials, when the
          dropper was placed within a glass tube connected with
          an exhaust pump so that its manner of discharging
          could be watched; but on a second filling with our
          purest sample (the first filling having thoroughly
          cleaned the interior surface of the droppers) no action
          took place even when the surrounding pressure was
          reduced to a few millimetres. In order, therefore,
          that the expulsion of the benzene from the dropper
          should commence as soon as the external pressure
          was reduced to the right amount, it was found
          necessary to leave a very considerable air-bubble
          within the tube.     Precautions had to be taken to
          prevent the expulsion of the liquid by the alternate
          contraction and expansion of the air-bubble when the
          temperature was changed from that of the balance
          case to that of the tank.
   These difficulties were surmounted in the following manner.
   During the process of filling, as above described, the
droppers stood in a vertical position, with the doubled over
and open end uppermost, and were never inverted after
their removal from the filling-tube, at a temperature of about
65°C., until their insertion into the calorimeter.       The co
efficient of expansion of benzene is very large, and, on cooling
to the room-temperature, the whole of the upper bend together
with a couple of centimetres of the neck between it and the
 body of the dropper was found to be free from benzene.
 The dropper was then placed in its case and left in a vertical
 position in the balance-case for, as a rule, some hours, when
 the small air-space in the enclosing-case no doubt became
 saturated with ' vapour and thus further evaporation ceased.
 After being weighed, the dropper and case were lowered
 into a large tube placed within the tank and left until they
 acquired the tank temperature 69; they were then rapidly

14        Mr. E. H. Griffiths and Miss Marshall on the
withdrawn and for the first time inverted—the air-bubble
rising to the closed end. The case was opened for a moment
and the dropper at once lowered into place by means of the
previously attached thread : this operation only occupied a
couple of seconds. As the dropper left the case the latter
was instantly closed by a second operator to prevent the
escape of any benzene vapour left within it. Thus from the
time of inversion no change took place in the temperature,
and therefore in the volume of the air-bubble; also no
appreciable change in the temperature of the calorimeter (6.)
was caused by the introduction of the dropper and contents.
However, the mere act of opening the tube leading down to
the calorimeter caused a slight lowering of 61, and in order to
re-establish the equality between 61 and 69 before commencing
an experiment, it was necessary to switch on, for a second or
 two, the current from the exterior coil in the tank to the
 calorimeter coil.   When the observer at the differential
 thermometer galvanometer announced that 60–61 was small
and steady, the time for commencing the experiment had
arrived.
    10. In our later experiments, when we had become more
 expert at the various operations, the time from the insertion
 of the dropper to the commencement of an experiment was
 from 3 to 5 minutes.    In our earlier observations at 30° the
 time was, however, much longer—from about 8 to 15 minutes.
 During this interval there was generally apparent a slight
 lowering of 61, which made us fear that the evaporation
 through the capillary was appreciable, and it was not until
 our tenth experiment that a means of meeting this difficulty
 suggested itself. It was evidently necessary to wait until 6,
 became steady before commencing an experiment, and it was
 difficult to see how to shorten the time required to establish
this condition.
    From Experiment X. onwards the procedure was as follows.
A glass rod whose upper end passed through a cork fitting
the opening of the entrance-tube was lowered into the
calorimeter.    Round the lower three inches of this rod was
strapped (by fine platinum wire) a thin roll of cotton-wool of
which the upper two inches were saturated with benzene
while the lower end was left dry, so that there was no danger
of drops of benzene falling from it into the silver evaporating
flask.
    The rod was withdrawn occasionally and more benzene
added if the upper portion of the roll had become dry. Obser
vation of the galvanometer showed when the cooling effect

             Latent Heat of Evaporation of Benzene.          15
caused by the evaporation had ceased, and we were thus able
to determine when the flask and connecting tubes were
saturated. The rod was not finally withdrawn until the
dropper was introduced ; thus the space being saturated, no
further evaporation took place; and we believe that from
Experiment X. onwards any error arising from evaporation
in the time preceding the experiment may be disregarded.
   After we had completed our experiments, we made some
observations with the object of ascertaining the probable
magnitude of the error in Experiments I. to VII. due to
evaporation when the flask had not been previously saturated.
A dropper was placed within the evaporating flask for 20
minutes and kept at a temperature of 30°C. It was then
withdrawn, and the loss determined. As might have been
expected, it varied slightly according to the droppers used,
probably owing to the different sizes of the capillary opening.
        In 20 minutes, dropper II. lost 10 milligrams,

          33       25       ,     IV. , 13        ,
    After Experiment VII. we adopted the plan of noting the
time from the insertion of the dropper to the commencement
of the experiment, but unfortunately we had not previously
done so. We consider that the average time in these
experiments must have been from 10 to 15 minutes; the loss
during this time would therefore appear to have been about
 6 milligrams, or rather more than #. Thus the values of L
 resulting from Experiments I. to VII. are probably too low by
about 0.12. Fortunately we have six independent experi
 ments at 30°C. (Nos. XXIX. to XXXIV.) in which this
 cause of error was absent.
    We have entered into this matter fully, as it shows the
 importance of extreme attention to details in work of this
 kind, and also it was necessary to explain why we practically
 neglected Experiments I. to VII. when drawing our final
 conclusions. The same cause of error would slightly affect
 Experiments VIII. and IX. at 40°C. At this time, however,
 we were attempting to minimize the evil by allowing as short
 a time as possible to elapse between the introduction of the
 dropper and the commencement of an experiment. We have
 also a note of the time, which in both cases was less than
  4 minutes. The loss during this interval would probably not
  have affected the resulting values of L by more than .05, and
  we therefore do not consider it necessary to reject these
  experiments.
     At the close of an experiment, when observation of the

16        Mr. E. H. Griffiths and Miss Marshall on the
£                 showed that all evaporation had ceased, the
  ropper was extracted by means of a bent wire, immediately
placed in its case, and weighed again after standing some hours
in the balance-case.
   Let mi and m2 be the weights of the case and dropper
before and after an experiment; the temperature of the
balance-case was usually about 20° C., the specific gravity
of benzene at that temperature may be taken as 0.88, hence
M (true mass corrected to vacuo)
                   -  mi-m; 4. (mi-m2) x 0012.
    11. Before commencing the experiments it was necessary
to ascertain if any alteration had taken place in the values
of the various constants and variables since their determination
in 1894.
   Thermometers II. and A were re-standardized and it was
found that a “zero-point rise” had taken place, as is customary
with mercury thermometers.
   Thermometer No. II. had risen 0.4 mm. =0°-02 C. since
its standardization in August 1894.
   Thermometer A had risen 1.4 mm. =0° 06 (nearly) since
its standardization in July 1893, which is about the normal
rise of thermometers of this description.
    The platinum thermometer (AB) was removed from the
calorimeter, strapped to its corresponding thermometer (CD),
and placed in the tank whose temperature was raised from
 18°C. to 40°C. Observations at different temperatures
 showed a rise of 0.45 mm. in the null-point whose position is
 now given by the formula 598.8+:03.6 in place of 598:35 +
 -036. If, however, this change, which probably took place
in the arms of the bridge rather than in the thermometers",
 had not been detected the resulting error would have been .
 negligible, for a difference of 45 mm. in the setting of the
 null-point is equivalent (at 40°) to a temperature difference
 of about .0041°C., and the total loss or gain by radiation, &c.,
 corresponding to this difference between 61 and 60 would not
 exceed 0-2 thermal gram per half-hour, whereas the actual
 duration of the majority of these experiments was about 18
 minutes.
    The corrected formula was, however, used throughout these
 experiments for the adjustment of the contact-maker.

 izing the bridge-arms, that the above supposition was correct.]

of some error in the time over the second interval.              If we omit

The errors at 20° and 50° as given in that paper were due to
an arithmetical mistake, a difference having been added,
instead of subtracted, in each case.

   These changes in Q. probably indicate the changes in the
viscosity of the oil.
                 14. Alterations in the Apparatus.
   No alterations have been made except in exterior portions
of the apparatus.
   When working with water in 1894 there were, in the tubes
leading to the air-pumps, one or two rubber joints which are
now replaced by glass ones.
   To prevent condensation, the benzene vapour after issuing
from the tank passed over a row of small gas-jets and then
down into a small Wolff's bottle, connected with the mano
meter and containing pumice-stone and sulphuric acid. It
then passed through another tap * into a large globe (capacity
about 35 litres) also containing pumice-stone and sulphuric
acid. By means of a water-pump the pressure in this globe
was reduced to that of the aqueous vapour at the temperature
of the tap-water. Its capacity was so great that the pressure
in the Wolff's bottle could, at any time, be brought below
that required, at experiments above 20°, by simply opening
the tap communicating with the globe. Thus the water
pump had not to be used during an experiment, and,
consequently, the two motors worked with greater regularity.
The Wolff's bottle was also in direct communication with a
Geissler's mercury-pump, by means of which, when working
at the lower temperatures, the pressure was greatly reduced
near the close of an experiment in order to secure the boiling
off of the last drop of benzene. We found that the mercury
pump had to be kept in constant use during the experiments
at 20°. With the exception of the above alterations and
additions, the apparatus is the same in every respect as that
figured in Plates 4, 5, and 6 of Paper W.
                 15. On the Purity of the Benzene.
   The benzene, which was a sample of that used by Professor
Ramsay and Miss Marshall for their comparative experiments,
was supplied by Messrs. Kahlbaum of Berlin and guaranteed
free from thiophene. It was redistilled twice from phosphoric
  * The grease on the core of taps traversed by benzene was replaced by
phosphoric acid.

                16. Description of an Experiment.
    The dropper was placed in position (as described in section 9)
and the contact-maker was then set, by means of a magnifying
glass, to the null-point corresponding to the tank temperature
  0°
     When the observer (Observer II.) at the thermometer
galvanometer (G2) announced that 61 had become steady,
three observations of the galvanometer-swing were taken,
and the chronograph-key, being pressed at the second of
those swings, recorded the time from which t, was estimated.
At the same moment Observer I. recorded the reading of
thermometer II., which when reduced to the nitrogen scale
   ave the value of 60,—the initial tank temperature.
     As a rule the initial swings were somewhere between 0 and
 +50 (a swing of +50 would correspond to about +:006°C.),
and, for reasons which will appear later, we preferred to
have this initial swing (which gave the value of d") positive.
     The Wolff's bottle (condenser A) had previously been
exhausted down to the pressure of the large globe (condenser
B) already referred to, but the tap between the two condensers
had been closed. A tap (immersed in the tank-water) between
the silver flask and condenser A was then opened, and the
air expanding into A caused a fall in the manometer attached
 to it. The tap connecting condensers A and B was then
 gradually opened, and the pressure in the flask fell until
some benzene was expelled from the dropper. The instant
 this occurred the calorimeter temperature 61 commenced to
 fall, and Observer I. was acquainted with this fact by
 Observer II. who, throughout the whole experiment, was
 engaged in calling aloud the galvanometer-swings which
 resulted from the inversion of the battery connexions in the
 differential-thermometer circuit by means of a swinging key.
 The storage-cell current, which had been running for some
 time through a platinum-silver coil immersed in oil in the
 outer tank, was,then switched on to the calorimeter-coil, the
 action recording itself, on the chronograph-tape, 2nd the
 potential balance then adjusted by means of the apparatus
 described in Paper J, p. 283. This basance had previously
  been approximately obtained while the current was running
 through the tank-coil; thus only a small additional adjust

22       Mr. E. H. Griffiths and Miss Marshall on the
ment was required and, as the temperature of the calorimeter
wire remained constant, the electrical balance required little
attention, for the potential-difference rarely altered by as much
       E                             •
aS 100,000 throughout an experiment.            As the benzene
vapour passed into condenser A the pressure in the flask
increased, and thus the loss of heat by evaporation diminished.
By a rapid movement of the tap between condensers A and B,
the pressure could again be diminished and the cooling effect
increased.
   It was found impossible to control the rate of evaporation
with the same perfection when using benzene as was the
case in the experiments with water. The taps had to be
constantly manipulated, and a moment's inattention on the
part of Observer I. was immediately followed by a sudden
rise or fall in 61. This was more especially the case during
the experiments at low temperatures. From about experi
ment V. or VI. onwards, however, the swings rarely amounted
to as much as 200 or so, except during the first minute when
the thermal balance was being obtained, at which time a
swing of +400 or 500 was generally experienced. Through
out the whole of an experiment care was taken that any
positive swing should be succeeded by a corresponding
negative one. Although the announcement of swings of
“+200” appeared alarming at the time, the extreme attention
devoted to the keeping down of these oscillations was really
unnecessary. A swing of +200 indicated that 60 was lower
than 61 (at 40°) by about 0°02 C., and the radiation &c.
coefficient of the calorimeter being about 00009 (in degrees
per second per difference of 1°, Paper W, p. 289), this swing,
even if maintained throughout the whole time that evaporation
was proceeding (on an average less than about 7 minutes),
would only have resulted in a total loss of about 00009 x 318
 x -0216 x 7 x 60="25 thermal gram *. In no case, however,
was a swing of such magnitude allowed to remain unaltered
for more than a few seconds.
   The chief difficulty was experienced near the close of an
experiment. When working with water, there were always
some indications that the end was near, for the pressure had to
be diffisished it ofdef #iagiiitain the thermal balance if only
a drop: or’so rentained: "In the case of benzene, however,
there were rarely aliyath indications; for the galvanometer

            Latent Heat of Evaporation of Benzene.            23
swing might be announced as +8 or + 10, and before the
next announcement could be made it would be found that it
had shot up to 300 or 400.   After the preliminary experiment,
it was of course possible to roughly estimate (knowing the
weight of the dropper when filled) the probable duration of
an experiment and, by adding it to the observed time of
establishing the current, to predict approximately the time
when evaporation would cease. Owing, however, to differences
in the size of the air-bubbles necessarily left in the droppers,
to the different rates of stirring, &c., and to errors in calcu
lations made while all the attention of the observers was
needed elsewhere, the current was very often switched off too
late, thus increasing the value of the correction X7 un
necessarily. If any mistake was made, the final value of 6,
was in consequence higher than the initial one, for in those
cases where the current was switched off too soon, it was
always possible to bring 61 up to its initial value by re-estab
lishing the current for a second or two; if, however, 61 was
too high there was no means of diminishing it, all the benzene
having been exhausted. Observer I. endeavoured, if possible,
to arrange so that the swing at the close of an experiment
should be about -150, for the following reason. Evaporation
having ceased and the current being switched off, the tap
between the evaporating-flask and condenser A was closed,
and a tap (also immersed in the tank-water) was slowly
opened so that air (dried by having passed through sulphuric
acid and phosphoric anhydride) was gradually admitted into
the evaporating-flask through a 30 ft. copper coil immersed
in the tank. Thus the air was at the temperature of the
calorimeter. The heat liberated by its compression caused,
however, a rise in 61 equivalent to a swing of about 120; thus
no heat was, on the whole, gained by the calorimeter, for a
corresponding loss had been experienced during the exhaustion.
 On this account we preferred to commence with a small
positive swing, as it was not then necessary to reduce 61 so
far at the close of an experiment to allow for this final
increase. When Observer II. found that 61, had again
become steady three final swings were taken, the chronograph
key being pressed at the middle one, thus giving the ter
mination of the time t, during which the stirring supply had
to be estimated.    Thermometer II. was read at the same time,
and gave 6'9, the final tank temperature. Throughout the
experiment, every thousand revolutions of the stirrer had
been automatically recorded on the chronograph-tape.

  The method of removing and weighing the empty dropper
has already been indicated.
                17. Remarks on the Experiments.
   We give particulars of all our experiments with two excep
tions. In No. XXI. a. the chronograph ceased to work during
a critical portion of the experiment, and we were thus unable
to determine tr.    In XXIV. a. Observer I. omitted to close the
entrance tap to the evaporating-flask before connecting with
the exhaust, thus the attempt to diminish the vacuum was a
failure and the experiment was relinquished after a minute or
so. In these two cases we at once performed other experi
ments to replace the failures, but retained the numbers for
convenience of reference.
   We have, however, rejected, when drawing our final con
clusions, several of the experiments whose details are given.
Such experiments are marked by a f in the Tables. We
have, in no case, rejected any experiment except as a conse
quence of some note made during that experiment; that is,
before reducing the observations we had already decided as
to those which should be regarded as of little value. Thus
we have in no way been guided by the results. For example,
XXV. differs from the mean of its group by a greater
quantity than either of the rejected experiments at that
temperature: however, as we have no note against it, we
are compelled to give it equal importance with any of the
others. A simpler plan would have been to reject entirely
the + experiments, but we think that a fairer idea of the
general accuracy of the work is given by including all those
that we completed.
   The reasons for the rejection of the + experiments are
given (as they appeared in our original notes) at the end of
each group. We have, however, in each case given the
mean of all in a footnote, and it will be seen that (except at
30°) our results would not have been appreciably affected by
the inclusion of those rejected ones.
   As a rule, we found that the thermal balance was most
easily maintained when the potential-difference was that of
4 cells, but this supply of heat would have been somewhat too
great at 20°, when we worked with 3 cells only. At all
temperatures above 20° we performed experiments with 3, 4,

            Latent Heat of Evaporation of Benzene.            25
and 5 cells, and we regard the agreement amongst the results
as very satisfactory, and as establishing the validity of the
various corrections. In thermal investigations it is as a rule
difficult to alter all the conditions in so complete a manner as
that caused by the changes above referred to. For example,
if any “priming” had taken place (the usual cause of inaccu
racy in determinations of the Latent Heat of Evaporation),
its effect must have been greatly increased when the rate of
evaporation was nearly trebled, which was the case when the
potential-difference was altered from 3 to 5 cells. Again,
the importance of the different terms undergoes such changes
that any constant error in the determinations of Q.'s and Xq
would cause the values of L when n=4 to lie between the
values when n=3 and n=5. An inspection of the Tables
will show that no such effect is visible.
   We also varied the “stirring supply” very considerably.
The Tables show that (at the same temperature) the values of
Q, have been changed from 00276 (Expt. XVII.) to -00427
 (Expt. XXIV.).
    [Note by E. H. GRIFFITHS.–My experience with apparatus
of a similar nature to that used in these experiments has con
vinced me of the severity of the test above referred to.
During my attempts at a determination of the mechanical
equivalent during the years 1887–1891 the results invariably
broke down when thus tested. The following quotation, refer
ring to the experiments anterior to 1892, is from p. 364,
Paper J.:—
    “The agreement amongst individual experiments taken
under the same conditions, was, if anything, at times more
marked than in the experiments of 1892; nevertheless, when
the final reduction took place, fatal discrepancies invariably
showed themselves. . . . Experiments conducted with a high
electromotive force invariably gave too great a value for '
time as compared with that obtained when a lower electro
motive force was used.”
    It appears to me that it is this power of altering all the
conditions which renders electrical methods of such great
value when applied to thermal determinations.]

34       Mr. E. H. Griffiths and Miss Marshall on the
               Remarks on Experiments at 40°C.
   Exp. XI.—“Reduced pressure far too much at commence
ment, was unable to obtain thermal balance until near end of
experiment.”
   Exp. VIII. & IX.—As pointed out (section 10, p. 15), the
values of L are here probably in error by about 0.05. This,
however, does not seem sufficient reason for rejecting them.
                            Conclusion.
                 When 60=40.045, L= 100.71.
               Remarks on Experiments at 30° C.
   Preliminary Exp.—The oscillations in 61 were very violent,
as this was our first attempt at balancing when evaporating
benzene ; also, as we had no idea when to finish, the value of
Sq is very great. We have, however, inserted it to show how
little such matters affect the result.
   Exp. II.—“After inserting the dropper, had to withdraw it
again owing to its sticking in the tube; dropper exposed for
some time.” There is little doubt that, owing to the cooling
when withdrawn, some air was sucked back, and hence there
must have been some expulsion on re-introduction. We
regret that we continued the experiment: the result is
useless.
   20. It will be noticed that the irregularities in this Table
are greater than in preceding ones. These are due to two
causes:—(1) The want of practice in the observers; (2) The
value of the galvanometer-swings were not determined with
sufficient accuracy until after Experiment VII., and, as the
values of Xq are large, any error might affect L, but probably
not by more than +0.1.
   In Section 10, p. 15, we have given in full our reasons for
considering that all these experiments (I. to VII.) are too low
by about 0.12. The mean value of L given by them (omitting
Preliminary and II.) is 102:14: thus it is probable that, had
the flask been previously saturated with vapour, we should
have obtained about 102:26, which is in fair agreement with
the mean of the last six (102:30), where this cause of error
was non-existent. In any case, taking all the values as they
stand in Col. XXI. (rejecting the f experiments), we get
 102:22. The number 102:30, however, is the most probable
value.
                            Conclusion.
                 When 60=30.066, L= 102:30.

36        Mr. E. H. Griffiths and Miss Marshall on the
                 Remarks on Experiments at 20°C.
   Exp. XXXV.—This should be regarded as a preliminary
experiment only. We had no idea of the pressure required to
produce equilibrium, and had great difficulties in sufficiently
 reducing the pressure. “61 was extremely irregular; the
 £"wing was often off the scale for a considerable
 period.
    Exp. XXXVI.—“This was a very fair experiment; the
 thermal balance well under control.”
    We regret that we were unable to perform more experiments
 at 20°C. It was found necessary, however, to work the
 mercury-pump almost continuously, and this could not be
 done without further assistance”.            As such assistance was
 but rarely available, and as our time was drawing to a close,
 we were compelled to content ourselves with the above
 experiments.
                               Conclusion.
                     When 60=19.947, L= 103-82.
                     21. Discussion of the Results.
    The values of L over the range 20° to 50° appear to be
 practically a linear function of the temperature.
    If we assume
                         L = 107.05–0:15816, . . . . (2)
 we obtain a very close approximation to the experimental
 values, as shown by the following Table:—

    It is evident, therefore, that the curvature over the above
 temperature-range must be very slight.
    The value of L cannot continue to be a linear function of 6
 at very high temperatures, either in the case of benzene or

water ; for the critical point of benzene would fall at about
677°C., and that of water at about 990°C. It has, however,
been shown that in the case of water the curvature from 0° to
100° (that is, over a pressure-range of about 4 mm. to 760 mm.)
may be neglected (Paper W, pp. 316–321); and the above
Table would indicate that we cannot be far wrong in making
a similar assumption with regard to benzene, especially when
we consider that both the temperature-range (0° to 80°2 C.)
and the pressure-range (26 mm. to 760 mm.) are in the latter
case diminished.
   We originally intended to perform a group of     ''
at 60°, which is about the highest temperature to which it is
advisable to expose the apparatus; but before doing so it
would have been necessary to standardize a third mercury
thermometer—a work which would have occupied at least a
week of the short time at our disposal.
   Assuming formula (a) to hold to 760 mm., and taking the
boiling-point at that pressure as 80°-20 C. (Ramsay and Young,
Phil. Mag. 1887), we get
    When 6=80.2, L=94.37 (“thermal units at 15° C.”).
   The results of the experimental work described in this
paper may be summarized as follows:–
The Latent Heat of Evaporation of Benzene over the temperature
     range 20° to 50°C. (nitrogen-scale) is represented by the
     equation
                        L=107.05–0:1586,
     where L is expressed in terms of a “thermal unit at 15°C.”
   Assuming this expression to hold over the range 50° to 80°,
the resulting value of L at 80°-2 C. (760 mm. pressure) is
94'37.

II. A Method of Comparing directly the Heats of Evaporation
   of different Liquids at their Boiling-points.        By Miss
   DoRo THY MARSHALL, B.Sc., and Prof. W. RAMSAY, Ph.D.,
   F.R.S., University College, London".
1.  Th:      heat of evaporation of a liquid is usually deter
          mined by measuring with the aid of a calorimeter
the amount of heat liberated during the condensation of a
known mass of the vapour; or conversely, by measuring the
heat absorbed during the vaporization of a known mass of the
liquid. The former method is the one more frequently
adopted, e. g. by Berthelot and by Schiff.
   Apart from the direct experimental difficulties of the method
(and these are by no means inconsiderable), it is open to the
objection that it measures, not simply the heat set free during
the passage of a given mass of the substance from the gaseous
to the liquid condition, but the sum of this quantity of heat
with that liberated during the cooling of the liquid from the
temperature of its boiling-point to the final temperature of
the calorimeter. It is therefore necessary to make a separate
determination of the thermal capacity of the liquid between
these temperatures.
   Whatever the cause may be, the fact remains that the data
regarding heats of vaporization are very scanty. The subject
has been worked at by few observers, and the results obtained
show very considerable discrepancies. Taking, for instance,
the case of ethyl alcohol, the heat of vaporization of a gramme
is given as 208 calories by Despretz, 227 by Brix, 2024 by
Andrews, and 208.9 by Favre and Silbermann. It is clear
that no method can be really satisfactory that leads to such
discordant results.
   2. Professor Ramsay suggested some time ago that it
should be possible to compare directly the heats of evapora
tion of two liquids, by raising the temperature of each to its
boiling-point (surrounding each vessel with a jacket of its
own vapour), and then determining the loss of weight sus
tained by each vessel when a current of electricity was passed
through a carbon filament immersed in the liquid. All other
conditions being made the same for the two vessels, the ratio
of their losses of weight should give the inverse ratio of the
heats of evaporation of the liquids. This method of com
parison we have since been engaged in working out; and
having once overcome the initial difficulties of apparatus &c.,
we have been able to obtain some very satisfactory results,
  * Communicated by the Physical Society: read November 8, 1895.

            Heats of Evaporation of different Liquids.        39
and intend to apply the method to a number of other liquids
that we have not yet had time to investigate.
    In such an arrangement as this there is no direct heat
measurement, and therefore a fruitful source of error is elimi
nated. As the current passes, heat is developed in each
carbon filament; and this heat is entirely expended in con
verting a portion of the liquid into vapour. The thermal
capacity of the liquid no longer needs to be known, since the
experiment is conducted entirely at the temperature of its
boiling-point.
    Each vessel is weighed at the temperature of the atmo
sphere at the beginning and end of the experiment; and the
loss of weight of the vessel during the experiment gives the
amount of liquid vaporized. If the same current be passed
for the same time through two filaments of equal resistance,
equal amounts of heat will be developed : hence the ratio of
the loss of weight of the first vessel to the loss of weight
of the second is the inverse ratio of the heats of vaporization
of the liquids employed.
    If the filaments have not equal resistances, the amounts of
heat developed will be directly as the resistances. If the heat
of evaporation of any one liquid be known, the absolute value
of the heat of evaporation of any other liquid can be calcu
lated from the ratio directly found.
    3. [Note, July 1895, by D. Marshall.—At the time when
this work was begun, the only liquid for which L was at all
certainly known was water; but it was not considered ad
visable to compare directly with water in all the experiments:
 (i.) because the heat of evaporation of water is so very much
greater than that of any other liquid; (ii) because it is so
exceedingly difficult to get it sufficiently pure; and (iii.)
because the continued use of water seemed to make the
apparatus more liable to break.
    Ethyl alcohol was in every way more suitable for a standard,
and I therefore tried to make a particularly careful comparison
between alcohol and water. But both in those first attempts,
and again in several other attempts that I made later on, I
had the greatest difficulty in getting even moderately con
cordant results; and I have never, when working with water,
been able to approach the degree of accuracy that I know
from my other results I am justified in expecting.
    Thus I was finally obliged to conclude that water is not a
liquid to use in these experiments at all, much less is it fitted
 to form our ultimate standard. It became necessary there
 fore to find some other liquid for which L was accurately
 known; and as we did not feel sufficient confidence in any

40      Miss Marshall and Dr. Ramsay on the Heats of
of the published values with which we were acquainted,
Mr. E. H. Griffiths, F.R.S., kindly consented to make a
determination of the Heat of Evaporation of Benzene by
the same method that he used with such conspicuous success
in the case of water.
   His experiments (in which I also took part) measured the
heat of evaporation over the range 30° to 50° C.; and gave
by extrapolation the value at 80°2, the boiling-point. This
number is therefore the one finally adopted by us in the
calculation of our results; and we take this opportunity of
recording our sincere thanks to Mr. Griffiths for furnishing
us with such a trustworthy standard.
   It should be observed that this number finally obtained for
the heat of evaporation of benzene at its boiling-point does
not in any way affect our work regarded as a method of
comparison; but it does enter as the most important feature
into the calculations by which we pass from our ratios to the
absolute values of the heats of evaporation, and bring our
results into line with those of other observers.]
                4. Description of the Apparatus.
   In the first experiments vessels were used closely resem
bling the ordinary incandescence-lamps, with carbon filaments;
but a good deal of trouble was caused by the extreme diffi
culty of making satisfactory connexions. After the prelimi
nary experiments, these lamps were therefore rejected in
favour of others which had a spiral of fine platinum wire in
place of the carbon filament : the ends of the spiral were
attached to stout platinum terminals sealed into the glass;
the terminals were gilt and amalgamated, and thus a safe and
good contact was secured. The upper part of each lamp was
drawn out into a rather narrow open tube, through which the
liquid could be introduced, and which could be securely closed
to prevent loss during weighing. The lamp was set up in an
ordinary vapour-jacketing arrangement provided with side
bulb and condenser. The jacket was closed at the bottom by
an indiarubber cork, through which passed two U-tubes con
taining mercury; the terminals of the lamp rested on the
inner ends, into the outer ends dipped the wires carrying the
current. The cork was protected by a layer of mercury so
that it could not come into contact with the liquid. Each
lamp was jacketed with the vapour of its own liquid, so that
the temperature of its contents would be raised to the boiling
point without the possibility of ebullition taking place until
the current was started; the liquid then lost by boiling from

  Evaporation of different Liquids at their Boiling-points. 41
the lamp was condensed in the jacket, and there was no loss
of material.
   The two lamps were connected in series.
   In the earlier experiments the current used was that sup
plied at 110 volts to run two incandescence-lamps of 32-candle
power (in parallel): it was further cut down to a convenient
strength by the introduction of an appropriate resistance. At
first this resistance consisted of a solution of copper sulphate
—therefore both indefinite and variable: in the later experi
ments a coil of wire of about 20-ohms resistance was substituted
for the copper-sulphate solution.
   In performing an experiment, the liquid in the side-bulb
of the jacket was first caused to boil; and the current was
not started until the whole contents of the lamp were judged
to have reached the temperature of the condensing vapour:
if this were so, the liquid would pass into tranquil ebullition
the moment the circuit was completed. It was generally
found advisable to drop into the lamp a little glass capillary
tube to    ''         a starting-point for boiling, as most of the
liquids showed a great tendency to become superheated and
bump. A number of experiments were rejected for this
TeaSOn.
          5. Preliminary Experiments. February 1894.
    In the experiments with carbon lamps, the resistance of
each filament was determined by the Wheatstone-bridge
method, using a post-office box of coils for bridge, at five
different temperatures; and the results were plotted on
squared paper. The observations for each lamp lie approxi
mately on a straight line, the resistance falling off uniformly
as the temperature rises.
   The resistance of each filament at 0° and 180°, the decrease
per degree, and the coefficient of change of resistance between
0° and 180° were found from the curves.

       Two lamps were now made with spirals of fine platinum
    wire in place of carbon filaments. These platinums were each
     18 inches long, and coiled into spirals with all possible care
    to prevent neighbouring turns from touching and short
    circuiting. The resistances of the platinums were determined
    by the Wheatstone-bridge method. The coefficient of increase
    of resistance of platinum with rise of temperature being
    (approximately) known, the resistance of each spiral for any
    given temperature could be calculated. It was assumed that
    the temperature of the spiral was the same as that of the
    liquid boiling round it.

  Evaporation of different Liquids at their Boiling-points. 43
         7. Second Series of Experiments. June 1894.
   Up to this time the resistance of the platinum spiral
during the passage of the current had never been directly
measured, but was calculated from the cold resistance and the
coefficient of increase with rise of temperature, on the assump
tion that the temperature of the spiral was the same as that
of the surrounding liquid. The truth of this assumption was
now called in question, and it was found to be unjustifiable.
The resistance of the spiral was directly measured, first when
surrounded by a liquid at its boiling-point, then when the
current was passed so that the liquid boiled.
   The resistance was always found to be greater when the
current was passing; that is to say, the temperature of the
spiral is always higher than that of the liquid boiling round
it". One does not exactly know what conditions govern the
difference of temperature between spiral and liquid. The
probability is that the ratio of the resistances when two liquids
are compared will be altered, as well as the absolute values of
the resistances themselves; and this would tend to alter all
the results hitherto obtained.
   It should also be observed that the coefficient of increase of
resistance of platinum with rise of temperature is that given
by Callendar (1.338; Phil. Trans, clxxxii.A, p. 136) for a par
ticular sample of wire employed by him; but as this coefficient
is found to be different for different samples of wire, the value
adopted may very probably not hold for the particular wire
here used.
   It was therefore necessary to determine directly the re
sistance of the platinum spirals in each experiment. The
resistance of the wire during the passage of the current was
now determined by Poggendorff's method:—viz., comparison
with the resistance of a standard wire carrying the same
current. [For diagram of arrangements vide infra, p. 45.]
   The standard resistance was a piece of uninsulated german
silver wire, immersed in cold water to keep its temperature
constant.
   Table III. shows the results obtained.

        8. Third Series of Experiments. February 1895.
   In the early part of this year the apparatus was further
modified with a view to increasing the accuracy of the re
sistance measurements.
   The readings of resistance had been found very troublesome
and very uncertain. In many experiments it was almost
impossible to obtain anything like a point of balance on the
 bridge-wire : it was useless to attempt to read to within
 1 centim. length of the wire; and during any one experiment
 the points of balance did not remain steady at all, but seemed
 to shift indefinitely. This might be the consequence either
 of variations in the strength of the current in the main
 circuit, or of change in the resistance of the bridge-wire from
 unequal heating. [The bridge consisted of a coil of un
 covered platinoid wire immersed in cold water and connected
 in series with a platinum wire stretched against a scale.]
 Probably both causes were working together.
    Two important changes were made :
    (i.) The current in the primary or lamp-circuit was taken
 from 8 secondary cells, instead of being taken from the mains
 through a (probably) variable resistance.
    (ii.) A new bridge was made, consisting of four parallel
 german-silver wires of approximately equal resistance stretched
 against four metre-scales.
    The whole of the resistance in the secondary circuit now
 falls into the bridge itself; whatever heating-effect there may
 be is distributed all along the bridge, and its effect is much
 lessened if not altogether removed. The resistance of the
 bridge-wire does not need to be known, provided it is tolerably

   Evaporation of different Liquids at their Boiling-points. 45
uniform ; because we are only concerned with comparative
measurements,           which are simply proportional to the lengths
measured.
   For the same reason the standard wire of known resistance
is really unnecessary, and was omitted in all the remaining
experiments.
S, S, are the platinum spirals of the lamps.
*1 . . . . . . m, are mercury-cups by which connexion is made with S1 and S2.
B1, B2 are the batteries supplying the current in the primary and secondary
          circuits respectively.
C, D are the terminals of the fourfold potentiometer wire.
A is a sliding contact, and has to be moved until the fall of potential on
          the bridge between C and A is equal to the fall of potential
          between m, and ma, or m, and mi.
G is a simple reflecting-galvanometer.
   It became evident at once—working in these improved
conditions—that the whole method had been made very much
more sensitive and accurate than before; hence it was of the
utmost importance to repeat the fundamental comparison
between         £          and water from which all the other results
were calculated. These experiments are entered in Table IV.
   It was at this point that we gave up the idea of taking
water for our standard, and looked round for some other
liquid to use in its place. It is quite clear, from the numbers
obtained, that there is something in the water itself that
interferes with the experiments. Probably there is some
electrolysis during the passage of the current along the un
insulated wire; it appears impossible by any ordinary means
to get water so pure that its conductivity may be disregarded.

     Evaporation of different Liquids at their Boiling-points. 47
      In the later tables the numbers given for the heats of
   evaporation are calculated from the absolute value for ben
   zene, viz.:—L =944 at 80°2.
        'able W. records the results obtained by us for benzene,
   toluene, metaxylene, acetic acid, and ten of the lower esters
   prepared by Prof. Sydney Young. Each liquid is compared
   with alcohol.
      In Table VI. we give for each liquid :—
          (A) the ratio compared with benzene;
          (B) the value of L in thermal units at 15°;
           (C) the value of L obtained from the thermodynamic
                    equation (see p. 51, infra);
           (D) values obtained by other observers.
       In Table VII. we give for each,
          L, the heat of evaporation;
          t, the temperature of the boiling-point;
           M, the molecular weight;
          ML
           T.     the quotient of the molecular heat of vaporization
                    by the absolute temperature; according to Trou
                    ton's Law this should be a constant.

regarded as satisfactory so far as they go.
   A good many difficulties have been encountered, but most
of them have been overcome; and with a few more improve
ments in matters of detail we believe that the method will
become almost as simple in practice as in theory, and will
give results as good as can be required for ordinary purposes.
   We do not profess or desire to aim at such accuracy as
Mr. Griffiths has reached in his work on water; our method
does not and cannot lend itself to such refinements.
   We rather hope to obtain for a large number of liquids
values that are certainly within one per cent. of the truth,
and often much nearer.
    Up to the present our experiments have mostly been
limited to Dr. Young's esters, which were ready to hand;
but we propose to extend them now, as far as possible, to
any other liquids that we can obtain pure, and whose boiling
points fall between 30° and 150°.
    We desire, in conclusion, to express our thanks to Prof.
Carey Foster for the use of his laboratory in the later part
of the work, and to Mr. A. W. Porter for his kind assistance
and advice in the matter of the resistance measurements.

The benzene was bought from Messrs. Kahlbaum, of Berlin,
and guaranteed free from thiophene. It was distilled twice
from phosphoric anhydride until its boiling-point remained
constant.
   * The value of J given here is that determined by Griffiths (Phil.
Trans. vol. clxxxiv. 1893 A), and used in working out the experiments
on benzene; even if not correct, it is still the right value to use here,
because it was determined by means of the same standards as those by
which the quantity of heat developed in the benzene experiments was
determined; so that any errors would eliminate.
  This assumption as to the value of J is the only one that enters into
the calculation; all the other data were obtained by direct experiment.

52        Mr. F. W. Lanchester on the Radial Cursor:
    The toluene had been used in some of Prof. Ramsay’s
  revious work; it was distilled once and showed a constant
£
    The metaxylene was fractionated three times, and the
portion distilling between 138.1 and 138.7 was used; it was
probably not quite pure.
    The alcohol was obtained from Messrs. Baird and Tatlock,
and distilled from quicklime, and finally with a little sodium,
 until its boiling-point remained constant.
    The acetic acid was bought from Messrs. Kahlbaum; it was
 fractionated by freezing, and the portion melting at 16°-2
 was separated and used.
    The esters were prepared by Prof. S. Young, F.R.S., and
 all details may be found in his paper (J. C. S. lxiii. p. 1191).
   III. The Radial Cursor: a new addition to the Slide-Rule.
                     By F. W. LANCHESTER".
      HE slide-rule in its ordinary form is chiefly useful in
         working simple problems involving multiplication and
 division, also involution and evolution where the indices
 occurring are integers. When an expression involves frac
 tional indices its solution is only possible, on a slide-rule of
 ordinary construction, by employing the scale of logarithms
 on the back of the      #.    in the same manner as a table of
 logarithms, when the process becomes so clumsy as to prac
 tically destroy its utility.
     The object of the present improvement is to enable the
 operator to solve problems of the latter class with the same
 ease and degree of accuracy as that only previously attainable
 in connexion with the simpler cases.
     In thermodynamic problems such as arise in dealing theo
 retically with gas- and other heat-engines, the need of some
 method of computation more rapid than that of ordinary
 arithmetic involving many references, to tables becomes
 evident, and it was in connexion with work of this description
 that the author was led to devise the instrument which is the
 subject of the present paper.
     In the case of the isothermal curve of a perfect gas, the
  ordinary slide-rule is all that can be required, for the curve is
  represented by the simple expression
                           Apv = constant.

                a new addition to the Slide-Rule.            53
   For the sake of brevity let us name the scales in a rule of
the ordinary “Gravet” type thus
                               A
                               B

   Then with the slide. in the inverted position the corre
sponding pressures and volumes of an £ can be read
off directly on the scales A and g[.
   In the case of an adiabatic curve, however, we have an
expression of the form
                          pv?= const.,
where y has a value 1.4 more or less according to the physical
properties of the gas or mixture of gases we are dealing with.
In order to deal with an expression of this form, it is neces
sary to provide some ready means of dividing the scales A
and g proportionately to the value of y which corresponds to
the division and multiplication of the respective logarithms
of the quantities dealt with, in the proportion of the indices
of p and v, that is 1: y.
   £ proportionate division of the scales is effected in the
new Cursor by a radial index-arm, indicated in fig. 1 b
lines f and g : this is arranged to swing about a stud wh:
is itself carried on a sliding bar running in guides at right
angles to the rule. All readings are taken at the points of
intersection of the line with the edges of the slide. In the
actual instrument the radial arm is made of a transparent
slip of celluloid on which is scratched a straight line true to
the centre of the stud-hole. The back view shows (fig. 2)
the transverse bar graduated to give the indices to which
it is desired to work. In fig. 2 this transverse bar is shown
set to 1.408, the y of a perfect gas.

   The following examples will serve as an illustration of the
class of calculation for which the instrument is designed.
   1. To determine the maximum pressure of an adiabatic
compression.
   Set the slide on back of cursor to 1408 (y). Suppose, for
example, that the initial pressure be 15 lbs. per square inch,
and that 100 vols. be compressed to 26 vols.
   Invert slide.   Set index line of cursor to 15 on A, then set
1 (100) on q to index line of cursor. Now set index line to
26 on QI and read on scale A the corresponding pressure
=100 lbs. absolute, 85 above atmosphere (figs. 1 and 2).
   2. The work done in any adiabatic compression can easily
be calculated from the above by the following formula :- *
                                1
                         w=#1 piv;
where W = work done in ft-lbs., W = final vol. of the gas
(after compression) in units of 12 cub. in. (to harmonize with
ft.-lbs. and pressure in pounds per square inch), and p1= differ
ence of pressure between adiabatic and isothermal maximum
pressure for the given ratio of compression (fig. 4).

                a new addition to the Slide-Rule.                57
   3. The temperature of an adiabatic at any point can be
determined from either pressure or volume by using suitable
indices for
                                s
                          v. Ty- = constant;
also

                         p. Ti-Y = constant.
    In determining temperatures from volumes or vice versá it
is only necessary to proceed as before (1). In dealing, how
 ever, with pressures and temperatures the index is negative
 (where y is > unity), the interpretation of this being that an
 increase of pressure is accompanied by an increase in the
 temperature. The slide therefore does not require to be
 reversed as in py and vT calculations; but with a rule of the
 Gravet type, owing to the scales C and D being the square
 roots of A and B, it is necessary to use a fictitious index
 obtained by dividing      I#,    by the logarithmic ratio of the
           • *      ‘y
 scales, giving 2(1-2). . It would also be quite possible to
 graduate one edge of the index slide with fictitious values to
 compensate for the ratio of the scale-readings.
    4. In the process described in (1) we have the means of
 plotting a series of adiabatics or isentropics, and each position
 of the radial cursor on the rule gives in its readings on the
 index line a corresponding isentropic, and a movement of the
 cursor to the left corresponds to a gain in entropy and vice
 versá, and it can be shown that equal increments of linear
 movement of the cursor correspond to equal increments of
  entropy. In other words, the scale of inches or centimetres
  on the edge of the rule may be regarded as a scale of entropy
 in arbitrary units.
     5. The following is a very good example of the use of the
  radial cursor in practice.
     The theoretical efficiency of an Otto cycle gas-engine is
  independent of the working temperatures and is given by the

                           , where v, is the total effective volume
 of the cylinder and compression-space, and v2 = volume of
  compression-space alone.
     Taking y=1408, y-1= 408. This is beyond the range
  of the instrument, so we will employ     *    = 2.45.

IV. Graphical Method for finding the Focal Lengths of

cave mirror and the distances from it of any two conjugate
foci (page 30 in third edition). The present note consists of
the extension of this principle to the cases of a convex mirror
and thin lenses and its application to the practical problem of
finding focal lengths. This experiment is usually a little
perplexing to junior students in a physical laboratory. It is
therefore hoped that by giving publicity to this method

   Let the following notation and convention of signs be
adopted :
                   Focal length,           f.
                   Distance of object,     tl.
                   Distance of image,      t".
All distances to be measured from the mirror or lens, and
to be reckoned positive when measured against the direction
of the incident light, and negative if with that direction.
   Then we have:—
For mirrors,              1.
                          v                                  (1)
and for lenses,           1
                          5-7 =; . . . . . . . (2)
   For the graphical method take two rectangular axes of
coordinates OX and OY, and let a straight line pass in any
direction through the point Ma, whose coordinates are (f, f);
then it follows at once from (1) and elementary geometry
that its intercepts on the axes of a and y give a pair of corre
sponding values of u and v respectively for a concave mirror
of focal length f(see fig. 1). This is the case already referred
to as given in Aldis's ‘Geometrical Optics. Now if the rota
ting line pass through the point M., whose coordinates are
(—f, -f), we have, as seen from (1) also, the case for a con
vex mirror. Similarly, by consideration of (2), we see that
the points La and L2, whose coordinates are (–f, f) and
(f, -f), give the completing cases for a concave and a convex
lens respectively.
   The first uses of this graphical method are to afford a
picture of the corresponding values of u and v for any mirror
or lens for which f is known, and to enable the student
to trace the series of values through which v passes as u
changes continuously from infinity to zero. But in this
view of the matter no very great advantage is gained, as it
is almost as troublesome to the student to        remember the
positions of the fixed points through which the revolving line
must pass for the various cases as to recall and rightly use the
corresponding formulae.
   The second and more important use of this method is its

the formulae, or the recollection of the positions of the four

fixed points mentioned above, avoids the cumbrous calculation
of reciprocals, and at the same time exhibits a criterion of
the accuracy of the experiment. The student has simply to
 (1) mark off along the axes of w and y with due regard to
 sign the corresponding values of u and v as observed on the

bank; (2) join the two points thus obtained; and (3) repeat
these operations for another pair of values of u and v. Then
the coordinates of the intersection of the two lines give the
focal length required. An additional check is obtained b
taking a £a pair of values of u and v, or by drawing throug
the origin of coordinates a line inclined at an angle of 45°
with the axes.       In either case the three lines obtained should
intersect in a single point. In any actual experiment this is
not likely to be precisely the case; but the value of f can
readily be inferred, or, in case of a great discrepancy, the
results rejected and the experiment repeated. Below are the
data for determining the focal lengths of a concave mirror
and a convex lens, which are utilized in the figure.

                         By RoLLO APPLEYARD*.
MF'              CALLENDAR and GRIFFITHS and their colleagues
        at Cambridge have proved that the platinum thermo
meter is capable of measuring temperature with an accuracy
of one thousandth of a Centigrade degree. For general

            “Direct-reading” Platinum Thermometer.                     63
purposes, temperature is never required to be measured with
a precision greater than one tenth of a degree. It is my
object to consider how the reserve of precision may be utilized
in facilitating the processes of testing. The results seem to
indicate that it is possible, with a platinum thermometer, to
determine ordinary temperatures by a single operation, of
such a kind that the readings are “direct”—that is to say,
no calculation requires to be applied to them.
   In the course of some experiments upon the variation of
the electrical resistance of dielectrics with temperature, an
apparatus was needed which, by a quick and simple operation,
would measure the temperature within the substance of the
dielectric. As dielectrics, generally, are bad conductors of
heat, it is desirable to take simultaneous readings of tempe
rature at many points within their mass. A platinum
thermometer may be regarded as having an extensible bulb,
for the wire may be distributed to various points within the
dielectric; the temperature deduced from the platinum
thermometer, at any instant, is therefore equivalent to the
mean of the simultaneous readings of a large number of dis
tributed mercurial thermometers. Further, the dielectrics,
in their protecting covers, are submerged in a tank of water;
the stems of ordinary mercurial thermometers placed, verti
cally, beneath a water-surface would be difficult to observe;
the platinum instrument is far more convenient for this work,
for it has the advantage of a portable stem and scale.
   The resistance of a dielectric * is by no means such a
definite quantity as the resistance of a metallic conductor.
The difference in quality between samples of the same name,
the age of the substance, the nature of the contact between the
dielectric and its electrodes, and the so-called “electrification,”
are such variable factors that the term “dielectric resistance”
has only an empirical significance. To arrange for the mea
surement of temperature with extreme precision is therefore
unnecessary.
                                Range.
   For certain practical reasons, the temperatures mentioned
in this paper are referred to the Fahrenheit scale. The
required range was 32°–120° F.; and, within the present
limits of accuracy, it is safe to assume that the resistance,
R., of the platinum coils, at any temperature t, within this
range, is represented by the expression                          -
                       R = R32[1+2(t–32)]. . .              .  .   .  (1)

64                  Mr. Rollo Appleyard on a
                        The Platinum Coils.
   There were six platinum coils, forming six thermometers,
each having a resistance of about 7 ohms. Each consisted of
about 2 metres of pure platinum wire, of 8 mils diameter,
wound in double spirals upon an ebonite rod. Thick copper
leads were soldered to the ends of the coils.        To determine a
and Ra, the six coils were separately tested in melting ice, and
then at various temperatures in heated water, side by side with
a mercurial thermometer.         These measurements were made
with the coils submerged in a large tank, the temperatures
being controlled by a gas-regulator. The resistances were
measured on an ordinary “dial” bridge having german
silver coils. This part of the work occupied much time : a
was derived from the mean of the best of 30 determinations;
it was somewhat tedious, but the values R22 and a proved, in
the result, very accurate. The six coils of the six thermo
meters were afterwards connected in series, and regarded as
one thermometer.      The mean values were :—
             Ra2 =40.05 ohms (six coils, in series).
               a = 0.02097.
   The six platinum coils, still connected in series, were then
imbedded within their respective dielectrics. Hollow metal
tubes, for mercurial thermometers, were inserted at the same
time within the dielectrics, for check-readings. The dielec
trics were then immersed together into one tank of water.
              Measurement of R, by “Dial” bridge.
   The apparatus was now complete, and tentative tests were
made for R, at different temperatures. The results, when
compared with the mean of the readings of the mercurial
thermometers in the tubes, were rather discouraging. The
temperatures could not be depended upon within about 2°
Fahr. These errors were due either to the german-silver
coils, or the plugs, of the dial-bridge. Slightly better results
were obtained by reducing the battery to a single cell. It
was impossible to determine the bridge-temperature, at any
time, with accuracy; and, moreover, even if that temperature
could have been found *, the temperature-coefficient for dif
ferent samples of german-silver varies so widely with different
samples, that no dependence whatever could have been placed
upon values “corrected” by text-book coefficients. The
  * A platinum coil interwound with one of the resistance-bobbins
would probably be the best method under these circumstances.

66          -         Mr. Rollo Appleyard on a
“dial” bridge was therefore abandoned, and a slide-bridge
of special form was designed for the purpose.
                 Measurement of R, by Slide-bridge.
   The slide-bridge, fig. 1, consists of a 12-ft. plank, P, with
a groove G cut along its whole length. A metre-scale, S,
can slide in the groove, flush with the upper surface of the
plank. Datum-marks are made at successive metres along
the plank; subdivisions being read upon the sliding metre
 scale. The contact-piece, L, is attached to the metre-scale at
its zero-point. This saves the cost of an elaborate graduation
 of the plank; and keeps the sliding-contact very accurately
in position. When necessary, the metre-scale with its con
 tact-piece is easily transferred to other such slide-bridges.
 There is no distortion of the slide-wire, and indentation is
 almost impossible".        The slide-wire, W, is of platinoid f
 stretched between two adjustable blocks of copper, B. Its
 ends are soldered into saw-cuts made in the copper blocks.
 On the other side of the scale-groove there is a copper wire,
 J, for the galvanometer-contact. The contact-piece consists
 of an ebonite block K, with a gap at one end. The platinoid
 wire slides through a saw-cut M transversely to this gap in
 the ebonite. A Y-shaped piece of spring-brass, L, is screwed
 to the ebonite block. One end of the Y, projecting over the
 gap, is provided at N with a platinum knife-edge. The other
 two arms of the Y project beyond the other end of the ebonite
 block, and carry clips, R, through which the wire for the
 galvanometer-contact slides.
    The bridge-coils, fig. 2, consist of five silk-covered platinoid
 resistance-bobbins, immersed in a double vessel of copper,
 the inner vessel containing 13 gallons of paraffin-oil.
    A glow-lamp, submerged in the oil, is used for maintaining
 the temperature constant at 80° F.; this temperature was
 chosen as being just above ordinary air-temperature.
    Copper rods (a, b, c, e,f, g, k) connect the coils; their
 ends pass upward, through the wooden cover of the calori
 meter, to the switch.
    Fig. 2 shows the arrangement of these coils. The two
 ends of the slide-wire go to f and g respectively; to which
 points the 100-ohm coils (f, e) and (g, a) are connected.

 thermometer is substituted for the (b, e) coil.

   To calibrate the bridge, the switch (fig. 2) is set with p, q
horizontal, and s screwed firmly to m. This puts 45+10=55
ohms between b and e, and the slider has to be moved to a
new position along the plank. A simple calculation enables
us to find an expression for the temperature, t, of the platinum
coils in terms of n, the distance in cms of the sliding-contact
from the extreme left of the plank-scale. The actual figures
for this particular bridge are here given.

   From (7) the plank may be calibrated “directly,” in tem

plot a curve co-ordinating n and t. Such a curve does not
greatly differ from a straight line; it is therefore sufficiently
accurate to calculate n for every successive five degrees
within the range.
                              Accuracy attained.
   Mr. E. H. Griffiths has been good enough to examine my
figures, and he agrees that, if the original standardization of the
platinum coils is carefully attended to, this apparatus may be
relied upon to measure temperature with an accuracy of one
tenth of a Fahrenheit degree. Unfortunately, the platinum
coils were sealed hard and fast within their respective dielec
trics before this slide-bridge method was adopted; so that it
has not been possible to check the readings in a liquid, as
against a mercurial thermometer. This is very much to be
regretted. By taking the mean of the readings of mercurial
thermometers in the tank, and the readings of the mercurial
thermometers in the tubes within the dielectrics, and com
paring this mean with the value of t derived from (6), it is
possible to make a very rough comparison. It should be
carefully noticed, however, that “tube” temperatures include
all the errors which it is the very object of the present
method to avoid. The following table must be regarded with
that limitation.               -

   It may be remarked here that, with the same apparatus, by
taking the mean of the two values of n, corresponding to
reversal of the battery, a second approximation could have
been made. Also the slide-wire is thinner than is required
by the temperature range. A thicker wire would have given
greater possibilities of accuracy, and it would have been less
liable to mechanical injury and temperature fluctuations.
           The Action of Sulphur Vapour upon Copper.
    While standardizing platinum thermometers in the vapour
 of sulphur (444°C.) some mica plates, which formed part of
 the apparatus within the vapour, were bound together with
 copper wires which passed through holes in the mica. After
 five hours’ exposure to the vapour the apparatus was dis
 mantled, and, as had been expected, the copper wire was
 completely demetallized. An examination of the resulting
 wire, a brittle compound of cuprous or cupric sulphide,
 showed that it was, in some cases, perforated by a small axial
 hole; the wire had, in fact, become a tube of very small
 bore.
    I am able to show this to you by projecting upon the
 screen one of the pieces of mica through which the original
 wire was threaded; the ends of the         £ wire were broken
 off flush with each face of the mica, thus forming a section of
 the sulphide wire.
    Prof. Ramsay tells me that, as a rule, it is possible to draw
 an inner metallic core" from a copper wire which has been
 treated with sulphur vapour. It therefore seemed probable
 that my specimen was a piece of sulphide wire out of which
 a core had fallen. This, however, does not appear to be
 the explanation, for I have since succeeded in threading an
 iron wire, of 8 mils diameter, completely through a sulphide
 wire, which was more than half an inch long and not quite
 straight. It is impossible that a core of 8 mils could have
 fallen out of this specimen.
    An examination, with the microscope, of the original copper
 wire does not reveal the slightest perforation; although the
 end was carefully removed with nitric acid so as to avoid the
 closing of the hole, if one existed, by any mechanical cutting
 of the wire.
    It was suggested that an occasional hole might occur in the
 process of drawing the wire. . Prof. Boys asked me to try a
 piece of copper cut from a block. I therefore had a piece, of
 square section, sawn from a large commutator-bar.                 After
     * I have obtained lately several specimens which show this core,

           “Direct-reading” Platinum Thermometer.             71
six hours’ boiling in sulphur vapour, this copper rod became
circular in section; it had a central perforation, as could be
proved by passing a wire into it. The colour of the surface
was a deep “beetle” blue.
   In order to show the amount of expansion which the copper
experiences during the change to sulphide, a second piece of
copper, of square section, was sawn out of the commutator-bar,
half the length being turned down to a circular section. This
was put into sulphur vapour for six hours, with the result that
the diameter of what had been the square part had increased
from 215 to 386 mils; the circular part had increased from
120 to 232 mils; and a third piece, of ordinary drawn copper
wire, increased from 31 to 77 mils.     During the transforma
tion from copper to sulphide the diameter in all cases is ap
proximately doubled.      The length is only slightly increased;
all sharp edges disappear; and there is a general tendency
towards the circular section. The fracture is crystalline,
resembling that of an aerolite.
   A piece of Delta metal submitted to the same test came out
of the sulphur vapour without appreciable change. It was
discoloured but otherwise unaltered, and I propose to adopt
this metal in future for the electrodes of platinum thermo
meters.
                           Summary.
   The foregoing results indicate that platinum-coil thermo
metry may be reduced to a simple operation, and that the
simplified method is sufficiently precise for general work.
The exact conditions which determine the numerical limits of
accuracy, generally, cannot be very concisely stated. The
possible causes of error are well known, and with a little care
may be nearly eliminated. The first precaution is to main
tain the bridge-coils at some constant temperature just above
the maximum air-temperature. For this purpose the oil-bath
and glow-lamp will be found satisfactory.
   If the temperature of the slide-wire is likely to vary con
siderably, r may be redetermined;, or a correction-factor
may be applied. This will seldom be necessary; no such
correction was used in the above tests.
   There must be some easy arrangement for calibrating the
slide-wire. The auxiliary-coil test is expeditious. The wire
now supplied by good makers is sufficiently uniform; and,
except where great precision is essential, it will not require
to be corrected for differences of diameter; it should be of
platinum-silver.

           WI. On a Method of Drawing Hyperbolas.
              By GEORGE J. BURCH, M.A. Oxon."
TH:       ordinary methods of drawing hyperbolas fail when
       the portion of the curve required lies some distance
 from the vertex, small errors of measurement being then so
 much magnified as to render the results practically useless.
 Cunynghame's hyperbolagraph, an admirable instrument for
 describing the parts near the vertex with a single movement,
is also, for the same reason, inapplicable to the cases dealt
with in the present communication.
    In using graphic methods for the investigation of a problem
 in Optics, the author had occasion, in 1885, to draw a number
 of hyperbolas all passing through a fixed point far away from
 the vertices of most of them, the asymptotes and the vertex
 of each being given. After vainly endeavouring to draw
 the curves in the usual way, he devised the following method
 which proved entirely successful, and which is, so far as he
 has been able to ascertain, a new one.
    Given the asymptotes Oa and Oy, and the vertex A, to
 construct an hyperbola.
    The equation of an hyperbola, when referred to its asym
ptotes as axes of coordinates, is
                          4ay=a”+b”.
In the simplest case, that of the rectangular hyperbola, a =b,
and the equation may be conveniently written
                      ay=c” = a constant.
    To any point C on Ov draw AC, and from A draw a line
parallel to Oy, cutting Ov in B.
    Make CE upon the axis of v equal to BO, and from E
draw a line parallel to Oy, cutting AC in D.
   Then yOw being a right angle, and AABC and ADEC

 But by the construction, AB and EC are constant;
and also         -         BC=OE=w ;
 and                        EC=OB.
 Therefore if ED=y,
                     ay=OB. BA = a constant,
 and D is a point on the hyperbola.
    It is scarcely necessary to point out that this construction
 applies also to hyperbolas other than rectangular, since the
 lines AB and ED are drawn parallel to Oy, the other
 asymptote.              -                -
    In practice, when it is required to plot several curves,
 the simplest plan is to draw the asymptotes on a piece of
 stout paper and then cut it into the shape of a modified
 T-square, as shown in P, fig. 2, where the edge OBE forms
 part of the asymptote Ov, the continuation of which is ruled
 on the paper and represented by the dotted line, and the edge
 DE is parallel to the asymptote Oy.
    A distance EC equal to OP is measured along the line Ev,
 and a fine pin-hole made at C.

drawn. Then the paper square, P, is laid against one asym
ptote and a third pin inserted at C. This can be done with
 greater accuracy if the line EC is continued to the end of the
 paper. It remains to place a straight-edge S against the pins
 A and C, and to mark the intersection of it with the line ED
 at D. Then D is a point on the hyperbola, and by shifting
 the pin C together with the paper square P to a fresh
 position on the line Ow, another point can be determined in
 like manner. One great advantage of the method is that the
 value of y can be found directly for any given value of v. To
 do so, it is only necessary to place the paper P so that OE=a,
 and proceed as before.
    Obviously, too, the instrument might be constructed in
 metal and arranged so as to slide along the asymptote Oa,
 drawing a continuous curve. It might consist of two brass
 bars hinged at C, with a cross-bar clamped to one of them in
 such a way that its distance from C and the angle between it
 and the bar P could be adjusted. This cross-bar might carry
 a pencil or writing-point free to slide along it, and pressed
 by a light spring against the edge of S. A rough model of
 such an instrument was made at the time by the author, and

 long lines being given by the straight edge, great accuracy is
 easily obtainable, whether with the simple paper square or
 the more complex instrument.

  Elements of the Mathematical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism.
     By J. J. THOMSON, M.A., F.R.S. Cambridge University Press,
    1895.
 ST'TS of           Electricity who desire to read the more mathe
      matical portions of the subject, and particularly those who wish
 to follow the development of the aether theory of electricity and
 the electromagnetic theory of light, usually find some difficulty in
  the choice of a text-book. From a first-year experimental course
  to Maxwell's treatise is too great a step, in mathematics as well as
 in physics; some text-book of an intermediate character is there
 fore required. Maxwell appears to have realized this, and he
 attempted to remove the difficulty by his Elementary Treatise,
which, unfortunately, he did not live to complete. In the present
 volume Prof. Thomson has a similar aim : he retains nearly the
  same order of subject-matter as in Maxwell's treatise, but (with
 few exceptions) only such problems are considered as can be solved
 by the aid of the differential calculus. By this treatment the
 mathematical difficulties are greatly diminished, while the physics
 of the subject is satisfactorily developed and illustrated by a
sufficiently large number of examples.
    The author has made frequent use of Faraday tubes of force in
explanations of phenomena occurring in the electric field: he shows
very simply that such tubes will be in equilibrium if the tension
along their axes is accompanied by an equal pressure at right angles
 to them. In discussing the case of an insulated sphere in a uni
form field, the idea of an electric doublet is introduced, and an
expression is found for the moment of a doublet representing the
external effect of the charge on the sphere. Among other new
modes of treatment we may mention the use of the dissipation
function in determining the distribution of currents in any network
of conductors. Kirchhoff's laws are shown to be equivalent to the
statement that the currents distribute themselves so as to make the
total rate of development of heat-energy a minimum; by writing
down the expression for this heat-energy and making it a minimum,
the values of the currents in each branch may be obtained. Prof.
Thomson has found a companion for k, the specific inductive
capacity, and u, the magnetic permeability, in dimensional formulae.
The work done by a unit magnetic pole in threading a closed
circuit is 4 T/p times the current flowing in the circuit; as the

 76                  Motices respecting New Books.
  definition connects magnetism with electricity clearly p may have
  dimensions, but the electrostatic and electromagnetic theories each
  assume it to be a mere number. The result of retaining p is
  to make p"/uk the square of a velocity.
     Chemists will probably regret that the subjects of migration of
  ions, ionic velocity, and electrolytic conductivity find no place in
 the volume, electrolysis being treated in a very elementary
 fashion. The chapter devoted to dielectric currents and the
 electromagnetic theory of light is very readable, even by those who
 are not familiar with the ordinary equations of wave propagation;
 it contains a concise though somewhat brief account of the recent
 confirmations of Maxwell's theory by Hertz and others. We
 notice that the discovery of the action of electric waves in dimin
 ishing the resistance of a tube of metal turnings is erroneously
 attributed to Prof. Lodge: the experiment was originally de
  scribed in this form by M. Branly.
    The volume is nicely printed, with bold headings at the com
 mencement of each section, and is of a handy size for students’
 use. There is a subject-index at the end of the book, but a list of
 titles of the various chapters inserted at the commencement of the
  volume would be of great service to the student.

  An Exercise Book of Elementary Physics for Organised Science
     Schools etc.; arranged according to the Headmasters’ Association's
    Syllabus of Practical Physics.      By RICHARD A. GREGORY,
    F.R.A.S.     London: Macmillan & Co., 1895.
 THE Government having at last recognized the suitability of
 elementary practical physics and mechanics as school subjects, this
 series of exercises suggests a method of making such subjects
 effective in training students to acquire habits of observation,
 accuracy, and carefulness. The exercises include the general
 operations of weighing and measuring, mechanics and heat; they
 are arranged according to subject and in order of difficulty.
 Spaces are provided in which the results of experiments may be
 recorded, and in each case the student is left to make his own
 deductions from his experiments.
    Some of the directions for experiment are not very explicit;
 for example, in order to measure the rise of water in capillary
 tubes the student is told to take two very narrow tubes, one having
 twice the internal diameter of the other, and to wash them by
 drawing distilled water through them. A good student, and rot a
 few teachers, will want to know how the diameters of the tubes
are to be measured; and the results of the experiment will not be
 very satisfactory unless the tubes have been previously washed
with some cleansing agent, such as potash or alcohol. A few
exercises on glass-blowing, soldering, and similar manipulation
'might be added with advantage. The construction of the model
 lift or force-pump, used in one of the experiments, would be
 excellent practice in this direction.

. The author suggests the use of balances weighing to 0.01 grm.,
and recommends supplying one balance to every six students.
Taking into account the number of experiments requiring the use of
a balance this seems hardly sufficient; we incline to the opinion
that a larger number of cheaper balances weighing to 0.1 grm, say
one balance to each pair of students, would be preferable for
elementary physical work.
   Mr. Gregory has rendered good service by suggesting in so
practical a fashion a programme of physical work, which indicates
the nature of the instruction to be given, without binding a teacher
to follow it out entirely or even in consecutive order.

Prof. T. G. Bonney, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   Kolguev Island, about the size of Norfolk, lies about 50 miles
from Arctic Russia and about 130 miles south-west of the nearest
part of Novaya Zemlya, with soundings not exceeding 30 fathoms
between it and Russia, and probably not more than 75 fathoms
between it and Novaya Zemlya. It is entirely composed of a vast
accumulation of glacio-marine beds. The northern two-thirds of the
island consists of an elevated ridged area with a maximum height of
 250 feet. The author has been furnished with notes by Mr. Trevor
Battye concerning the geology of this region. It is inferred from his
 observations that this elevated region is composed of beds of sand.

 with erratic boulders not less than 80 feet deep, resting on clays—
 the ‘Kolguev Clays. Mount Bolvana rises as a symmetrical cone
 above the tundra, detached from the northern plateau, pointing,
 in the opinion of the author, to the occurrence of marine erosion.
    The southern portion of the island is tundra, a dead flat of grass,
 bog and peat-levels reaching to the sea; good sections of the
 Kolguev Clays are exposed in the gullies traversing it near the sea on
 the western coast. In the vicinity of the Gobista river the Kolguev
 Beds consist of clays merging here and there into sands. They are
 charged with boulders often ice-scratched, indicating continuous
 deposition in a comparatively deep sea. The beds yielded many
 shells of Arctic mollusca, such as Savicava arctica, Mya, etc.,
 apparently dispersed from top to bottom. The ice-pack has
 forced many fragments of semi-fossil wood on to the shore, no
 doubt worked up from a bed immediately below sea-level. No
 deposit was met with in Kolguev Island precisely similar to what is
 called ‘Till’ in Scotland, though there are many Boulder Clays in
 Britain which are in no measure superior in toughness to those of
 Kolguev, for instance, those of the Yorkshire coast and the Chalky
 Boulder Clays of Norfolk.
    It is suggestive that all the glacial deposits met with by the
 author in Arctic and Polar lands (except the terminal moraines
now forming above sea-level) should be glacio-marine beds.
    Prof. Bonney in his report describes the rocks brought home by
the author. They include granite-gneiss (very like Archaean rocks),
grit, chert, limestone with Favosites (Silurian or Devonian), lime
stone with Amphipora ramosa (Devonian), limestone with Litho
strotion irregulare (Carboniferous), and a fragment of a Jurassic
belemnite. The fossils have been examined by Mr. E. T. Newton,

       ON UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURES AT GREAT DEPTHS.
                      BY ALEXANDER AGASSIZ.
For: several      years past I have, with the assistance of our
       engineer, Mr. Preston C. F. West, been making rock-tempe
rature observations as we increased the depth at which the mining
operations of the Calumet and Hecla Mining Co. were carried on.
We have now attained at our deepest point a vertical depth of
4712 feet, and have taken temperatures of the rock at 105 feet, at
the depth of the level of Lake Superior, 655 feet, at that of the
level of the sea, 1257 feet, at that of the deepest part of Lake
Superior, 1663 feet, and at four additional stations, each respec
tively 550, 550, 561, and 1256 feet below the preceding one, the
deepest point at which temperatures have been taken being 4580
feet. We propose, when we have reached our final depth, 4900

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                  79
feet, to take an additional rock-temperature and to then publish
in full the details of our observations.
    In the meantime it may be interesting to give the results as
they stand. The highest rock-temperature obtained at the depth
of 4580 feet was only 79° F., the rock-temperature at the depth
of 105 feet was 59°F. Taking that as the depth unaffected by
local temperature variations, we have a column of 4475 feet of
rock with a difference of temperature of 20° F., or an average
increase of 1°F. for 223.7 feet. This is very different from any
recorded observations; Lord Kelvin, if I am not mistaken, giving
 as the increase for 1° F., fifty-one (51) feet, while the observations
 based on the temperature-observations of the St. Gothard Tunnel
 gave for an increase of 1° F., sixty (60) feet. The ca'culations
 based upon the latter observations gave an approximate thickness
 of the crust of the earth, in one case of about 20 miles, the other
 of 26. Taking our observations, the crust would be over 80 miles
 and the thickness of the crust at the critical temperature of water
 would be over 31 miles, instead of about 7 and 8.5 miles as by
 the other and older ratios.        With the ratio observed here, the
temperature at a depth of 19 miles would only be about 470°, a
 very different temperature from that obtained by the older ratios
 of over 2000°F.
    The holes in which we placed slow-registering Negretti and
 Zambra thermometers were drilled, slightly inclined upward, to a
 depth of ten feet from the face of the rock and plugged with wood
 and clay. In these holes the thermometers were left from one
 to three months. The average annual temperature of the air is
 48° F.; the temperature of the air in the bottom of the shaft was
 72°F.—American Journal of Science, December 1895.
   ON THE INFLUENCE OF ELECTRICAL WAVES ON THE GALVANIC
        RESISTANCE OF METALLIC CONDUCTORS.              BY H. HAGA.
     At the meeting of the Berlin Physical Society on Nov.30, 1894,
 M. E. Aschkinass" communicated observations according to which
 the resistance of a grating of tinfoil was found to be about two per
 cent. less in consequence of electrical radiation; and this small
 resistance lasted even after the cessation of radiation, until heating
 or mechanical agitation restored the former value.
     Since radiation will produce electrical vibrations in a tinfoil
  resistance, it appeared worth while to investigate whether in
  general the resistance of a metallic conductor is also altered by
  electrical vibrations passing over its surface.
     Using the apparatus described and recommended by Ebertt, by
  which long continuous electrical vibrations could be obtained, such
  vibrations were transmitted through different specimens of copper
         * Verhandl. der Phys. Gesellschaft zu Berlin, vol. xiii. p. 103.

and iron wire and through tinfoil. No influence could be observed,
although in the way the experiments were arranged an alteration
in the resistance of £5 per cent. could easily have been observed.
   After this negative result I returned to radiation, and allowed
primary sparks of very various duration to strike across, while the
resistances to be investigated were at a distance of less than 50 cm.
To produce the sparks an induction-coil 25 cm. in length was used
worked by three accumulators, but more frequently an induction
coil 60 cm. in length worked by ten accumulators (24 amperes).
   By means of a spark-resonator it was always ascertained that
the primary spark was an oscillating one. The following resist
ances were used:—Warious gratings of tinfoil fastened on ebonite,
the thickness of the tinfoil being 0.05 mm. to 0.01 mm., and the
resistances 0.478 Q, 3.155 Q, 11:31 Q, 36.31 Q; a grating of thin
iron wire on an ebonite frame (5-504 Q); a german-silver wire
(0.578 Q), and a strip of tinfoil (1:068 Q): both these last were
resonant with the primary spark; secondary sparks could be
obtained between the wire or the strip. In none of these resist
ances was any trace of a variation observed (to 5% per cent.).
   When the gratings were not fastened on the ebonite, but were
fixed in an ebonite frame, I observed the phenomena described by
Aschkinass, but only when the strips were very close to each
other. The variations in the resistances were often very con
siderable. The resistance of a grating of 6.7 Q was 3.6 Q after
radiation by the primary spark; by an agitation again 5:1 (),
after radiation 3:2 (). This grating was dipped in solidifying
paraffin; it then showed a resistance of 7.85 Q, which became
4.75 Q by radiation, and by shaking increased to 7.6 Q. It was
necessary to agitate violently to get back to the original high
resistance. No change in resistance could be observed with
gratings having great spaces between the strips. In one grating
the 22 strips were 0.75 mm. in breadth and likewise 0.75 mm.
apart. The resistance 11.85 Q was the same after radiation as
before.                         -
    Hence, from these experiments, the amount of the varia
tion depends on the position of the strips in reference to each
other. If these are close the primary spark may give rise to the
formation of one or more bridges between adjacent strips, as
Branly" assumes with metal filings, and Lodget in what he calls

in the latter investigation, it appears to me indubitable that, as
Aschkinass also thinks possible, the phenomena with metal gratings
belong to the same category, and are not to be ascribed to some
unknown action.—Wiedemann's Annalen, No. 11, 1895.

X. The Filar Anemometer. By CARL BARUs, Hazard Pro
   fessor of Physics, Brown University, Providence, U.S.A.”
1. TN a remarkable paper, published some sixteen years
          ago, Prof. W. Strouhalf investigated certain laws
subject to which a sound is produced when the wind passes
transversely across a slender solid body. Placing his chief
reliance on the results obtained with metallic wires, Strouhal
found for thicknesses ranging from 0.018 cm. to 0.325 cm.,
and for speeds from 2:1 met./sec. to nearly 12 met./sec., that
the whole group of phenomena could be expressed by an
equation of striking simplicity,
                               n=Cv/d ;
where n is the frequency of vibration, v the speed of the
wind, d the diameter of the wire, and where C is constant
except as to temperature. When all data are expressed
relatively to metres and seconds, this constant has at atmo
spheric temperatures a mean value
                             C=0-200;
and it is thus at once possible to compute the speed of the air

normally to the axis of a given wire, when the note made by
the whistling wind is located, at a given temperature, in pitch.
Other data", such as the material, or the tension, or the length
of the wire, &c., are without marked effect, except as regards
the intensity of the sound produced.
    Strouhal further found that whenever the air-tone n, vary
ing continuously with speed v, approaches the fundamental
or any of the overtones of the transversely vibrating wire, the
sound bursts forth with accentuated intensity. In virtue of
this discovery, Strouhal was able to give a degree of pre
cision to his results which for the case of the unassisted air
tone would have been unattainable; for it was merely neces
sary to work out such speeds as kept the wire in a state of
permanent resonance. Indeed it was now possible to obtain
 sounds from the wire even after the actuating air-tone alone
had ceased to be audible.
    Commenting on the application of his results, Strouhal
 notes its immediate bearing on anemometry. The device is
 peculiarly adapted to the measurement of variable gusts and
 high winds, and is thus supplementary to the ordinary
 anemometer.
    2. It is from this point of view, i. e. in relation to what
may be called micro-anemometry, that the filamentary ane
mometer interested me during my connexion with meteoro
logical research f. Here is an instrument virtually without
 mass, which therefore does not state the case summarily, but
 represents the wind as it actually is. In consideration of the
 actual complexity of aerodynamic phenomena, the simplicity
 of Strouhal's law is an ulterior advantage. Whoever believes
 that much is to be learned from a more searching investiga
 tion of the nature and origin of gusts of windt will be in
 sympathy with the development of what is in many respects
 an ideal instrument of research.
     There is another important problem which lies within
 the scope of the filar anemometer. I refer to the class of
 researches recently accentuated by the paper of S. P. Langleys
 on the work of the wind.
   * The law applies more accurately in proportion as thickness increases,
 and may be considered exact for diameters above 0.1 cm.

   If the velocity of air normally to the wire is registered,
three wires at right angles to each other would register the
respective velocities in three cardinal directions.         From this
the actual direction of the gust is at once obtainable as the
resultant of the three components.
   It is necessary, however, before a like deduction can be
accepted with confidence, to further elucidate Strouhal's law
with data referring to the oblique passage of a wire through
the air. For just what will occur under these circumstances
cannot certainly be foreseen. It is also desirable to obtain
accurate data for the effect of temperature on the phenomenon,
an inquiry which Strouhal only carried far enough to appre
hend that the pitch of a note, other things being equal, is
depressed with increasing temperature.                                -
   From a theoretical side, the subject has recently been
elucidated by Lord Kelvin *.
   In constructing my whirling table I aimed at quantitative
decision on these questions. I therefore made a whirling
machine one end of the axis of which was pivoted to the
ceiling of a high room, and the other end rigidly attached to
the spindle of an ordinary whirling table about a metre above
the floor. The crank-wheel was placed at some distance, so
as to allow two horizontal arms, about 1.4 metre long and
1.9 metre apart in the same vertical plane, to rotate freely.
Clamp-screws at the end of these arms carried the wire to be
tested, vertically stretched and 1.9 metre long.
   The whole framework was made of gas-pipe and snugly
screwed together. It was therefore possible to move the
horizontal arms so that the vertical planes through them
would subtend a given (small) angle, and the (elongated)
wire be rotated through the air obliquely to the line of motion.
Due care had to be taken not to carry the obliquity too far.
   The customary electric brushes were added at the axis of
the whirling arm, and thus the rotation could be timed by a
chronograph pendulum of the simple kind sketched in a pre
ceding papert. Contact brushes for other electric apparatus
(cf. § 3) were also supplied.
   On trial, however, the whirling arm at the higher speeds
developed a weakness. It was found to yield seriously under
the strain of rotation, so that I did not feel sure of its con
stants. I therefore abandoned further attempts at solving
the subsidiary questions just specified, for the present.

anemometer, least of all when its own song is drowned for
 the ear by the noises round about. I therefore proposed to
 myself in the first place to devise some means by which this
 air-tone could be conveyed to any distance without change of
 quality, and thereafter to endeavour to register this indication
 automatically. It is only with the first of these problems
 that the present paper is concerned. All attempts made at
the second, which is seriously difficult, have thus far been
failures*.
    The first condition appeared easy of accomplishment. It
seemed merely to be necessary to attach the wire to the plate
of a telephone in order to catch and transmit the sounds from
the roof to the office. However, telephonic devices over
which I laboured a long time failed to the last to give me any
result whatever.
    I then turned to the microphone, at first equally without
success, though finally an arrangement was developed which
behaved satisfactorily. I may in passing refer to certain of
the earlier forms of microphonic contact, some of which were
at times useful. The difficulty encountered arises from the
fact that a delicate microphonic contact is to be maintained          .
without breakage, at the end of a rapidly revolving and
necessarily vibrating whirling arm. Most devices give sounds
interrupted by a terrific racket at the receiver, which is very
trying to the ears. Apart from this the effect of centrifugal
force in varying the contact is to be counteracted, and the
air-resistance or the noises made by moving parts of the
microphone eliminated.
   In figure 1 aa is the revolving wire, attached at its upper
end to one arm of the whirling machine (not shown), and at
the lower end to the metallic plate or sounding-board b, at
the end of the lower arm of the machine. Near the bottom of
the wire a very delicate brass spring cd is soldered on at c,
carrying a short platinum stylus at d. A similar spring, ef,
attached at f to the sounding-board, carries at e a light pellicle
of carbon. The latter has been electroplated on one side
with copper, so that it can be soldered. The two springs are
so adjusted that the microphonic contact is just made at d, e,
and kept intact when e is slightly moved up and down, d
sliding on the flat face of e in this case. Moreover, as e is
relatively heavier than d, centrifugal force will tend to
straighten the springfe more than dc, and the contact is not

          §
   As f is insulated, the current of four Leclanché cells passes
through f, e, d, c, a, g, and the Bell telephone included in the
circuit. The sounds are very much increased (and unfortu
nately the thunder due to breaks of contact also) when the
primary of a transformer is placed in the circuit with the
telephone in the secondary, in the now well-known way”.
A great advantage is gained by filing the flat surface of e
with a smooth file, probably owing to the carbon powder
which lodges in the pores. Polishing the surface on a stone
is harmful. High tones seem to require firmer contacts than
low tones, and this state of things is brought about by the
action of centrifugal force as stated. The position of the
spring cd on the wire aa seems to be immaterial. I made
tests throughout 30 cm. without marked results. Nor is
much advantage gained from the shape or material of the
sounding-board. Curiously enough, the latching of d and e
often favoured the intonation of low sounds.            No rules can
be given for the bending of the springs, and the best contact
is usually the result of chance, and is obtained only after
many trials.
   It is with the above arrangement that I once noted a
peculiar phenomenon for which I have failed to find an

the Telephone,

86                         Prof. Carl Barus on
explanation. After having made a delicate contact I noticed
a low sonorous sound in the telephone, which continued with
undiminished intensity for fully five minutes. No spring could
have vibrated for this length of time, so that the acoustic
apparatus must have contained its own motor. The sound
ceased only when contact was broken, but on succeeding days
I could not reproduce it.
    4. A second microphonic contact with which there is
usually less racket than in the preceding case is shown in
figure 2 in plan.           The sounding wire is shown in cross
      Fig. 2.–Horizontal Spring Microphonic Contact on Air-Wire.

section at a ; h and k are two very delicate flat springs
attached to the wire a at its lower end by two insulating plates
 of hard rubber b, b’, and the insulated clamp screws c, c'. The
 free ends of these springs carry two small carbon pellicles, e
 and f, centrally perforated so as to hold the shouldered rod
 of graphite g loosely between them. The current of four
 Leclanché cells passes through a, h, e, g, f, k, 8 (a and 8 being
 the terminals) to the enclosed primary of the transformer, and
 thence back to the battery. The rod g may also fit into cavities
 in e and f, and be held in place by the very gentle clutch of
 the springs h and k ; or g may be replaced by a short wire of
 platinum. There is a groove in the middle of g to attach
 small weights to vary the contact; h and k are set radially,
 so as not to be influenced by centrifugal force.
     No effect was obtained when either of the microphonic
 contacts were placed on the sounding-board in which the
 lower end of the air-wire terminates. It seems essential,
 therefore, to tap the sound from the wire itself. A weighted
 sounding-board gives no novel results. A gridiron of wires
 produced air-tones which the ear appreciated with an in
 tensity proportional to the number of wires, but the effect
 in the telephone did not exceed that of a single wire. Strips
 of metal in place of the wires were also ineffectual, and it
 was difficult to keep the sharp edge turned in the direction
  of motion. In this case, too, the bulging of the central parts
  of the revolving filament proved to be a serious annoyance.

  A regular speed of the wire favours the occurrence of tones,
  particularly those which are awakened by resonance.
  .5. The beneficial effects obtained in § 3, as the result of
  filing, induced me to try a form of microphone in which the
 sensitive contacts are produced by a pulverulent conductor".
 After many attempts I finally succeeded in devising an
 arrangement which is far superior to the forms just described,
 inasmuch as the thunder is altogether absent, and other
 extraneous noises are excluded.           The sounds heard in the
 telephone are not loud, but clear and flute-like, and the range
 of pitch obtained is enormous. I passed almost from utter
 cessation of motion to the highest speed which I could give
 the whirling arm, and heard sounds quite inaudible to the
 unaided ear.
   . The annexed figure (3) shows the form which seemed to
 give the best results. Here aa and bb are two tin-plates about

interposed flat ring of hard rubber dd about 0.1 cm. thick or
less. An elastic band of soft rubber ee, is stretched quite
around the circumference and secures the plates by pressure
against the hard rubber ring. The upper plate is centrally
perforated, and a tube, g, about 1 cm. wide and 2 cm. lon
communicates with the perforation. A stylus c, is soldere
to the middle of the lower plate and passing axially through

the tube gends in a hook to which the air-wire h is attached.
The whole arrangement is held down horizontally on the
sounding-board by two flat clamps (not shown) or by a ring
£ from the plates a and b.          Carbon powder f, is finally
introduced into the tube g, not in too large quantity, and not
packed tightly. The current therefore passes into the upper
plate at a, then through f into the lower plate and out at 8, a
and 8 being the terminals.
   My first trials with finely pulverized graphite failed.    I
obtained the best results with gas-carbon ground in a mortar
and sifted in a way to keep the particles granular. The plates
must be clean and bright. The sounds usually start with a
creak, as if the powder must first be shaken loose; and
tapping frequently improves it. The plates must not be
pressed upon the powder, and the part of it around the stylus
is chiefly effective. In other forms I have quite filled up
the discoid cavity, but it was then frequently necessary to
pull up the upper plate with a spring.
   6. The following results were obtained with the micro
phone of $5. A series of wires of different diameters were
tested, and those larger than 0.05 cm. and smaller than
0.15 cm. were found best adapted for the purpose. Thicker
and thinner wires behaved peculiarly, as will presently be
seen. It has been stated that Strouhal's law requires a cor
rection for thin wires (<0.1 cm.). The following is a record
of some experiments:—
   (A) Copper wire, 0.072 cm. in diameter, 190 cm. long.—
Sounds were heard from g’ (faint), a' (faint), b', c" chromati
cally to c", to c", to e", which corresponded to the highest
speeds safely attainable in my whirling arm. The range of
frequency is thus from n=391 to above n=2610 indefinitely;
interpreted by Strouhal's law (since d=0.00072 met.), from
1:41 met./sec. to above 9:40 met./sec., or from about 3 miles
 er hour to 21 miles per hour, and above this indefinitely.
  he sound therefore begins with a calm or the zero of Beau
fort's scale. Strouhal's range began with frequency 840,
showing advantages in the microphonic method in detecting
low notes, some of which were indeed quite inaudible in
the air.
   I counted the revolutions of the whirling arm at the pitches
e', d', e", g”, c', e", g”, and compared the data so found
with Strouhal's formula, obtaining values which agreed well
enough to evidence the correctness of pitch in both cases.
   If the notes in question could be registered automatically,
the limit of accuracy would be subject only to the production
of beats, for the sounds vary continuously; but the ear can

                    the Filar Anemometer.                    89
hardly detect a smaller interval than a half tone, so that
speeds are not definable closer than about 6 per cent. This,
however, in view of the excessively variable character of a
gust of wind, is no serious disadvantage.
   (B) Copper wire, 0.126 cm. diameter, 190 cm. long.—
I heard all the chromatic intervals from c' to c" to c" to e”,
which corresponded to the limiting speed used. The frequency
is thus from n=261 to above n=1305, indefinitely; and the
speeds are from 1.7 met./sec. to above 8.5 met./sec., or from
3.8 miles per hour to above 19 miles per hour. Comparisons
with Strouhal's formula were made for g', b’, d", g”, c',
checking the pitch in the two cases. All the notes were clear
and strong. Strouhal's lower limit was here about n=600,
so that the microphone again detects inaudibly low notes.
   (C) Copper wire, 0.240 cm. diameter, 190 cm. long.—Faint
cello-like notes were heard, ranging from c to c' to c". The
pitch was checked for g, c’, and e'. The limit of speeds used
corresponded to c", above which the notes would, doubtless,
have come out more ringing. . The lower limit of frequency
was thus actually n=130, whereas Strouhal failed to hear
tones below n=500 about.      I did not enter into this case at
much length, because of the confusion produced by overtones.
Very regular rotation was needed to bring out the low
notes.
   (D) Brass wire, 0.020 cm. diameter, 190 cm. long.—The
behaviour of this wire was very peculiar. No sounds were
obtained except for tensely drawn wire, and I then heard the
exceedingly shrill notes b", c', c', d', d", e", f\,fty, ranging
therefore in frequency from n=3915 to n=6000 nearly. A
comparison of pitch with Strouhal's data was made for by and
d'. Curiously enough, Strouhal in the case of these thin wires
actually heard a whole range of low sounds from less than
n=2000 to about n=3000, and none above.            The fact that
I had to draw the wire tensely to affect the microphonic plates
 may be adduced in explanation. Apart from the range there
is no anomaly. It is probable that these wires are not
 massive enough to actuate the microphone.
    I have stated that my reasons for not going to higher
 speeds than about 21 miles per hour were merely the imper
 fections of my whirling arm. The last example : forcibly
 enough that excessively high pitches are by no means beyond
the scope of the microphone. If the note n=6000 had been
 heard from the first wire (d=0.072 cm.), it would actually
 mean a speed of about 22 met./sec. or 49 miles per hour.
 This is fairly a gale. If heard from the second wire
 (d=0.126 cm.), it would mean a speed of 87 miles per hour

or a hurricane; if heard from the third wire (d=0.240 cm.),
it would mean 160 miles per hour, a speed” which fortunately
transcends our storm nomenclature.
    7. At the close of these experiments I put up a couple of
these anemometers in my yard, but I have not yet obtained
sufficient material for discussion. The means of registry is to
bring the sounding wire on the whirling arm into unison
with the exposed anemometer, and to let the former wire
make its registry on the chronograph (§ 2).

        By Professor F. Y. EDGEwoRTH, M.A., D.C.L.t
     HE Probability-Curve may be described as an approxi
        mation to the law of frequency which governs the set
of values assumed by a function of numerous independently
varying small quantities; the function and the limits within
which the variables range being such that the function may
be regarded as approximately linear ; so that we have nearly
                Q=Qo-H Qi'q1 + Q5'92 +&c. + Q, Q,t;
where Q is the compound quantity under consideration;
q1, q2, &c. are the elementary quantities; Qi' is what Q
becomes when we differentiate with respect to qu and sub
stitute zero for each of the variables q1, q2, ...; Q,', Q5', ...
are similarly defined; Qo is what Q becomes when zero is
substituted in Q for each of the q's—an absolute term which
may usually be omitted.
   The symmetrical probability-curve is a first approximation
which is commonly written                    Ar2

   * There is a possible optical analogy to which I may allude in passing.
If in relation to speeds of the order of molecular velocities, the lumini
ferous aether may be considered as evidencing viscosity (following in the line
of a well-known hypothesis of Lord Kelvin), we might then expect a
molecule in its passage through aether to “sing” optically; in other words,
we might expect the aether to awake resonant vibrations in the molecule,
in the way in which the transverse harmonic vibrations of a wire are
evoked (§ 1 et seq.) when the air-tone is the fundamental.

where w, y, and c have each the same meaning as before; j is
the sum of the n quantities each of which is the mean cube
of error for one of the elements Q'q. . . I propose to give a
new proof of this formula; after first adverting to one or two
old proofs.
   I. The formula may be derived from an analysis which
Todhunter, following Poisson, has indicated. Todhunter
inquires what is the probability, P, of the value of a certain
quantity E occurring between c + m and c-m; E being =
"yiel + y2e2+..., where y1, y2, ... are constants, and each of
the quantities e1, e2, &c. fluctuates between given limits, a and
b, according to a law of frequency which is of the form
                             Qs
y=f(t); the value of       b   af'(a)da, being k, ; the correspond
ing value of mean second powers being k', of mean third
powers k,". For a first approximation to P, Todhunter finds
                           1       m  -(1-c-i-v)2

where l=>yk, and 2*=>ty”(k/-k:"). This coincides with
the first approximation given above * when ki, k2 each = 0,
and when the interval 2m is indefinitely small.              For then P
reduces to
                             1      –c.    2
                                = e 4x” X 2m :

where c” may be replaced by our a*, 2m by our Av, and
4k” = our c”.

     II. A second proof is derivable from the reasoning
by which Mr. E. L. De Forest in the ‘Analyst” (Iowa)
(vol. ix. p. 163) obtains for the asymmetrical probability
curve a certain formula which has been independently
discovered by Prof. Karl Pearsont. The expansion of this
formula in ascending powers of w will be found to coincide
with the expansion of our formula in ascending powers of a ;
provided that the second and higher powers of # may be
neglected—a condition which is employed by Mr. De Forest
in his proof $, and may readily be established||.

at a distance b, assumed with respective frequencies p and q. Then, the
mean square of error for a single element is pqb°, and the sum of these
means for all the elements, our k, is npqb°. Also the mean cube of error
for an element is +pq(p-q)b" (cf. Phil. Mag. vol. xxi. (1886) p. 320);

relatively to (p-q)-- Vpg, a quantity which vanishes when the element
is symmetrical, and is finite for all but infinite degrees of asymmetry.
By parity it will be found that j+k in general = a finite quantity + Vn;
so that it becomes small when n is sufficiently large.

   III. The new proof of the formula for the asymmetric
probability-curve, which is offered here, is analogous to that
which has been given by Mr. Morgan Crofton for the sym
metrical probability-curve*. The proof consists in deter
mining y, the required error-function, as the solution of a
system of partial differential equations which must be satisfied
by such a function. Put y=F(v, k, j) where w and j have the
same signification as before and k now = our c”—-2, (=Tod
hunter’s k” x 2). A first equation is obtained from the
condition that, if each of the constituent elements q1, q2 ...
be multiplied by a constant yf,
                       #=F(*, *, *).
Putting y= (1+o), where o is indefinitely small, expanding
and neglecting powers of o above the first, we have
                           dy         dy     .d

   Two more equations are given by the conditions that, if
y = F(x, k, j) is the law of frequency for the sum of the n
elements Qi' q1 + Q, q2 + ..., then the superposition of a new
element of the form Q',4', qn41 for which the mean-square-of
error (measured from its centre of gravity) is Ak, and the
mean-cube-of-error (similarly measured) is Aj, must obey the
law of frequency
                   y+Ay=F(w, k + Ak, j+ Aj).
    Let m=f(£) be the law of frequency for the new element.

tions; it is therefore proper to equate the coefficients of Ak in
the two expressions for y + Ay; and similarly the coefficients

descending series. This condition is fulfilled by our solution. For let
the mean square of error for each element be of the order #,  72

sum of these mean squares,-a2will be of the order unity. Accordingly if y,

   These and higher differentials may be regarded as being of the order
 unity for values of a between limits +1. Whence it follows that the
terms of the expansion in the text form a descending series; since
#. #. &c. are of the order unity, and Ak, Aj, &c., being integrals of
 £f(#), £f(£), &c. between limits separated by a very small interval, will
 in general form a descending series. The reasoning is not affected if we
 change the unit: e. g. suppose the range of the elements to be of the
 order unity; in which case £’ #: &c. will form a descending series,

 functions are restricted by equation (4) to the form

   This solution may be completed by observing that it satisfies
the fundamental equations (1) and (2) unconditionally, as well
as (3) when account is taken of condition (a).
   A further verification of the theory is afforded by showing
that if the sum of m independent elements obeys the law of
frequency y=F(x, ki,j), F having the form which has been
found, and ki and ji being the sum of the respective mean
squares of error and mean cubes of error for the m elements;
and likewise the sum of another set of m independent elements,
n in number, obeys the similarly defined law of frequency,
y = F(x, k2, j9); then the sum of (m+n) elements of which m

   A particularly interesting case of the asymmetrical proba
bility-curve is that in which an element has only two possible
values, say zero and unity, occurring with the respective
probabilities p and q—the case considered in a former number
of the Philosophical Magazine (vol. xxi. p. 318, 1886).
Observing that the mean square of error for this elementary
locus is pq*--qp”=pq(p+q)=pq, and the mean cube of
error = pg(p-q), we have by the general formula for the
curve representing the law of frequency for the sum of n such
elements, an expression in terms of those constants which,
mutatis mutandis, proves to be identical with the expression
which Todhunter, after Laplace, has obtained by a method
peculiar to the Binomialt.
   The general or multinomial probability-curve, involvin
(in addition to the centre of gravity) only two constants #
and j, may always be replaced by a binomial; through the
equations
                  mpgi"=k, npq(p-q)*=j,

  set of observations, there is given a third condition, namely,
  that ni must be greater than the distance between the greatest
  and least observations. But this inequation (coupled with
  the other equations) is not sufficient to determine n, i, and
 p-i-Q with any precision.
     Of course, whether a binomial or multinomial probability
 curve is to be adapted to a given set of observations, the set
 must fulfil the condition that j-i-k' should be a small fraction*.
 In fact the condition is frequently unfulfilled: for instance,
 in the statistics of the duration of American marriagest,
 where the observed j+k' forms a large integert. In such
 cases it may be inferred that the number of independent
 elements is too small (or their asymmetry too great) to gene
 rate a probability-curve.

 components of the earth’s magnetic force in series, and had
 deduced expressions, two of which give the magnetic potential
 on the surface of the earth in so £ as it depends on (1) in
 ternal, and (2) external forces. “The third series represents
 that part of the magnetic forces which cannot be expressed
 in terms of a potential, but must be due to electric currents
 traversing the earth's surface.” The author concludes that
 such currents amount on the average to about 0.1 ampere per
square kilometre.
    It appeared therefore desirable that this conclusion, drawn
 from # magnetic state of the earth as a whole, should be
 tested by means of those portions which have been most fully
studied.

   The test to be applied is, whether the line-integral of the
magnetic force taken round a re-entrant circuit on the
surface of the earth is or is not a vanishing quantity.
   The irregular form of the United Kingdom makes the appli
cation of this test more difficult than it would otherwise be ;
but as two detailed Surveys of Great Britain and Ireland have
been carried out by Dr. Thorpe and myself for the epochs
1886 and 1891 respectively, the data at our disposal are so
numerous that I thought it worth while to undertake the
inquiry.
   The actual work of calculation has been carried out almost
entirely by two of my students, Messrs. Kay and Whalley.
My best thanks are due to them for the care and skill they
have displayed.
   The facts on which the investigation is based are as follows.
    The first survey (1886) included 205 stations, at all of
which observations were made by Dr. Thorpe or myself.
   The true, and therefore irregular, isomagnetic curves were
drawn for the epoch January 1, 1886, and the terrestrial
 curves, from which the local disturbances were eliminated,
were also calculated for the same date (Phil. Trans, vol.
 clxxxi. A, 1890).
    The second survey included observations at 677 stations.
 These were made by ourselves, or, under our superintendence,
 by Messrs. Briscoe, Gray, and Watson. The results are
 about to be published by the Royal Society. The terrestrial
 isomagnetic curves were drawn for the epoch Jan. 1, 1891.
 The secular change having been carefully determined by
 special observations and methods, the values of the elements
 and the terrestrial curves obtained for the earlier date were
 reduced to Jan. 1, 1891.    Thus the whole of the 882 stations
 were available for drawing the true isomagnetics for the
 latter date.   The two sets of terrestrial curves obtained from
 the second survey and from the first survey reduced to the
 second epoch did not agree exactly, and the lines bisecting
 the intervals between them were taken as our final result for
 the terrestrial curves in 1891.
    The following sets of curves will be considered in this
  aper:—
    (1) The terrestrial isomagnetics obtained in the first sur
 vey for Jan. 1, 1886. These will be referred to as the 1886
 curves.
    (2) The same curves reduced by the secular change to
 Jan. 1, 1891. These will be called the first survey 1891 curves.
    (3) The terrestrial curves for 1891 deduced from the second
 survey. These will be called the second survey 1891 curves.

            Electric Currents in the United Kingdom.          101
   (4) The mean terrestrial curves for Jan. 1, 1891, deduced
from (2) and (3). These will be called the mean 1891 curves.
   (5) Lastly, the true isomagnetic curves deduced from the
results at all the 882 stations for the epoch Jan. 1, 1891.
These will be called the true 1891 curves.
                     (1) The 1886 Curves.
   The advantage of using the calculated terrestrial curves is
that they can be carried across the sea from England to
Ireland, or extended a few miles from the coast by extra
polation. The area included can therefore be made as large
as possible. On the other hand, the method of obtaining
these curves is such that the errors in their positions will
probably be greatest near the boundaries of the land area
over which the survey was carried. In order therefore that
such errors might affect different calculations as differently as
possible, it was determined to take two circuits, which should
have their greatest extensions N. and S., and E. and W.
respectively. They will be called the 2 and & circuits.
   The a circuit was bounded by long. 2° W., lat. 58° N.,
long. 7° W. and lat. 52° N.
   The 8 current was bounded by long. 1° W., lat. 55° N.,
long. 9° W. and lat. 52° N.
   In the published account of the 1886 survey (loc. cit.
p. 322), the values of the declination (8) and horizontal force
(H) are given for all points within the United Kingdom
defined by the intersection of whole degrees of latitude and
longitude.     From these the northerly components of the
force (H cos 8) were calculated for all such points on the lines
of latitude, and the westerly components (Hsin 8) for all
such points on the lines of longitude which bounded the
circuits.
   The method of calculating the line-integral of the force
may best be shown by an example, for which we may select
long. 2° W. between lat. 52° and 58°.
   Let C be the number of cm. in a degree of latitude,
and N the northerly component of the force. Assume that
N=N=2+ al’ + c, where a is a constant, l'=l-52, and v is a
small variable.
   Let W be the work done as the unit pole moves due North
from lat. 52° to lat. 58°.

The value of a was found from the values of the northerly

102       Prof. A. W. Rücker on Vertical Earth-Air
components at the points on latitudes 52° and 58° respectively.
The integral was calculated by quadrature, graphic methods
being employed.
   To give an idea of the relative magnitudes of the terms, I
append the following data :
      6N52 + 18a +|  6
                      and/= 1.00896–0-06864–0.00152
                          = 0.93880.
   The constant C was taken = 11119320 cm., so that the
work done in this part of the circuit is 1.04387 x 10" ergs.
   Treating the other parts of the circuit in the same way, the .
four quantities, the algebraical sum of which is the work done
in completing the circuit, are:
(1:04388+0.17082–1-00637-0.20902) x 10' =–6.9 x 10" ergs.
   Dividing by 4T, we find that the total current within the
circuit is –550 C.G.S. units, and, since the area is 2.13 x 10"
square kilometres, this amounts to -0.026 ampere per
square kilometre. The negative sign indicates that the
current flows downwards.
   A similar calculation carried out with respect to the 8
circuit, of which the greatest extension is East and West,
and the area is 1.77 x 10" square kilometres, indicates a
current of only -0.004 ampere per square kilometre.
              (2) The First Survey 1891 Curves.
   When the 1886 curves are reduced to the Epoch Jan. 1,
1891, by methods which are fully described in the account of
the later survey, the results obtained from the a and 8 cir
cuits are —0.045 and -0.030 ampere per square kilometre
respectively. It would at first sight appear as though the
fact that these values are larger than those calculated for
Jan. 1, 1886, might be due to errors introduced by the assumed
values of the secular change; but, as will immediately be
seen, they are not larger than those obtained by another
method, which this cause of error does not affect.
             (3) The Second Survey 1891 Curves.
   Treated in exactly the same way as the last, these give
values of about the same magnitude but of opposite signs;
viz. for the x circuit +0.046, and for the 8 circuit +0.020
ampere per square kilometre. Thus two different methods of
calculating the same quantity lead to very different results,
which point to the conclusion that the apparent effects of the

           Electric Currents in the United Kingdom.          103
hypothetical currents are due to small errors in the determi
nation of the exact positions of the lines.
  In the final calculation of the results of our survey, we have
taken the means of the positions of these two sets of lines as
the isomagnetic lines for 1891, hence the mean values of the
currents deduced from them by the
                    (4) Mean 1891 Curves
are +0.001 and -0.005 ampere per square kilometre for
the a and 8 circuits respectively.
                   (5) The True 1891 Curves.
   We have further checked the above results by means of the
true curves, taking two circuits—one (y) in England and
Scotland, and the other (8) in Ireland.
   The first of these was as follows:–
             Long. 1° E. from lat. 51° to lat 53°.
             Lat. 53° from long 1° E. to 1* W.
             Long 1° W. from lat. 53° to 55°.
             Lat. 55° from long. 1° W. to 3° W.
             Long. 3° W. from lat. 55° to 53°.
              Lat. 53° from long. 3° W, to 4° W.
              Long. 4° W. from lat. 53° to 51°.
              Lat. 51° from long. 4° W. to 1" E.
  The area is 1.054 x 10" square kilometres. The values
of the horizontal force and declination for every 10' of
latitude or longitude were read off from the maps on which
the values at the different stations were entered, and the
true isomagnetics drawn. This operation was performed
by Messrs. Kay and Whalley and checked by myself. The
northerly or westerly component of the force was then calcu
lated for each of these points, and the average value for each
short section was assumed to be equal to the mean of the
values at its initial and final points.
   No difficulty arose except at a point in Wales, where the
curves are closed, and where it was therefore necessary to
assume an average value for a section of the line on which a
maximum occurred.
   The result of the calculation gave a current of -0.008
ampere per square kilometre.
   The second circuit was taken in Ireland.      It traversed the
district of Antrim, in which there are violent local disturb
ances, and is interesting chiefly as showing to what extent
the result may be affected by such causes.

104        Prof. A. W. Rücker on Vertical Earth-Air
   The circuit was as follows:–
            Long. 6° 30' W. from lat. 52° to lat. 55°.
            Lat. 55° from long. 6° 30' to long. 8°.
           Long. 8° from lat. 55° to 54°.
            Lat. 54° from long 8° to 9°.
            Long. 9° from lat. 54° to lat. 52°.
            Lat. 52° from long 9° to long. 6° 30' W.
   The area is 48 x 10" square kilometres.
   The current is -0.046 ampere per square kilometre.
   The fact that these different circuits, including areas of
 very different magnitudes and situated in different parts of the
 United Kingdom, all give very small values for the hypo
thetical currents, is strong evidence that the smallness of the
calculated numbers is not due to the fact that large positive
and negative values mutually cancel each other. It is, for
instance, conceivable that the directions of the current-flow
might be opposed on what may be called the oceanic and
continental sides of the kingdom.
   If this were so, it is probable that circuits y and 8 would
have given results of opposite signs. By way of testing the
matter further, the current was calculated both from the 1886
and the 1891 lines for the relatively small area in the West
of Ireland bounded by latitudes 52° and 53°, and longitudes
9° and 10°.
   The results were :—
        for 1886, -0.04 ampere per square kilometre,
         ,, 1891, +0.11             33        33      35
   Hence the difference of direction which characterized the
currents deduced from the two surveys when applied to large
areas, also distinguishes, and in an exaggerated degree, the
results obtained from a small border district. It is therefore
evident that either the distribution of the vertical currents
has entirely altered in five years, or they are too small to be
detected by the method employed.
   The former of these hypotheses is negatived by the fact
that different calculations, based on the first and second
survey 1891 curves respectively, lead to discordant results for
the same date, and we are therefore compelled to fall back
upon the second alternative.
               Effect of the Ellipticity of the Earth.
   The question may fairly be raised whether, in dealing with
such minute quantities, the ellipticity of the earth ought not
to be taken into account.
   In answer to this, it may be stated that the work done

           Electric Currents in the United Kingdom.           105
when the unit pole traverses the a circuit was also calculated,
using the data as to the form of the earth given by Captain
Clarke and quoted by Prof. Everett (“C.G.S. System of
Units, ed. 1891, p. 71). The numerical values thus obtained
differed from those given above, but the differences between
them were of the same order.           Both methods of calculation
lead to opposite conclusions as to the directions of the hypo
thetical currents according as the 1886 or 1891 curves are
used; thus proving that the small outstanding uncertainties
as to the magnetic state of the United Kingdom are the cause
of the discrepancies, which are not reduced by using a closer
approximation to the form of the earth.
                               Conclusion.
   I can only conclude from these various figures that the
local magnetic surveys furnish no evidence of vertical elec
trical currents in the United Kingdom. The largest number
obtained from the larger circuits is less than half that which
Dr. Schmidt assigns as the mean value for the whole earth.
Different calculations lead to results of different signs for the
same quantity; and the data which would a priori be accepted
as the best give the smallest values.
   As far as the terrestrial curves are concerned, the final
results for the two surveys are embodied in the 1886 and the
mean 1891 curves respectively. The local irregularities in
the North of Ireland are so great that the calculations based
on the true isomagnetics in that country may be neglected
as compared with the probably much better results obtained
in Great Britain.
   Selecting, then, only the most trustworthy values, the
results may be summed up as follows in terms of amperes
per square kilometre.
                                       Circuit.
                         do               (3.        y
          1886.        –0.026           -0-004
          1891.        +0.001           –0.005
          1891.         ......      .    ......    -0-008
   From these figures we may conclude that there is not in
the United Kingdom a vertical current amounting on the
average to 0-1 ampere per square kilometre. They are not

 106           Mr. J. E. Moore on a Continuous and
inconsistent with the existence of a current of about a tenth
or a twentieth of that amount ; but on account both of the
smallness of the results and of the discrepancy between the
 values obtained for 1891 by two methods, we cannot assert
that such a current actually exists. The calculations taken
 by themselves do not disprove the hypothesis that electric
currents traverse the earth's surface, as we cannot argue from
the condition of a small portion of the globe to that of the
whole. The most that can be said is that no evidence in
favour of the existence of vertical currents can be drawn from
one district, which has been very minutely surveyed.
    P.S.—No reference to Dr. Schmidt's original paper was
#        in the short notice published in the Report of the
   ritish Association. I had therefore supposed that the latter
was a preliminary note. Professor Schuster has, however,
recently shown to me Dr. Schmidt's complete investigation,
and he has kindly calculated the current-density at latitudes
50° and 55° on the prime meridian from formulae given by
Dr. Schmidt. The result is upward currents and 0.20 to 0.15
ampere per square kilometre at lat. 50° and 55° respec
tively. The mean of these two numbers, viz. 0.175, is nearly
equal to Schmidt’s mean for the whole earth (0.17). It is
opposite in direction to and very much greater in magnitude
than any vertical current the existence of which is compatible
with the results of the Magnetic Survey.
XIII. A Continuous and Alternating Current Magnetic Curve
          Tracer. By JoHN ELY MooRE, M.E., E.E."
$ 1.   OF     the various methods that have been proposed and
              used for measuring the magnetic quality of iron,
or the losses of energy in iron due to magnetic reversals,
none have been successful as accurate means of measurement
that have not given simultaneous and independent readings
(capable of interpretation in absolute units) of the two quan
tities, magnetic induction or intensity of magnetization, and
the magnetizing force producing that induction.
    In a magnetic-curve tracer intended for accurate work, the
first condition to be fulfilled is that its indicating system
shall be capable of receiving and recording two simultaneous
and independent displacements, always at right angles to each
other, and always strictly proportional, respectively, to the
intensity of magnetization of the sample under test, and the
magnetizing force producing that magnetization.
                   * Communicated by—the Author.

          Alternating Current Magnetic Curve Tracer.        107
   This condition is not fulfilled by any magnetic-curve tracer,
so far as I know, that has ever been described.     The failure
being due to mutual interference (mechanically or magneti
cally) of the separate displacements of the indicating system,
to lack of proportionality of these two displacements to the
intensity of magnetization and magnetizing force respectively,
or to the inability to interpret these displacements in terms of
Absolute Units.
   In the following description of a continuous and alternating
current magnetic-curve tracer, the order observed will be the
actual order of development from the observation of the
underlying principle to the embodiment of this principle in
the present form of instrument.
   § 2. Several years ago (in the early part of 1892), while
making an investigation of the losses in iron magnetized by
alternating currents, the writer used, he believes for the first
time, an instrument which may be conveniently called an
alternating-current magnetometer. A small helix of fine
insulated wire was suspended bifilarly, so that the axis of the
helix was in the earth’s magnetic meridian. The lower ends
of the bifilar wires were put in connexion with the free ends
of the helix, and the upper ends of the bifilar wires were
arranged so that the suspended helix might be made to form
part of a circuit, composed of a few cells of secondary battery,
a regulating resistance, and a revolving contact-maker carried
on the shaft of an alternating-current generator. It is clear
that when the armature of the alternating-current generator
was set in rotation at a constant angular velocity, an inter
mittent current of constant mean intensity and of definite
£       and phase relation was passed through the suspended
  elix. It was observed, on bringing a long rod magnetized
by an alternating current from the generator whose armature
£ carried the contact-maker, that the suspended helix was
deflected from its position of rest through a definite angle for
any definite position of the rod; and that for any fixed
position of the rod, by varying the point in the revolution of
the armature-shaft at which the intermittent current was
made through the suspended helix, a series of deflexions of
the suspended helix to the right and left of the zero position
was obtained. Thus, by means of the suspended helix carry
ing an intermittent current of proper periodic time and of
constant mean intensity we are enabled to measure directly
the magnetic state of the iron at any definite point of the
alternating-current waves. The alternating-current mag
netometer method, employed to measure the losses in iron
magnetized by alternating currents, has been described in the

108          Mr. J. E. Moore on a Continuous and
London ‘Electrician’ of Feb. 3, 1893, and also in the New
York “Electrical World” of Feb. 4, 1893, and need not be
entered into here.
   Although the alternating-current magnetometer can plainly
be used equally well for continuous and alternating currents
of any frequency, yet as a method of measuring losses in iron
under widely varying conditions of magnetization and pe
riodicity it necessitates the separate observation of a compa
 ratively large number of quantities, the subsequent calibration
of these quantities, and finally the graphical representation of
them, before the desired estimation of losses can be made.
    § 3. It seemed desirable, therefore, in order to facilitate the
investigation of the nature and amount of the losses in iron,
carried through magnetic cycles varying widely in both am
plitude and in time, to devise an instrument that would, first,
be independent in its action of the time required to complete
the magnetic cycles; second, be accurate and reliable, and
give indications capable of interpretation in Absolute Units;
third, that would reduce the number of observations required
to obtain the losses to an absolute minimum ; fourth, that
 would read directly the quantities to be measured; and fifth,
that would allow measurements to be made in the least pos
sible time.
    It is attempted to fulfil these conditions in the present
instrument in the following way:—A system of two small
helices is so suspended and mechanically connected that any
angular displacement about a vertical axis, given the one, is
imparted to the other also, while one of the two helices
may receive independent angular displacements about a hori
zontal axis besides. The arrangement and connexions of the
magnetometer system will be immediately seen from the
accompanying diagram (fig. 1). If the losses in iron mag
 netized by an alternating current are to be measured, an
intermittent current of the proper periodic time (secured, as
previously indicated, by a revolving contact-maker on the shaft
of the alternating-current generator) is passed through the
helices of the suspended magnetometer system in series,
making of the small helices during the very short time the
current is flowing in them virtual magnets. If now the
sample to be tested, in the form of a long rod supplied with
the proper magnetizing coil, be adjusted so that its axis is
vertical and lies in the vertical axis of suspension of the
magnetometer system, and it be magnetized by an alternating
current from the generator whose armature-shaft carries the
revolving contact-maker, only that one of the magnetometer
helices which is capable of displacement about a horizontal

torsion-wire, the angular displacements of the helix may be
taken proportional in magnitude to the product of the mag
netic moments of the long rod and the helix, at the point in
the alternating current waves at which the helix becomes a
magnet. As will be seen on referring to curve (a), fig. 2,

by keeping the mean strength of the intermittent current

110           Mr. J. E. Moore on a Continuous and
magnetic moments of the sample, at the points in the alter
nating-current waves at which the instantaneous direct current
#' in the magnetometer system. Since the centre of the
 -magnetometer helix lies in the prolongation of the axis of
the long rod, and the magnetic field due to the long rod is
symmetrical about its axis, the deflecting force exerted on the
I-magnetometer helix by the long rod is independent of the
angular position of the    i:               helix about the ver
tical axis of suspension of the magnetometer system. If, then,
we adjust a coil of wire so that its centre is in a horizontal
line (normal to its plane) passing through the centre of, and
perpendicular to that magnetometer helix capable of displace
ment about a vertical axis only (called hereafter the H-mag
netometer helix),and pass through this coil the same alter
nating current that magnetizes the sample, the H-coil will
receive a horizontal angular displacement, and through the
mechanical connexions of the parts of the moveable system it
will carry with it through the same horizontal angle the
I-magnetometer helix. This horizontal displacement being
made against the restoring couple of the fine silver wire
bifilar suspension of the system, is equilibrated partly by the
restoring couple of the bifilar suspension proper (which varies
as the sine of the angle of displacement), and partly by the
torsion of the bifilar wires (which varies directly as the angle
of displacement). Hence for small horizontal angular de
flexions the angular displacement may be taken proportional
to the product of the magnetic moments of the coil carrying
the magnetizing current and the H-magnetometer helix, at
the point in the alternating current waves at which the helix
becomes a magnet. But the magnetic moment of the H-mag
netometer helix may be kept constant throughout an experi
ment; hence, as will be seen from curve (b), fig. 2, the
horizontal angular displacements may be taken proportional
to the magnetic action, or the magnetizing force of the cur
rent, at the points in the alternating-current waves at which
the instantaneous direct current passes through the magneto
meter helices.
   If it is desired to measure the losses of energy in iron
magnetized by continuous currents, or the “static ’’ losses of
iron, plainly the only change of arrangement in the curve
tracer is to substitute for the intermittent current through
the magnetometer system a direct current of the same mean
intensity, to replace the source of alternating current by a
continuous-current source, and provide a regulating resistance
for varying the continuous magnetizing current from zero to
the maximum value required.

          Alternating Current Magnetic Curve Tracer.         111
   In either case, by means of one of the mirrors attached to the
I-magnetometer helix, we are enabled to record a displace
ment, the rectangular components to which are independent
of each other, and accurately proportional to the intensity of
magnetization of the sample and the magnetizing force pro
£g       that magnetization, at any point in the magnetic
cycle.
   Thus we have, in this magnetometer system of two simple
helices connected as described, the fulfilment of all the essen
tial conditions for an instrument measuring the dissipation of
energy in either “static ’’ magnetic cycles, or in “periodic”
magnetic cycles of any frequency.

now used in the     £ Observatory             of Princeton Uni
versity.   It consists, first, of a solid wooden base of circular
shape, provided with levelling-screws. From this base arise
four vulcanite pillars, which support a vulcanite disk, having

112          Mr. J. E. Moore on a Continuous and
a circular opening at its centre. The cover of the instrument
rests in a groove in the wooden base, fitting closely about the
circular disk at its top, and is provided with a plane glass
window for the admission of a beam of light. Placed dia
metrically opposite, on the upper surface of the vulcanite disk,
are two coils of a few turns of stout wire, hereafter to be
called the H-deflecting coils. From the centre of this same
disk rises a glass cylinder, covered at its upper end by a
second vulcanite disk, to which is attached the suspension
tube. The suspension-tube carries at its upper end a torsion
head, provided with binding-posts and adjusting devices for
regulating the bifilar wires. From this torsion-head is sus
pended, by means of the silver bifilar wires, the moveable
magnetometer system. The upper or H-magnetometer helix is
held by a hard rubber clamp, serving at the same time as a
terminal block for the lower ends of the bifilar wires.    To the
lower part of this clamp is fastened a hard rubber shaft, sup
porting centrally, at its lower end, a horizontal hard rubber
bar, to the extremities of which are fastened (by means of
suitable adjusting devices) the horizontal unifilar torsion-wires
carrying the I-magnetometer helix.
   Each of the magnetometer helices having the same number
of turns of wire will, when so connected as to develop opposite
polarities in the ends lying in the same direction, form an
astatic combination for horizontal deflexions.    If it should be
necessary to make the vertical deflexions also independent of
the earth’s magnetic field, one can easily arrange a flat coil
of wire with its centre in the vertical axis of suspension of
the moveable system, and its plane horizontal, and pass through
the coil such an electric current as will just equal and neutra
lize, in its magnetic effect, the vertical component of the
earth’s magnetic field at the centre of the I-magnetometer
helix.
   § 5. In using the instrument, it should be set up on some
firm support   £           though not necessarily, so that the
planes of the H-deflecting coils are parallel to the earth's
magnetic meridian) and properly levelled until the suspended
system is perfectly free, and hangs centrally in the instru
ment. The length of the bifilar wires should then be adjusted
until the centre of the H-magnetometer helix lies in a hori
zontal line passing through the centre of the H-deflecting
coils on either side of the instrument. The stress on the
bifilar wires should then be equalized, by means of the adjust
ing devices at either end of the horizontal bar carrying the
I-magnetometer helix, the horizontal torsion-wires should be
regulated in length, so that the centre of gravity of the

 I-magnetometer helix lies in the vertical axis of the suspended
 system, and the torsion adjusted in the wires until the axis of
 the helix is horizontal.   The torsion-head of the instrument
 is then turned until the axes of the magnetometer helices are
 parallel to the planes of the H-deflecting coils.
    Upon one of the mirrors, carried by the I-magnetometer
 helix, is projected a beam of light from some fixed source, which
 after reflection is received upon a screen placed normally to
the helices in their undisturbed position. By means of cross
hairs placed in the path of the incident beam of light, one is
enabled to mark on the screen the initial or zero position of
the magnetometer system, and to measure any subsequent
angular displacement of either or both of the magnetometer
helices.                                                           -
    The sample to be tested (in the form of a long rod supplied
with the proper magnetizing coil) should be placed with its
axis in the vertical line of suspension of the magnetometer
system. This can be accomplished most conveniently by
clamping the sample and its magnetizing coil below the
support of the instrument. The sample and its magnetizing
coil should then be adjusted vertically, until the magnetic
action of the sample, for maximum intensity of magnetization,
produces the desired maximum vertical deflexion of the I
magnetometer helix. A compensating coil of a few turns of
wire should then be adjusted so as to neutralize, at the I
magnetometer helix, the magnetic action of the magnetizing
coil about the sample.
    The accuracy of the adjustments for horizontal displace
ments can be tested by making the magnetometer helices
active, by means of a constant current of one or two tenths of
an ampere, and reversing an independent direct current
through the H-deflecting coils. This should give the mag
netometer system equal horizontal displacements on either
side of the zero position, and, for various current-strengths,
the magnitude of these deflexions should be proportional to
the respective currents.
   The accuracy of the adjustments for vertical displacements
depends upon the setting of the sample to be tested (with its
magnetizing coil) and the balancing coil. This can be tested
before beginning an experiment by placing the magnetizing
coil (with the sample removed) in the position it will occupy
during an experiment, and reversing continuous currents of
various strengths through it. There should be no horizontal
displacements, and the vertical displacements, on either side
of the zero position, should be proportional to the respective
magnetic forces due to the magnetizing coil, at the

114          Mr. J. E. Moore on a Continuous and
netometer helix. The compensating coil should be so con
nected in series with the magnetizing coil as to give an
opposing magnetic effect at the 1-magnetometer helix, and by
keeping its plane horizontal, and its centre in the vertical
line of suspension of the magnetometer system, be adjusted in
position until the joint magnetic effect of the two coils at the
I-magnetometer helix is zero, for all strengths of current
through them.
   § 6. The instrument, having thus been set up and adjusted
and the adjustments tested, is ready to be used for the
measurement of energy-losses in iron magnetized by either
direct or alternating currents. If the losses in iron magne
tized by continuous currents are to be measured, a current of
two-tenths of an ampere from some independent battery (a
single cell of storage-battery answers very well) is passed
through the helices of the magnetometer system, and kept.
constant throughout an experiment. The intersection of the
cross-hairs in the beam of light reflected upon the recording
screen by one of the mirrors carried by the I-magnetometer
helix, is taken as the centre of a system of vertical-horizontal
rectangular coordinates. The sample is then placed in the
magnetizing coil, which, after being properly connected in
series with the compensating coil, the H-deflecting coils of
the instrument, a regulating resistance, and a source of con
tinuous current, has the magnetizing current through it
increased from zero to the maximum value required to produce
the desired maximum degree of magnetization, reduced to
zero, reversed, the same operation performed in the opposite
sense, and the cycle completed by returning finally to the first
maximum. The point of intersection of the cross-hairs on the
screen will be displaced for every different value of the mag
netizing current, a distance from each of the coordinate axes
previously drawn, proportional respectively to the magne
tizing force acting on the sample and the intensity of
magnetization of the sample. Hence by marking down on
the screen the point of intersection of the cross-hairs in the
reflected beam of light, for any desired number of values of
the magnetizing current throughout the cycle of magnetiza
tion, we have an accurate outline of the magnetization curve
for the sample, or, as it is frequently called, the “hysteresis”
curve. By properly varying the magnetizing current, loops
can be traced to any part of the hysteresis curve, or a com
plete set of graded cycles obtained without removing the
sample.
   In measuring the losses in iron magnetized by an alter
nating current, an intermittent current of a mean value of

          Alternating Current Magnetic Curve Tracer.        115
two-tenths of an ampere (obtained by means of a revolving
contact-maker on the shaft of the alternating-current generator
supplying the alternating magnetizing current) is passed
through the magnetometer helices, and kept accurately con
stant throughout an entire experiment. For the continuous
magnetizing current is substituted an alternating current,
adjusted to such a mean value as will give the desired
maximum intensity of magnetization. As has been shown,
by varying the point in the revolution of the armature-shaft
at which contact is made, or current passes in the magneto
meter helices, different deflexions will be obtained, the
rectangular components to which are strictly proportional to
the magnetizing force, and the intensity of magnetization
respectively, at the points in the alternating-current waves at
which the instantaneous direct current passes through the
magnetometer helices. Hence by varying the point of con
tact on the revolving contact-maker, through a circular angle
corresponding to 360 degrees of phase in the alternating
current waves, we have, as in the case of “static” cycles, the
successive positions on the screen of the intersection of the
cross-hairs in the reflected beam of light, marking points in
the outline of the energy-loss curve.
   § 7. In calibrating the instrument for either “static” or
“periodic” cycles, the current through the magnetometer
helices is kept the same in kind and magnitude as during the
experiment. The sample is removed from the magnetizing
coil, and an accurately measured current sent through either
the magnetizing coil or the compensating coil, alone. The
deflexion is marked down on the vertical axis of coordinates.
Then an accurately measured current is sent through the H
deflecting coils alone, and the resulting deflexion marked
down on the horizontal axis of coordinates.
   By knowing the distance of the resultant magnetic distri
bution, or magnetic poles, from the I-magnetometer helix,
we can calculate, by well-known magnetometer laws, the value
of the magnetic force at the centre of the I-magnetometer helix,
due to the long rod, in terms of the distance of the poles
from the centre of the helix, the cross section of the sample,
and the intensity of magnetization of the sample. It will be
plain, by considering the relative position of the long rod and
1-magnetometer coil, that this force,

 R' the distance from the centre of the I-magnetometer helix

    By knowing the distance of the compensating coil during
 calibration from the I-magnetometer helix, its number of
 turns, mean radius, and the current through it, we are enabled
 to calculate its magnetic force at the I-magnetometer helix.
 If the calibrating coil is a flat coil of only a few turns of wire
 (as is always most convenient), then, as is well known, its
 magnetic force at the I-magnetometer helix is expressed by:

 deflexion in the course of an experiment, and D. the vertical
 deflexion during calibration, we have, since the current in
the magnetometer system has been kept constant through the
 whole experiment, the following relation —

We are thus enabled to find the value of the intensity of
magnetization of the sample in Absolute Units for any point
on the entire curve of magnetization.
   Knowing the number of turns, the length, and the current
flowing in the magnetizing coil surrounding the sample,
we can at once calculate in Absolute Units the magnetizing
force of the coil on the sample. In the calibration of the
horizontal deflexions, we know the current flowing in the H
deflecting coils and the displacement it gives along the
horizontal axis. We calculate the magnetizing force of the

           Dissociation Degree of some Electrolytes at 0°.              117
  magnetizing coil about the sample for that current, and by
  direct proportion between horizontal displacement in cali
  bration, and the horizontal displacement of any point on the
  curve, we obtain in Absolute Units the magnetic force corre
  sponding to any point on the curve. Having thus calibrated
  the curves of either continuous or alternating current-mag
  netic cycles in Absolute Units, the energy losses, |IdH, may be
  obtained by taking the area of the curves in the usual way.
     Although this description has only been concerned with
  the curve-tracer as a means of measuring the magnetic quality
  of, and the energy losses in iron and other metals, when
  carried through magnetic cycles, it plainly lends itself to such
  operations as direct tracing of alternating-current and elec
  tromotive-force curves, the investigation of the nature and
  amount of iron losses in alternating-current transformers, the
  measurement of the power in any electrical circuit, &c.

                           By R. W. WooD*.
 TH: values obtained by the lowering of theelectrolytes  freezing-point
        for the dissociation-degree of dissolved                       are
 always a little smaller than those calculated from the electrical
 conductivity.
    Meyer Wildermann f has recently lessened the difference
 by the use of a more accurate method for the freezing-point
 determinations, and has expressed the opinion that the cause
 of the discrepancies lay in the fact that the electrical con
 ductivities have been determined at a higher temperature
 (18°-25°).
    At Prof. Jahn’s suggestion, I have determined the conduc
 tivity of certain Salts and Acids in solutions of varying
concentration at 0°, for the purpose of reckoning the Dis
sociation-degree at this temperature, and the results indicate
that, in dilute solutions, the dissociation-degree is practically
independent of the temperature.
    The determinations were made according to the Kohlrausch
method, and the conductivity of the distilled water used in
the experiments was determined at different temperatures
and taken into account.

  XV. The Duration of the Flash of Exploding Oxyhydrogen.
                         By R. W. Woodf.                    -
    OME time ago, in endeavouring to photograph the ex
       plosion-wave, if it may be so termed, of electrolytic gas
by means of the electric spark, I was struck with the fact that
the duration of the flash was exceedingly small. In many
cases I found that the glass bulbs, which were thinner than
paper, were photographed         '   the light of the incandescent
gas within before the walls had given way. The striations
on the glass were sharp and the outlines of the bulb were
perfectly distinct, the interior being quite filled with a bright
glow.
   I have recently repeated and enlarged somewhat on these
£" with                a view to determine the duration of the
flash.
   The bulbs were blown very thin, with a quill-like neck at
each end. They were filled with a mixture of oxygen and
hydrogen by means of an electrolytic apparatus, and two
copper wires were then sealed in with wax, with a gap of
perhaps half a millimetre between them.
    A pendulum, made by hanging a heavy lead ball on a fine
wire, was hung in front of the bulb, the copper wires of which
were connected with the terminals of a small inductorium.
    From the bottom of the ball projected a pin which came in
contact with a slip of platinum foil mounted edgewise before
the bulb, and the pendulum and foil were put in circuit with
the primary coil of the inductorium. This arrangement
insured the explosion of the bulb at the moment when the
pendulum passed its point of equilibrium, and by calculating
the velocity of the pin's head and measuring the amount of
blur of the photographic image the duration of the flash
could be approximately determined. The camera, provided
with a Zeiss lens of large aperture, was placed near enough

to give an image of natural size in order to simplify the
measurements.
   With a velocity of 3 metres a second the image of the
round pinhead was as sharp as if stationary; but on raising
the pendulum to a height sufficient to give it a velocity of
6 metres a second, a blur amounting to a trifle less than
.5 millim. was observed. The pendulum-point moving 6000
millim. in a second would traverse a distance of 5 millim. in
        1, of a second, consequently the duration of1the flash is
the 1, 2000

                   -

                                                          SeC.
    Of course the total duration of the flash depends on the
 speed of propagation of the explosion in the mixture, as well
 as on the actual duration of the flash of each exploding
 element; Le Chatelier found that this velocity was about
 1000 metres a second.         -                                  -
    The bulbs being about 8 centim. in diameter, and the point
 of ignition in the centre, the explosion would reach the walls
 in #55 of a second. This being about one half of the total
 duration, we may suppose it to be about the duration of the
 flash of any small element.

122      Duration of Flash of Exploding Oxyhydrogen.
   In some cases the luminous gas in the photograph was
confined within the walls of the bulb, while in other cases a
cloud or outburst was noticed at some particular spot outside
the wall. The image of the pendulum wire in one case came
in front of this cloud and was found to be much more blurred
than the pin, indicating that the light of one of these out
bursts lasts longer than that of the mixture within. This
may be due to an admixture of outside air, which increases
the time of combustion.
   I find that the light of these exploding bulbs is quite suit
able for photographing small objects in rapid motion such as
water-jets; and in some cases may be preferable to the spark,
the electrostatic strain just before the flash tending to deform
the jet. In one of the photographs, where an outburst has
taken place directly against the jet, there are curved traces
around the drops, apparently where the burning gases are
rushing around them.
   For the purpose of photographing jets, I think that a better
device than the thin bulb would be a shallow, rectangular tin
tray with a highly polished bottom, such as a box cover.
This could be covered with a thin film of mica fastened on
with wax, and the vessel filled through two small tubes. The
reflecting back would increase the amount of light without
increasing the depth of the exploding layer, which of course
tends to prolong the flash.
   Mote.—On receiving the proof of the above paper I was
much surprised to find that the photograph, which I had
enclosed as a curiosity with the MS., had been reproduced.
I had no idea that the picture would be considered of interest
enough to warrant reproduction, or I should have taken
pains to secure a better one. My best negative came to
grief, and the picture reproduced is the first attempt at
securing a water-jet by the flash, taken merely to ascertain
whether the method was feasible.        Much of the detail has
been lost in reproduction, but the upper parts of the jet show
well. No especial pains were taken to secure uniform jets,
though the right-hand one is fairly good. An oblate spheroid,

       XVI. A very Simple and Accurate Cathetometer.
                   By F. L. O. WADsworTH".
     F the various standard physical instruments which are
       usually found in a student's laboratory, the cathetometer
may justly be considered as one of the most instructive and
valuable, both because of the many principles involved in its
adjustment, and because of the number of measurements
which may be made with it. Unfortunately, good catheto
meters (and it is never good policy to use poor instruments
for the purposes of instruction) are so expensive, as made at
present, that one or at most two are all that one laboratory
can afford. For this reason it may perhaps be of interest to
briefly describe a form of cathetometer recently designed by
the writer which costs less than one-tenth as much as the
best German or English instruments, but which has shown
itself in use to be quite as accurate as and in some respects
even more convenient of manipulation than the latter.
   In the new arrangement, the general method of comparison
now employed in nearly all of the most accurate linear
measurements is followed: i.e., the images of the observed
points and of the lines on a standard bar, placed parallel with
the length to be measured, are brought in succession into the
field of an observing telescope or microscope, and their
relative position determined by means of a micrometer or
some equivalent arrangement. In previous forms of catheto
meter, this has been done by rotating the observing-telescope
itself on a long heavy-vertical axis; in the new form, all of these
heavy rotating parts are dispensed with, the observing-tele
 scope is fixed in position and the images of the object and
 scale brought successively into the field by means of a light
silvered mirror mounted on a vertical axis just in front of the
objective. A sensitive level attached to the upper end of this
axis enables the latter to be set accurately vertical, this adjust
 ment being made as in an ordinary cathetometer.
    The complete arrangement is shown in elevation in fig. 1
and in plan in fig. 2. A, fig. 1, is the mirror frame and B is
the level, mounted at the lower and upper end respectively of
 the short, conical axis C. The boss D, in which this axis turns,
 is attached by means of a geometrical clamp at E to a split
 cap which slips over the end of the observing-telescope T and
 is clamped thereon by means of the screw F. This much

meter, the telescope-mounting itself-consisting of the two L
shaped bars K, G and the adjusting screws H, I—being merely
 accessory to the convenient adjustment of the axis C to verti
 cality. An ordinary open V-clamp M attached to the lower
 bar G enables the whole arrangement to be clamped to any
 convenient support; such, for example, as the upright of a
 heavy retort-stand, or an iron wall-bracket or even a stiff well- |
 secured water- or gas-pipe on the wall of the laboratory. If a    |

   In the use of the instrument, the mirror is first adjusted
until it is parallel to the axis of rotation C and perpendicular

126                Mr. F. L. O. Wadsworth on a
to the optical axis of the telescope T. These two adjust
ments are made simultaneously in the same manner as
described in a previous article"; i.e. by bringing the reflected
image of the cross-wires into coincidence with the wires
themselves, revolving the mirror through 180° and correcting
one-half of the resulting vertical displacement by means of the
adjusting screws b, b, b, against the heads of which the mirror
rests, and the other half by means of the screwe, which forms
part of the geometrical clamp E. . The level is then adjusted
until it is perpendicular to the axis of rotation by means of
the screws f, f, in the usual manner.
    Lastly, the telescope is set at the height of the object to be
measured and clamped in position, and the axis C adjusted to
verticality by the screws I and H (or the levelling-screws in
the base of this support), the level being placed first parallel
to the telescope-tube and then at right angles to it f. The first
of these adjustments is made once for all; the second is tested
at the beginning of each day’s work; and the third only is
necessary at each setting of the telescope.
   It is important to notice that a small error in levelling has
the same effect in this new form as in the ordinary form; i.e.
the error is not doubled by reflexion from the mirror, because
the telescope and the latter move together, so far as any move
ment in a vertical plane is concerned. Let us consider the
effect of a small error in levelling, first, in the vertical plane
parallel to the axis of the telescope; second, in the vertical
plane at right angles to that axis. Let 6 be the angle which
the line of sight to the object makes with the first plane con
sidered, and a the angle which the axis of rotation c makes
with the vertical in that plane. Then, if e denote the difference
in reading produced by this inclination from the vertical, and
r the distance of the     £        from the axis of rotation, we have
evidently

   t The mounting shown in figs. 1 and 2 is especially convenient in per
forming this last operation, as the screws H, I, and the third pivot-point
bear respectively in a slot, plane, and conical hole at the three vertices of
a right-angled triangle, and the motion of either screw, therefore, affects
the position of the axis C only in the vertical plane passing through that
screw and the pivot-point.                                         -

In the new form of instrument the best position for the object
and the comparison scale is about 90° from the axis of the
telescope, or in the direction o, fig. 2. If we suppose the
object and scale 15° from one another, and symmetrically
placed on the two sides of the 90° position, we have for 6 and
6, respectively 90°-- 7" or 974° and 823°. Hence
-                    A = 0:26 r sin ar: }rx . . . . . (3)
and                  A'= 0. .      . . .     . . . . .     .  (4)
   The general equations (1) and (2) show that care in
levelling is only necessary in the vertical plane perpendicular
to the line of sight; i. e. in the new form the plane parallel to
the axis of the telescope ; in the usual form the plane at
right angles to that aris. Hence if the greatest accuracy is
to be attained with the ordinary cathetometer, the usual tele
scope level should be placed at right angles to its customary
position (or perhaps, better still, a second level added in that
position), so as to at once call attention to any error of
adjustment in that plane. It is strange that this rather
important fact should have been overlooked in previous
designs.
   The actual magnitude of the error in measurement, due to
an error in levelling, is, however, always small, unless either
the distance of the object from the telescope is considerable,
or the difference between the angles 6 and 61 is larger than
60°. If x=5" and 6–61=15° as in (3), the error, A, for
objects distant #M. from the axis of rotation, would be about
-003 millim., or about the limit of accuracy of setting with
the best cathetometers under the best conditions.
   With a good level sensitive to 5" per division (the best
cathetometer levels are from two to three times as sensitive
as this), there is no difficulty in setting by reversal to within
less than } div. or 1", reducing the error under the above
conditions to about Yo'où millim.
   This shows that we may very considerably increase the
angular difference 6-61, without introducing any appreciable
error. For when this difference is 60° the value of A is only
twice the above values or about "001 millim. in the last case,

 128                  Mr. F. L. O. Wadsworth on a
 a quantity quite negligible in comparison with the errors of
 setting. This indicates another method of using this new
 form of instrument to good advantage; i.e., the method of
 superposition of object and comparison scale. To accomplish
 this, the mirror A is half silvered and the scale is viewed
 directly through the unsilvered half in the direction o' (see
 fig. 4), the object being at the same time seen by reflexion
 from the silvered half in the direction o’”.              In this case we
 may make the measurement either by determining the distance
 between the image of the point and the image of the nearest
 millim. division on the scale with an ordinary form of
 micrometer; or better, by bringing these two images into
 coincidence by means of a £ double micrometer, an
 opthalmometer or a parallel-plate micrometer. The second
 method of coincidence has the decided advantages both of
 greater rapidity, only one setting and reading being necessary
 instead of two, and of greater accuracy for the same reason,
since any error, due to a change in position of any part of
the apparatus in the interval between two settings, is thus
avoided. This last advantage fully balances the disadvantage
of the greater effect of a given error of levelling on account
 of the greater angular distance between scale and object.
 One additional cause of error is introduced, i.e., that due to
a want of parallelism between the mirror A and the axis of
rotation C.; but since this should not exceed a fraction of
a second, if the first adjustment has been properly made, its
effect is negligible.
    Of the various instrumental means for obtaining coincidence
perhaps the simplest and most convenient, as well as one of
the most accurate, is the parallel-plate micrometer first
invented by Clausen, and quite recently reinvented and much
improved by Poynting f, who was the first to adopt it for
cathetometric measurements. Figs. 4 and 5 show in plan
and elevation a form of this micrometer modified slightly from
that described by Poynting, to better adapt it to this particular
instrument. It consists simply of a plate of plane-parallel
glass, P, rotating on an axis C at right angles to the axis C,
   * The mirror should be half silvered horizontally, i.e. the line of
separation of the silvered from the unsilvered portion should be parallel
to the axis of rotation, both because the maximum resolution is required
in a vertical direction and because, as will be seen later, this management
is the better adapted to the use of certain forms of micrometer.

convergent for low values of b, it is on the whole better to

value of 8 is only 0.2 per cent. of f(p), and since the maxi
mum shifting of the image need never exceed 1 millim. (if
comparison is made on a millim. scale), the corresponding
correction to the tangent value is only    #    millim. and may
be disregarded. In this case we may read off the value of A
directly on a straight scale s s by means of a pointer, u, which
consists of a thin plate of glass or mica on which is ruled a
fine radial line. The distance ro from o, to the point of inter
section of this line with the longitudinal line ss on the scale,
equals c'o tang b, and hence is directly proportional to A. If
we make c'o equal to 17#t in millim., then each millim. on
the scale s s corresponds to a shifting of the image through
s', millim. For an angle of 30° A+ t, hence for a shifting
of 1 millim. corresponding to this angle, the plate P must be
5 millim. thick, and the distance c’o therefore about 89 millim.

hardly practicable on account of mechanical difficulties. We
may, however, obtain the desired result very much more
simply. An inspection of the values of 8 in Table I. will
show that they are roughly proportional to tang (b. If we
draw a line no (fig. 6), inclined at a small angle a, in each
direction from 0, to the longitudinal line on the scale ss, and
read in each case to the intersection of this line with the
radial line u on the pointer,-we increase the scale-reading by
an amount sr=os tang a tang p, and the new scale-reading is

   Hence we have only to make tang a tang p=3, in order
to make os the new scale-reading directly proportional to A

axis of graduation we have only to put
                        tang a tang (p=8

   Using this value of a to calculate the values of the scale
correction, rs, at other points, we find the valnes given in the
5th column of Table I. As will be seen, they differ on the
average from the corresponding values of 8 by less than 5% per
cent. ; or only about 0.0008 millim. at the maximum for
$=25°. By this simple method, therefore, the necessity for
making any correction to the scale-reading, even in the most
accurate work, is entirely avoided.

placed between the objective and the reflecting mirror A, or
else mounted on the mirror-frame itself so as to rotate with it.
The last position enables the same instrument to be used
either in the method of comparison or in the method of coin
cidence, but is objectionable both on account of the increased
weight of the moving parts and because of the liability of dis
turbing the adjustment of the axis or mirror while manipulating
the micrometer. It is therefore better to place the rotating
plate in the first position indicated and adapt it to either
method of use if desired, by making it cover only one-half
the field of the telescope, that half of course which is
opposite the unsilvered half of the mirror when the coinci
dence method is used, and opposite the silvered half when the
comparison method is employed.

134         Mr. C. Davison on the Straining of the
supposition that the coefficient of dilatation increases with the
temperature, being e-He'v, where v is the temperature. In
assuming this law to hold true up to a temperature as high as
7000°F., it is evident that the numerical results here obtained
cannot be regarded as reliable. They are given for their
qualitative rather than for their quantitative value.
   Let r be the internal radius of a thin spherical shell con
centric with the earth", its thickness Br, density p, and
coefficient of linear dilatation e. In any given time, let the
temperature of this shell be increased by 6; then, if the
shell were isolated, r would be increased by reó. But, in
consequence of the expansion of the mass inside it, let the
internal radius be further increased by rk, so that r becomes
r(1+a), where a=k+e6. Also, p becomes p(1-3e0) and
ör becomes
                           8r[1+    # (ra)].
Since the mass of the shell remains unchanged, we have there
fore

from Adie’s experiments f on six rocks at temperatures
varying from about 50° to 208°F., is 0000057. Taking this
as the surface-value e, and as before W equal to 7000°F.,
and 8 to 1, we find that after a lapse of 100 million years
the total volume of solid rock is about 6,145,000 cubic miles,
and the mean thickness of the layer formed by spreading this
over the whole earth is 03120 mile or 1647 feet.                    If the
coefficient of dilatation were constant and equal to the value
above-mentioned, the corresponding figures would be 184,500
cubic miles and 4.95 feet.
   Alleged Insufficiency of the Contraction Theory.—If the co
efficient of dilatation increases with the temperature, instead
 of being constant, it thus appears that the result is a con
siderable increase in the depth of the surface of no strain,
and in the total amount of rock-folding due to the cooling of
the earth. If the conductivity increases with the temperature,
there will be a further increase of both quantities. It is
 possible, moreover, that besides their variation with the tem
 perature, both the conductivity and the coefficient of dilata
 tion may be greater in the material which composes the
 earth's interior than they are in the surface rocks. Mr. Rudski
 has also pointed out $ that the depth of the surface of no
 strain will be much greater if initially the temperature, in
 stead of being uniform, increased with the depth, and there is
 some reason for supposing that this may have been the case.
 If, then, we regard the contraction theory as a theory of the
 formation of mountain-ranges only, and not necessarily of
 the continental masses, we may, I think, conclude that
 calculations as to its alleged insufficiency are at present
 inadmissible.

IN this treatise    M. Waschy presents a purely mechanical theory
      of electricity founded on the fact, experimentally demon
strated, that an electric field with a measurable intensity exists at
every point of space, The connexion between electric intensity
and the medium in which it is manifested is not considered; on
this point the author remarks:—“The idea of intensity of the
electric field is not more intimately connected with the three
fundamental ideas of mechanics than these latter are connected
among themselves. We shall therefore consider it as fundamental;
but all others with which we meet in electricity will be derived
from it, and from length, time and mass.”
    It is shown that the condition of stability of the electric field is
the existence of a potential function; this leads to the discussion
of lines of force, equipotential surfaces and conductors. M. Waschy
distinguishes two classes of action at a distance, of which the
 action between two electric charges and that of an element of a
linear current on a magnet pole are the types; in the former case
 the force is in the line joining the particles, whereas in the latter
 case one of the attracting “masses” is a vector quantity, and its
 direction determines that of the force. The two classes may be
 called Newtonian and Laplacian respectively; the author shows
 that any field of force whatever can be completely represented by
 a suitable distribution of Newtonian and Laplacian masses, with
 an inverse square law of attraction: a stable field is due only to
 Newtonian masses, while a solenoidal distribution is produced by
 Laplacian masses alone. The energy which really exists in every
 unit of volume of the field is referred in action-at-a-distance
 theories to these fictitious masses, thus giving rise to the ideas of
 electric charges and currents.
    M. Vaschy’s explanation of a current in a conductor is analogou
 to that of Poynting; in every element of volume of the conductor,
 the energy of the electric field is constantly being transformed
  into heat, and new energy must be supplied along definite paths
 from the battery or other source of electric energy. Assuming
 that the rate of supply of energy to the element of volume depends
  only on the instantaneous state of the field at its surface, and not
  on the mode of transformation of the energy within it, the field of
  a current can be divided into an electrostatic and a magnetic
  portion. The discussion of variable currents follows, and the
  detailed treatment of electric waves is a prominent feature in the
  book.

  The aim of the author has been to produce a work bearing the
same relation to electrical theory as a treatise on thermodynamics
bears to the theory of heat. Temperature in the one case, electric
force in the other, are regarded as fundamental quantities; the
rest consists entirely of experiment and mathematical deduction.
A closer study of the behaviour of heated gases gives us a clue to
the physical meaning of temperature; may we not hope to learn
from the electrical properties of matter something more definite
concerning electric force 2                      JAMES L. HowARD.
Molecules and the Molecular Theory of Matter. By A.D. RISTEEN, S.B.
  Boston, U.S.A.: Ginn & Co., 1895.               *
THIS volume is the outcome of a lecture on the same subject,
which the author has greatly amplified, retaining, however, the
lecture style, which involves the frequent use of the first person
singular. The introduction of this personal element enables
Mr. Risteen occasionally to put forward his own views without
leading students to suppose them orthodox—if such a term is
permissible in connexion with the theory of the constitution of
matter. He thus imparts to his subject a greater interest and a
more vigorous treatment than it has previously received, except in
Maxwell's discourse on ‘Molecules, and Lord Kelvin's lecture on
the ‘Size of Atoms.’                                                 -
   The first part of the work is devoted to the kinetic theory of a
perfect gas; the gaseous laws are explained, and Maxwell's law of
distribution of molecular velocities is enunciated and discussed.
This is followed by the statement of Boltzmann’s theorem and
the deduction of the relation between the number of degrees of
freedom of the molecules of a gas and the ratio of its specific heats,
after which diffusion and viscosity are treated according to the
principles of the kinetic theory, and molecular free path is
illustrated by the radiometer and Crookes's tubes. The second
section of the volume deals with the molecular theory of liquids
and solids, and is necessarily more superficial and sketchy than the
previous one; it concludes with a good account of the various
methods for the determination of molecular magnitudes. The
rest of the volume contains short descriptions of the various
theories concerning the nature of atoms and molecules.                -
   The author has endeavoured to give an outline of the whole
subject rather than a detailed mathematical treatment of a portion
of it, so that formulae are occasionally quoted without proof. In
these cases the student might with advantage be referred to a
treatise or memoir where the proof is to be found.

A Laboratory Course in Experimental Physics.     By W. J. LoudoN,
   B.A., and J. C. McLENNAN, B.A.        New York : Macmillan &
   Co., 1895.
ALTHOUGH text-books of practical physics are now fairly numerous,
the demonstrators in physics of the University of Toronto appear
to have found it impossible to adapt any of the existing ones to
the requirements of their students. The same difficulty has been
experienced in most English laboratories, partly on account of the
diversity which exists between the apparatus of the various
institutions, and partly because of the different aims of students
working in them. Consequently nearly every laboratory possesses
instruction-sheets, either in print or manuscript, which have in
some instances been edited and issued in book form; the present
volume is a case in point.             -
   The experiments described in the book are arranged in two
courses, elementary and advanced, in the former of which
weighing and measuring, light and heat, are included, while the
advanced course consists of sound, advanced heat, electricity, and
magnetism. Some easy experiments in electricity and magnetism
might have been included in the elementary course, otherwise the
selection is a fairly good and useful one. The section on sound
contains figures and descriptions of Helmholtz's and König's
apparatus for various experiments, but many students’ laboratories
in this country are, unfortunately, not equipped with large
electrically-driven tuning-forks and chronographs. Experimental
details are sometimes omitted; for example, in describing the use
of the spectrometer as a goniometer, the student is not told how
to focus the telescope and adjust the slit so as to obtain a parallel
beam of light from the collimator. In the same experiment it is
erroneously stated that the edge of the crystal must coincide with
the axis of the instrument, whereas the two need only be parallel
to each other if the collimator is properly adjusted. Again, in
calorimetric measurements, errors arising from radiation between
the calorimeter and its surroundings are not very adequately
discussed; the calorimeter is supposed in all experiments to alter
its temperature at a uniform rate, and matters are so arranged
that the mean between its initial and final temperatures is that of
the atmosphere. In specific heat determinations a preliminary
experiment is necessary in order to satisfy the latter condition,
and the assumption of uniform rise of temperature is only approx
imately true, even when the body under experiment is a good
conductor of heat.
   The book is printed in a bold, clear type, and its illustrations
are good; it will be found a useful addition to the laboratory
bookshelf.                                       JAMES L. HOWARD.

      1. ‘On the Alteration of certain Basic Eruptive Rocks from
Brent Tor, Devon. By Frank Rutley, Esq., F.G.S.
   Two microscopic sections of rock occurring on the north side ef
Brent Tor were examined, and a cursory glance suggested at once
the idea that they might originally have consisted to a greater or
less extent of extremely vesicular basalt-glass. No unaltered vitreous
matter, except perhaps mere traces, can now be detected in these
specimens, the interest of which lies in the assemblage of alteration
products which they contain. A third section cut from a small chip
collected at the southern side of the base of the Tor consists of a
highly vesicular lava of a hyalopilitic character, which may be
regarded as an amygdaloidal glassy basalt.
   The author gives a detailed account of the microscopic characters
of the three sections, and discusses the history of the rocks, com
paring them with Tertiary basic glass, and with the Devonian
rocks of Cant Hill, which he described previously. He brings
forward evidence in favour of the view that the original alteration
of both the Brent Tor and Cant Hill rocks was palagonitic, and
that while in the Brent Tor rocks the subsequent alteration of the
palagonite into felsitic matter, magnetite, secondary felspar, epidote,
and probably kaolin, and some serpentine and chlorite was com
plete, it was only partial in the case of the Cant Hill rocks. We
may therefore assume that palagonite is not the ultimate phase of
alteration in basic igneous rocks.

   1. ‘The Tertiary Basalt-plateaux of North-western Europe.        By
Sir Archibald Geikie, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S.
: The author in this paper gives the results obtained by him in
the continued study of Tertiary Wolcanic Geology during the seven
years which have elapsed since the publication of his memoir on
* The History of Wolcanic Action during the Tertiary Period in the

                         - Geological Society.                     143
British Isles. His researches have embraced the Western Islands of
Scotland, St. Kilda, and the Faröe Islands.          -                  -
    1. In an account of the rocks of the basalt-plateaux attention
  s particularly directed in this paper to a type of banded basic lavas
which play an important part in the structure of the volcanic dis
tricts both of the Inner Hebrides and of the Faröes. The banding
 sometimes consists in layers of more highly vesicular structure,
sometimes in alternations of distinctly different lithological cha
.racter, such as close-grained basalt and more coarsely-crystalline
dolerite. These banded rocks are more particularly developed in
the lower portions of the volcanic series. At a distance they might
 be mistaken for tuffs or other stratified deposits. They occupy a
 conspicuous place in the great precipices of the west and north of
..the Faröe Islands.                                                    -
     Numerous examples are cited of the ending-off of basalt-sheets in
 different directions, indicative of many local vents from which
 the lavas issued.      An account is also given of tuffs and other
stratified intercalations which occupy a subordinate place in the
 structure of the plateaux.                                             -
     2. A number of examples are adduced of the volcanic vents which
 form a characteristic feature of the basalt-plateaux. A remarkable
 row of five such vents was met with by the author at the base of
 the great cliffs on the west side of Stromö, in the Faröe Islands.
 They are occupied with agglomerate, and their saucer-shaped craters
 have been filled in by successive streams of lava from neighbouring
 vents, the whole being buried under the great pile of basalt-sheets
 forming the island of Stromö.                                        -
     An instance of similar structure is described from Portree Bay,
.the agglomerate in this case being connected with a thick and wide
 spread sheet of tuff intercalated among the basalts. Another
example is cited from the eastern end of the island of Canna,
 where the ejected volcanic blocks are associated with records of
  contemporaneous river-action.                                         -
     3. The paper describes in some detail the evidence for the flow
  of a large river across the lava-fields during the time when volcanic
 activity was still vigorous. Thick sheets of well-rolled gravel are
 intercalated among the basalts of the islands of Canna and Sanday.
 These masses of detritus consist mainly of volcanic material, but
  they include also abundant pieces of Torridon Sandstone and rocks
from the Western Highlands.         The current of water which trans
 ported them certainly came from the east. That it flowed while the
  volcanic vents continued in eruption is shown by the bands of tuff
 and the large blocks of slag contained in the conglomerates, as well
  as by sheets of vesicular basalt interstratified in the same deposits.
..From the terrestrial vegetation whereof the macerated remains are
:enclosed in the tuffs and shales, and from the entire absence of
 imarine organisms, it may be confidently inferred that the water was
 that of a river. The large size of many of the rounded blocks that
                 * ...

 144                      Geological Society:—
 were swept along proves that this river must have been of con
 siderable volume and rapidity. The stream probably drained some
part of the Inverness-shire Highlands, and wandered over the volcanic
 plain, following the inequalities of the lava-fields, sweeping away
 the loose detritus of volcanic cones, and continually liable to have
 its course altered by fresh volcanic eruptions. An interesting
 section is cited from the island of Sanday, where what appears to
 be a portion of the ravine of one of the tributaries of this river.
trenched in the basalts, filled with coarse shingle and buried under
later basalts, remains in a picturesque sea-stack.
    An account is given of the little islet of Hysgeir, about
 18 miles to the west of the island of Eigg, which has been identified
 by Dr. Heddle with the rock of the Scuir of Eigg, and which the
author has visited in two successive years. The ‘pitchstone” is
precisely like that of the Scuir down to the most minute structure,
 as is shown by an examination of the rock under the microscope
by Mr. A. Harker. There can be little doubt that this rock was
a superficial lava like that of Eigg, and there seems every prob
ability that it is really a westward continuation of the Scuir. The
Hysgeir pitchstone everywhere dips under the sea, so that its
bottom cannot be seen.
    The author considers that the Canna river may have been the
same as that which at a later part of the volcanic period had its
channel filled up by the pitchstone of the Scuir of Eigg.
    4. Many additional details are given to illustrate the structure
and behaviour of the basic sills which are so abundantly developed,
especially at the base of the plateaux. Some of these sheets are of
colossal proportions, as in the Shiant Isles, where a single columnar
bed is 500 feet thick. Others descend to extremely minute pro
portions, such as the slender layers and threads which have been
injected into the coal and shale between the lower basalts in the
Portree district. A remarkable instance of a sill traversing the
centre of another is cited from the south-east of Skye, the younger
sheet having a strongly developed skin of black glass on its upper
and under surfaces.     One of the most striking instances of a sill
rising obliquely across a thick mass of the plateau-basalts is described
from Stromö in the Faröe Islands.
   5. The author adds some additional particulars, more especially
from Skye and St. Kilda, to his published account of the dykes
which have taken so important a place in the origin and structure
of the plateaux.                          -
    6. Further observations are narrated regarding the great bosses
of gabbro in the Inner Hebrides. In particular, the peculiar banded
structure, already described from a part of the Cuillin Hills, is shown
to have a wide distribution in Skye, and to occur also in Rum.
The remarkable alteration of the plateau-basalts as they approach
the gabbros of Loch Scavaig is referred to, and the microscopic
structure of these metamorphosed rocks is described in notes supplied
to the author by Mr. Harker. An account is also given of the

        Tertiary Basalt-plateaux of North-western Europe.           145
 gabbros of St. Kilda, which display a considerable variety of texture
 and composition and include basalts and dolerites.
     7. The author, having been able to visit St. Kilda, describes the
junction of the granophyre of that remote island with the basalts
 and gabbros.    He brought away a series of specimens and photo
graphs which demonstrate that the acid rock has been injected into
the basic masses, traversing them in veins and enclosing angular
pieces of them. The granophyre is precisely like that of Skye and
 Mull, and is traversed by veins of finer material, as in these islands.
 Where it has penetrated the basic rocks it sometimes forms a kind
 of breccia-matrix in which the pieces of dark material are enclosed.
 It has taken up a certain quantity of the basalt or gabbro, as
 is shown by the abundant brown mica and hornblende which have
been developed in the acid rock, especially round the enclosed basalt
 fragments. The results of a microscopic examination of thin slices
of the rock at the junction are furnished by Mr. Harker.
    From Skye examples are given of triple dykes and sills, wherein
a central band consists of granophyre or spherulitic felsite, while
the two marginal bands are of basalt, diabase, or other basic
material. There does not appear to be any ascertainable connexion
between the acid and basic parts of such compound intrusions. In
some cases the basic, in others the acid portion is the older.
    8. By way of illustrating the probable history of the basaltic
plateaux of North-western Europe, the author gives a short
summary of the results of recent investigations of the modern
volcanic eruptions of Iceland, especially by Th. Thoroddsen and
A. Helland. He shows in how many ways the phenomena of that
island explain the facts which are met with in the study of our
Tertiary plateaux, and how, in some respects, the enormous
denudation of these plateaux throws light on parts of the
mechanism of the Icelandic volcanoes which are still buried under
the erupted material.
    9. Reference is made to the evidence of considerable terrestrial
movement since the Tertiary volcanic period, as shown by the
tilting of large sections of the plateaux in different directions, and
also by the existence of actual faults.   Besides the normal faults,
which are not infrequent among the Western Isles, there occur
among the Faröe Islands instances of reversed faults, which
probably indicate disturbance of a more serious character.
    10. The concluding section of the paper deals with the effects of
denudation on the plateaux. With possibly some minor intervals
of partial depression, the present Tertiary volcanic tracts of the
British and Faröe Isles have remained as land ever since the volcanic
period. Their valleys were probably begun before the close of the
eruptions, and these hollows have been continuously widened and
deepened ever since. The result is a stupendous memorial of the
potency of the agents of geological waste. While the Inner
Hebrides abound in most impressive illustrations of this denudation,

they are inferior in that respect to the Faröes. The long level lines
of basalt-sheets furnish, as it were, datum-lines from which the extent
of erosion can be estimated and even measured. There is certainly
no other area in Europe where the study of the combined influence
 of atmospheric and marine denudation can be so admirably pro
 secuted, and where the imagination, kindled to enthusiasm by the
 contemplation of such scenery, can be so constantly and imperiously
 controlled by the accurate observation of ascertainable fact.

   1. ‘A Delimitation of the Cenomanian, being a Comparison of the
Corresponding Beds in Southern England and Western France. By
A. J. Jukes-Browne, Esq., B.A., F.G.S., and William Hill, Esq.,
F.G.S.
   The object of the authors is to compare the beds which form the
lower part of the Upper Cretaceous Series in those parts of Southern
England and Western France which are nearest to one another.
They briefly trace the history of English and French geological
research, and remark that even at the present time French geologists
are not agreed as to the beds to be included in their “etage Céno
manien.”                          -
   The authors feel justified in taking the English succession as a
standard, and endeavour to show that the French succession is in
accord with it, believing that the confusion of French geologists has
arisen from their having taken a set of arenaceous shallow-water
beds as the standard of their Cenomanian stage, in a district where
these form the local base of the Cretaceous System, and where the
typical Albien fauna does not exist.
   Commencing with the English sections, they describe such as serve
to establish the succession in the Isle of Wight, Dorset, and Devon,
pointing out that the Gault and Upper Greensand are everywhere
so inseparably united that it is difficult even to assign limits to the
component zones; further, that the Lower Chalk is clearly marked
off from this group, and that no classification can be accepted in
England which does not recognize the clear and natural line of
division at the base of the Chalk.
   In Devonshire the representative of the Lower Chalk is found
in a set of arenaceous deposits which contain a remarkable
fauna, some of the fossils being such as occur in the Upper Green
sand, some in the Chalk Marl, while many have not been found
elsewhere in England, but occur in the Cenomanian of France and
in the Tourtia of Tournay. This Devonshire ‘Cenomanian’ includes

       The Llandovery and Associated Rocks of Conway.               147
the beds numbered 10, 11, 12, and 13 by Mr. Meyer in his Beer
Head section, Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xxx. (1874) p. 369.
   Passing over to France, the fine section in the cliffs between
Cap la Hève and St. Jouin is described in detail, and the bed which
is regarded as the base of the Cenomanian by M. Lennier and
Prof. A. de Lapparent is shown to be the representative of the Chloritic
Marl of the Isle of Wight; the Greensand and the Gault below
forming, as in England, a separate and independent group of beds.
   An account is then given of a traverse made through the depart
ments of Calvados and Orne as far as Mortagne; succeeded by a
brief account of the lateral changes which take place as the Ceno
manien is traced through the Sarthe, this being derived from the
publications of MM. Guillier and Bizet.
   A critical study of the fossils found in Devonshire and Normandy
follows, with tabulated lists comparing the Devonshire fauna with
that of the French Cenomanian, and the fossils of the Norman
Cenomanian with those of the Warminster Greensand and of our
Lower Chalk.     In this part of the work the authors have received
much assistance from Mr. C. J. A. Meyer and Dr. G. J. Hinde.
   Finally, they claim to have defined the limits of the Cenomanian
stage in Western France, and to have shown that this group of beds
is simply a southern extension of our Lower Chalk, formed in a
shallower part of the Cretaceous Sea and nearer to a coast-line.
   2. “The Llandovery and Associated Rocks of Conway.                By
G. L. Elles and E. M. R. Wood, Newnham College.
   The discovery of beds with Phacops appendiculatus, Salt., near
Deganwy, and of shales with a fauna of Upper Birkhill age close to
the town of Conway, indicates that the break between Ordovician
and Silurian is smaller in this area than has hitherto been supposed.
   In the paper a full description of the representatives of the
Birkhill, Gala (Tarannon), and Wenlock beds is given, and the
distribution of the fossils (chiefly graptolites) in the various sub
divisions is recorded. Many of the graptolites are forms which
have been described from Swedish deposits, but have hitherto been
unrecorded in this country.
   3. ‘The Gypsum Deposits of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.’
By A. T. Metcalfe, Esq., F.G.S.
   The gypsum deposits of these counties occur in the Upper Marls
of the Keuper division of the Triassic system. The author describes
their occurrence in thick nodular irregular beds, large spheroidal
masses, and lenticular intercalations, and their association with Satin
spar, alabaster, selenite, and anhydrite.

     CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF TROPICAL RAIN.
                       BY PROF. T. WIESENER.
AN      incentive to this series of researches carried out in Buiten
       zorg, Java, in the winter 1893–94, was the question as to the
direct mechanical effect of tropical rain on plants, on which subject
entirely erroneous views are current.
   The author first determined the rainfall per second, and found
the highest value to be 0.04 millim. If a rain of such intensity
had continued, within a day it would almost have equalled a year's
fall at Buitenzorg.
   The masses of rain in tropics even in the heaviest falls are very
small in comparison with those from the rose of an ordinary
watering-pot. The former are to the latter as 1:25 up to 100.
   From the heaviest rainfalls and the smallest number of drops
falling on a surface of 100 sq. cm. in a second, the weight of the
greatest possible raindrop was calculated at 0.4 gramme. This
number is far too great, for the largest drops which can be made
(of 0.25-0-26 gramme) break up at a height of fall of over 5 metres
into a larger one weighing 0-2 gramme and into several smaller
drops. The weight of the largest raindrop in Buitenzorg, mea
sured by the method of absorption, is still smaller, amounting
namely to only 0.16 gr.
   Experiments by the author on free fall have shown that drops
of water of 0.01–0-26 gramme, at heights of more than 5–10
metres fall with approximately uniform velocity of about 7 metres
in a second.     The acceleration is therefore very soon after the
commencement of the fall almost entirely compensated by the
resistance of the air.
   The vis viva of the heaviest drops of rain calculated by the
formula
                                  pv’
                                  2g
amounts to 0.004 kgmetre. In heavy falls no doubt several drops
fall in rapid succession on a leaf-2–6 large drops per square centi
metre per second,—but the impact of each falling drop is diminished
by the elastic attachment of the leaf to the stem.
   It follows from the experiments, that the force which tropical
rain falling in a still atmosphere can exert is far too small to
cause injury to vegetation. The mechanical action of the strongest
tropical rain on plants is seen in a violent agitation of the leaves
and twigs. Injuries only occur in isolated cases in the more
tender parts of the plants which cannot give way to the impact,
for instance on the tender shoots of tobacco when they lie on
a coarse soil consisting of angular particles of earth and sand.

The statements that leaves are torn and separated from the stem
by the mere impact of the rain, in a still atmosphere, that upright
leafy plants are shattered, and the like, depend on errors.—Wiener

ON THREE DIFFEREN TSPECTRA OF ARGON.                 BY DR. J. M. EDER
                   AND E. VALENTA, OF VIENNA.
   In this paper it is demonstrated that besides the “red” and
“blue” argon spectrum discovered by Crookes, there is a third
separate spectrum of argon which is characterized by different limes
as well as by partial displacement of certain groups of lines toward
the red. The authors describe also the spectrum of the glow-light
at the + and – poles of the tubes filled with argon.— Wiener
Berichte, December 19, 1895.
  ON THE RED SPECTRUM OF ARGON.            BY DR. J. M. EDER AND
                             E. WALENTA.
   Through the kindness of Lord Rayleigh we became possessed of
some argon gas which was very carefully filled into vacuum-tubes
by Hr. Goetze in Leipzig. The pressure in those tubes which we
used for our investigations amounted to 1–3 millim. For the
purpose of analysis by the spectrum, we used a very powerful con
cave grating of # metre curvature, and the photographic method.
We measured the spectrum of the second order and referred the
wave-length to the lines on Rowland's standards. We examined
the red-and-blue argon spectrum which was obtained in accord
ance with the statements of Mr. Crookes, with feeble sparks
without leyden-jars or with sparks from the jars themselves.
   For the red argon spectrum we obtained the following numbers.
The lines marked with a star are also present in the blue argon
 spectrum; the other lines are characteristic of thered spectrum itself.
 As specially characteristic lines of the red spectrum may be men
tioned the principal lines A=4628:56, 4596:22, 4522:49, 4510.85,
 4300:18, 4272.27,4259.42, 4251:25, especially the groups 4200-76,
 419842, 4182,07, 4164:36, 4158.63, and, further, 4044:56,
 3949.13, 3834.83. This, of course, only applies to the region
 examined by us, and we shall shortly publish further measure
 ments in the Memoirs of the Vienna Academy. It may be
 remarked that the red argon spectrum is resolved if the double line
    {#         appears well separated. If the blue and the red
 argon spectrum belong to two elements, which is by no means
improbable, the above lines would be the characteristic principal
 Ones.                                             -
   We give the following preliminary list for the region A=5060
 to A=3319, in which i is the intensity of the lines (the feeblest
 *=1, the strongest = 10).

      INTERFERENCE EXPERIMENT WITH ELECTRICAL WAVES.
                         BY PROF. WON LANG.
    The experiment described corresponds to the well-known acous
 tical one of Quincke. The electrical wave from a Righi's exciter
 is divided into two parts with unequally long paths; after joining,
 the partial waves interfere, which is demonstrated by a Branly's
 Coherer. If the one wave is successively lengthened, both waves
 will be alternately strengthened and weakened, and as many as
four maxima and minima can be easily shown. The experiments
were made with tubes of nearly 60 millim. diameter. Tubes with
half that diameter did not show the phenomenon. If in one of
the two tubes a paraffin cylinder is introduced which entirely fills
it, the position of the maxima and minima is displaced, from which
the refractive index of paraffin can be calculated. The author
found for it 1.65–170. Similar experiments with sulphur gave
for its refractive index 2.33–2:37. These numbers are considerably
higher than the values found by Righi, which were, for paraffin
1.43; for sulphur 1:87. The length of the electrical waves in
these experiments was 80 millim., the diameter of the knobs of the
exciter 106 millim.— Wiener Berichte, Oct. 24, 1895.

GENTLEMEN,
      I find that the view expressed by me in my paper “On the
Relation between the Atom and its Charge” (Phil. Mag. Dec. 1895,
p. 541), that a negatively electrified atom moved more rapidly than
a positively electrified one in the same electric field, was arrived at
from different reasons by Professor Schuster, and given by him
more than five years ago in the Bakerian Lecture for 1890. I am
glad to find that this view is held by so eminent an authority, and
regret that I had previously overlooked such strong evidence in its
favour. There is another result given in the same Bakerian
Lecture which I ought to have quoted. I allude to Mr. Stanton's
interesting experiments on the escape of electricity from a hot
copper rod surrounded in one case by oxygen and in another by
hydrogen.
                                   I am, Gentlemen,
                                             Yours very sincerely,

        ON THE DOUBLE REFRACTION OF ELECTRICAL WAVES.
                       BY PROF. AUGUSTE. RIGHI.
     In No. 2, 1895, of Wiedemann's Annalen is a memoir by Prof.
  Mach (Phil. Mag. July 1895), in which are described experiments
  showing that a plate of pine-wood with faces parallel to the fibres
  behaves towards electrical radiation just as a double refracting
  plate towards luminous radiations. This memoir is dated Nov.
  1894.
    Now on May 27, 1894, I communicated to the R. Accademia
 di Bologna a long paper in which are described experiments equi
  valent to those of Prof. Mach, and others of analogous import. In
 my experiments I not only confirmed the double refraction pro
 duced by wood, and the varying absorption of electrical rays
 according as they are parallel or perpendicular to the fibres, but I
 also obtained elliptical and circular polarization, using for this
 latter a wooden plate of such a thickness as to represent a quarter
 of a wave-length. Thus, like Prof. Mach, I compared the be
 haviour of wood to that of tourmaline rather than to that of calc
 spar or of quartz. One experiment of Prof. Mach's I did not make,
 namely, that in which it is proved that there is no double refrac
tion if the wooden plate is cut perpendicularly to the fibres. I
did not think it necessary to make this experiment, the idea of
which did indeed occur to me, because from reasons of symmetry
the result seemed a priori evident.
    I am satisfied that Prof. Mach did not know of my memoir, or
 at any rate not when I made my communication to the Annalen,
and I am glad that his experiments so completely confirm those I
 had already published. I may add that, like him, I do not believe
 in the possibility of producing double refraction of electrical
radiations by means of a plate of Iceland spar, for the reasons I
have explained in my memoir. In any case I intend soon to
resume my researches in these directions, which I have been pre
vented from doing by other work.—Nuovo Cimento [4] vol. i., April

NOTE ON ELEMENTARY TEACHING CONCERNING FOCAL LENGTHS.
             To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine.
GENTLEMEN,
      In Dr. Barton’s communication, page 59, I see he follows
the usual practice with regard to signs. My experience is that
students find it simpler and more natural to take the positive sign
for real images always, and the negative sign for virtual ones.
Similarly, converging instruments are to have their focal length
or their “potency” considered positive, and diverging instruments
negative, whether they be mirrors or lenses. Does Dr. Barton see
objection to this course?                 -                -

XXI. On Magnetic Tractive Force". By E. TAYLOR Jones,
    D.Sc., Assistant Lecturer in Physics in the University College
    of North Wales, formerly Science Scholar of Royal Commis
    sion for Exhibition of 1851f.
    N a former paper # an account was given of experiments
       in which the value of the magnetic tractive force of a
divided ellipsoid was found to agree within 1 per cent. with
Maxwell's expression B*/87 for the electromagnetic stress in
the narrow air-space between the two halves, for inductions
between 6000 and 20,000 C.G.S.
    In the present paper further experiments will be described,
the chief object of which was to test whether the same agree
ment existed at much higher inductions. Since the magne
tizing force H in the iron was very small in comparison with
the induction B in the former experiments, these cannot be
considered as deciding between Maxwell's expression B°/87r
and, for instance, the expression 27tl”, which has also been
given as the value of the tractive force $.
   In order to complete the test it was necessary to continue
the experiments to such high inductions that the magnetic
force H was a considerable part, numerically, of the induction
H+47 I.

154                  Dr. E. Taylor Jones on
                            Apparatus.
    These inductions were obtained by means of the Ring
Electromagnet designed by Dr. H. du Bois*.
    The chief parts of the apparatus are shown in fig. 1, by a
vertical axial section; the left half is not all shown, but is
symmetrical with the right. The pole-pieces were conical,
and had a vertical angle of 78°28', so that the field near the
vertex was as nearly uniform as possiblet.                      -
    Both pole-pieces were axially perforated, the width of the
openings being about 5 millim.
    Into one of the pole-pieces fitted a short cylindrical iron
bar, C1, provided with a flange, so that when pressed home
it just reached to the vertex of the cone. Into the opening
in the other pole-piece fitted a longer bar, C2, of the same iron
as C, and of equal diameter; this bar could be moved to and
 fro in its socket with very little friction. The two bars thus
 met in the equatorial plane EE' and formed an “isthmus ”
 between the pole-pieces. Similar bars were also made of
steel.
    This part of the apparatus was carefully centred, and the
 inner ends of the bars were turned plane and polished; in
 this process the pole-pieces themselves served as “guard
 rings” before they were completely turned down to their
 conical form. The surfaces were optically tested as in the
former experiments (l.c. p. 262).
    The bar C2 was connected, by a long brass rod M and a
 cord which passed over a pulley, with a scale-pan, so that the
 tractive force could be directly measured. For measuring
 the induction and magnetic force in the isthmus the method
 of Ewing and Low was employed. A small brass bobbin, on
 which two coils, each of five turns of thin copper wire, were
 wound, could be placed on the isthmus near the plane of
 section, so that when the bar C2 was pulled out the bobbin
 automatically fell out to a distance and was turned so that
 its plane remained parallel to the field. The diameter of one
 of the coils was slightly greater than that of the isthmus,
  that of the other about 2 millim. greater, so that an annular
  space about 1 millim. wide existed between the coils. Each
 coil could be connected through a resistance-box with an
 Ayrton-Mather galvanometer. The movable coil of this
  instrument was specially weighted to make it suitable for
 ballistic measurements.

   From the induction-throws obtained with the two coils, the
mean induction in the isthmus and the field-intensity just
outside the isthmus (which by the principle of continuity of
tangential magnetic force is equal to the magnetic force just
inside the isthmus) could be calculated.
   It was assumed that the field in and near the isthmus was
so nearly uniform that the induction and magnetic force were
constant over the section of the isthmus, and the latter equal
to the field in the annular space between the two coils.
                               Theory.
   The results obtained with this arrangement can be inter
preted in the following way according to Maxwell's theory.

    Applying this to the case of the bar C2, taking the origin
 at the outer end (cf. fig. 1) and ow along the axis of the bar—
 also considering for the present only the first term XI of the
 integral, and assuming that A and a are independent of y
 and z in each section of the bar—we have after integrating by
parts,

    At the end (x=l) between the pole-pieces we have A= I,
 while a=H+2TI, corresponding to the action of the pole
 pieces and of the free end of the bar Ci.
    The distribution of a along the axis was found by throwing
 out a small exploring coil from different points on the axis.
 The results showed that a certain region existed in which a
 was always very small and nearly constant. The ordinates of
 the curves abc and def, fig. 1, represent the values of a at
 points on the axis, with magnetizing currents of 7 and 25
 amp. respectively.

    This part of the integral in (1) depends only on the longi
tudinal components of the field and magnetization.
    It may be shown that the part of X depending on the
transverse components of field and magnetization vanishes if
the value of a is constant at the outer end of the bar,
i.e. if   # =0 at v=0"; since this was very nearly the case
in the experiments we may neglect these terms.

   + In the immediately following section of his treatise (l.c. $641),
 Maxwell explains these forces by his well-known theory of stresses in a
medium, and develops the corresponding stress equations.      From these
the  equation (3) might be more shortly deduced. In somewhat different
ways similar expressions have been obtained by du Bois, Wied. Ann.
 xxxv, p. 146 (1888), and by Adler, Wien. Ber. c. 2 Abth. p. 897 (1891).

present arrangement, according to Maxwell's theory, pro
portional to the induction B. In the former experiments B
was proportional, neglecting small corrections, simply to MP.

    The integral   | HdI is clearly equal to the area enclosed
                    0
by the magnetization curve, the axis of I, and the line parallel
to the H-axis at distance I from it". This area is very dif
 ferent in the cases of hard steel and soft iron.                For this
 reason, and in order to make the test as general as possible,
 two bars of glass-hard steel were also experimented on.
                      Preliminary Experiments.
    The ballistic galvanometer was standardized in the usual
 way by means of a long solenoid and a secondary coil.
    The core of the solenoid consisted of a glass tube covered
with ebonitet; this was turned accurately cylindrical, and
its diameter measured with a Zeiss “thickness measurer,”
both before and after it was wound with one layer of silk
covered copper wire. From these measurements the field
inside the solenoid and the area of the solenoid were calcu
lated in the usual way, The current in the solenoid was
measured by a Kelvin “platform ”-galvanometer, which was
moreover standardized by a copper voltameter!.
    From the throw of the galvanometer-needle on reversing
the primary current, the ballistic sensitiveness of the galva
nometer was calculated. This was not constant but varied,
firstly somewhat with the time and temperature, secondly
with the resistance of the galvanometer circuit. The first
 changes were observed and corrected for by withdrawing a
small coil from a very constant permanent magnet before and
after each set of observations.
    This was then repeated with various resistances in the
galvanometer circuit. At the same time the damping was
also observed, i. e. the ratio m of two successive swings
 measured from the zero.        The results of these observations
are contained in Table 1., in which R=total resistance of
 galvanometer circuit, a = product of R into the throw (a
being thus proportional to the ballistic sensitiveness of the
galvanometer), and

    The value of a is therefore within 3 per cent. constant ;
 in other words, the influence of the resistance of the secondary
 circuit on the ballistic sensitiveness of the galvanometer is
 completely, though indirectly, explained by its well-known
 influence on the damping of the oscillations, and can be
 eliminated, was as done in all the galvanometer observations.
 Moreover, the damping was too small to have any effect on
 the proportionality of throw to quantity of electricity flowing
 through the galvanometer, as I convinced myself by special
 observations.
    The areas of the two isthmus coils were compared electro
magnetically in the uniform field between flat pole-pieces with
a standard coil made of a single strip of phosphor bronze
wound on a circular glass plate which £ been carefully
turned, ground, and measured. The connecting strips of the
standard coil were exactly laid one above the other so as to
enclose no area parallel to the plane of the coil.
    In using this coil the influence of its resistance on the
sensitiveness of the galvanometer was of course, as explained
above, taken into account.
    The total areas of the two isthmus coils were thus found to
be 1.235 and 2.553 sq. centim. respectively, that of the
standard coil being 1:530 sq. centim. These areas were also
calculated from the previously measured diameters of the
brass bobbin and of the wire, and the calculated values

160                     Dr. E. Taylor Jones on
agreed within 4 and 3 per cent, respectively, with the values
obtained electromagnetically.
   A series of observations was then made of the tractive force
and at the same time of the induction-throws caused by the
coils falling from the isthmus, the electromagnet being excited
by various currents ranging from 0 to 25 amp.
   One great difficulty in measuring the tractive force was due
to the fact that the iron bar, and, more especially, the steel
bar (which in the process of hardening might easily be slightly
bent), often got jammed in its socket. If the bar was pulled
exactly in the direction of its axis and that of its socket the
jamming was avoided, and the friction was very slight. This
was determined by removing the other pole-piece and demag
netizing the electromagnet as far as possible in order to
remove all magnetic action. By properly guiding the brass
rod M, the position was then found in which the weight
necessary to pull the bar out was a minimum, and this was
found to be less than 5 grammes weight, which is negligible
in comparison with the tractive forces obtained later.
   But if the bar was pulled only slightly to one side, it
became jammed in its socket, and about 700 grms. weight
more were necessary to pull it out. In all subsequent
measurements therefore the position was found, by properly
guiding the brass rod, in which the tractive force was a
minimum, and this was taken as the magnetic tractive force.
The question as to whether the magnetization had any appre
ciable effect on the friction was tested by pushing the longer
bar C2 through both pole-pieces (C, being removed), so that it
lay in a symmetrical position of minimum potential energy.
No effect on the friction could be detected when the exciting
current was made or broken”.

parts of the curves, two bars were used which were cut from
the same pieces as the isthmus bars. The curves were then
  * This arrangement, in which no gap existed in the isthmus, afforded
at the same time a means of testing how far the gap in the usual
arrangement caused disturbance by spreading the lines of induction. It
was found that in the strong fields here used this was a considerably
smaller source of error than might be supposed after certain experiments
at less intense fields.

determined for these by means of a du Bois Magnetic Balance”,
which had been tested at the Reichsanstalt. These experi
ments, as well as all the tractive-force measurements, were
made with increasing magnetization f. This integral formed
only a comparatively small correction, so that it was not
necessary to know it very accurately.
                         Final Experiments.
   From the galvanometer-throws the values of B and H were
calculated, and their difference gave, on being divided by 4T,
the magnetization I. The greatest values of I obtained for
the soft iron and the hard steel were 1818 C.G.S. and 1556
C.G.S. respectively, and these occurred at a field of about
10,600 C.G.S. At stronger fields I appears to have rather
smaller valuest; a similar apparent diminution of I was also
observed by Ewing $.
   It must, however, be remarked that the isthmus method is
never very suitable for accurate measurements, and that the
arrangement described above is particularly unfavourable to
accurate measurements of I from the difference of B and H.;
firstly, because of the disturbing influence of the gap in the
isthmus; and, secondly, because the bars are not continuous
with the pole-pieces, as in the original arrangement of Ewing
and Low.
    No valid conclusions can therefore be drawn from these
experiments as to the course of the magnetization-curve; the
 induction in the isthmus, however, which is the quantity of
chief importance in these experiments, was, in consequence
of its direct determination, known with sufficient accuracy.
    With each value of the current, the measurements were
 repeated several times. For given values of the galvanometer
 throws, the minimum tractive force was very constant, so that
 even at the highest values it could be determined to within
 about 30 grammes weight.
    The greatest magnetic tractive force measured was 94.30
 grms. weight, the cross section of the iron bar being 0.1896
 sq. centim. This gives a pull of 49.73 kilogs. weight per sq.
 centim. (707.4 lb. wt. per sq. inch).

 connexion.
   1 In later experiments made with a continuous isthmus (see p. 160,
 footnote) this diminution of I was not observed.

   According to Maxwell's theory (l. c. § 643) the first term
   2
# is the total electromagnetic tension existing in the narrow
air-gap between the ends of the two bars; similarly, H°/8tg
is the tension in the gap, depending only on the “external”
field H. The correctness of this interpretation of the term
H*/879 follows from the well-known experiments of Quincke
and others.
   This latter part of the stress is not included in the tractive
force in the present arrangement : it merely serves to com
press the brass pillars S1, S2, S3.
   If the bar C, were firmly fixed in its pole-piece (instead of
sliding in it), and if the two halves of the electromagnet were
pulled from each other, the pull in grammes weight in this
case, corrected for the tension due to all those tubes of in
duction which do not pass along the isthmus, would be equal to
 -                     2     :
                    - x area of contact.
                     8Tg
   This case corresponds theoretically to the arrangement of
my former experiments, but cannot of course be practically
carried out.
                Measurement of High Inductions.
   After Maxwell's law of tractive force, or electromagnetic
stress, had been verified as explained above for inductions up
to 40,000 C.G.S., its general truth could be assumed. And
just as various physicists have conversely used the tractive
force for the measurement of lower inductions, it now seemed
feasible to apply a similar process to the measurement of the
highest attainable inductions, all other known methods failing
in this case.               -
   I therefore arranged a few more experiments with this
object. Two pole-pieces of 120° vertical angle were made of
the very best annealed Swedish iron. The point of one was
slightly flattened, ground plane, and polished, so that it pre
sented a small circular pole-face whose diameter was only a
fraction of a millimetre. Through the opposite pole-piece a
slightly conical hole was bored,    £        which a long wire of

166                 Dr. E. Taylor Jones on
annealed soft iron (of diameter 0.586 millim.) could be drawn,
which fitted accurately in front and more loosely behind.
The friction was thus only a fraction of 1 gramme weight.
   The end of the wire was also carefully polished and, as well
as the opposite small pole-face, examined and measured with
a Zeiss microscope.
   With a magnetizing current of 25 amperes, the weight
supported in this case was 249 grms. weight; this corresponds
to a pull of 92.39 kilogs. weight per sq. centim. (1314 lb. wt.
per sq. inch).
   The maximum value of the magnetization was, moreover,
determined by means of an isthmus consisting of a bundle of
50 pieces of the same wire pushed through the former pole
pieces of 78° 28' vertical angle. This value was found to be
about 1800 C.G.S.
   Taking also 500 grms. weight as the approximate value of
                 I
the integral  #| HdI, we have from these data the values of
                0
B”—H”, and of B-H=4trI; from these were deduced the
values
                       B=61,900 C.G.S.
                      H=39,300 ,
These experiments were extended still further by drawing out
the wire to a thickness of 0.2412 millim., and narrowing
down the hole in the pole-piece correspondingly.
   After the wire had been once more annealed in a spirit-flame
and its end ground plane, the weight supported with a
current of 40 amperes was 52.5 grms. weight, corresponding
to a pull of 1149 kilogs. weight per sq. centim. (1634 lb.
wt. per sq. inch).
   Hence follow, as above, the values
                      B = 74,200 C.G.S.
                      H= 51,600        35
and the permeability is only
                       A = B/H = 1:44.
   The calculated value of H from the Stefan-Ewing loga
rithmic formula is 50,450 C.G.S., assuming that the conical
pole-pieces are uniformly magnetized with a maximum inten
sity of 1800 C.G.S. To this must be added about 750 C.G.S.
due to the direct action of the coils of the electromagnet with

                       Magnetic Tractive Force.                    167
a current of 40 amperes. The total calculated field is thus
51,200 C.G.S., which agrees well with the value found above.
    In this experiment the area of the isthmus was about
-:55 of the area of the base of the conical pole-piece.
    'nduction (B=74,200) exists also by continuity in the
narrow air-gap at the contact, and here it is to be regarded
as “external” field.        This will not be much altered at the
moment of separation as long as the gap is narrow in com
parison with its transverse dimension. It was then observed
with a magnifying glass that, unless the apparatus was very
 carefully cleaned, small microscopical iron filings flew into the
 gap when separation took place and formed new “isthmuses”
 across it, whose thickness was very small in comparison with
 that of the 3 millim, iron wire, so that their self-demagnetizing
 effect could be neglected. The induction B' in these is thus
              B’=74200+47t. 1800–96,800 C.G.S.
    We may therefore conclude that inductions of nearly
 100,000 C.G.S. can exist in iron without any special occur
 TenC6.
    If the wire is pulled back so that its end is in the plane of
 the edge of the opening, the field between the pole-faces is
 then about 60,000 C.G.S.; it only extends, however, over a
 few tenths of a millimetre”.
    At the instant of separation a tension of (74.200)*/87g=224.
 kilogs. weight per square centim. (3185 lb. wt. per sq. inch)
 is transmitted across the air-gap ; this is about the limit
 of elasticity of lead. In this connexion it is interesting to
 remember that the tension between the plates of an air
 condenser at atmospheric pressure cannot far exceed 2 grms.
 weight per square centim. without a spark appearing. An
 absolute vacuum, however, or a body of high specific induc
 tive capacity can transmit much greater tensions.
     My best thanks are due to Dr. H. du Bois, in whose
 laboratory the above experiments were carried out, for his
 help and advice.

                     Summary of the Research.
Po'               in his Traité de Mécanique (Paris, 1833, t. ii.
         pp. 368–392) f discusses the laws of the transverse
vibrations of a bar free at its ends and supported under its two
nodes. He shows that the frequency of the vibrations of the
bar is given by an equation, which, reduced to its simplest ex
pression, is N=W x 1.0279        #:  in which N is the number of
vibrations per second of the bar, t its thickness, l its length,
 and V the velocity of sound in the direction of the length of
the bar.
    To ascertain how nearly the frequency of the transverse
vibrations of a bar, computed by Poisson’s formula, agrees
with the result obtained by experiment, the following method
of experimenting was used.
    Rods of steel, aluminium, brass, glass, and of American
white-pine (Pinus Strobus)—substances differing greatly in
their moduli of elasticity, densities, and physical structures—
were carefully wrought so as to have the length of 1:5+ metre,
the thickness of 0.5 cm., the width of 2 cms., and a uniform
section throughout their lengths. The velocity of sound in
these rods was determined by vibrating them longitudinally
at a temperature of 20°, while held between the thumb and
forefinger, and their frequencies of vibration ascertained by
the standard forks of Dr. R. Koenig's tonometer.
    Out of each of these long rods were cut three bars of the
length of 20 cms, and these bars, also at 20°, were supported
on threads at their nodes, vibrated transversely by striking
them at their centre with a rubber hammer, and their
frequencies of vibration determined by the forks of the tono
meter.                                         -
    The mean departure of the observed from the computed
numbers of transverse vibrations (see Table I.) is 3's ; the
computed frequency being always in excess of the observed,

    the observed frequency.

    N = number of vibrations per second at 20°.
       The close agreement of the computed and observed values
    shows that, by vibrating a bar at various temperatures,
    the variation of its modulus of elasticity with change in its
   temperature can be obtained.                   We observe N at various

    and the modulus         M=\".            As t, l, and d (the density of
                                    g
    the bar) vary with the temperature, the coefficient of
    expansion of each bar and its density at 4° were determined,
    so that the dimensions and density of the bar could be
    computed for each of the temperatures at which it was
    vibrated.
        Experiments were made on five bars of different steels, on
    two of aluminium, on one of St. Gobain glass, one of brass,
    one of bell-metal, one of zinc, and one of silver.                 The results
    of these experiments may be summed up as follows:—
The modulus of elasticity of St. Gobain glass is 1:16   per cent, less at 100° than at 0°.

        The decrease of the modulus of elasticity of glass, aluminium,
    and brass is proportional to the increase of temperature;
    straight lines referred to coordinates giving the results of
    experiments on these substances. The five steels, silver, and
    zinc give curves, convex upwards, showing that the modulus
    decreases more rapidly than the increment of temperature;
    while bell-metal alone gives a curve which is concave
    upwards, its modulus decreasing less than the increment of
    temperature. (See Curves, fig. 5, p. 185.)
        The more carbon a steel contains, the less is the fall of its
    modulus of elasticity on elevating the temperature of the
    steel.   Thus, the modulus of the steel with 1:286 per                   cent. of
    carbon is 2.24 per cent. less at 100° than at 0°, while the
    steel containing 0.15 per cent. of carbon has a modulus at
    100° which is 3.09 per cent. lower than its modulus at 0°.
        So far as experiments on a single steel containing nickel

   170         Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.
   permit of any general deductions, it appears that the presence
   of nickel in a low carbon steel lowers its modulus of elasticity.
   Thus, steels No. 3 and 4, having respectively 47 and ’51 per
   cent. of carbon, have a modulus of 2130 x 10"; while steel
   No. 5, containing 27 per cent. of carbon and 3 per cent. of
   nickel, has a modulus of 2080 x 10", which is 2:35 per cent.
   lower than that of steels Nos. 3 and 4.
      The presence of nickel in a steel may, in a diminished
   degree, have the effect of carbon in lessening the lowering of
   the modulus when the temperature of the steel is increased.
   Thus the percentage of the lowering of the modulus, by
   heating from 0° to 100°, of steel No. 5 containing 0:27 of
   carbon and 3 per cent. of nickel, is the same as that of steel
   No. 3 with 0:47 per cent. of carbon.
      If a bar of any one of the substances experimented on is
   struck with the same energy of blow, by letting fall on the
   centre of the bar a rather hard rubber-ball from a fixed height,
   the sound emitted by the bar diminishes in intensity and in
   duration as the temperature of the bar is raised. Thus:

   1.5 sec. At 62° it vibrated for so short a time that it only
   gave three beats with forks of 1090 and 1082 v. s.                   At 80° it
   was not possible to determine the pitch of the bar, and at 100°
   the bar when struck gave the sound of a thud. The bar of
   silver acted in a similar manner to the bar of zinc–it was
   even less sonorous than zinc,-thus flatly denying the “silvery
   tones'' attributed to it.
      These phenomena do not depend on the fall of modulus, but
   on changes in the structure of the metal on heating it, which
   cause the blow to heat the bar and not to vibrate it.
      Bell-metal was found to be an alloy peculiarly well suited
   for bells, as the intensity and duration of its vibrations were
   the same at 50° as at 0°, all other substances showing a
   marked diminution of intensity and duration of sound at 50°.
      A bar of unannealed drawn brass, after it has been heated
   to 100°, has its modulus at 20° increased £5 per cent.

      In this research I had the good fortune to have the
   assistance of Dr. Rudolph Koenig, of Paris. He not only
   placed at my service the resources of his laboratory and

workshop, but generously gave me constant assistance during
the experiments—making the determinations of the numbers
of vibration of the rods and bars with the standard forks of
his tonometer. Without his aid this work could not have been
done. For instance, in the cases of the bars of silver and zinc
the beats they give with a fork are so few that they cannot
be compared with a chronometer; but Dr. Koenig, from his
long experience in the estimation of beats, was enabled to
form an accurate judgment of their number per second from
the rhythm of the beats. The determination of pitches
extending through such a range of vibrations as occurs in this
research can only be made with Dr. Koenig’s “grand tono
mêtre’—a unique apparatus of precision, giving the fre
quency of vibrations from 32 to 43690 v. S., and really
indispensable to the physicist who would engage in precise
quantitative work in Acoustics.
    We now proceed to give accounts of the several operations
 performed in the progress of this research.
         Determination of the Velocity of Sound in Rods.
    In the determinations of the velocity of sound in the rods of
 1.5 m. in length, I used the method of Chladni*. Kundt's
 method of obtaining nodal lines of fine powders in a tube, by
vibrating a rod whose end carries a cork which fits loosely the
end of the tube, is not accurate. The weight and friction of the
cork, the necessity of firmly clamping the rod at a node, and,
above all, the want of knowledge of the velocity of sound in the
 air of glass tubes of different diameters, renders this method, so
 beautiful and ingenious, worthless for accurate measures of the
 velocity of sound in solids.                    -
    The curves in fig. 1 show the very diverse determinations
 of the velocity of sound in the air in tubes of different dia
 meters by the physicists Kundtt, Schneebelit, Seebeck $,
 and Kayser ||. The velocity of sound in metres is given on
 the axis of Y; the diameter of the tube in centimetres on the
 axis of X. Ku stands for Kundt, Sch for Schneebeli, Se for
 Seebeck, and Ke for Kayser. The most precise measures of
 velocities are those of Kayser, who closed the end of the tube
 with a cork attached to the end of a steel bar, while the other
 end of the bar was securely clamped. The frequency of the
 transverse vibrations of the bar was registered by a style

weight and friction of the cork introduced no error.     In a
similar manner I obtained the velocity, marked M in fig, 1,
by vibrating a rod of aluminium. The frequency of the

longitudinal vibrations of the rod was measured while the
' at the end of the rod was vibrating in the mouth     of the
tube. The result agrees closely with Kayser's. It is needless
to discuss the curves of fig. 1.

   The method of Chladni, used exactly as that eminent man
used it, remains the best we have. It is important, however,
to note that the rod must be held between the thumb and
forefinger when it is vibrated and not clamped when vibrated.
When clamped it always gives a higher frequency, as shown
by the following experiments —
        Steel rod clamped . . . . . . . 3429.2
        Steel rod held between fingers . . .3428.4
        Aluminium rod clamped . . . . 3377:0
        Aluminium rod held between fingers. 3376.4
   The frequency of the vibrations of the rods of steel, brass,
aluminium, glass, and pine wood, when held at the middle of
their lengths and vibrated so as to give their fundamental
tones, gave exactly the octaves of these fundamental tones
when held at one-quarter of their lengths and vibrated.
   Determination of the Lengths of the Long Rods and of the
              Lengths and Thicknesses of the Bars.
   The lengths of the rods of 1.5 + metres were ascertained by
comparison with the rod of steel whose length was measured at
the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The lengths
and thicknesses of the bars which were vibrated transversely
were measured with micrometer calipers. The readings of
these calipers were tested by comparison at 20° with a series
of standards of various lengths of inches and fractions of
inches, made for me with great care by Mr. George M. Bond,
who has charge of the gauge department of the Pratt,
Whitney Co. In reducing the comparisons to centimetres,
I adopted the value of the inch as equal to 25.4 millimetres.
In obtaining the length of a bar, the mean of several measures
in the axis of the bar and in directions parallel to the axis and
at various distances from it was adopted. The thickness of a
bar was taken as the mean of measures taken throughout the
length of the bar at points designated by the intersections
of lines drawn parallel and at right angles to the axis of the
 bar.                                  -
   The dimensions of the bars were measured at 20, except
those of steels Nos. 3, 4, 5, which were measured at 18° 25.
  Determinations of the Coefficients of Expansion of the Bars.
   To determine the coefficients of expansion of the bars,
I devised the apparatus shown in fig. 2. In a brass tube, T,

the bar, B, rests in slots in the supports, S, S'. The tube T
is slightly shorter than the bar B. Washers of rubber (shown
in black in the figure), of the same diameter as the outside
diameter of the tube, are placed in the screw-caps, C, C.
These washers are perforated with holes of diameters smaller
than the thickness of the bar. When the caps are screwed up,
the rubber washers press against the ends of the bar. This
         F                R              G

pressure is further increased by flat rings which surround the
holes in the washers, and are pressed against these washers by
means of the springs, D, D'. By this arrangement the sur
faces of the ends of the bars are exposed, while the contact
of the washers on the bars makes a water- and steam-tight
joint. Thus the bar may be surrounded with ice, or with
steam, or with a current of water of different temperatures,
and be cooled or heated up to its terminal planes, while the
holes in the washers allow the micrometer-screws, M, M', to
be brought to contact with the terminal planes of the bar.
Two helical springs are attached to the column A. The
other ends of these springs are fastened to rods projecting
from the tube T. Thus the same pressure of contact is always
made between the bar and the end of the micrometer-screw M.
The tube T is supported in Ws, W, W", and the greater part of

           Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.      175
the weight of the tube is taken off the Vs by helical springs
fastened to a frame above the apparatus. The tension of these
springs can be so regulated that the tube rests on the Vs with
the same pressure when it has steam passing through it and
when it is filled with ice. The column, A, and the Vs, V, V",
are insulated from the base of the apparatus by thin plates of
ebonite, e. Between the binding-screws, E and E', and con
nected by wires, are the voltaic cell F, the galvanometer G,
and a box of resistance-coils, R. The micrometer-screw, M',
with which the variations in length of a bar are measured,
is mounted as follows:—The screw passes through its nut in
a massive brass plate which rotates around nicely fitted
centres at H. These centres are supported by two side plates
not shown in the figure. A spring, K, is fastened to the
lower part of the swinging nut-plate and brings this plate
against the plate, L, firmly fastened to the base of the appa
ratus. When the swinging plate is vertical and the axis of
the screw horizontal, the swinging plate fits accurately the
surface of the fixed plate, L. By turning the rod, N, the
swinging plate and its screw can be rotated away from the
bar. This arrangement allows the screw to be swung out
of the way while the tube, T, is being placed in the Vs.
Also, it prevents any strain between the micrometer-screw, M",
and the column, A.; which would take place if M' were fixed
and it should be brought in contact with a hot bar in the
tube, T.
   With careful manipulation, successive electric-contacts can
be made on a bar in the tube, T, surrounded by ice, so
that the variations in a series of measures will not exceed
Tokyo mm., with a resistance of about 200 ohms placed in
the circuit.
   It may be reasonably objected to this apparatus that when
the micrometer-screw touches the bar at 0° it is cooled and
shortened, and that when it touches the bar at 100°, or at
temperatures higher than that of the screw, the latter is
heated and elongated. This error, however, is quite small,
and may be neglected in our work. If we assume that one
centimetre of the screw is heated 10°, which is a large
estimate, considering the duration of contact of screw and
bar during a measure, the shortening or elongation of 1 cm.
of the screw by cooling or heating it 10° amounts to only
:00.12 mm., or It'ss of the length of the bar. This change
in the length of # screw will affect the coefficient of
expansion of the bars only 00000006.

        Determination of the Densities of the Bars at 4°,
   The bar whose density was to be determined was immersed
in water at 4° for a couple of hours. The bar was then sus
pended by a platinum wire in water at 4° and weighed. The
bar was then removed from the wire and a quantity of water
equal in volume to the volume of the bar was added to the
water in the vessel, and the platinum wire, now immersed
exactly as it was when the bar was attached to it, was weighed.
This weight, subtracted from the previous weighing, gave the
weight of the bar in water. Every precaution was taken to
prevent, by means of screens, the action on the balance of
the currents of cold air in the balance-case, which are pro
duced by the constant descent of air from the sides of the
cool vessel.
 The Apparatus in which the Bars were Heated and Cooled. On
   the precautions used so that one is sure of having the real
   temperature of the bar when it is vibrated.
   The apparatus used to heat and cool the bar is shown in
fig. 3. In a brass box, C, is inclosed a box, C', containing
the bar, B, supported on its nodes, N, N, by threads held by
upright rods. From this central box two tubes, T, P, pass
through the outer box C. The inner box is made water-tight
and steam-tight by a rubber washer which is pressed between
the top of the box and its cover by means of screws. Through
the tube, T, the bar is vibrated by letting fall upon its centre
a rubber ball fastened to a light wooden rod. On the blow of
the ball it rebounds, and the rod is caught by the fingers in its
upward motion. The cork is then at once replaced in the
tube, T. The sound from the bar is conveyed to the ear, at
E, by means of a tube (fig. 4). One branch of this bifurcated
tube leads through a rubber tube to the pipe, P, of the box,
fig. 3. The other branch leads to the fork, F, the number
of whose beats per second made with the vibrating bar is
measured by a chronometer. The pipe, S, allows the steam
to issue when water is boiled in the box, C', by a gas lamp.
The flow of gas through this lamp was neatly regulated by a
stop-cock turned by a long lever. The box, C, is covered,
except at the bottom, with thick felt.
   To determine the frequencies of vibration of a bar through
a range of temperature from 0° to 100°, the following method
was used. The box, C, was filled with ice, surrounding the
inner box, C". It thus remained for an hour so that the
boxes were cooled down to 0°, and the moisture in the inner

box had been condensed so far as it could be at 0°. The bar,
which had been in ice for two hours, was wiped dry and quickly
introduced into the inner box. A thermometer, T (made by
Baudin and corrected), which entered the boxes through
stuffing-boxes, and whose bulb touched the under surface of
the bar, was read till it became stationary. The bar was now
vibrated, and its frequency of vibration determined for the
temperature given by the thermometer.
   The lamp was now placed under the box, and the water in
it boiled till the thermometer reached its maximum reading
and the reading remained stationary during a half-hour.
The vibration frequency at this temperature was taken. The
flame of the lamp was now lowered and the box allowed to
cool very slowly, at the rate of 1° fall of temperature in about
eight minutes. When the thermometer read 80°, 60°, 40°,
the flame of the lamp was carefully adjusted, so that these
successive temperatures were maintained during 15 minutes.
We then took the frequency of vibration of the bar.
   The numbers of vibrations of the forks used in the deter
minations of the pitches of the bars were corrected for tem
perature by the coefficient 0001118, determined   '.     Koenig
in 1880 (Quelques Expériences d'Acoustique, Paris, 1882,
p. 172 et seq.).
   The subsequent tables show the results of the experiments
and give the computations of velocities and moduli founded
on them. The curves express graphically the effect of change
of temperature on the modulus of elasticity of all the bars
experimented on. The circles, on or near the curves, give
the data as determined by the experiments.
   In Table III., T=temperature of bars, l= the length, t = the
thickness, and W = the velocity of sound through the bars, in
centimetres. M=the modulus in grammes per square centi
metre section of the bar. g., at Paris, equals 980-96. D= the
density, and N = the number of vibrations of bar per second
at temperature, T.
   All of the bars were annealed, except those of Jonas and
Colver steel, of the French aluminium, and of brass; these
were experimented on just as they came from the draw-bench.
   For the analyses of the substances of the bars experi
mented on, I am indebted to my colleagues, Professors
Stillman and Leeds.

    Says, “my own experiments show that both the torsional and
longitudinal elasticities of iron and steel are decreased by about
2} per cent. when the temperature is raised from 0° to 100°.”

    Modulus of a piano wire of 19 mm. diam. 5 per cent. less
at 100° than at 0°.
    The results of Wertheim’s experiments giving an increase to
the modulus, as the temperature rises, of iron, iron wire, wire
of English cast-steel, steel wire drawn to blue, and silver,
have not been confirmed in any instance by subsequent
experiments; only for cast-steel rod and copper did he obtain
a diminution of modulus for a rise of temperature from 18°
to 100°. Yet he found that a wire of English cast-steel had
a modulus 23 per cent. higher at 100° than at 18°.
           On the Acoustical Properties of Aluminium.
    The low density (2:7) of aluminium combined with a
modulus of elasticity of only 712 x 10" render this metal easy
to set in vibration; a transverse blow given to a bar of this
metal causes it to vibrate with an amplitude of vibration
greater than that which the same energy of blow gives to a
similar bar of steel or of brass. This fact has given rise to
the popular opinion that aluminium has sonorous properties
greatly exceeding those of any other metal. This opinion is
 erroneous. If a bar of aluminium and a bar of brass having
the same length and breadth and giving the same note, are
struck transversely so that the bars have the same amplitude
of vibration, the bars give equal initial intensity of sounds;
but the bar of aluminium from its low density and because of
 its internal friction will vibrate less than one-third as long as
 the bar of brass. Thus, a bar of aluminium and a bar of brass
 of the same length and width and of such thickness that they
 gave the same note, SOL of 768 v. d., were vibrated so that
 the sounds at the moment of the blows were, as near as could
 be judged, of the same intensity. The duration of the sound
 of the brass bar was 100 seconds; the sound of the aluminium
 bar lasted 30 seconds.
    The readiness with which a bar of aluminium vibrates when
 acted on by acrial vibrations of the same frequency as those

  194        Dr. A. M. Mayer's Researches in Acoustics.
 given by the bar, gives one the means of making many charm
  ing experiments in which “sympathetic vibrations” come
 into play.
    I here describe an experiment which I devised to show the
 interference of sound in a manner similar to analogous ex
 periments in the case of light. The resonant box on which
 Koenig mounts his UT; (1024 v. d.) fork is open at both ends
 and has a length of nearly a half wave of the sound of the
 fork. If this resonant box is held with its axis vertical, above
 an aluminium bar in tune with the vibrating fork, the bar does
 not enter into sympathetic vibration with the fork, because the
 Sonorous pulses, on reaching the aluminium bar from the two
 openings of the resonant box, differ in phase by one half wave
 length. But if the axis of the box is held parallel to the axis
 of the bar, then the sonorous waves reaching the bar have
 travelled over equal lengths from the openings at the ends of
 the box, and these waves conspire in their action and the
 aluminium bar enters into sympathetic vibration.
    As this experiment is an interesting one I here give details
 as to the manner of making it. The bar of aluminium has a
 large surface, having a length of 17 cms. and a width of
 5 cms.    The two nodal lines, which are at a distance from the
ends of the bar equal to #ths of its length, are drawn on the bar.
 The bar is supported under these nodal lines on threads
 stretched on a frame. This frame is of such a height that the
 under surface of the aluminium bar is 8.4 cms, or one quarter
 wave-length, above the surface of the table, so that the vibra
 tions of the bar and those of the waves reflected from the
 table will act together. The upper surface of the bar is
covered with a piece of thick cardboard, in which is cut a
 rectangular aperture, having for length the distance between
 the nodal lines and a width equal to that of the bar. As this
 piece of cardboard rests on supports which lift it a slight dis
 tance above the surface of the bar, the latter, when it vibrates,
 does not send to the ear the vibrations of the surfaces of
 the bar included between its nodal lines and its ends, which
 vibrations are opposed in phase to those given by the central
 area of the bar. Thus the sound emitted by the bar is much
increased and the experiment rendered more delicate and im
proved in every way. I have found that the experiment
succeeds best when the centre of the resonant box is held
about 58 cms., or 7  ' above the surface of the aluminium bar.
This experiment works best in the open air, away from the
action of sound-waves reflected from the walls and ceiling of
a l'OOlil.

   The fact that aluminium gives, from a comparatively slight
blow, a great initial vibration, and that its vibrations last for
a short time, render this metal peculiarly well suited for the
construction of those musical instruments formed of bars
which are sounded by percussion and the duration of whose
sounds is not desirable.
    I had hopes that aluminium would prove to be a good
substance out of which to make plates on which to form the
acoustic figures of Chladni. Experiments have shown that
aluminium is not suited to this purpose. I had plates of
aluminium carefully cast, with 2 cms. of thickness. These
plates were turned down on the face-plate of a lathe to thick
nesses of 2 mm. and 3.8 mm. Three of these plates were
quite homogeneous in elasticity, for the Chladni figures when
obtained on them were symmetrical. Yet the Chladni figures
were difficult to produce, because it is difficult to obtain a pure
tone from an aluminium plate. The sound is generally more
or less composite; therefore the plate in its vibration tends to
form two or more figures at the same time, and the con
sequence is that either no figure is formed or one is given
that is not sharply defined. One square plate of 30.8 cms.
on the side and 38 cm. thick, gave quite clearly the three
following tones:—UT, (1), SOL, (2), and SOL, (3). Cor
responding respectively to the Chladni figures of (1) two
lines drawn between opposite points of the centre of sides of
plate; (2) figure formed of the two diagonals drawn between
the corners of plate; (3) figure similar to (1) but with corners
of plate cut off by curved lines. Figure 3 corresponded so
nearly to the sound of SOL, that a vibrating SOL, fork when
held near the plate set the latter into vigorous vibration.
    Another difficulty met with in using plates of aluminium for
Chladni’s figures is that sand, even when entirely free from salt
and from the globular grains of wind-blown sand, does not
move freely over a vibrating surface of aluminium, whether
this surface has been polished or has been slightly tarnished
and roughened by the action of alkali.                              -
    There is one serious objection to the use of aluminium in the
construction of musical and acoustical instruments, and that
is the great effect that change of temperature has upon
 its elasticity. If a bar of aluminium and a bar of cast-steel
 be tuned at a certain temperature to exact unison, a change
from that temperature will affect the frequency of vibration
 of the aluminium bar 2' times as much as the same change of
temperature will affect the bar of cast-steel.

      XXIII. On the Freezing-points of Dilute Solutions.
                 By W. NERNST and R. ABEGG*.
Th:       lowering of the freezing-point of dilute solutions has
       been recently carefully investigated by two observers,
Mr. Jonest and Mr. Loomist, but they have found very
different values for the lowering in the case of non-electrolytes.
   No reader of the two researches could fail to see that
Mr. Loomis had worked with great care, and that Mr. Jones,
on the other hand, had neglected some very obvious pre
cautions.
   Indeed we found that a very dangerous source of error,
viz. the influence of the external temperature, which Loomis
approximately avoided, made Mr. Jones’s results in the case
of non-electrolytes entirely worthless. At the same time we
showed how the influence of the external temperature is to be
computed, since we developed a mathematical-physical theory
for its effect upon the freezing-point.
   To our surprise Mr. Jones sought to defend his results
by attacking our research in a most condemnatory manner.
How far he is justified in this can be seen from the following
brief observations.
   Mr. Jones had nothing to say against the above-mentioned
theory, except (page 386 of this Journal, 5th series, vol. xl.)
that “the introduction of a correction-term when amounting
to more than 20 per cent. would not tend to increase our
confidence in the final results.” Ought such an argument
to be taken seriously when a very elementary acquaintance
with physical measurements shows that exact determinations
can be made in spite of large correction-terms, provided these
are correctly computed. So long as Mr. Jones has not
proved any error here he must discard his own results. In
reference to the same point Mr. Jones remarks, “Their
correction-term . . . . . appears to me to involve the assump
tion that K for solutions is the same as for water, which
assumption is gratuitous and unallowable” [p. 385]. Evi
dently Mr. Jones has not correctly understood our theory.
We have in no way assumed that K, the rate of dissolving
 (Lösungsgeschwindigkeit) solid substances in solutions and in
water is the same; but, on the other hand, we have em
phasized the fact of the great difference in the values for
water and solutions, and we have computed them.

             On the Freezing-points of Dilute Solutions.              197
   We had ourselves called attention to the fact that we had
at our disposal thermometers reading only to Ilo" direct, and
to Tokyo” by estimation, so that our determinations of the
lowering of the freezing-points could for this reason be accu
rate to within only one to two thousandths of a degree. Mr.
       5                    •                1     o
Jones's numbers, which read to 10,000                 are, as we have
shown, untrustworthy to within at least hundredths of a degree.
   Mr. Jones then remarked that it was not “apparent” to him
why our two series for NaCl in very dilute solutions should
'. by 5 per cent. He neglected to remark that in reality
such differences are limited to the most dilute solutions, and
on that account lie within the limits of experimental errors
given by us. Moreover in the second series for NaCl the
greater values for the lowerings may be accounted for by the
presence of larger quantities of the solid substance, since in
this method larger quantities of undercooled liquid are intro
duced. In any case it is self-evident to every one who knows
the elements of the computation of errors, that no conclusions
can be drawn presupposing a greater degree of accuracy in our
results than that given by us. Nevertheless in spite of this
 Mr. Jones concluded, from our results with ethyl alcohol, that
 a rise of the molecular lowering took place which was far
 within the experimental errors.
    That we used substances of sufficient purity for the purpose
 we had in view, that is, substances whose possible impurities
were absolutely unessential, we certainly did not especially
 mention. Every one knows that comparatively pure NaCl,
ethyl alcohol, and cane-sugar are easy to obtain.
    We refrain from criticizing the few new experiments of
 Mr. Jones, partly because we have not the least interest in
carrying on a further controversy, partly because the criticism
 given in our earlier research would simply need to be repeated
 word for word *.         Moreover Mr. Jones admits indeed the
influence of the external temperature (page 389), and in that
 the existence of a great source of error which he formerly
 entirely neglected.
    In conclusion a purely personal remark. Mr. Jones spoke
 (page 385) of “the unusual lack of courtesy.” That Mr. Jones
   * For instance, Mr. Jones maintained that the influence of his “gentle”
stirring was imperceptible, i. e. determined from his feeling instead of
quantitatively. That the thermometer-reading remained unchanged is
no proof for his assertion according to what our theory as well as experi
ments showed.

introduces no proof for this assertion no one could wonder
from the above. But that each one may judge for himself
we insert the following passage from a paper in which we refer
to the results of other authors, and to which alone Mr. Jones's
severe reproach could relate:—
   “It is not without interest to test the earlier values for this
source of error through which partly they have been rendered
so considerably inaccurate: for instance, for the molecular
lowering of the freezing-point (computed from Raoult) for
dilute (about 1 per cent.) cane-sugar solutions the following
values were found by
         Arrhenius.     Raoult.     Jones.     Loomis.
             2.02        2-07       2-18         1.81
but we find, as was mentioned, 1.86 (uncorrected from 1:6 to
2:1). Arrhenius used the usual Beckmann apparatus with
quite an energetic cooling-mixture: this explains why his
value is considerably too large. Raoult gives more experi
mental details, and from these one can conclude that he kept
the cooling-bath about 3° below the freezing-point of the
solution. This investigator seems to have appreciated the
essential importance of the cooling-bath, for he says, “If the
influence of the cooling-bath upon the temperature of the
liquid at the moment of freezing is not nought, yet it is
indeed the same in the experiments to be compared and
vanishes from the differences, so that the lowering of the
freezing-point is not influenced by it. The assumption which
Raoult here makes is identical with the supposition that K
has the same value for pure water and for solutions, which
is certainly not the case with cane-sugar according to our
experience. His values must accordingly be considerably too
high. Still more erroneous are the values of Jones, who used
a cooling-mixture of ice and salt, therefore an exceedingly
strong cooler.    If Jones had used a single time in the case of
cane-sugar another cooling-mixture, or even only a freezing
vessel of other dimensions, he would have observed with the
great accuracy with which he read the apparent freezing
points the influence of these factors, and would have refrained
from publishing his essentially accidental numbers. [Note:—
“Since the corrections for Jones’s values amount to hun
dredths of a degree, if the accuracy is to be increased to
within 0.0001° with the same external temperature and rate
of stirring only by using a greater volume of the liquid, in
order to reduce K (cf. equations (3) and (7) to its hundredth
part, it is necessary to increase the linear dimensions of the

                    XXIV. On Resultant Tones.
               By Professor J. D. EVERETT, F.R.S.*
1.   Th:      received theory of the generation of resultant tones
           in the ear may be summed up with rough accuracy
as follows t!—
    The drumskin being pulled inwards by the end of the
handle of the “hammer,” which is attached to its centre,
offers unsymmetrical resistance to displacement in the inward
and outward directions, so that the equation for the move
ment of its centre in free vibration would be
                           –3 =o"a + aw”,
or to a closer approximation
                           — & = o°x + a v" + 8.",
o, a, 8 being constants.
    The value of a when the second is the unit of time is less
than 60, hence the frequency of free vibration, being o/2T, is
less than 10.
    When two harmonic forces of frequencies m and n act upon
the drumskin, they produce, in addition to their own tones,
certain “resultant tones,” the one of largest amplitude being
the “first difference-tone,” of frequency n-m. The next
                                       -    2

the “first summation-tone,” of frequency n+m. Neither
of these tones will be audible unless the excursion v is so large
that aw” is sensible in comparison with o'a. There will also
be difference-tones of frequencies 2m-n and 2n—m, but
neither of these will be audible unless 8x" is sensible com
pared with o'v.
   2. This theory does not appear sufficient to account for the
loud resultant tones which are sometimes heard.              When a
Helmholtz siren is driven rapidly, with the rows of holes 9,

 12, 15, and 18 open, the resultant tone of frequency 3 on the
same scale is the most prominent tone in the whole volume of
sound.
   3. The view which I desire to put forward is closely con
nected with the well-known theorem of Fourier, that every
periodic variation can be resolved in one definite way into
harmonic constituents, whose periods must be included in the
list 1, #, #, #, &c., where 1 denotes the period of the given
variation itself. The corresponding frequencies will be as
1, 2, 3, 4, &c.
   In the majority of cases, when this analysis is carried out,
the fundamental constituent, represented by 1 in the above
lists, is the largest or among the largest ; but in the case of
a variation compounded of two simple tones with frequencies
in the ratio of two integers, neither being a multiple of the
other, the fundamental will be absent, and the Fourier series
will consist of only two terms, which in the language of
acoustics are harmonics of the fundamental.
   4. Clearness of thought is facilitated in these matters by
supposing a curve to be drawn, in which horizontal distance
represents time and vertical distance represents the quantity
whose variation is in question. Since the variation is periodic,
the curve will consist of repetitions of one and the same form,
in other words it will consist of a number of equal and similar
waves, and the wave-length stands for the complete period of
the variation.
   The point on which I wish to insist is, that if such a curve
representing the superposition of two harmonics of the funda
mental is in the first instance very accurately drawn, and is
then inaccurately copied in such a way that all successive
waves are treated alike, the inaccuracy is morally certain to
introduce the fundamental.
   Let y denote any ordinate, and 6 the time (or abscissa)
expressed in such a unit that 27 is the numerical value of
the wave-length or period; then the amplitude of the funda
mental is the square root of A* + B", where
                1                       1.
           A=   ''. 2r

                                                 9 sin 6d6.
   In the original curve both A and B vanish. Let y be the
altered value of y in the new and inaccurate curve, and let
2 denote y'-y; then we have, between the above limits,
        Wy cos 6d.6 = y cos 6d.6 +)- cos 6d.6 = 2 cos 6d6,
since  Jy cos 6.d6 is zero.

              Prof. J. D. Everett on Resultant Tones.           201
     But 2 may be regarded as a random magnitude, hence it is
 infinitely improbable that its different values exactly fulfil the
  condition  |2 cos 6d.6=0.     Therefore the new A is finite ; and
  similar reasoning shows that the new B is finite.
     If all the ordinates were changed in one uniform ratio, A
 and B would remain zero, and no new constituent would be
 introduced ; but any other change, unless specially planned
 to avoid introducing A and B, is practically certain to give
 A*-i-B” a finite value.
     5. I maintain that such a change is effected in the form of
 sonorous waves during their transmission from the external
 air to the sensory fibres by which we distinguish pitch. The
 waves are transmitted first from the air to the drumskin, then
 through two successive levers, the hammer and anvil, to the
 head of the stirrup, while the foot of the stirrup sits upon the
 membrane of the oval window, and passes on the vibrations
 through the membrane to the liquid on the other side in
 which the sensory fibres are immersed. The levers turn upon
 ligamentous fulcra, and have rubbing contact with each other.
 The wave-form cannot run the gauntlet of all these trans
missions without being to some extent knocked out of shape.
It is much as if a very accurately drawn curve, representing
the original wave-form, were copied and recopied, five times
in succession, by five different pantagraphs not very firm in
their connexions. The final copy so obtained would be sure
to exhibit sensible departures from the original.
    6. It appears likely that the chief seat of the disturbing
actions in the ear is the junction of the hammer and anvil.
“When the drumskin with the hammer is driven outwards,
the anvil is not obliged to follow it. The interlocking teeth
of the surfaces of the joint then separate, and the surfaces
glide over each other with very little friction”. Such action
is likely to introduce derangement, increasing generally with
the excursions of the drumskin, but not expressible as a defi
nite function of the ordinates of the wave-curve.           For a
given pressure on the drumskin, the pressure communicated
to the liquid in the cochlea will vary according to the relative
position and relative motion of the two portions of this joint.
    7. The principal resultant tone due to these actions is likely
to be that which corresponds to the complete period of the
actions, in other words the highest common fundamental of
the two primaries, or what old writers called the “grave har
monic.”     This will not be the same as the “first difference
tone” unless the ratio of the two primaries is of the form
               * Ellis's ‘Helmholtz, p. 133, 2nd edition."

m . m + 1 ; and I have satisfied myself, both by my own
trials and by a study of Koenig's experimental results, that
when the difference-tone and the common fundamental are
not identical, the common fundamental is usually the pre
dominant, and often the only audible resultant tone. (See
Appendix.)
   8. The common fundamental is, however, not the only
resultant tone that can be thus accounted for.           Similar
reasoning to that employed in reference to A and B suffices
to explain the introduction of any or all of the harmonics of
the fundamental; but it is to be expected, from the analogy
of ordinary experience in harmonic analysis, that the succes
sive constituents will usually be smaller and smaller as we
advance in the series. The octave is likely to be the largest
 of them ; and Koenig found, in several experiments with
primaries in the ratio of 3:5, that both the fundamental 1
and its octave 2 were distinctly heard as resultant tones.
   9. The following investigation bears on the relation be
tween beats and resultant tones. The expression
                         a cosm6+b cosnó
can be reduced to the form
                        A cos (* # "9-)
where A and e are given by
                A*=a^+b^+2ab cos (n-m)6,

                      a+
and the beating together of two tones not differing much in
 pitch is explained by the fact, definitely £i          in these
 formulae, that the whole effect may be regarded as a succession
 of waves with gradually varying amplitude. The frequency
 of the beats is the frequency of the maxima of A', and is the
 difference of m and n.
    We have ascribed resultant tones to alterations made in
 the wave-form by the action of the ear, such alterations being
 in general largest at those points at which the excursions of
 the drumskin are largest. These excursions are measured by
  +A, and the above investigation shows that their maxima
 have a frequency corresponding to the difference-tone. This
 is true whether m and n are commensurable or incommen
 surable.   If they are commensurable, their greatest common

             Prof. J. D. Everett on Resultant Tones.          203
measure will be the frequency of the complete cycle of change.
This cycle will not be conspicuous in the curve if the ratio of
n-m to #(n+m) is very small, but will assert itself more and
more as this ratio increases; and these remarks will apply to
the comparison of the fundamental with the first difference
tone.
   10. If the ear is able so to alter the form of waves
impinging upon it as to generate resultant tones, it is natural
to seek for some instance of a similar action in external bodies.
A violin is very susceptible, like the ear, to vibrations of all
frequencies between wide limits, and the sound-post serves,
like the ossicles of the ear, to transmit vibrations from one
portion to another. It is easy to produce resultant tones by
bowing two strings of a violin together. For example, in
the ordinary process of tuning, when the fourth and third
strings with frequencies as 2: 3 are combined, the resultant
tone 1 is very observable if attention be directed towards it.
But more striking effects are obtained when the resultant is
at a larger interval from the primaries. The major sixth 3: 5,
the major second 8:9, and the minor seventh 5:9, are suitable
intervals for calling out the fundamental 1, the strings em
ployed being either the first and second or the second and
third. The deep resultant tone thus obtained can not only
be heard by the ear but felt as a tremor by the hand which
holds the instrument. This is clear evidence of its objective
existence, and I have succeeded in confirming the fact by
means of a Helmholtz resonance-globe, the largest of the
ordinary set, responding to C of 128 vibrations. When held
with the edge of its mouth resting      #        the side of the
violin, it responds to the combination C of 256 and G of 384
on the 4th and 3rd strings, or to the combination C of 512
and E of 640 on the 2nd and 1st ; or, still better, to the 3rd
and 2nd open strings each flattened one note, so as to be C of
256 and G of 384. Here, then, we have distinct evidence
that the violin possesses the power which I have ascribed to
the ear—the power of manufacturing the fundamental when
the two primaries are supplied.
   11. Sir John Herschel, in his treatise on Sound (Enc.
Met. arts. 238, 239), mentions the fact that the common
fundamental can be called out by sounding two or more of
its harmonics on very accurately tuned strings or pipes, and
says that the effect cannot be obtained from a pianoforte tuned
in the ordinary way, because the intervals are tempered. I
find, however, on trying the experiment with an upright
Broadwood of date about 1860, that C of 64 is easily called
out by simultaneously    *2      eight or ten of its harmonics;

204         Prof. J. D. Everett on Resultant Tones.
and the effect is greatly enhanced if the key of C 64 is held
down.     In the latter case its note continues to be heard for
a long time after the keys which were struck are released.
From these experiments it appears probable that the sounding
board of a piano possesses ' same property which we have
proved to exist in the violin.
   12. I now come to the explanation of the experiments of
Professor Rücker and Mr. Edser (Proc. Phys. Soc. vol. xiii.
p. 412, Phil. Mag. 1895, xxxix. p. 341). They were made
with a Helmholtz siren, and in each instance the two primaries
were produced in the same box, sometimes the upper and
sometimes the lower box. The following explanation is a
development of suggestions contained in Appendix xvi. of the
Tonempfindungen.
   The rate of escape of air from the box containing the two
rows of holes # are employed may as a first approxima
tion be assumed to be jointly proportional, at each instant,
to the aperture for escape and the differential pressure
which produces the escape. Again, this differential pressure
may be regarded as the algebraic sum of two terms, one of
them constant, and representing its average value, while the
other represents the difference from the average due to the
varying amount of the aperture from instant to instant. As
a first approximation, equal increments of aperture must be
regarded as producing equal decrements of pressure, so that
the variable term will be proportional (with reversed sign) to
the excess of the aperture above its mean value. This excess
(defect being counted negative) will be a periodic function of
the time, and if the ratio of the two primaries in lowest terms
be m: n, the frequency for the complete period will be repre
sented on the same scale by 1. In other words it will be the
period of their common fundamental.
   Let the aperture at time t be expressed in a Fourier series,
6 being put for 27tt/T, where T is the complete period; and let
the variable part of the expression be denoted by f(6), while
ao denotes the mean aperture, so that the aperture at time t is
a0+f(6). We shall have
f(6)=A sin 6 + ... +a1 sin (m6+ e1) + ... + bi sin(né-- e.) + .
The largest amplitudes will be a, and b1 corresponding to the
two primaries; but A, which corresponds to the fundamental,
is likely to be sensible.
   The pressure at time t is proportional to
C being a constant ; and the aperture is
                             a0+f(6).

            Prof. J. D. Everett on Resultant Tones.         205
Hence the rate of escape is proportional to
                   Cao + (C-ao)f(6)–{f(6)}”.
a0 is comparable with the maximum value of f(6), and C is
much greater; hence ao may be neglected in comparison
with C.
   Developing {(f(6)}”, we shall obtain a term
                  2a1b1 sin (m6+el) sin (n0+ e.)
     = a1b1[cos {(n-m)6+e, -e, -cost (n+m)6+ e2+ e1}],
representing a difference-tone and a summation-tone. From
(C-ao)f(6) we have the common fundamental
                   (C-ao)A sin 6, or CA sin 6,
and the two primaries
               Cal sin (m6+el), Cbi sin (n0+ ex).         -
Suppose for simplicity that a1 =bi, then, taking the amplitude
of each of the primaries as 1, the amplitude of the common
fundamental will be A/a1, and the amplitudes of the summa
tion-tone and difference-tone will each be al/C.
    When n-m=1, the difference-tone coincides with the
fundamental, and their joint amplitude may be taken as the
square root of the sum of the squares of al/C and A/a1.
    13. Professor Rücker and Mr. Edser in experiments i. and
ii. obtained the difference-tone 64 from five distinct com
binations of primaries,
 256 & 320, 192 & 256, 320 & 384, 51.2 & 1152, 96 & 160,
 their ratios being
     4 : 5,       3:4,         5: 6,      4:9,        3 : 5.
    The second combination appears to have given a stronger
 effect than either the first or the third ; whence it would
 appear that low frequencies are favourable to strong effects.
 Nevertheless the fourth combination is mentioned as giving a
 rather feebler effect than any one of the first three. This
 confirms our conclusion that the difference-tone is weaker
 when it is distinct from the common fundamental than when
 it coincides with it.
    Experiment iii. was directed to testing for the presence
 of the resultant 64 when the primaries were 256 and 576.
 which are as 4:9. Their common fundamental is 64, and it
 could not be detected. This may have been because the
 pitch 576 was too high to give a good effect. Or the failure
 may be an indication that A/a1 is decidedly smaller than al/C.
 It would be interesting to repeat the experiment, employing
 192 and 320 as the primaries.

   14. Near the end of chapter vii. of the Tonempfindungen
Helmholtz makes prominent mention of the slipping of the
hammer on the anvil as an important cause of resultant tones,
and appears to regard it as exemplifying his mathematical
formula for the restoring force as a function of the displace
ment. But it is clear that if the hammer, which holds the
drumskin, is liable to shift in its supports, the restoring force
cannot be a mere function of the displacement, but must also
depend on the relative position and relative velocity of the
hammer and anvil at the moment considered. I accept all
the consequences which Helmholtz deduces in the passage
in question from this slipping, including its application to
explain first difference-tones; but I regard these consequences
as lying outside the range of his general mathematical for
mulae as given in Appendix xii.
    15. To sum up my objections to the received mathematical
theory of resultant tones:
    First. It assumes that the reaction of the drumskin against
 the air is a definite function of the displacement of the drum
 skin from a certain fixed position, whereas this reaction
 depends also on the position and motion of the further end of
 the hammer at the time.
    Secondly. Even if the vibrations of the drumskin were in
 accordance with the received formulae, there is plenty of scope
 for the introduction of additional constituents on the road
 from the drumskin to the liquid in the cochlea. The auditory
 ossicles, with their ligamentous supports and attachments,
 probably serve to protect the oval window of the cochlea
 against shocks and jars, and to smooth down asperities in the
 wave-form, thus mitigating the harshness of sounds and
 rendering them more musical. The changes thus introduced
 are very unlikely to fulfil the special conditions required for
 the vanishing of the common fundamental.
    Thirdly. The received theory makes the common funda
mental, when not coincident with the first difference-tone,
depend on a term involving the cube or some higher power
of the displacement. When the primaries are as 3:5, the
fundamental 1 comes in as 2m-n, and depends on the cube
of the displacement. When they are as 4:11, the tone 1,
which Koenig found to be the loudest resultant, is 3m-n,
 and depends on the fourth power. When they are in the
ratio 4:15, as in Koenig's experiment with the simple tones
 ut, and sie, the common fundamental uts, which was the
 only resultant tone heard, is 4m-n, and depends on the fifth
power of the displacement; the first difference-tone, which
 depends on the second power and should in theory be the

 loudest, being inaudible. This is surely a reductio ad absurdum
 of the received theory.
    I do not wish to be understood as denying that the theory
 has any basis of truth. My contention is that the actions to
 which it is truly applicable play only a subordinate part in
 the production of resultant tones.

              XXV. The Compound Law of Error.
        By Professor F. Y. EDGEwoRTH, M.A., D.C.L."
THE compound law of error is an extension             to the case of
        several dimensions of the simple law for the frequency
with which a quantity of one dimension (v) tends to assume
each particular value. A first approximation to the com
pound law has been obtained by several writers independently,
—by Mr. De Forest, in the ‘Analyst” for 1881; by the
present writer, in the Philosophical Magazine for December
1892; and by Mr. S. H. Burbury, in the same Journal for
January 1894. I propose here to employ the method of
partial differential equations explained in a preceding papert
to verify the first approximation, and to discover a second
approximation, to the compound law.
   To begin with the case of two dimensions: let Q be the

sum (or more generally an expansible function*) of a number
of elements # 8, &c., each of which, being a function of two
variables v and y, assumes any particular system of values
according to any law of frequency £= f(x, y); the functions
f being in general different for different elements. If each
of these functions is referred to its centre of gravity at origin,
and expanded in powers of a and y, it appears, by parity of
reasoning with that employed in the case of the simple law,
that for a first approximation we need take account only of
terms of the second order. Integrate between extreme limits
 of a f(x,y)da dy for each element; and let the sum of all
 these integrals be k. Also let
                           l=>\ryf (cy)dwdy,
                          700- >\#(xy)dr dy;
 the integration extending between the extreme limits of each
 element, and the summation over all the elements. Then
 2, the sought function which is to express the frequency of
 Q, will be of the form
                         z=QP(x, y, k, l, m)f.
    This expression may be simplified by transforming the
 axes to new ones making an angle 6 with the old ones, such
 that the new l vanishes. This will be effected if we put
 tan 26=2l--(k-m)+. Thus we may write with sufficient
 generality:
                             z=qP(x, y, k, m).

 where f is what f(xy) becomes when for x and y are substituted their
 values in X and Y; each element is integrated between extreme limits,
 and all the integrals are summed. Transforming back to the old axes
 we have for the new l
   >\f(xy) (*(y’—w") sin26+xycos26)de dy= #(m-k) sin26+l cos 26;
  which becomes null when

    Other differential equations are obtained by supposing the
units of w and y altered; substituting for x and y, x (1 + 2)
and y(1 + 8) respectively. The expression for z thus trans
 formed must be multiplied by (1 + 2) (1+8); - since the
measure of the solid contents of the parallelopiped inter
 cepted between the surface, the plane of viy, and any two fixed
 adjacent points in that plane will be increased in that pro
portion. Thus

  where x is an arbitrary function. The form of x is restricted
  by the condition that its value is the same for positive and

  element, we might replace the given system of elements by a

identical with zero. By parity Y(y) is null.

serving that each term separately satisfies those equations.

whether a given set of observations may be represented by a
probability-surface.
   A more summary test is afforded by observing that an
strip (or slice) of the surface (or solid) ought to fulfil the
condition that the mean-cube-of-error--the mean-square-of
error raised to the power # should be small. For it is zero
for a strip of the symmetrical probability-surface; and the
asymmetrical     £                       differs from the symmetrical
one only by small terms".
   The condition is often not fulfilled by actual observations.
Take, for instance, the statistics of the frequency of marriages
 between men and women of different ages. I have else
 where t constructed a table which may be translated into a
 surface such that z represents the probability that, out of the
 Italian marriageable population, a particular man aged v
 should marry a particular woman aged y within two years.
 Consider one strip of the surface, one row of the table, the one
 indicating the frequency with which women aged 22–23
 marry men of different ages. Utilizing the entries in the
 table, and, for the extreme ages not represented in the table,
 the original materials, I find for the centre of gravity of the
 row 10:7, reckoned from the age of 16.5 as zero, and for the
 criterion j+k a figure between 2 and 3. It appears, there
 fore, that the number of the elements (in relation to their
 asymmetry) is not sufficiently great to generate a true
 probability-surface.
    Analogous expressions for the compound asymmetrical
 function of many variables may be constructed by parity of
 reasoning.

                      By R. S. CoLE, M.A.”
 TH: following graphical methods, which I have not seen
        published, may be of interest.
    They depend on the following geometrical construction:—

                    A

Let A B and C D be parallel straight lines terminated by
B.D.; let A D and B C intersect in E, and draw E F parallel
to AB or CD to meet B D in F; then it can be proved
that

                      EE TAB         CD"
This furnishes a graphical method of compounding reciprocals.
   Adopting the convention of signs which reckons lengths
positive when measured from the surfaces (or with thick
lenses from the nodal points) in a direction opposite to that
of the incident light, the usual lens formula is
                  1    1   1       1     1   1
                  v    u "f*    Or :=;     +/.
   If u and fare given and v is required, we must draw AB
and CD to scale to represent u and frespectively, and then
E F represents v; and, on the other hand, if u and v are
given, draw AB and EF to represent them, and from these
complete the figure; CD will then give the focal length.
Negative values of u, v, and f can be indicated by drawing
the lines corresponding below B D.

for they are in the ratio v : u or E F : A B; the image being
direct or inverted according as EF and A B are or are not
on the same side of B.D.
   The construction can also be used for finding the focal
length of the lens equivalent to any number of lenses in con
tact, for this is done by adding the reciprocals of the focal
lengths.
   ' extension can be made to the case of two lenses sepa
rated by a definite interval a, to find the focal length of the

   XXVII. Electro-optical Investigation of Polarized Light.
                  By J. ELSTER and H. GEITEL".
Th:        photo-electric current produced in an attenuated gas
       by illumination of the kathode has been shown to be
dependent upon the inclination of the vibrations of light to
the plane of the kathode, and to attain a maximum when the
plane of polarization of the light is at right angles to the
plane of incidence, and a minimum for the position at right
angles to thist.
   The further examination of this phenomenon proceeds in
two directions:—We may ask, “According to what law does
the photo-electric current vary when the plane of polarization
of the incident light is made to rotate about the ray as its
axis ?” and we may inquire “how the intensity of this current
depends upon the angle of incidence of the light.”
   We confine ourselves here for the most part to the first of
these questionst: towards the solution of the second (which
offers greater difficulties) we can here only make some small
contributions.
   As we have previously remarked, we are led by the diffi
culties which present themselves in the production of polarized
ultra-violet light, to choose the fluid alloy of sodium and potas
sium as the     £ sensitive surface in an                   atmosphere
of a rarefied indifferent gas, which permits the use of light
from the region of the visible spectrum. But this involves
the necessity of enclosing the metallic surfaces subjected to
experiment in glass vessels. It would be of advantage that
the polarized beam of light should enter the vessel normally,
through a glass plate with parallel plane surfaces. We should
thus avoid all change of intensity in the exciting beam, which
with oblique incidence against the glass wall is associated with
change of azimuth. But the insertion of such plate-glass
“windows” in the glass vessels involves the use of some
cement, which must be of such a nature that in presence of
vapour of the alkali metals in a vacuum it shall neither
evaporate nor undergo any chemical change. We have not
succeeded in finding a cement that will stand under these
conditions. Organic substances such as resins are out of the
question, since they contain volatile constituents which con
dense upon the kathode, forming a layer almost insensitive to
light. And such inorganic substances as potassium and sodium

        Electro-optical Investigation of Polarized Light.    219
silicates, and cements composed of phosphoric acid and me
tallic oxides produce a decrease in sensitiveness to light after
a time, probably in consequence of the increase of gas-pressure
due to the evolution of hydrogen by the action of metallic
vapours on the water contained in the cement. A better
result was obtained with molten glacial phosphoric acid if
the precaution was taken of covering the joints, immediately
after the plate had been cemented on, with zinc oxide which
had been washed and ignited, and then covering the joint
with a layer of a mixture of wax and resin. It is true that
with the apparatus so constructed, the sensitiveness also de
creased for the first few days after sealing-off from the
air-pump; but this falling off soon ceased. We were thus
able to construct vessels with windows of parallel glass, which
might serve at least for control-experiments.
   These difficulties induced us to use generally simple glass
bulbs (cells) blown before the blowpipe, in which the alkali
metal and its vapours were in contact only with the glass
walls and the platinum electrodes. For most of the experi
ments here described we employed such bulbs of 50 millim.
diameter which were half filled with the alloy of sodium and
potassium. Each ray, therefore, that strikes the centre of
this metallic mirror must cut the glass wall at right angles,
and its intensity will not vary with the azimuth. The cross
section of the beam was therefore made as small as the sensi
tiveness of the cell permitted.
   In order to obtain a beam of light of small section and great
intensity, we obtained a projection lantern (sciopticon) with a
little disk of zirconia heated in the oxygen-coalgas-flame as
source of light. After this had been so adjusted that the
image of the piece of zirconia was obtained sharply at a con
siderable distance, a screen with a slit, about 3 millim. long
and 1 millim. broad, was placed between the condenser and
the projecting lens so that its outline was defined upon the
wall of the cell. The sciopticon, which with the screen
formed a rigid whole, was capable of rotation in a vertical
plane, and in any position could be inclined to the horizontal
through about 50° and held fast in that position. If it had
such a position that the spot of light which marked the
entrance of the ray of light was distinctly seen at A upon the
glass wall, then the point of emergence at A' could also be
distinctly recognized. The distances AB and A'B' of corre
sponding edges of these spots of light from the horizontal
surfaces of the fluid metal were measured with a pair of
compasses, and the sciopticon and cell were so placed that AB
was equal to A'B'. We were thus sure that the ray of light
struck the centre of the  ":        and cut the glass wall at a

A B A B'.        The surface of
the alkali-metal must be so                        s
bright that the place where the light strikes it must appear
absolutely black to an eye not in the direction of the reflected
ray. Sharper angles of incidence than could be obtained by
inclining the sciopticon were obtained by the use of a silver
mirror (the metallic side of a piece of plate-glass coated with
silver), which rotated about a horizontal axis, and from which
the horizontal ray was reflected downwards.
   In order to determine the angle of incidence of the ray to
the horizontal kathode we employed a simple instrument that
is also useful in determining the altitude of the sun. From
the centre of a quadrant of pasteboard, graduated into half
degrees, hangs a plumb-line, the thread of which touches the
graduations. In the prolongation of one of the bounding
radii of the quadrant across the centre, is placed a pencil at
right angles to the plane of the quadrant. The apparatus is
so placed that the shadow of the pencil is thrown by the
beam of light from the sciopticon in the direction of the radius.
The angle of incidence is then equal to the angle between
the radius and the thread, and can be read off upon the
divided arc.
   As in the previously described photo-electric measurements,
the cell was placed with the galvanometer previously described
in circuit with a battery of 100 to 400 Leclanché cells, of a
total E.M.F. of about 450 volts, so that the surface of the
alkali-metal was the kathode. The intensity of the photo
electric current was read off with mirror and scale; it is
scarcely necessary to observe that the cell was shielded from
the light of the lamp used to illuminate the scale, and that
no stray light was allowed to escape from the sciopticon.
   Immediately in front of the cell was placed a large Nicol's
prism, provided with graduated circle and capable of rotation
in horizontal and vertical planes. The cross-section of the
beam of light was so cut down by the screen that it traversed
the prism freely while it was rotated, as one could easily see
by observing the path of the light within the calcspar.
   If, then, the beam of light, polarized by passing through the
Nicol's prism, fall upon the kathode-surface in the manner
described at any incidence other than normal, the galvanometer
shows a periodic change of intensity during the rotation of

the Nicol with two maxima and two minima.           The maxima
occur when the principal section is coincident with the plane
of incidence, and the minima in the alternate positions at right
angles to the former. If we reckon the angle of rotation a of
the prism from the position of the maxima, for which the
plane of polarization of the ray is at right angles to the plane
of incidence, and if we denote by J the intensity of the current
for the angle a as found from the reading of the galvanometer,
then, within the limits of experimental error, the relation
between these is expressed by the formula
                     J=A cos” a + B sin” a,
where A denotes the maximum current-intensity (for a =0°),
and B the minimum intensity (for a =90°). In order that
this connexion shall be verified without doubt, the positions
of maximum and minimum position must be determined with
as much sharpness as possible. The changeability of J is, as
the nature of the function shows, least in the neighbourhood
of a=0° and a = 90°: consequently, it is only possible to
determine these principal positions by direct experiment with
an uncertainty of more than a degree. We therefore pre
ferred to determine the position of the greatest changeability
of J, namely, when a = 45°. Whilst one of us slowl
rotated the Nicol’s prism, the other observed at the         '.
vanometer the intensity of the current, and read off the
maximum and minimum values A and B.            At the same time
the corresponding positions of the Nicol were read off on the
divided circle. For a =45°, the formula leads us to expect
the value                       A+B
                            J= –5–.
If the Nicol be turned from one of the observed positions
through 45° we shall always obtain a value of J nearly equal
to the calculated value (A+B)/2. By a slow rotation of the
Nicol we brought it about that this number was actually read
off, and regarded the position so obtained as that actually
corresponding accurately to the azimuth 45°. Then, by
turning on, or back, through 45°, we obtain the corrected
principal positions, and obtain for these the old maximum
and minimum values A and B again. We must further
mention that on rotation of the prism the direction of the
emergent beam was not absolutely constant, but there were
slight displacements of the positions of entrance and emergence
of the beam to be observed on the glass wall (see fig. 1). As
there were but very slight changes of direction, and the dis
placements of the spot of light thus produced fell pretty well
within the limits of accuracy of the method of measurement
described, we have neglected them. The attempt to eliminate

   The numbers given as calculated current-intensities are
calculated from the formula
                             J=A cos” a + B sin” a
in the following manner. The equation may be written
                             J=(A–B) cos’ a+B
Or
                                               J-B
                                    A-B =
                                               cos' a'
   If we subtract the minimum value of B (corresponding to
a=90°) from all the other values of J, and divide by the square
of the cosine of the corresponding azimuths, we ought to
obtain numbers nearly equal. Of these we take the arithmetic
mean (M), and write down the numbers obtained from the
formula
                                  J = M cos” a + B
for all azimuths as the calculated current-intensities.
   As we see from the foregoing tables, the result found with

224      M.M. Elster and Geitel on the Electro-optical
the cell with parallel glass windows confirms that found with
the bulb-shaped ones; and even when the ray directed
towards the centre of the kathode-surface cuts the glass wall
at an acute angle, as was the case with the cell referred to in
Table II., the regularity in the change in value of J is the
same.     The reason of this is to be found in the fact that the
changes in intensity with change of azimuth, which a polarized
ray suffers at acute passage through a single surface of glass,
are only small even if the angle of incidence differs much
from the polarizing angle.
    For angles of incidence less than 40° (Table I. D) as
 already remarked, the ray was reflected by a silver mirror
 into the Nicol's prism. Strictly, we ought to take into
 account the amount of elliptical polarization due to the
 reflexion of the light from the silver, which itself would
 cause a change in the intensity of the light transmitted by
 the Nicol at different azimuths.    But here also the error lies
 quite within the limits of accuracy of the measurements. Of
 this we convinced ourselves by measuring the brightness of
 the emergent beam with a sodium cell with solid kathode at
 right angles to the ray, during rotation of the Nicol through
 90°: it remained almost constant.
    In order to eliminate the effect of possible change in the
 zircon-light, the measurement with the first position of the
 Nicol was repeated after each series of measurements. Only
 those series were retained in which this control-measurement
 agreed with the first.
    The relationship expressed in the above formula between
 the photo-electric current and the azimuth of the light may be
 deduced from the assumption, justified by previous experi
 ments, that the current-strength is proportional to the
 intensity of the light, if we make the further assumption that
 the constant is not the same for light polarized at right angles
 to the plane of incidence as for light polarized in the plane of
 incidence. If a denote the amplitude of a polarized ray,
 whose plane of vibration makes an angle a with the plane of
 incidence, then the intensities of its components parallel and
 at right angles to the plane of incidence are respectively
 a cos" a and a sin a. The strength of the photo-electric
 current caused by this ray is therefore
                     J=a'a cos" a +a'y sin” a,
 if we represent by a and y the two constants between the
 intensities of light and current.    In this expression, a'a and
 a’y are the constants, independent of a, which were denoted
 above by A and B. A ray of light vibrating in the plane of

                 Investigation of Polarized Light.             225
incidence, therefore, excites a photo-electric current stronger
in the ratio v : y or A: B than a ray of equal intensity
vibrating in a plane at right angles to the plane of incidence,
and therefore parallel to the surface of the kathode.
    It is easily seen that the ratio A: B must depend upon the
angle of incidence. For with normal incidence the position
 of the plane of incidence is undetermined, and therefore the
 difference between A and B must disappear. Experiment
 shows that the common value of the constants for this
 direction of the rays is comparatively small; whilst then with
 increasing angle of incidence A, increases rapidly, attaining
 a maximum at about 60° and then decreasing, B becomes
 continually smaller and appears to become zero at a nearly
 grazing incidence. Thus between 60° and 70° the ratio A: B
 has the value of about 50: 1 (cf. the tables). Experiments,
 still in progress, make it not improbable that the angle of
 incidence for which A attains its maximum coincides with
 the angle of polarization for the potassium-sodium alloy for
 the most electrically active rays, that is, for the blue rays.
     It is an obvious suggestion that the different sensitiveness
 of the metallic kathode-surface to light polarized in and at
  right angles to the plane of incidence is connected with the
  greater depth to which, according to Quincke *, the latter
  penetrates into a metallic surface.
     We have then the remarkable result that a ray of polarized
  light exerts a much smaller photo-electric effect at normal
  incidence than if it strikes the kathode at an acute angle with
  the plane of polarization at right angles to the plane of inci
  dence.    But it is to be observed that the like result must
  follow also with ordinary light, since we may regard this as
  consisting of two components polarized in planes at right
  angles, of which one vibrates in the plane of incidence. The
  one at right angles contributes little to the photo-electric effect
  at high angles of incidence on account of the smallness of the
  constant B.
     In order that this prediction should be verified it is neces
  sary that the surface of the kathode should be such a perfect
  plane as is only attainable by the use of the alkaline metals in
  the fluid condition. Kathodes of solid sodium or potassium
  have always a rough crystalline surface, and offer to the light
   elements of all possible positions. Consequently the increase
   of the photo-electric current with increasing angle of incidence
   can only be observed with cells containing fluid kathodes of
   NaK-alloy, whilst for those with solid kathodes the strength
   of the current is almost independent of the angle of inci
   dence.

   This independence is a consequence of the fact that with
increasing angle of incidence the surface illuminated increases
in the same ratio as the illumination of the unit-surface de
CreaSeS.
   In proof of what has been said, we give the two following
series of observations:—

   Since, then, it is possible without the aid of polarization,
simply by changing the angle of incidence, to show the in
crease in the photo-electric action of a ray of light which takes
place when the vibrations of light have a component at right
angles to the kathode, it was easy to make the like experi
ment with ultra-violet light; which, as we remarked at the
outset, it is difficult,-possibly impossible with the usual means
—to obtain in the condition of linear polarization. We have
then the advantage that the kathode may be made of any
metallic substance we like, and may be used in the open air.
                              Fig. 2.
  The arrangement of the experiment was as follows (fig. 2):—
A condenser C was connected with a large inductorium J,
the brilliant discharge of which took place between two zinc
points S and S in the focus of a lens Q of quartz. The rays
thus made parallel fell upon a plate P of amalgamated zinc
placed upright, which was capable of rotation over a gra
duated arc K about an axis at right angles to the direction of
the rays of light. A wire frame n, n' connected to earth, and

attached to the plate by supports of sealing-wax t, t', carried a
fine copper wire stretched across the space between t and t'.
When the sparks had passed for a certain time between Sand S',
the ultra-violet light from it withdrew from the plate a greater
or smaller quantity—according to the intensity of the light—
of the negative charge communicated to it. The fall of
potential was observed with an Exner’s electroscope connected
to it. From the values V and V of the potential before and
after illumination, the intensity of the light was calculated by
means of the formula J=log V/V, previously established *.
At the beginning of each series of experiments the brightly
polished zinc plate stood at right angles to the incident rays
 (a=0°), then the plate was turned through 50° right and then
 left (x= +50°), and finally the initial position was restored.
At the beginning the potential was always 258 volts (25 di
visions of the scale of the electroscope); the potentials V after
 10 seconds’ exposure are given in the following table :
                                 13 April, 1895.

    The mean of the observations gives:—
 For normal incidence Wo                 = 8.9 scale-divisions = 117 volts.
 For oblique incidence V+50=7-7 scale-divisions = 107 volts.
    Hence for the ratio of the photo-electric action we have
                      J^+50 log 258-log 107 = 1'11.
                       J%         log 258–log 117
     Hence the        £ activity                    of obliquely incident
  ultra-violet light in the open air is also greater than that of
  normally incident light, although the differences are much
  smaller than those found for visible light with alkali
  metal surfaces in vacuo. We suspected that this was to be
  accounted for by the imperfection of the surface of the amal
  gamated zinc, and repeated the same experiment with a sur
  face of mercury, altering the arrangement of the apparatus
  so as to suit the condition that the kathode-surface must
  remain fixed and that the light-ray must now be rotated.              But
  here also the differences were found to lie within the same
  limits, Consequently either the ratio of photo-electric activity
  of light polarized parallel and at right angles to the plane of
  incidence is dependent on the wave-length, so that it ap
  proaches to unity for small wave-lengths, or other conditions

228        MM. Elster and Geitel on the Electro-optical
(for example, the difference in pressure) play a part in the
phenomenon.
    Further, induced thereto by the attempts of Herr Wanka"
to recognize in the well-known Hertzian experiment of the
  roduction of an electric spark by the light of another, the
influence of the direction of the vibrations of light to the
illuminated kathode, we have looked for a dependence of the
same phenomenon on the angle of incidence. The experi
mental arrangement was essentially the same as that already
described, only that the action of the light was observed not
by the fall of potential of an #: surface, but by the
discharge of the synchronous, so-called passive spark of a
second inductorium in similar phase with the first. The con
denser used with the first is not now required, but it is
advisable to connect the second with a Leyden jar in order to
give greater intensity to the passive spark, and thus to facili
tate its observation. We have not found any perceptible dif
ference in the action which was clearly recognizable at different
angles of incidence (0° and 50°), either with the zinc plate as
kathode or with the mercury surface.
    It is, however, to be remarked that the Hertzian pheno
menon, the resolution of a spark by the ultra-violet illumina
tion of the kathode, is not to be regarded as altogether the
same as the    #              of negative electricity in ultra-violet
light observed by Herr Hallwachs. This latter is within
wide limits proportional to the intensity of the light, and
therefore first disappears completely on excluding the light,
whilst with the first, for a given distance apart of the elec
trodes, a finite strength of light is necessary and sufficient.
On this account the above described experiment would perhaps
have given a positive result if the striking distance of the
passive spark had each time been adjusted by a micrometer
screw to its maximum value.                               -         -
    In regard to the nature of the photo-electric process, the
results of the experiments with polarized light on the whole
indicate that we have here to do with an immediate action
which the light-rays exert by exciting electrical vibrations.

if we do not with the first named investigators connect the
photo-electric process with the production of kathode-rays, it
remains to be explained why it is limited just to the kathode
surface. To supply this deficiency a further assumption is neces
sary which has recently been made by Prof. J. J. Thomson",
namely, that the kathode-surface in contact with air, or what
ever the gas may be, has a double electric charge, the positive
side formed by the molecules of the kathode, the negative by
molecules of the gas.
    If we now imagine that a ray of light so strikes the kathode
surface of metal that the electric displacements in the ray have
a component at right angles to the surface, then electric
vibrations will be induced in the molecules of the metal in
which such a component will also be present. This will cause
the place of contact between the molecules of metal and gas,
 so far as it belongs to the first, to take alternately positive and
 negative charges in rapid succession. It is perhaps possible
 that in that phase of the vibrations in which the electric
 density is negative, the connexion of the metallic molecule
 with the equally negative gas-molecule may be dissolved in
 consequence of electrostatic repulsion, and the latter may be
 driven off into the free gas-space, whilst another that now
 takes its place communicates positive electricity to the
 metallic molecule by contact with it, and itself takes a
 negative charge.
    This view is supported by the circumstance that alkali
 metal cells, which, instead of rarefied hydrogen, contain the
 much more strongly electro-negative gases oxygen or carbon
 dioxide, are particularly sensitive to light, and that with
 similar gaseous atmospheres the sensitiveness to light rises
 with the electro-positive character of the kathode-metal. We
 hope to return to these phenomena.
     t may certainly be urged against the view here expressed,
 that the photo-electric action does not entirely cease when the
 electric displacements take place parallel to the kathode
 surface, and when consequently the normal component is zero.
 It appears to us to be of great importance to our knowledge
 of the photo-electric process to make further investigations
 into its dependence upon the angle of incidence, using, of
 course, polarized light.

  XXVIII. On the Production of Electrical Phenomena by the
                 Röntgen Rays. By AUG. RIGHI".
1.   IT is known that the most important properties            of the
           X-rays, that is to say the power of exciting fluor
escence and of acting on photographic preparations (which
Röntgen thinks is a secondary effect of the former), belong
more especially to the more refrangible of the ordinary rays.
Since these, in like manner, are eminently suited to produce
photo-electrical properties, I was desirous of examining
whether phenomena of this kind would also be produced by
the X-rays.
   As my investigation, though only recently begun, has
already given results, I will communicate them to the
Academy. For the sake of clearness it is necessary to give
a brief account of photo-electric phenomena.
   2. A body negatively electrified rapidly loses its charge if
exposed to radiations. The rapidity with which the charge
is dispersed is greater or less according to the nature of the
body and the wave-length of the radiations used. So that,
while for most bodies the phenomenon is produced only by
the rays of smallest wave-length emitted by the voltaic arc
(and especially by that produced between carbon and zinc or
aluminium), or by that of burning magnesium, for some
bodies, like amalgamated zinc, the sun’s light is sufficient,
and for others, like the alkaline metals, the ordinary artificial
lights.
   I ought more especially to mention here an experimental
arrangement, that of the photo-electric couple f. The active
radiations fall on a metal disk after passing through wire
gauze parallel and close to it, and in connexion with the
earth. The radiations dispersing the negative charge which,
owing to the difference of potential by contact, the gauze or
the disk possesses (they having been placed in contact just
before the experiment) produce a deflexion, positive or
negative according to circumstances, in an electrometer in
connexion with the disk: this deflexion measures sensibly
the difference of potential in question #.
    If, in repeating the experiment, the disk is put further and

 Production of Electrical Phenomena by Röntgen Rays. 231
further away from the gauze, the deflexion increases in ab
solute value if it is positive, and diminishes to zero, or is
reversed, if it is negative.
   The direct cause of this is a phenomenon brought out from
my earliest researches on the electrical phenomena of radia
tions: namely, that a discharged body becomes positively
charged when it is struck by radiations *.
   The above phenomenon is expressed by a law which I have
established by many experiments, and which can be thus
enunciated: the positive charge of the body on which the
radiations fall ceases to increase when the electrical density has
attained a certain value, which is constant for a given substance.
   It follows from this law, that the positive deflexion produced
by the radiations becomes smaller if the conductor in con
nexion with the earth is brought gradually nearer the body
on which the radiations fall, the capacity of which is thereby
increased. Hence to show the positive charge produced by
radiations, the body on which they fall should not be too near
the uninsulated conductor. In the opposite case, which is
that of photo-electric couples, the formation of this final
positive charge has almost no influence on the deflexions
obtained.
   3. In order to examine whether the X-rays disperse the
charge of a body electrified negatively, and charge positively an
uncharged body, I worked with methods similar to those now
described:—
   (1) I charged a conductor in any given way, and then
examined whether its potential, as shown by a quadrant
electrometer in connexion with it, underwent a more rapid
diminution than that arising from the usual dispersion of the
electric charge when the X-rays fall on it; or
   (2) I caused the X-rays to fall on a photo-electric couple and
observed whether they produced a deflexion in the electro
meter communicating with the disk, the gauze being put to
earth; lastly,
   (3) I tried whether those rays falling on an uncharged body
produce a positive charge.
   In combining the most convenient experimental arrange
ments, it was necessary to do so in such a manner that there
could be no possibility of any kind of electrical action being
produced directly on the electrometer, or on bodies in con
nexion with it, by the apparatus generating the X-rays.
   I therefore arranged the Crookes’ tubes, together with the
coil, the contact-breaker, &c., inside a large metal box in con
       * Ibid, page 387; Nuovo Cimento, vol. xxv, p. 128 (1889).

232       Aug. Righi on the Production of Electrical
nexion with the earth.      One of the sides of the box is made
in chief part of a large lead plate provided with a circular
window, in front of which on the inside and at a small distance
is that part of a Crookes' tube which is struck by the kathodic
rays. The window may be closed either by a large lead plate
or by a thin plate of aluminium. In either case, when the
apparatus in the box are at work, no electrical force pro
ceeding from the internal charge of the case is manifested on
the outside.
   When conductors, electrified or not, are placed in front of
the window closed with aluminium, I observed the following
phenomena —
   4. If a conductor charged negatively is placed in front of
the window, no sooner is the Crookes’ tube at work than the
charge rapidly disperses.
   If the conductor is uncharged, it becomes positively elec
trified; and in the same conditions the final charge is dif
ferent according to the nature of the substance : thus, with
gas-graphite it is greater than with copper, and with copper
greater than with zinc.
   With the latter metal the deflexion obtained is negative
when the distance between it and the aluminium is small
enough. This arises from the difference of potential of contact;
but at a greater distance the positive charge produced by the
X-rays preponderates.
   In fine, if a photo-electrical couple is placed in front of the
window, a deflexion of the electrometer is obtained, as if
with ultra-violet radiations.    I have not yet examined whether
this deflexion is exactly equal to that £ the latter radia
tions would produce.
    Hence the X-rays have, in common with the ultra-violet
 ones, the property of dispersing the negative charge, and of
giving rise to positive charges in unelectrified bodies.
   The electrical action of the X-rays diminishes, as was to be
 expected, if the bodies on which they act are moved away from
 the window from which the rays proceed.
    If a board of pine-wood, or a thick plate of aluminium or
 of glass, or the hand, is placed so as entirely to cover the
 aperture, it more or less diminishes the effect produced by the
 X-rays, but in general does not obscure them completely. A
 piece of glass-mirror less than a centimetre in thickness
 absorbs more than pine-wood 6 centim. in thickness.
    5. Ultra-violet radiations produce no appreciable action on
 bodies positively electrified, for if in any case they seem to
 disperse positive electricity, it may be ascertained that the
 effect observed was due to the dispersion of negative electricity
 by the surrounding bodies.

                 Phenomena by the Röntgen Rays.                 233
    Having given a positive charge to the conductor (gas
 graphite, copper, zinc, &c.) on which the X-rays fall, I
 £          the same action as in the case of the negative
 charge.
    Accordingly, the X-rays, unlike the ultra-violet ones, produce
 the dispersion also of bodies electrified positively.
    Of course, while in the case of an initial positive charge the
 dispersion ceases when there is on the conductor a charge equal
 to that which, starting from the neutral state, the rays would
 impart to it: on the other hand, with an initial negative
 charge the dispersion continues until the body is discharged,
 and then the same final result is obtained as it has when the
 original charge is null or positive. This result may be ex
 pressed by saying that the conductor communicating with the
 electrometer behaves like an electrode in a conducting medium
 which acquires the potential of the region in which it is
 placed, whatever was the initial potential.
    6. I desire to call attention to the fact that the new property
here mentioned has the advantage of furnishing a means of
measuring the X-rays. I believe that to compare the absorp
tion produced by various bodies, it will be better to express
this absorption by the velocity of dispersion, rather than by
an estimation based on a comparison of the intensity of the
shadow projected on a fluorescent screen or on a photographic
plate.
    The new property will evidently have to be taken into
account when the time comes for discussing the various hypo
theses proposed to explain the nature of the X-rays.
    7. The following is a lecture-experiment for showing the
dispersion of electricity produced by the Röntgen rays. The
metal box is dispensed with, retaining only the large lead
plate, with the window closed by aluminium. A disk of any
metal is placed at a few centimetres from the window on
one side of the lead plate, while on the other side is a
Crookes’ tube with the apparatus for working it. The disk
is connected with a gold-leaf electroscope. The disk being
well insulated, a charge of either sign is given to the system
—the leaves remain divergent and motionless, but no sooner
is the Crookes’ tube at work than they fall and become vertical.
If the aperture is closed with a large leaden plate, the phe
nomena are no longer produced. If various other substances
are placed against the window, such as the hand, wood, &c.,
the rate at which the leaves fall is slower.

Dynamo-Electric Machinery. By S. P. THOMPson, D.Sc., F.R.S.
   Fifth Edition.     London: E. & F. N. Spon, 1896.
 TH: rapid increase in       the number of technical applications of
      Electricity has occasioned the development of many new types
 of machinery in recent years. Any treatise which aims at giving
a complete account of the principles involved in the construction
 of these machines must therefore grow visibly larger with each
 new edition. Prof. Thompson's work has reached the stage at
 which a single volume will not contain all the new matter without
 omitting or condensing part of the text of previous editions; con
 sequently he has been obliged to transfer a portion of it to another
 treatise (‘The Electromagnet’) where it can be more adequately
 discussed.     Even with this overflow some curtailment of the
 more theoretical chapters has been found necessary, and it seems
 evident that the sixth edition, whenever it appears, will be in two
 volumes.
   The new matter in the present edition relates mostly to alternate
 current machinery; rotary-field motors have a chapter to themselves;
and the methods of synchronizing alternators to run as two
dynamos or as dynamo and motor are described in a separate
short section. The volume is enriched by many plates giving
details of the construction of typical machines; and the student
whose thirst for knowledge on any point cannot be satisfied by the
text of the volume may often derive help from the plates, and
will find throughout the book copious references to other works.

Elementary Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, founded on
   Joubert's ‘Traité Elémentaire d'Electricité. By G. C. FosTER,
   F.R.S., and E. ATKINsoN, Ph.D. London: Longmans, 1896.
THAT the French physicists excel in the writing of elementary
text-books is evidenced by the great popularity of the treatises by
Ganot and Deschanel, the translations of which have passed
through very many editions in this country. Although not nearly
so well known in England, M. Joubert's Traité élémentaire d'Elec
tricité has a deservedly high reputation in France: its scope is
somewhat wider than that of the other two works, but the subject
is treated logically and in a progressive manner throughout. In
common with many other text-books, both English and continental,
it has, however, the disadvantage of presenting too exclusively the
action-at-a-distance character of electric and magnetic attractions,
and it does not sufficiently emphasize the importance of the medium
which, according to more modern ideas, is the seat of electric force
and energy. Undoubtedly, the older view furnishes a beginner
with an easy explanation of the simpler phenomena of electrostatics
and magnetism, and, once adopted, it can only be discarded with
difficulty. Prof. Carey Foster and Dr. Atkinson, taking M.
Joubert's work as a basis, have found much re-writing necessary
in their endeavour to present such explanations of all phenomena

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             235
as are consistent with the ideas of Faraday and Maxwell. Familiar
 terms like charge and current have been retained, but their relation
 to the ethereal medium is made clear as each arises; by this means
 the authors have been able to adhere to the order of treatment
 followed by Joubert. The result is a very satisfactory text-book,
with all the advantages that can be imparted to it by teachers of
 skill and experience.                                     J. L. H.
 Computation Rules and Logarithms, with tables of other useful
   functions. By SILAs W. HoDMAN. New York: Macmillan,
    1896; pp. xlv. 4-73.
 THIS is not a Manual such as the ‘Manual of Logarithms’ by
G. F. Matthews and the ‘Examples for practice in the use of seven
figure Logarithms’ by Wolstenholme, nor is it conterminous with
the “Logarithmic Tables’ by Prof. George W. Jones, but it
treats the subject more from the point of view of the engineering
and scientific student. This is to be expected from the author's
position of Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of
 Technology.
    The preliminary matter is very clearly put and several practical
exercises are worked out. It treats of Rules of Computation (up
to date), Logarithms, Antilogs and Cologs, Squares and Square
Roots, Reciprocals, the ordinary Trigonometrical Natural and
Log Sines, &c., and Slide Wire Ratios (this will be of use to students
of physical chemistry). For those who are unacquainted with the
terms employed in the previous introduction, definitions and
explanations of them are appended.
    The tables are in the main four-place ones, but space is also
devoted to five-place logarithms of numbers and of the Trigono
metrical functions.
    Prof. Holman has done his work well, and the many contrivances
in working and in the printing of the tables evince him to be a
thoroughly practical teacher. We can accord him no higher praise.

              BLACK LIGHT.      B.Y. M. GUSTAVE LE BON.
THE recent publication of photographic        experiments with light
       of kathodic origin has decided me to make known, though
they are still very incomplete, some researches which I have carried
on for the last two years in photography through bodies opaque to
ordinary light. The two subjects are very different; only in their
results are there some analogies.                    •
   The following experiments prove that ordinary light, or at any
rate some of its radiations, traverses the most opaque bodies without
difficulty. Opacity is a phenomenon which only exists for an eye
like our own ; if it were somewhat differently constructed, we
could see through walls.                                    - - -
   In an ordinary positive photograph-frame place a sensitive plate
and above this any ordinary photograph, then above the photograph,

236          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
and in close contact with it, a plate of iron entirely covering the
interior of the frame. The plate thus masked by the metal plate
is exposed to the light of a petroleum-lamp for about three hours.
An energetic and very prolonged development of the sensitive
plate carried on to almost complete blackness will give a very pale
image of the photograph, but one which is very marked by trans
mitted light.
   By a slight modification of the preceding experiment, images
may be obtained almost as sharp as if no obstacle had been inter
posed between the light and the sensitive plate. Without altering
anything in the preceding arrangement, let a plate of lead of any
thickness be placed behind the sensitive plate, and its edges bent
over until they slightly cover the edges of the iron plate. The
sensitive plate is thus enclosed in a sort of metal box, the front
part of which consists of an iron plate, the back and the sides being
formed of lead. After three hours of exposure to petroleum light,
we obtain as before a vigorous image after development.
   What part does the lead plate play in this second experiment.
Provisionally I imagine that the contact of two different metals
gives rise to very feeble thermoelectric currents, the action of
which adds itself to that of the luminous radiations which have
passed through the iron plate.
   I hope to be able soon to determine the part of the various
factors which come into play in producing the preceding results.
I hope thus to determine the properties of light after its passage
through opaque bodies. The action which might be exerted on the
clichés by heat, or that of light stored up, have been entirely
eliminated by my experiments.
   The action of the sun's light gives the same result as that of
petroleum, and does not appear to be much more active.
   Cardboard and metals, particularly iron and copper, are easily
traversed by light. This passage of light through the bodies is
only a question of time.
   If the experiments are repeated in the photographic camera,
that is to say, if a metal plate is placed in front of a sensitive
plate, and therefore between the latter and the object to be photo
graphed, on exposure for two hours to the sunlight, an intense
blackening is obtained on development, proving the passage of light
through the opaque plate, but images are only exceptionally ob
tained and in conditions which I have not yet been able to determine.
   As they are invisible to the eye, I give the name of black light
to those radiations of unknown origin which pass in this way
through opaque bodies. Considering the divergences between the
numbers of vibrations producing various kinds of energy, such as
electricity and light, we may imagine that there are intermediate
numbers corresponding to natural forces still unknown. The latter
must be connected by imperceptible transitions to the forces we
know. The possible forms of energy, although we know very little
about them at present, must be infinite in number. Black light
perhaps represents one of the forces of which we are ignorant.—

XXXI. On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air upon
   the Temperature of the Ground.                 By Prof. SVANTE

          I. Introduction : Observations of Langley on
                     Atmospherical Absorption.
       GREAT deal has been written on the influence of
       the absorption of the atmosphere upon the climate.
Tyndall f in particular has pointed out the enormous im
portance of this question. To him it was chiefly the diurnal
and annual variations of the temperature that were lessened by
this circumstance. Another side of the question, that has long
attracted the attention of physicists, is this : Is the mean
temperature of the ground in any way influenced by the
presence of heat-absorbing gases in the atmosphere? Fourier;
maintained that the atmosphere acts like the glass of a hot
house, because it lets through the light rays of the sun but
retains the dark rays from the ground. This idea was
elaborated by Pouillet S; and Langley was by some of his
researches led to the view, that “the temperature of the
earth under direct sunshine, even though our atmosphere
were present as now, would probably fall to -200° C., if
that atmosphere did not possess the quality of selective

wide a use of Newton's law of cooling, must be abandoned,
as Langley himself in a later memoir showed that the full
moon, which certainly does not possess any sensible heat
absorbing atmosphere, has a “mean effective temperature”
of about 45° C.f                      -                                -- -   -
    The air retains heat (light or dark) in two different
ways. On the one hand, the heat suffers a selective dif
fusion on its passage through the air; on the other hand,
some of the atmospheric gases absorb considerable quantities
of heat. These two actions are very different. The selective
diffusion is extraordinarily great for the ultra-violet rays, and
diminishes continuously with increasing wave-length of the
light, so that it is insensible for the rays that form the chief
part of the radiation from a body of the mean temperature of
the earth $.

          in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground.             239
   The selective absorption of the atmosphere is, according to
the researches of Tyndall, Lecher and Pernter, Röntgen,
Heine, Langley, Angström, Paschen, and others *, of a
wholly different kind. It is not exerted by the chief mass of
the air, but in a high degree by aqueous vapour and carbonic
acid, which are present in the air in small quantities.
Further, this absorption is not continuous over the whole
spectrum, but nearly insensible in the light part of it, and
chiefly limited to the long-waved part, where it manifests
itself in very well-defined absorption-bands, which fall off
rapidly on both sides f. The influence of this absorption
is comparatively small on the heat from the sun, but must
be of great importance in the transmission of rays from
the earth. Tyndall held the opinion that the water-vapour
has the greatest influence, whilst other authors, for instance
 Lecher and Pernter, are inclined to think that the carbonic
acid plays the more important part. The researches of
 Paschen show that these gases are both very effective, so that
 probably sometimes the one, sometimes the other, may have
 the greater effect according to the circumstances.
    In order to get an idea of how strongly the radiation of the
 earth (or any other body of the temperature +15° C.) is
 absorbed by quantities of water-vapour or carbonic acid in
 the proportions in which these gases are present in our
 atmosphere, one should, strictly speaking, arrange experi
 ments on the absorption of heat from a body at 15° by means
 of appropriate quantities of both gases. But such experiments
 have not been made as yet, and, as they would require very
 expensive apparatus beyond that at my disposal, I have not
 been in a position to execute them. Fortunately there are
 other researches by Langley in his work on ‘The           £
    For ultra-violet rays the absorption becomes extremely great in
 accordance with facts.
   As one may see from the probable errors which I have placed alongside
 for the least concordant values and also for one value (1:50 u), where
 the probable error is extremely small, the differences are just of the
 magnitude that one might expect in an exactly fitting formula. The
 curves for the formula and for the experimental values cut each other at
 four points (1/A=2:43, 1.88, 1:28, and 0.82 respectively): From the
 formula we may estimate the value of the selective reflexion for those
 parts of the spectrum that prevail in the heat from the moon and the
 earth (angle of deviation=38–36°, A=104-24'4"). We find that the
 absorption from this cause varies betweeen 0.5 and 1 p. c. for air-mass 1.
 This insensible action, which is wholly covered by the experimental
 errors, I have neglected in the following calculations.

240 Prof. S. Arrhenius on the Influence of Carbonic Acid
of the Moon, with the aid of which it seems not impossible
to determine the absorption of heat by aqueous vapour and
by carbonic acid in precisely the conditions which occur in
our atmosphere.          e has measured the radiation of the full
moon (if the moon was not full, the necessary correction
relative to this point was applied) at different heights and
seasons of the year. This radiation was moreover dispersed
in a spectrum, so that in his memoir we find the figures for
the radiant heat from the moon for 21 different groups of
rays, which are defined by the angle of deviation with
a rocksalt prism having a refracting angle of 60 degrees.
The groups lie between the angles 40° and 35°, and each
group is separated from its neighbours by an interval of 15
minutes. Now the temperature of the moon is nearly the
same as that of the earth, and the moon-rays have, as they
arrive at the measuring-instruments, passed through layers of
carbonic acid and of aqueous vapour of different thickness
according to the height of the moon and the humidity of the
air. If, then, these observations were wholly comparable with
one another, three of them would suffice for calculating the
absorption coefficient relatively to aqueous vapour and
carbonic acid for any one of the 21 different groups of rays.
 But, as an inspection of the 24 different series of observations
will readily show, this is not the case. The intensity of
radiation for any group of rays should always diminish with
increasing quantity of aqueous vapour or carbonic acid
traversed. Now the quantity of carbonic acid is proportional
to the path of the ray through the atmosphere, that is, to the
quantity called “Air-mass” in Langley’s figures. As unit
 for the carbonic acid we therefore take air-mass=1, i.e. the
 quantity of carbonic acid that is traversed in the air by a
vertical ray. The quantity of aqueous vapour traversed is
 proportional partly to the “air-mass,” partly to the humidity,
expressed in grammes of water per cubic metre. As unit for
the aqueous vapour I have taken the quantity of aqueous
vapour that is traversed by a vertical ray, if the air contains
10 grammes per cubic metre at the earth’s surface". If we
tabulate the 24 series of observations published by Langley
in the work cited with respect to the quantities of carbonic
acid and aqueous vapour, we immediately detect that his
figures run very irregularly, so that very many exceptions
are found to the rule that the transmitted heat should
continuously decrease when both these quantities increase.
   * This unit nearly corresponds to the mean humidity of the air (see
Table VI. p. 264).

         in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground.         241
And it seems as if periodic alterations with the time of
observation occurred in his series.       On what circumstance
these alterations with the time depend one can only make
vague conjectures: probably the clearness of the sky may
have altered within a long period of observation, although this
could not be detected by the eye. In order to eliminate this
irregular variation, I have divided the observations into four
groups, for which the mean quantities of carbonic acid (K)
and of water-vapour (W) were 1.21 and 0:36, 2.21 and 0.86,
1:33 and 1:18, and 2.22 and 2.34 respectively. With the
help of the mean values of the heat-radiation for every group
of rays in these four groups of observations, I have roughly
calculated the absorption coefficients (w and y) for both gases,
and by means of these reduced the value for each observation
to the value that it would have possessed if K and W had
been 1:5 and 0.88 respectively. The 21 values for the
different rays were then summed up, so that I obtained the
total heat-radiation for every series of observations, reduced to
K= 1.5 and W = 0.88.       If the materials of observation were
very regular, the figures for this total radiation should not
differ very much from one another. In fact, one sees that
observations that are made at nearly the same time give also
nearly equal values, but if the observations were made at very
different times, the values differ also generally very much.
For the following periods I have found the corresponding
mean values of the total radiation —
                                              Mean      Reduction

   In order to reduce the figures of Langley to comparability
with one another, I have applied the reduction factors
tabulated above to the observations made in the respective
periods. I have convinced myself that by this mode of
working no systematic error is introduced into the following
calculations.
   After this had been done, I rearranged the figures of
Langley’s groups according to the values of K and W.
in the following table. (For further details see my original

    The signification of these figures may be illustrated by an
 example. If a ray of heat, corresponding to the angle of
 deviation 39°45, passes through the unit of carbonic acid, it de

        in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground. 245
creases in intensity in the proportion 1 : 0.934 (log= –0.0296),
the corresponding value for the unit of water-vapour is
1 : 0.775 (log = –0.1105). These figures are of course only
valid for the circumstances in which the observations were
made, viz., that the ray should have traversed a quantity of
carbonic acid K=1:1 and a quantity of water-vapour W=0.3
before the absorption in the next quantities of carbonic acid
and water-vapour was observed. And these second quantities
should not exceed K=1:1 and W =1.8, for the observations
are not extended over a greater interval than between K=1:1
and K=2:2, and W=0.3 and W=2.1 (the numbers for K
and W are a little different for rays of different kind). Below
A is written the relative value of the intensity of radiation
for a given kind of ray in the moonlight after it has traversed
K=1 and W=0.3. In some cases the calculation gives
positive values for log v or log y. As this is a physical
absurdity (it would signify that the ray should be strength
ened by its passage through the absorbing gas), I have in
these cases, which must depend on errors of observation,
assumed the absorption equal to zero for the corresponding
gas, and by means of this value calculated the absorption
coefficient of the other gas, and thereafter also A.
    As will be seen from an inspection of Table I., the values of
i obs. agree in most cases pretty well with the calculated values
i calc. But in some cases the agreement is not so good as one
 could wish. These cases are mostly characterized by a small
 “weight” G, that is in other words, the material of observa
 tion is in these cases relatively insufficient. These cases
 occur also chiefly for such rays as are strongly absorbed by
 water-vapour. This effect is probably owing to the circum
 stance that the aqueous vapour in the atmosphere, which is
 assumed to have varied proportionally to the humidity at the
 earth’s surface, has not always had the assumed ideal and
 uniform distribution with the height. From observations
 made during balloon voyages, we know also that the dis
 tribution of the aqueous vapour may be very irregular, and
 different from the mean ideal distribution.            It is also a
 marked feature that in some groups, for instance the third,
 nearly all the observed numbers are less than the calculated
 ones, while in other groups, for instance the fourth, the
 contrary is the case. This circumstance shows that the division
 of the statistic material is carried a little too far; and a combi
 nation of these two groups would have shown a close agreement
 between the calculated and the observed figures. As, how
 ever, such a combination is without influence on the correct
  ness of the calculated absorption-coefficients, I have omitted

246     Prof. S. Arrhenius on the Influence of Carbonic Acid
a rearrangement of the figures in greater groups, with con
sequent recalculation.
   A circumstance that argues very greatly in favour of the
opinion that the absorption-coefficient given in Table II.
cannot contain great errors, is that so very few logarithms
have a positive value. If the observations of Langley had
been wholly insufficient, one would have expected to find
nearly as many positive as negative logarithms. Now there
are only three such cases, viz., for carbonic acid at an angle
of 40°, and for water-vapour at the angles 36°45 and
36°-15. The observations for 40° are not very accurate,
because they were of little interest to Langley, the corre
sponding rays not belonging to the moon’s spectrum but only
to the diffused sunlight from the moon. As these rays also
do not occur to any sensible degree in the heat from a body
of 15°C., this non-agreement is without importance for our
problem. The two positive values for the logarithms belong
ing to aqueous vapour are quite insignificant. They correspond
only to errors of 0:2 and 1.5 per cent, for the absorption of
the quantity W =1, and fall wholly in the range of experi
mental errors.
    It is certainly not devoid of interest to compare these
absorption-coefficients with the results of the direct observa
tions by Paschen and Angström". In making this com
parison, we must bear in mind that an exact agreement
cannot be expected, for the signification of the above co
efficients is rather unlike that of the coefficients that are or
may be calculated from the observations of these two authors.
The above coefficients give the rate of absorption of a ray
that has traversed quantities of carbonic acid (K=1:1) and
water-vapour (W =0:3); whilst the coefficients of Paschen and
   ngström represent the absorption experienced by a ray on
the passage through the first layers of these gases. In
some cases we may expect a great difference between these
two quantities, so that only a general agreement can be
looked for.
    According to Paschen’s figures there seems to exist no
sensible emission or absorption by the aqueous vapour at
wave-lengths between 0.94 and 1:2.4 (corresponding to the
 angle of deviation 40°). On the other hand, the representa
tion of the sun’s spectrum by Langley shows a great many

strong absorption-bands in this interval, among which those
marked p, q, r, and b are the most prominent", and these
absorption-bands belong most probably to the aqueous vapour,
That Paschen has not observed any emission by water-vapour
in this interval may very well be accounted for hy the fact
that his heat-spectrum had a very small intensity for these
short-waved rays. But it may be conceded that the absorption
coefficient for aqueous vapour at this angle in Table II. is
not very accurate (probably too great), in consequence of the
little importance that Langley attached to the corresponding
observations. After this occurs in Langley’s spectrum the
great absorption-band Wr at the angle 39-45 (X=1:4 u), where
in    Paschen's curve the emission first becomes sensible
(log y= –0.1105 in Table II.). At wave-lengths of greater
value we find according to Paschen strong absorption-bands
at A=1.83 u (Q in Langley's spectrum), i. e. in the neigh
bourhood of 39°30 and at x=2.64 u (Langley's X) a little above
the angle 39°15. In accordance with this I have found
rather large absorption-coefficients for aqueous vapour at
these angles (logy= –0.0952 and -0.0862 resp.). From
x=3.0 u to A=4.7 u thereafter, according to Paschen the
absorption is very small, in agreement with my calculation
(logy= -0.0068 at 39°, corresponding to A=4:3 u). From
this point the absorption increases again and presents new
maxima at A=5:5 u, X=66 u, and A=7.7 u, i.e. in the
vicinity of the angles 38° 45 (X=526 u) and 38°30 (A=7.1 m).
In this region the absorption of the water-vapour is con
tinuous over the whole interval, in consequence of which the
 great absorption-coefficient in this part (log y= -0.3114 and
 –0-2362) becomes intelligible. In consequence of the de
creasing intensity of the emission-spectrum of aqueous vapour
 in Paschen's curve we cannot pursue the details of it closely,
 but it seems as if the emission of the water-vapour would also
 be considerable at A=8.7 u (39°15), which corresponds with
 the great absorption-coefficient (log y = –0. 1933) at this
place. The observations of Paschen are not extended further,
ending at A=9.5 m, which corresponds to an angle of 39°08.
    For carbonic acid we find at first the value zero at 40°, in
agreement with the figures of Paschen and Angströmt. The
absorption of carbonic acid first assumes a sensible value at

X=1:5 u, after which it increases rapidly to a maximum at
X=2.6/u, and attains a new   £ maximum
at A=4-6 (Langley’s Y). According to Angström the ab
sorption of carbonic acid is zero at A=0.9 u, and very weak
at A=1.69 u, after which it increases continuously to A=4'6".
and decreases again to X=60 u. This behaviour is entirely
in agreement with the values of log v in Table II. From
the value zero at 40° (A = 1-0 u) it attains a sensible value
(–0.0296) at 39°45 (A=1.4 m), and thereafter greater and
greater values (–0.0559 at 39°30, and –0.1070 at 39°15)
till it reaches a considerable maximum (–0.3412 at 39°,
X=4:3A). After this point the absorption decreases (at
38°45=5'6", log vs=–0-2035). According to Table II, the
absorption of carbonic acid at 38°30 and 38°15 (A=7.1 u
and 8.7 u) has very great values (log v= –0.2438 and
–0.3730), whilst according to Ångström it should be insensible.
This behaviour may be connected with the fact that Ångström's
spectrum had a very small intensity for the larger wave
lengths. In Paschen’s curve there are traces of a continuous
absorption by the carbonic acid in this whole region with
weak maxima at X=52 u, A=5'9", N=66 a (possibly due
to traces of water-vapour), X=8.4 u, and A=8.9 u. In
consequence of the strong absorption of water-vapour in this
region of the spectrum, the intensity of radiation was very
small in Langley’s observations, so that the calculated ab
sorption-coefficients are there not very exact (cf. above,
pp. 242-243). Possibly the calculated absorption of the car
bonic acid may have come out too great, and that of the
water-vapour too small in this part (between 38°30 and 38°0).
This can happen the more easily, as in Table I. K and W
in general increase together because they are both propor
tional to the “air-mass.” It may be pointed out that this
also occurs in the problems that are treated below, so that the
error from this cause is not of so great importance as one
might think at the first view.
    For angles greater than 38° (A = 9.5 u) we possess no
direct observations of the emission or absorption of the two
gases. The sun’s spectrum, according to Langley, exhibits
very great absorption-bands at about 37°50, 37°25, 37°, and
36°40°. According to my calculations the aqueous vapour
has its greatest absorbing power in the spectrum from 38° to
35° at angles between 37° 15 and 37°45 (the figures for
35°45, 35°30, and 35° 15 are very uncertain, as they de
pend upon very few measurements), and the carbonic acid
between 36°30 and 37°-0.      This seems to indicate that the
 first two absorption-bands are due to the action of water

        in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground.            249
vapour, the last two to that of carbonic acid. It should be
emphasized that Langley has applied the greatest diligence
in the measurement of the intensity of the moon’s radiation
at angles between 36° and 38°, where this radiation possesses
its maximum intensity. It may, therefore, be assumed that the
calculated absorption-coefficients for this part of the spectrum
are the most exact. This is of great importance for the fol
lowing calculations, for the radiation from the earth" has by
far the greatest intensity (about two thirds, cf. p. 250) in this
portion of the spectrum.
     II. The Total Absorption by Atmospheres of Varying
                            Composition.
   As we have now determined, in the manner described, the
values of the absorption-coefficients for all kinds of rays, it
will with the help of Langley’s figurest be possible to cal
culate the fraction of the heat from a body at 15°C. (the earth)
which is absorbed by an atmosphere that contains specified
quantities of carbonic acid and water-vapour. To begin with,
we will execute this calculation with the values K= 1 and
W=03. We take that kind of ray for which the best deter
minations have been made by Langley, and this lies in the midst
of the most important part of the radiation (37°). For this
pencil of rays we find the intensity of radiation at K= 1 and
W=0.3 equal to 629; and with the help of the absorption
coefficients we calculate the intensity for K=0 and W=0,
and find it equal to 105. Then we use Langley's experiments
on the spectral distribution of the radiation from a body of
15°C., and calculate the intensity for all other angles of devia
tion. These intensities are given under the heading M. After
this we have to calculate the values for K=1 and W=0.3.
For the angle 37° we know it to be 62.9. For any other
angle we could take the values A from Table II. if the moon
were a body of 15° C. But a calculation of the figures of
Very # shows that the full moon has a higher temperature,
about 100° C. Now the spectral distribution is nearly, but
not quite, the same for the heat from a body of 15° C. and
for that from one of 100° C. With the help of Langley’s
figures it is, however, easy to reduce the intensities for the
hot body at 100° (the moon) to be valid for a body at 15°

              For angles less than 37° one finds, in the manner above
           described, numbers that are a little inferior to the tabulated
           ones, which are found by means of the absorption-coefficients
           of Table II. and the values of N. In this way the sum of the
           M’s is a little greater (6.8 per cent.) than it would be accord
           ing to the calculation given above. This non-agreement
           results probably from the circumstance that the spectrum in
           the observations was not quite pure.
              The value 37.2 may possibly be affected with a relatively
           great error in consequence of the uncertainty of the M-values.
           In the following calculations it is not so much the value 37.2
           that plays the important part, but rather the diminution of
           the value caused by increasing the quantities K and W. For
           comparison, it may be mentioned that Langley has estimated
           the quantity of heat from the moon that passed through the
           atmosphere (of mean composition) in his researches to be 38
           per cent." As the mean atmosphere in Langley’s observa
           tions corresponded with higher values of K and W than K = 1
           and W=0.3, it will be seen that he attributed to the atmo
           sphere a greater transparence for opaque rays than I have
           done. In accordance with Langley's estimation, we should
           expect for K = 1 and W=0.3 a value of about 44 instead of
           37.2. How great an influence this difference may exert will
           be investigated in what follows.
              The absorption-coefficients quoted in Table II. are valid for
           an interval of K between about 1:1 and 2:25, and for W between
           0.3 and 2:22. In this interval one may, with the help of those
           coefficients and the values of N given above, calculate the value
           of N for another value of K and W, and so in this way obtain
           by means of summation the total heat that passes through an
           atmosphere of given condition. For further calculations I
           have also computed values of N for atmospheres that contain
           greater quantities of carbonic acid and aqueous vapour. These
           values must be considered as extrapolated. In the following
           table (Table III.) I have given these values of N.                         The

        Quite different from this dark heat is the behaviour of the
   heat from the sun on passing through new parts of the earth’s
  atmosphere. The first parts of the atmosphere exert without
  doubt a selective absorption of some ultra-red rays, but as
   soon as these are extinguished the heat seems not to diminish
   as it traverses new quantities of the gases under discussion.
   This can easily be shown for aqueous vapour with the help of
    Langley’s actinometric observations from Mountain Camp
  and Lone Pine in Colorado”.                         These      observations were
   executed at Lone Pine from the 18th of August to the 6th of
    September 1882 at 7" 15" and 7" 45" A.M., at 11" 45" A.M.
   and 12" 15" P.M., and at 4" 15" and 4"45" P.M. At Mountain
    Camp the observations were carried out from the 22nd to the
    25th of August at the same times of the day, except that only
    one observation was performed in the morning (at 8" 0"). I
    have divided these observations into two groups for each
    station according to the humidity of the air. In the following
    little table are quoted, first the place of observation, and after
    this under D the mean date of the observations (August 1882),

           At a very low humidity (Mountain Camp) it is evident that
       the absorbing power of the aqueous vapour has an influence,
       for the figures for greater humidity are (with an insignificant
       exception) inferior to those for less humidity. But for the
       observations from Lone Pine the contrary seems to be true.
       It is not permissible to assume that the radiation can be
       strengthened by its passage through aqueous vapour, but the
       observed effect must be caused by some secondary circum
       stance. Probably the air is in general more pure if there
       is more water-vapour in it than if there is less. The
       selective diffusion diminishes in consequence of this greater
       purity, and this secondary effect more than counterbalances
       the insignificant absorption that the radiation suffers from the
       increase of the water-vapour. It is noteworthy that Elster
       and Geitel have proved that invisible actinic rays of very
       high refrangibility traverse the air much more easily if it is
       humid than if it is dry. Langley’s figures demonstrate mean
       while that the influence of aqueous vapour on the radiation
       from the sun is insensible as soon as it has exceeded a value
       of about 0°4.
           Probably the same reasoning will hold good for car
       bonic acid, for the absorption spectrum of both gases is of the
        same general character. Moreover, the absorption by car
        bonic acid occurs at considerably greater wave-lengths, and
        £                   for much less important parts of the sun’s
        spectrum than the absorption by water-vapour". It is,
        therefore, justifiable to assume that the radiation from the
        sun suffers no appreciable diminution if K and W increase
        from a rather insignificant value (K=1, W =0.4) to higher
        OneS.
           Before we proceed further we need to examine another
       question. Let the carbonic acid in the air be, for instance,
       the same as now (K=1 for vertical rays), and the quantity
       of water-vapour be 10 grammes per cubic metre (W=1 for

  vertical rays). Then the vertical rays from the earth traverse
  the quantities K=1 and W = 1; rays that escape under an
  angle of 30° with the horizon (air-mass=2) traverse the
  quantities K=2, W = 2; and so forth. The different rays that
  emanate from a point of the earth’s surface suffer, therefore,
  a different absorption—the greater, the more the path of the
  ray declines from the vertical line. It may then be asked
! how long a path must the total radiation make, that the
  absorbed fraction of it is the same as the absorbed fraction of
  the total mass of rays that emanate to space in different
  directions. For the emitted rays we will suppose that the
  cosine law of Lambert holds good. With the aid of Table III.
  we may calculate the absorbed fraction of any ray, and then
  sum up the total absorbed heat and determine how great a
  fraction it is of the total radiation. In this way we find for
  our example the path (air-mass) 1:61. In other words, the
  total absorbed part of the whole radiation is just as great as
  if the total radiation traversed the quantities 1.61 of aqueous
  vapour and of carbonic acid. This number depends upon the
  composition of the atmosphere, so that it becomes less the
  greater the quantity of aqueous vapour and carbonic acid
  in the air. In the following table (IV.) we find this number
  for different quantities of both gases.

      III. Thermal Equilibrium on the Surface and in the
                     Atmosphere of the Earth.
   As we now have a sufficient knowledge of the absorption
of heat by the atmosphere, it remains to examine how the
temperature of the ground depends on the absorptive power
of the air. Such an investigation has been already performed
by Pouillet", but it must be made anew, for Pouillet used
hypotheses that are not in agreement with our present
knowledge.
    In our deductions we will assume that the heat that is con
ducted from the interior of the earth to its surface may be
wholly neglected. If a change occurs in the temperature
of the earth’s surface, the upper layers of the earth's crust will
evidently also change their temperature; but this later pro
cess will pass away in a very short time in comparison with
the time that is necessary for the alteration of the surface
temperature, so that at any time the heat that is transported
from the interior to the surface (positive in the winter, nega
 tive in the summer) must remain independent of the small
secular variations of the surface temperature, and in the
 course of a year be very nearly equal to zero.
    Likewise we will suppose that the heat that is conducted
to a given place on the earth's surface or in the atmosphere
in consequence of atmospheric or oceanic currents, horizontal
or vertical, remains the same in the course of the time con
sidered, and we will also suppose that the clouded part of the
 sky remains unchanged. It is only the variation of the
temperature with the transparency of the air that we shall
 eXalmline.
    All authors agree in the view that there prevails an equi
 librium in the temperature of the earth and of its atmosphere.
 The atmosphere must, therefore, radiate as much heat to
 space as it gains partly through the absorption of the sun’s
 rays, partly through the radiation from the hotter surface of
 the earth and by means of ascending currents of air heated
 by contact with the ground. On the other hand, the earth
 loses just as much ' by radiation to space and to the
 atmosphere as it gains by absorption of the sun's rays. If
 we consider a given place in the atmosphere or on the ground,
 we must also take into consideration the quantities of heat
 that are carried to this place by means of oceanic or atmo
 spheric currents.      For the radiation we will suppose that

   Stefan's law of radiation, which is now generally accepted,
   holds good, or in other words that the quantity of heat (W)
   that radiates from a body of the albedo (1-v) and tempera
   ture T (absolute) to another body of the absorption-coefficient
   A and absolute temperature 6 is
                              W= w8y(T4–6),
|  where y is the so-called radiation constant (1:21. 10-12 per
   sec. and cm.”). Empty space may be regarded as having the
   absolute temperature 0*.
      Provisionally we regard the air as a uniform envelope of
   the temperature 6 # the absorption-coefficient a for solar
   heat; so that if A calories arrive from the sun in a column of
   1 cm." cross-section, a A are absorbed by the atmosphere and
  (1-2)A reach the earth's surface. In the A calories there
  is, therefore, not included that part of the sun’s heat which
  by means of selective reflexion in the atmosphere is thrown
  out towards space. Further, let 8 designate the absorption
  coefficient of the air for the heat that radiates from the earth's
  surface; 8 is also the emission-coefficient of the air for radia
  tion of low temperature—strictly 15°; but as the spectral
  distribution of the heat varies rather slowly with the tempe
  rature, 8 may be looked on as the emission-coefficient also at
  the temperature of the air. Let the albedo of the earth’s
  crust be designated by (1-v), and the quantities of heat that
  are conveyed to the air and to the earth's surface at the point
  considered be M and N respectively. As unit of time we
  may take any period: the best choice in the following calcu
  lation is perhaps to take three months for this purpose. As
  unit of surface we may take 1 cm.”, and for the heat in the
  air that contained in a column of 1 cm.” cross-section and
  the height of the atmosphere. The heat that is reflected
  from the ground is not appreciably absorbed by the air
  (see p. 252), for it has previously traversed great quantities
  of water-vapour and carbonic acid, but a part of it may be
  returned to the ground by means of diffuse reflexion. Let
  this part not be included in the albedo (1–v). y, A, v, M, N,
  and a are to be considered as constants, 8 as the independent,
  and 6 and T as the dependent variables.

    For the earth's solid crust we may, without sensible error,
 put v equal to 1, if we except the snowfields, for which we
 assume v-0.5. For the water-covered parts of the earth I
 have calculated the mean value of v to be 0.925 by aid of the
 figures of Zenker". We have, also, in the following to make
 use of the albedo of the clouds.       I do not know if this has
 ever been measured, but it probably does not differ very much
 from that of fresh fallen snow, which Zöllner has determined
 to be 0.78, i.e. v =0.22.       For old snow the albedo is much
 less or v much greater; therefore we have assumed 0.5 as a
 mean value.
    The last formula shows that the temperature of the earth
 augments with 8, and the more rapidly the greater v is. For
 an increase of 1° if w=1 we find the following increases for

altered temperature. In that case entirely different circum
stances enter. If, for instance, an element of the surface which
is not now snow-covered, in consequence of falling temperature
becomes clothed with snow, we must in the last formula not
only alter 8 but also v. In this case we must remember that
a is very small compared to 8. For a we will choose the
value 0.40 in accordance with Langley's" estimate. Cer
tainly a great part of this value depends upon the diffusely
reflected part of the sun's heat, which is absorbed by the
earth’s atmosphere, and therefore should not be included in a,
as we have defined it above. On the other hand, the sun
may in general stand a little lower than in Langley's measure
ments, which were executed with a relatively high sun, and
in consequence of this a may be a little greater, so that these
circumstances may compensate each other. For 8 we will
choose the value 0.70, which corresponds when K=1 and
W=0.3 (a little below the freezing-point) with the factor 1.66
(see p. 253). In this case we find the relation between T

will be valid until b = 1, i.e. till the heat delivered by con
vection to the air exceeds the whole radiation of the sun.
This can only occur in the winter and in polar regions.
    But this is a secondary phenomenon. The chief effect that
we examine is the direct influence of an alteration of 8 upon
the temperature T of the earth’s surface. If we start from a
value T=273 and 8=0.70, we find the alteration (t) in the

number 5°.7 is reduced to 4°0. But as about half the sky is cloud
covered, the effect will be only half as great as for cloudless sky, i. e. the
mean effect will be a lowering of about 2°C.

                              1.00           + 18, 6.
    These values are calculated for v-1, i.e. for the solid crust
of the earth's surface, except the snowfields. For surfaces
with another value of v, as for instance the ocean or the
snowfields, we have to multiply this value t by a fraction
given above.
    We have now shortly to consider the influence of the
clouds. A great part of the earth's surface receives no heat
 directly from the sun, because the sun's rays are stopped by
 clouds. How great a part of the earth's surface is covered
 by clouds we may find from Teisserenc de Bort's work" on
Nebulosity. From tab. 17 of this publication I have deter
mined the mean nebulosity for different latitudes, and found:—
 Latitude. . 60.     45.   30.     15.    0,    -15.  —30. -45, -60.
 Nebulosity.    0.603 0.48 0.402 0.511 0,581 0.463 0.53        0.701
    For the part of the earth between 60° S. and 60° N. we
 find the mean value 0.525, i. e. 52.5 per cent. of the sky is
 clouded. The heat-effect of these clouds may be estimated in
 the following manner. Suppose a cloud lies over a part of
 the earth's surface and that no connexion exists between this
 shadowed part and the neighbouring parts, then a thermal
 equilibrium will exist between the temperature of the cloud
 and of the underlying ground. They will radiate to each
 other and the cloud also to the upper air and to space, and
 the radiation between cloud and earth may, on account of the
  slight difference of temperature, be taken as proportional to this
  difference. Other      '            of heat by means of air-currents
  are also, as a first approximation, proportional to this dif
  ference. If we therefore suppose the temperature of the
  cloud to alter (other circumstances, as its height and compo
  sition, remaining unchanged), the temperature of the ground
  under it must also alter in the same manner if the same supply
  of heat to both subsists—if there were no supply to the
  ground from neighbouring parts, the cloud and the ground
  would finally assume the same mean temperature. If, therefore,
  the temperature of the clouds varies in a determined manner

        in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground.        259
(without alteration of their other properties, as height, com
pactness, &c.), the ground will undergo the same variations of
temperature. Now it will be shown in the sequel that a
variation of the carbonic acid of the atmosphere in the same
proportion produces nearly the same thermal effect indepen
dently of its absolute magnitude (see p. 265). Therefore we
may calculate the temperature-variation in this case as if the
clouds covered the ground with a thin film of the albedo 0.78
(v=0:22, see p. 256). As now on the average K=1 and
W = 1 nearly, and in this case 8 is about 0.79, the effect on the
clouded part will be only 0.25 of the effect on parts that have
v=1.     If a like correction is introduced for the ocean
(v=0.925) on the supposition that the unclouded part of the
earth consists of as much water as of solid ground (which is
approximately true, for the clouds are by preference stored
up over the ocean), we find a mean effect of, in round num
bers, 60 p. c. of that which would exist if the whole earth’s
surface had v= 1. The snow-covered parts are not considered,
for, on the one hand, these parts are mostly clouded to
about 65 p. c.; further, they constitute only a very small
part of the earth (for the whole year on the average only
about 4 p. c.), so that the correction for this case would not
exceed 0.5 p. c. in the last number 60. And further, on the
border countries between snowfields and free soil secondary
effects come into play (see p. 257) which compensate, and
perhaps overcome, the moderating effect of the snow.
   In the foregoing we have supposed that the air is to be re
garded as an envelope of perfectly uniform temperature. This
is of course not true, and we now proceed to an examination
of the probable corrections that must be introduced for elimi
nating the errors caused by this inexactness. It is evident
that the parts of the air which radiate to space are chiefly
the external ones, and on the other hand the layers of air
which absorb the greatest part of the earth’s radiation do not
lie very high. From this cause both the radiation from air
to space (8 y6 in eq. 1) and also the radiation of the earth
to the air (8 yw(T'-6") in eq. 2), are greatly reduced, and
the air has a much greater effect as protecting against the
loss of heat to space than is assumed in these equations, and
consequently also in eq. (3). If we knew the difference of
temperature between the two layers of the air that radiate to
space and absorb the earth's radiation, it would be easy to
introduce the necessary correction in formulae (1), (2), and
 3). For this purpose I have adduced the following con
sideration.
   As at the mean composition of the atmosphere (K=1,

260    Prof. S. Arrhenius on the Influence of Carbonic Acid
W=1) about 80 p. c. of the earth's radiation is absorbed in
the air, we may as mean temperature of the absorbing layer
choose the temperature at the height where 40 p. c. of the
heat is absorbed. Since emission and absorption follow
the same quantitative laws, we may as mean temperature of
the emitting layer choose the temperature at the height where
radiation entering from space in the opposite direction to the
actual emission is absorbed to the extent of 40 p. c.
   Langley has made four measurements of the absorptive
power of water-vapour for radiation from a hot Leslie cube
of 100° C.” These give nearly the same absorption-coeffi
cient if Pouillet's formula is used for the calculation.      From
these numbers we calculate that for the absorption of 40 p. c.
of the radiation it would be necessary to intercalate so much
water-vapour between radiator and bolometer that, when
condensed, it would form a layer of water 3.05 millimetres
thick. If we now suppose as mean for the whole earth K=1
and W = 1 (see Table VI.), we find that vertical rays from the
earth, if it were at 100°, must traverse 305 metres of air to
lose 40 p. c. Now the earth is only at 15°C., but this cannot
make any great difference. Since the radiation emanates in all
directions, we have to divide 305 by 1.61 and get in this way
209 metres. In consequence of the lowering of the quantity
of water-vapour with the height f we must apply a slight
correction, so that the final result is 233 metres. Of course
this number is a mean value, and higher values will hold
good for colder, lower for warmer parts of the earth. In so
small a distance from the earth, then, 40 p. c. of the earth’s
radiation should be stopped. Now it is not wholly correct to
calculate with Pouillet's formula (it is rather strange that
 Langley's figures agree so well with it), which gives neces
sarily too low values. But, on the other hand, we have not
at all considered the absorption by the carbonic acid in this
part, and this may compensate for the error mentioned. In
 the highest layers of the atmosphere there is very little water
vapour, so that we must calculate with carbonic acid as
 the chief absorbent. From a measurement by Angström #,
 we learn that the absorption-coefficients of water-vapour and
 of carbonic acid in equal quantities (equal number of molecules)
 are in the proportion .81: 62. This ratio is valid for the
 least hot radiator that Angström used, and there is no doubt

that the radiation of the earth is much less refrangible. Put
in the absence of a more appropriate determination we may
use this for our purpose ; it is probable that for a less hot
radiator the absorptive power of the carbonic acid would
come out a little greater compared with that of water-vapour,
for the absorption-bands of CO2 are, on the whole, less
refrangible than those of H2O (see pp. 246-248). Using the
number 0.03 vol. p. c. for the quantity of carbonic acid in
the atmosphere, we find that rays which emanate from the
upper part of the air are derived to the extent of 40 p. c. from
a layer that constitutes 0-145 part of the atmosphere. This
corresponds to a height of about 15,000 metres. Concerning
this value we may make the same remark as on the foregoing
value. In this case we have neglected the absorption by the
small quantities of water-vapour in the higher             £
The temperature-difference of these two layers—the one ab
sorbing, the other radiating—is, according to Glaisher's
measurements" (with a little extrapolation), about 42°C.
    For the clouds we get naturally slightly modified numbers.
 We ought to take the mean height of the clouds that are
illuminated by the sun. As such clouds I have chosen the
summits of the cumuli that lie at an average height of
 1855 metres, with a maximum height of 3611 metres and a
minimum of 900 metres +.            I have made calculations for
mean values of 2000 and 4000 metres (corresponding to dif
ferences of temperature of 30°C. and 20°C. instead of 42°C.
for the earth's surface).
    If we now wish to adjust our formulae (1) to (3), we have
 in (1) and (2) to introduce 6 as the mean temperature of the
 radiating layer and (6+42), (6+30), or (6+20) respectively
 for the mean temperature of the absorbing layer. In the
 first case we should use v=1 and v=0.925 respectively, in
 the second and the third case v = 0.22.

 simpler formula.

  How great an influence this difference may exercise is very
  easily calculated with the help of formula (3) or (4). Ac
  cording to Langley's valuation, the effect should be nearly
  15 p. c. greater than according to mine. Now I think that my
  estimate agrees better with the great absorption that Langley
  has found for heat from terrestrial radiating bodies (see p. 260),
  and in all circumstances I have preferred to slightly under
  estimate than to overrate the effect in question.

IV. Calculation of the Variation of Temperature that would
     ensue in consequence of a given Variation of the Carbonic
      Acid in the Air.
   We now possess all the necessary data for an estimation of
the effect on the earth’s temperature which would be the
result of a given variation of the aërial carbonic acid. We
only need to determine the absorption-coefficient for a certain
place with the help of Table III. if we know the quantity of
carbonic acid (K= 1 now) and water-vapour (W) of this
place. By the aid of Table IV. we at first determine the factor
p that gives the mean path of the radiation from the earth
through the air and multiply the given K- and W-values by
this factor. Then we determine the value of A which corre
sponds to pK and pW. Suppose now that the carbonic acid
had another concentration K1(e.g. K1 = 1-5). Then we at first
suppose W unaltered and £e new valie of p, say pi, that
is valid on this supposition. Next we have to seek 8, which
corresponds to plKi (1:5p1) and plW. From formula (3) we
can then easily calculate the alteration (t) (here increase) in
the temperature at the given place which will accompany the
variation of 8 from 8 to 81. In consequence of the variation
(t) in the temperature, W must also undergo a variation. As
the relative humidity does not vary much, unless the distri
bution of land and water changes (see table 8 of my original
memoir), I have supposed that this quantity remains constant,
and thereby determined the new value W1 of W. A fresh
approximation gives in most cases values of W1 and 81 which
may be regarded as definitive. In this way, therefore, we
get the variation of temperature as soon as we know the
actual temperature and humidity at the given place.
   In order to obtain values for the temperature for the whole
earth, I have calculated from Dr. Buchan’s charts of the mean
temperature at different places in every month * the mean
temperature in every district that is contained between two
parallels differing by 10 and two meridians differing by 20
degrees, (e. g., between 0° and 10° N. and 160° and 180° W.).
The humidity has not as yet been sufficiently examined for
the whole earth; and I have therefore collected a great many
measurements of the relative humidity at different places
 (about 780) on the earth and marked them down in maps of
the world, and thereafter estimated the mean values for every
district. These quantities I have tabulated for the four seasons,
Dec.-Feb., March–May, June–Aug., and Sept.-Nov.                  The
detailed table and the observations used are to be found in
my original memoir : here I reproduce only the mean values
for every tenth parallel (Table VI.).

        in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground. 265
   By means of these values, I have calculated the mean
alteration of temperature that would follow if the quantity of
carbonic acid varied from its present mean value (K=1) to
another, viz. to K=0.67, 1:5, 2, 2:5, and 3 respectively. This
calculation is made for every tenth parallel, and separately
for the four seasons of the year. The variation is given in
Table VII.
   A glance at this Table shows that the influence is nearly
the same over the whole earth.     The influence has a minimum
near the equator, and increases from this to a flat maximum
that lies the further from the equator the higher the quantity
of carbonic acid in the air.       For K = 0.67 the maximum
effect lies about the 40th parallel, for K = 1.5 on the 50th,
for K=2 on the 60th, and for higher K-values above the
70th parallel. The influence is in general greater in the
winter than in the summer, except in the case of the parts
that lie between the maximum and the pole. The influence
 will also be greater the higher the value of v, that is in
general somewhat greater for land than for ocean. On account
of the nebulosity of the Southern hemisphere, the effect will
be less there than in the Northern hemisphere. An increase
in the quantity of carbonic acid will of course diminish the
difference in temperature between day and night. A very
important secondary elevation of the effect will be produced
in those places that alter their albedo by the extension or
regression of the snow-covering (see p. 257), and this secondary
effect will probably remove the maximum effect from lower
parallels to the neighbourhood of the poles *.
    It must be remembered that the above calculations are
found by interpolation from Langley’s numbers for the values
 K=0.67 and K=1:5, and that the other numbers must be
regarded as extrapolated. The use of Pouillet's formula
makes the values for K=0.67 probably a little too small,
those for K=1:5 a little too great. This is also without
doubt the case for the extrapolated values, which correspond
 to higher values of K.                               -
    We may now inquire how great must the variation of the
carbonic acid in the atmosphere be to cause a given change of
the temperature. The answer may be found by interpola
 tion in Table VII. To facilitate such an inquiry, we may
 make a simple observation. If the quantity of carbonic acid
 decreases from 1 to 0.67, the fall of temperature is nearly the
 same as the increase of temperature if this quantity augments
 to 1:5. And to get a new increase of this order of magnitude
 (3°4), it will be necessary to alter the quantity of carbonic
 acid till it reaches a value nearly midway between 2 and 2.5.

Thus if the quantity of carbonic acid increases in geometric
progression, the augmentation of the temperature will increase
nearly in arithmetic progression. This rule—which naturally
holds good only in the part investigated—will be useful for the
following summary estimations.
                      5. Geological Consequences.
    I should certainly not have undertaken these tedious calcu
lations if an extraordinary interest had not been connected
with them. In the Physical Society of Stockholm there have
been occasionally very lively discussions on the probable
causes of the Ice Age; and these discussions have, in my
 opinion, led to the conclusion that there exists as yet no satisfac
 tory hypothesis that could explain how the climatic conditions
 for an ice age could be realized in so short a time as that which
 has elapsed from the days of the glacial epoch. The common
 view hitherto has been that the earth has cooled in the lapse of
 time; and if one did not know that the reverse has been the
 case, one would certainly assert that this cooling must go on
 continuously. Conversations with my friend and colleague
 Professor     £           together with the discussions above
 referred to, led me to make a preliminary estimate of the
 probable effect of a variation of the atmospheric carbonic
 acid on the temperature of the earth. As this estimation led
 to the belief that one might in this way probably find an
 explanation for temperature variations of 5°-10°C., I worked
 out the calculation more in detail, and lay it now before the
 public and the critics.
     From geological researches the fact is well established
 that in Tertiary times there existed a vegetation and an
 animal life in the temperate and arctic zones that must have
 been conditioned by a much higher temperature than the
  present in the same regions". The temperature in the arctic
  zones appears to have exceeded the present temperature
 by about 8 or 9 degrees. To this genial time the ice age
  succeeded, and this was one or more times interrupted by
 interglacial periods with a climate of about the same character
  as the present, sometimes even milder. When the ice age

Orel, and Nijni Novgorod), Germany and Austria (to the
Harz, Erz-Gebirge, Dresden, and Cracow). At the same
time an ice-cap from the Alps covered Switzerland, parts of
France, Bavaria south of the Danube, the Tyrol, Styria, and
other Austrian countries, and descended into the northern part
of Italy. Simultaneously, too, North America was covered with
ice on the west coast to the 47th parallel, on the east coast to
the 40th, and in the central part to the 37th (confluence of
the Mississippi and Ohio rivers). In the most different parts
of the world, too, we have found traces of a great ice age, as
in the Caucasus, Asia Minor, Syria, the Himalayas, India,
Thian Shan, Altai, Atlas, on Mount Kenia and Kilimandjaro
(both very near to the equator), in South Africa, Australia,
New Zealand, Kerguelen, Falkland Islands, Patagonia and
other parts of South America. The geologists in general
are inclined to think that these glaciations were simultaneous
on the whole earth "; and this most natural view would
probably have been generally accepted, if the theory of Croll,
which demands a genial age on the Southern hemisphere at the
same time as an ice age on the Northern and vice versá, had
not influenced opinion. By measurements of the displacement
of the snow-line we arrive at the result, — and this is very
concordant for different places—that the temperature at that
time must have been 4°-5°C. lower than at present. The last
glaciation must have taken place in rather recent times,
geologically speaking, so that the human race certainly had
appeared at that period. Certain American geologists hold
the opinion that since the close of the ice age only some 7000
to 10,000 years have elapsed, but this most probably is greatly
underestimated.
   One may now ask, How much must the carbonic acid vary
according to our figures, in order that the temperature should
attain the same values as in the Tertiary and Ice ages respect
ively? A simple calculation shows that the temperature in
the arctic regions would rise about 8° to 9°C., if the
carbonic acid increased to 2.5 or 3 times its present value.
In order to get the temperature of the ice age between the
40th and 50th parallels, the carbonic acid in the air should
sink to 0.62-0:55 of its present value (lowering of temperature
4°-5°C.). The demands of the geologists, that at the genial
epochs the climate should be more uniform than now, accords
very well with our theory. The geographical annual and
diurnal ranges of temperature would be partly smoothed
away, if the quantity of carbonic acid was augmented. The
      * Neumayr, Erdgeschichte, p. 648; Nathorst, l.c. p. 992.

        in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground. 269
reverse would be the case (at least to a latitude of 50° from
the equator), if the carbonic acid diminished in amount. But
in both these cases I incline to think that the secondary
action (see p. 257) due to the regress or the progress of the
snow-covering would play the most important rôle. The
theory demands also that, roughly speaking, the whole earth
should have undergone about the same variations of tempera
ture, so that according to it genial or glacial epochs must have
occurred simultaneously on the whole earth. Because of the
greater nebulosity of the Southern hemisphere, the variations
must there have been a little less (about 15 per cent.) than
in the Northern hemisphere. The ocean currents, too, must
there, as at the present time, have effaced the differences in
temperature at different latitudes to a greater extent than in
the Northern hemisphere. This effect also results from the
greater nebulosity in the arctic zones than in the neighbour
hood of the equator.
   There is now an important question which should be
answered, namely:—Is it probable that such great variations
in the quantity of carbonic acid as our theory requires have
occurred in relatively short geological times? The answer to
this question is given by Prof. Högbom. As his memoir on
this question may not be accessible to most readers of these
pages, I have summed up and translated his utterances which
are of most importance to our subject *:—                         -
   “Although it is not possible to obtain exact quantitative
expressions for the reactions in nature by which carbonic
acid is developed or consumed, nevertheless there are some
factors, of which one may get an approximately true estimate,
and from which certain conclusions that throw light on the
question may be drawn. In the first place, it seems to be
of importance to compare the quantity of carbonic acid now
present in the air with the quantities that are being trans
formed. If the former is insignificant in comparison with
 the latter, then the probability for variations is wholly othe
 than in the opposite case.                                      - -
    “On the supposition that the mean quantity of carbonic
 acid in the air reaches 0.03 vol. per cent, this number repre
 sents 0.045 per cent. by weight, or 0.342 millim. partial
pressure, or 0.466 gramme of carbonic acid for every cm.”
 of the earth's surface.     Reduced to carbon this quantity
 would give a layer of about 1 millim. thickness over the
 earth's surface.   The quantity of carbon that is fixed in the
 living organic world can certainly not be estimated with the
       * Högbom, Svensk kemisk Tidskrift, Bd. vi. p. 169 (1894).

 270 Prof. S. Arrhenius on the Influence of Carbonic Acid
 same degree of exactness; but it is evident that the numbers
 that might express this quantity ought to be of the same
 order of magnitude, so that the carbon in the air can neither
 be conceived of as very great nor as very little, in compa
 rison with the quantity of carbon occurring in organisms.
 With regard to the great rapidity with which the transform
 ation in organic nature proceeds, the disposable quantity of
 carbonic acid is not so excessive that     £          caused by
 climatological or other reasons in the velocity and value of
 that transformation might be not able to cause displacements
 of the equilibrium.
    “The following calculation is also very instructive for the
 appreciation of the relation between the quantity of carbonic
 acid in the air and the quantities that are transformed.
 The world’s present production of coal reaches in round
 numbers 500 millions of tons per annum, or 1 ton per km.”
of the earth's surface. Transformed into carbonic acid, this
quantity would correspond to about a thousandth part of
the carbonic acid in the atmosphere. It represents a layer of
limestone of 0.003 millim. thickness over the whole globe,
or 1.5 km.” in cubic measure. This quantity of carbonic
acid, which is supplied to the atmosphere chiefly by modern
industry, may be regarded as completely compensating the
quantity of carbonic acid that is consumed in the formation
of limestone (or other mineral carbonates) by the weathering
or decomposition of silicates. From the determination of the
amounts of dissolved substances, especially carbonates, in a
number of rivers in different countries and climates, and of
the quantity of water flowing in these rivers and of their
drainage-surface compared with the land-surface of the globe,
it is estimated that the quantities of dissolved carbonates that
are supplied to the ocean in the course of a year reach at
most the bulk of 3 km.” As it is also proved that the
rivers the drainage regions of which consist of silicates
convey very unimportant quantities of carbonates compared
with those that flow through limestone regions, it is per
missible to draw the conclusion, which is also strengthened
by other reasons, that only an insignificant part of these 3 km.”
of carbonates is formed directly by decomposition of silicates.
In other words, only an unimportant part of this quantity of
carbonate of lime can be derived from the process of wea
thering in a year.    Even though the number given were on
account of inexact or uncertain assumptions erroneous to the
extent of 50 per cent, or more, the comparison instituted is of
very great interest, as it proves that the most important of
all the processes by means of which carbonic acid has been

        in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground.      271
removed from the atmosphere in all times, namely the
chemical weathering of siliceous minerals, is of the same
order of magnitude as a process of contrary effect, which is
caused by the industrial development of our time, and which
must be conceived of as being of a temporary nature.
   “In comparison with the quantity of carbonic acid which
is fixed in limestone (and other carbonates), the carbonic acid
of the air vanishes. With regard to the thickness of sedi
mentary formations and the great part of them that is formed
by limestone and other carbonates, it seems not improbable
that the total quantity of carbonates would cover the whole
earth's surface to a height of hundreds of metres. If we
assume 100 metres,—a number that may be inexact in a high
degree, but probably is underestimated,—we find that about
25,000 times as much carbonic acid is fixed to lime in the
sedimentary formations as exists free in the air. Every
molecule of carbonic acid in this mass of limestone has,
however, existed in and passed through the atmosphere in
the course of time. Although we neglect all other factors
which may have influenced the quantity of carbonic acid in
the air, this number lends but very slight probability to the
hypothesis, that this quantity should in former geological
epochs have changed within limits which do not differ much
from the present amount. As the process of weathering
has consumed quantities of carbonic acid many thousand
times greater than the amount now disposable in the air,
and as this process from different geographical, climato
logical and other causes has in all likelihood proceeded with
very different intensity at different epochs, the probability
of important variations in the quantity of carbonic acid
seems to be very great, even if we take into account the com
pensating processes which, as we shall see in what follows,
are called forth as soon as, for one reason or another,
the production or consumption of carbonic acid tends to
displace the equilibrium to any considerable degree. One
often hears the opinion expressed, that the quantity of
carbonic acid in the air ought to have been very much
greater formerly than now, and that the diminution should
arise from the circumstance that carbonic acid has been taken
from the air and stored in the earth’s crust in the form of
coal and carbonates. In many cases this hypothetical dimi
nution is ascribed only to the formation of coal, whilst the
much more important formation of carbonates is wholly over
looked. This whole method of reasoning on a continuous
diminution of the carbonic acid in the air loses all foundation
in fact, notwithstanding that enormous quantities of carbonic

272 Prof. S. Arrhenius on the Influence of Carbonic Acid
acid in the course of time have been fixed in carbonates, if
we consider more closely the processes by means of which
carbonic acid has in all times been supplied to the atmosphere.
From these we may well conclude that enormous variations
have occurred, but not that the variation has always proceeded
in the same direction.                                      -
    “Carbonic acid is supplied to the atmosphere by the follow
ing processes —(1) volcanic exhalations and geological phe
nomena connected therewith; (2) combustion of carbonaceous
meteorites in the higher regions of the atmosphere; (3) com
bustion and decay of organic bodies; (4) decomposition of
carbonates; (5) liberation of carbonic acid mechanically
inclosed in minerals on their fracture or decomposition.
The carbonic acid of the air is consumed chiefly by the
 following processes –(6) formation of carbonates from
silicates on weathering; and (7) the consumption of carbonic
acid by vegetative processes. The ocean, too, plays an
important rôle as a regulator of the quantity of carbonic acid
in the air by means of the absorptive power of its water,
which gives off carbonic acid as its temperature rises and
absorbs it as it cools. The processes named under (4) and
 (5) are of little significance, so that they may be omitted.
 So too the processes (3) and (7), for the circulation of matter
in the organic world goes on so rapidly that their variations
cannot have any sensible influence. From this we must
except periods in which great quantities of organisms were
stored up in sedimentary formations and thus subtracted
from the circulation, or in which such stored-up products
were, as now, introduced anew into the circulation. The
source of carbonic acid named in (2) is wholly incalculable.
   “Thus the processes (1), (2), and (6) chiefly remain as
balancing each other. As the enormous quantities of car
bonic acid (representing a pressure of many atmospheres)
that are now fixed in the limestone of the earth’s crust
cannot be conceived to have existed in the air but as an insig
nificant fraction of the whole at any one time since organic
life appeared on the globe, and since therefore the consump
tion through weathering and formation of carbonates must
have been compensated by means of continuous supply, we
must regard volcanic exhalations as the chief source of car
bonic acid for the atmosphere.
   “But this source has not flowed regularly and uniformly.
Just as single volcanoes have their periods of variation with
alternating relative rest and intense activity, in the same
manner the globe as a whole seems in certain geological
epochs to have exhibited a more violent and general volcanic

        in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground. 273
activity, whilst other epochs have been marked by a com
parative quiescence of the volcanic forces. It seems there
fore probable that the quantity of carbonic acid in the air has
undergone nearly simultaneous variations, or at least that
this factor has had an important influence.
    “If we pass the above-mentioned processes for consuming
and producing carbonic acid under review, we find that they
evidently do not stand in such a relation to or dependence on
one another that any    £              exists for the permanence
of an equilibrium of the carbonic acid in the atmosphere.
An increase or decrease of the supply continued during
geological periods must, although it may not be important,
conduce to remarkable alterations of the quantity of carbonic
acid in the air, and there is no conceivable hindrance to
imagining that this might in a certain geological period have
been several times greater, or on the other hand considerably
less, than now.”
   As the question of the probability of quantitative variation
of the carbonic acid in the atmosphere is in the most decided
manner answered by Prof. Högbom, there remains only one
other point to which I wish to draw attention in a few words,
namely: Has no one hitherto proposed any acceptable ex
planation for the occurrence of genial and glacial periods?
Fortunately, during the progress of the foregoing calcula
tions, a memoir was published by the distinguished Italian
meteorologist L. De Marchi '. relieves me from answer
ing the last question". He examined in detail the different
theories hitherto proposed—astronomical, physical, or geo
graphical, and of these I here give a short résumé. These
theories assert that the occurrence of genial or glacial epochs
should depend on one or other change in the following cir
cumstances :
    (1) The temperature of the earth's place in space.
    (2) The sun’s radiation to the earth (solar constant).
    (3) The obliquity of the earth's axis to the ecliptic.
   (4)  The position of the poles on the earth’s surface.
    (5) The form of the earth’s orbit, especially its eccentricity
          (Croll).
   (6) The shape and extension of continents and oceans.
    (7) The covering of the earth's surface (vegetation).
    (8) The direction of the oceanic and aerial currents.
    (9) The position of the equinoxes.
    De Marchi arrives at the conclusion that all these hypotheses
must be rejected (p. 207). On the other hand, he is of the
   * Luigi De Marchi: Le cause dell'era glaciale, premiato dal R, Istituto
Lombardo, Pavia, 1895.

274     Prof. S. Arrhenius on the Influence of Carbonic Acid
opinion that a change in the transparency of the atmosphere
would possibly give the desired effect. According to his
calculations, “a lowering of this transparency would effect a
lowering of the temperature on the whole earth, slight in the
equatorial regions, and increasing with the latitude into the
70th parallel, nearer the poles again a little less. Further,
this lowering would, in non-tropical regions, be less on the
 continents than on the ocean and would diminish the annual
 variations of the temperature. This diminution of the air's
 transparency ought chiefly to be attributed to a greater
 quantity of aqueous vapour in the air, which would cause
 not only a direct cooling but also copious precipitation of
 water and snow on the continents. The origin of this
 greater quantity of water-vapour is not easy to explain.” De
  Marchi has arrived at wholly other results than myself, because
 he has not sufficiently considered the important quality of
 selective absorption which is possessed by aqueous vapour.
 And, further, he has forgotten that if aqueous vapour is sup
 plied to the atmosphere, it will be condensed till the former
 condition is reached, if no other change has taken place. As
 we have seen, the mean relative humidity between the 40th
 and 60th parallels on the northern hemisphere is 76 per cent.
 If, then, the mean temperature sank from its actual value +5.3
 by 4°-5°C., i. e. to +1-3 or +0.3, and the aqueous vapour
 remained in the air, the relative humidity would increase to
  101 or 105 per cent. This is of course impossible, for the
 relative humidity cannot exceed 100 per cent. in the free air.
 A fortiori it is impossible to assume that the absolute
 £y could have

                          been greater than now in the glacial
   P:    the hypothesis of Croll still seems to enjoy a certain
  favour with English geologists, it may not be without interest
  to cite the utterance of De Marchi on this theory, which
  he, in accordance with its importance, has examined more in
  detail than the others.     He says, and I entirely agree with
  him on this point —“Now I think I may conclude that from
  the point of view of climatology or meteorology, in the
  present state of these sciences, the hypothesis of Croll seems
  to be wholly untenable as well in its principles as in its
  consequences”".
     It seems that the great advantage which Croll's hypothesis
  promised to geologists, viz. of giving them a natural chro
  nology, predisposed them in favour of its acceptance.
  But this circumstance, which at first appeared advantageous,
  seems with the advance of investigation rather to militate

        in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground. 275
against the theory, because it becomes more and more im
possible to reconcile the chronology demanded by Croll's
hypothesis with the facts of observation.
   I trust that after what has been said the theory pro
posed in the foregoing pages will prove useful in : aining
some points in geological climatology which have hitherto
proved most difficult to interpret.

  As the nebulosity is very different in different latitudes,
and also different over the sea and over the continents, it is
evident that the influence of a variation in the carbonic acid
of the air will be somewhat different from that calculated
above, where it is assumed that the nebulosity is the same
over the whole globe. I have therefore estimated the nebu
losity at different latitudes with the help of the chart published

 XXXII. On the Calculation of the Conductivity of Mixtures of
  : Electrolytes. By Prof. J. G. MACGREGOR, Dalhousie
     College, Halifax, N.S.*
 An'              IUS has deducedt, as one of the consequences
          of the dissociation theory of electrolytic conduction,
 that the condition which must be fulfilled in order that two
 aqueous solutions of single electrolytes, which have one ion
 in common and which undergo no change of volume on being
 mixed, may be isohydric, i. e. may on being mixed undergo
  no change in their state of dissociation or ionisation, is that
  the concentration of ions, i. e. the number of dissociated
  gramme-molecules per unit of volume, shall be the same for
  both solutions. He obtained this result by combining the
  equations of kinetic equilibrium for the constituent electrolytes
 before and after mixture.
     According to the above theory, the specific conductivity
  of a mixture of two solutions of electrolytes 1 and 2, whose

volumes before the mixture were vi' and v, respectively,
which contained ni and n2 gramme-molecules of the electro
lytes per unit of volume, whose combined volume after
mixture is p(v) + v ), whose coefficients of ionisation after
mixture are a1 and as, and whose specific molecular con
ductivities at infinite dilution under the circumstances in
which they exist in the mixture are u-, and us, is given by
the expression

                                 (aniv,'", + asn't,'u~).
 Since in any case in which isohydric solutions are mixed
without change of volume, ni, vi', n2, v2 are known, 21 and as
 readily determinable, and p equal to unity, the specific con
 ductivity can be calculated provided we assume that u.., and
 A., have the same values for solutions in a mixture as for
 simple solutions. In the case in which equal volumes of the
 constituents are mixed without change of volume, the specific
 conductivity of the mixture becomes the mean of the specific
 conductivities of the constituent solutions.
    Arrhenius has subjected the above result to a number of
 tests. In one he determined by experiment several series of
 dilute aqueous solutions of different single acids, such that if
 any two of the members of the same series were mixed in
 equal volumes the mixture was found to have a conductivity
 equal to the mean of the conductivities of the constituents.
 Regarding the solutions of each series as shown thereby to be
 isohydric among one another, he calculated the concentra
 tions of the ions in the various solutions by the aid of data
  due to Ostwald. The following table gives the result, the
 numbers specifying the concentration of dissociated hydrogen
 (in mgr. per litre) in the constituent solutions, and those in
  each row applying to solutions found as above to be isohydric

   It will be observed that while the numbers in the various
horizontal rows show a general agreement, they differ very
considerably from one another, the extreme differences ranging
from 0.7 to 20.5 per cent.
   He found also that two solutions of Ammonium Acetate
and Acetic Acid respectively, which were determined as above
to be isohydric, contained, according to Kohlrausch, amounts
of the ion CH3COO which were in the ratio 1 : 0.79, a ratio
which is only very roughly equal to unity.
   So far as result is concerned these tests are not satisfactory.
But the lack of agreement may have been due to various
causes: (1) the data for calculation may have been defective;
(2) the change of volume which would doubtless occur on
mixing, even with very dilute solutions, may have been too
great for the     £               of Arrhenius's deduction; and
(3) the difference between the values of u, in simple solution
and in a mixture may be too great to admit of the identifica
tion of isohydric solutions by the method employed.
   On the other hand, Arrhenius has calculated" the conduc
tivities of two dilute solutions containing in each case given
quantities of two acids, employing for this purpose a series of
approximations based on his own observations of isohydric
solutions of the acids; and the calculated values were found
to agree with those observed to within 0.5 and 0.2 per cent.
respectively. So far as result is concerned this forms a much
more satisfactory test than those mentioned above. But the
number of calculations is too small to exclude the possibility
of accidental agreement.
   The calculation of the conductivity of a mixture of electro
lytes is so severe a test of the ionisation theory of electrolysis
that I have thought it well to test its possibility on a more
extensive scale, especially as a ': body of material
is available for this purpose in the observations of the con
ductivity of mixtures of solutions of Potassium and Sodium
Chlorides made by Benderf.             The present paper contains
the results of calculations of the conductivities of mixtures
determined experimentally by him.
                      Method of Calculation.
   In order to make such calculations by Arrhenius's method,
it would be necessary to make a preliminary determination of
a number of isohydric solutions of the two salts, and to restrict
the calculations to very dilute solutions. They may be made,
however, without such preliminary experiments and without

such restriction by employing a more general form of Arrhe
nius's deduction. Two electrolytes having a common ion and
in a state of equilibrium in the same solution, may be regarded
as occupying definite portions of the volume of the solution.
If we apply the equilibrium conditions to the parts of the
solution occupied by the respective electrolytes as well as to
the whole solution, we obtain equations which, mutatis mu
tandis, are identical with those obtained by Arrhenius for
isohydric solutions and their mixture, and which give a
similar result, viz., that for equilibrium the concentrations of
the ions of the respective electrolytes per unit volume of the
portion of the complex solution or mixture occupied by them
must be the same.
   With the aid of this result, we can find the ionisation
coefficients of the constituents of a mixture. For if, in
addition to the symbols used above, v1 and v2 be taken to
represent the volumes of the portions of the mixture occupied
by the respective electrolytes, it gives us the equation

   Of the quantities involved in these equations, ni, n., "I', ''
are known, and p may be determined by density measure
ments before and after mixture.       The form of the functions
in (3) and (4) may be determined if measurements of the
conductivities of sufficiently extended series of simple solu
tions of the constituent electrolytes are made. We have thus
four equations with but four unknown quantities.

we may write the above equations as follows:--

   I determined a, and as from these equations by the fol
lowing graphical process:-Equation (3), was employed by
drawing, from experimental data, for simple solutions of elec
trolyte 1, a curve with values of the concentration of the ions
 (a/W) as abscissae and corresponding values of the dilution (W)
as ordinates.    This curve was drawn once for all and was used
in all determinations. The curve embodying equation (4)
had to be drawn anew for each mixture examined.            If this
mixture was formed of solutions containing ni and n2 gramme
molecules per unit volume of electrolytes 1 and 2 respectively,
the curve had as abscissae the concentrations of ions of a series
of simple solutions of electrolyte 2, and as ordinates, since
Bender’s mixtures were mixtures of equal volumes, n°/n,
times the corresponding values of the dilutions. Equations
 (1) and (2) were applied by finding, by inspection, two points,
one in each curve, having a common abscissa (21/W1=as/W2),
and having ordinates (V1 and       : V2
                                    1
                                           respectively) of such
magnitude as to have a sum equal to p times the sum of the
 ordinates of the points on the curves determined by the dilu
tions (V1' and W, respectively) before mixing. The value of
 the abscissa common to the two points thus determined gives
 the concentration of ions of both constituents in the mixture.
 The corresponding ordinate of the first curve, and that of the
 second curve multiplied by ni/ng, give the dilutions (V1 and
 V2) of the constituents in the mixture. The products of the
common value of a/V into V1 and V2 are the required values
 of a1 and as respectively.
    It will be obvious that the values of a1 and as for a solution
 containing two electrolytes with a common ion may be deter
 mined in this way, whether it has been formed by the mixing
 of two simple solutions or not. It may always be imagined
 to have been formed in this way; and if data are not available

  e made.

   These data are quite sufficient for drawing the curves repre
senting a/W as b(V) in the £ corresponding to small

282       Prof. J. G. MacGregor on the Calculation of
greater dilutions, where the curvature is most rapid. I there
fore obtained interpolation formulae, by means of which I
drew in the latter parts of the curves, expressing a/V in the
case of each salt in terms of the reciprocals of powers of V.
These formulae, having no permanent value, need not be given
here. The table of results below shows that they were accu
rate enough for the purpose in hand.
   As Bender measured the specific gravities of both his
simple solutions and his mixtures, his paper affords the neces
sary data for determining the change of volume on mixing.
Such change will have a double effect on the calculated con
ductivity: (1) it will affect the value of a as determined from
the curves, and (2) it introduces the factor p in the final com
putation. In the case of Bender's solutions, though in some
cases they were nearly or quite saturated, the first effect was
so small as to be much less than the error incidental to the
graphical process, and I did not therefore take it into account.
The second effect was also very small; but as in some cases
it was nearly as great as Bender’s estimated error, I took it
into account in all cases.
   While Kohlrausch's solutions had at 18°C. both the con
stitution and the conductivity specified in his tables, Bender’s
solutions had at 15° the constitution and at 18° the conduc
tivity ascribed to them. I found that it did not appreciably
affect the values found for a1 and as to take the concentra
tions at 15° as being the concentrations at 18°; but that this
approximation was inadmissible in calculating the conduc
tivity, as in some cases it made a difference of about the
same magnitude as Bender's estimated error. Hence in the
calculation I took the values of n1 and n2 to be Bender's
values multiplied by the ratio of the volume of the solution
at 15° to its volume at 18°.   As Bender measured the thermal
expansion of his solutions, his paper affords the necessary data
for this correction.
   The conductivities given by Bender as the results of his
observations are the actual results of measurements, and are
thus affected by accidental errors, which in some cases are
considerable. In order that his measurements may be
rendered comparable with the results of calculations, these
accidental errors must, as far as possible, be removed. I
therefore plotted all his series of observations on coordinate
paper, drew smooth curves through them, and estimated as
well as I could in this way the accidental errors of the single
measurements.     The correction thus determined is referred
to in the table on p. 285 as correction a.

   Again, it will be noticed that the differences are all of the
same sign up to conductivities of about 1800, and nearly all of
the opposite sign for higher conductivities; also that for any
given conductivity the difference is of the same sign and
 order of magnitude for solutions of both salts. If they were
due to the first of the above assigned causes, since Kohl
 rausch’s interpolated values agree well with his observations,
 we should expect much more alternation of sign : if to the
 second, there should be no change of sign : if to both, there
 should be greater and more irregular variation in magnitude.
 The fact that the differences are practically the same for both
 electrolytes at any given value of the conductivity, would
 seem to show that the cause of the differences—a defect in the
 apparatus possibly or in the distilled water—was operative in
 the measurements of both sets of simple solutions, and there
 fore probably in the measurements of the mixtures. Hence,
 to render the results of calculations based on Kohlrausch's
 data for the simple solutions comparable with Bender's results
 for mixtures, we must determine what the conductivities of
 Bender’s mixtures would have been found to be if Kohlrausch
 had prepared and measured them. To find this out as nearl
 as possible, I have plotted the data of the above table     £
 Bender's conductivities as abscissae and the differences between

284       Prof. J. G. MacGregor on the Calculation of
them and Kohlrausch’s corresponding values as ordinates,
and drawn a smooth curve through the points. By the aid of
this curve I determined the correction b of the table given
below. The correction is, of course, a more or less doubtful
one; for it is not certain that the observations on mixtures
suffered from the same unknown source of error as the obser
vations on simple solutions. It seems probable, however,
that they did; and the results of the table given below would
appear to render it almost certain.                      . . . .
   It may be well in one case to give an example of the mode
of calculation. We may take for this purpose the mixture of
solutions containing 1 grm.-molecule of salt each. It is
found by the graphical process that the value of a/W for this
mixture is 0.718 grm.-molecule per litre, and that the
dilutions of the mixture are 0.937 and 1.063 litre per grm.
molecule for the NaCl and the KCl respectively. The den
sities of the constituent solutions were 1.0444 and 1:0401
respectively, and that of the mixture 1.0422. The expansions
per unit volume between 15° and 20°C. were 0.0013569 and
0.001:2489 respectively. The values of the conductivity at
infinite dilution I took to be 1028 and 1216, according to
Kohlrausch's observations. Hence the conductivity of the
mixture,              -       -                       -

   Bender’s observed value (he used the same standard as
Kohlrausch) was 814. To this a correction of about -3
must be applied to make the observation agree with the
others of the same series (correction a), and a correction of
about -3 to make it comparable with a calculated value
based on Kohlrausch’s data (correction b). Bender's reduced
result is thus 808, which differs from the calculated value by
1:2 or 0.15 per cent.

286        Prof. J. G. MacGregor on the Calculation of
   It will be seen that in the case of the more dilute solutions
Nos. 1–17 and 19, the differences, which are in all cases less
than 1 per cent, and for the most part considerably less, are
one half positive and one half negative; and that whether the
solutions are arranged in the order of conductivity or in the
order of mean concentration, they exhibit quite a sufficient
alternation of sign to warrant the conclusion that they are
due, chiefly at least, to errors in the observations and the
graphical portion of the calculations.
   In the case of the stronger solutions, Nos.16–18 and 19–22,
the alternation of sign has disappeared. In the weakest solu
tions of these two series the differences are positive and small;
but as the concentration increases, the differences become
negative and take increasing negative values, the negative
difference having its greatest value in No. 22, which is a
mixture of a strong solution of NaCl with a saturated solution
of KCl. The tendency towards a negative difference as the
concentration increases may be recognized also in Nos. 11
and 15; and it is perhaps worth noting that, while the mean
value of the positive differences is slightly greater than that of
the negative differences up to a concentration of 1 gramme
molecule of salt per litre, the mean negative difference is the
greater for higher concentrations.
    It is manifest from these results that for solutions of these
chlorides containing less than, say, 2 gramme-molecules per
litre, it is possible to calculate the conductivity very exactly,
but that for stronger solutions the calculated value is less than
the observed.
    This excess of the observed over the calculated conduc
tivities shows one or more of the assumptions implied in the
 mode of calculation to be erroneous.      It would seem to be
 probable that the error is at any rate largely due to the
assumption that the molecular conductivity of an electrolyte
at infinite dilution is the same whether it exists in a simple
solution or in a mixture, and that the discrepancy is thus due
to the effect of mixing on the velocities of the ions. The
mode of calculation assumes that in the mixture the con
stituents are not really mixed, but lie side by side so that the
ions of each electrolyte in their passage from electrode to
electrode travel through the solution to which they belong
only. They must rather be regarded, however, as passing in
rapid alternation, now through a region occupied by one
solution and now through a region occupied by the other.
The actual mean velocities of the ions in the mixture will
therefore probably differ from their values in a solution of

           the Conductivity of Mictures of Electrolytes.      287
their own electrolyte only. In the case of dilute solutions
the difference will be small, in sufficiently dilute solutions
inappreciable; but in the case of the stronger solutions it
may account in large part for the discrepancy observed above.
We have, however, so far as I am aware, no data for calcu
lating the effect of mixture on the ionic velocities, or the
extent to which the discrepancy is due to this effect.
    To obtain some rough conception of its magnitude, I have
calculated the conductivity of the mixture No. 18 on two
assumptions, which seemed more or less probable, -viz. (1)
that the velocities of the ions of each electrolyte in the mix
ture were the same as they would be in a simple solution of
their own electrolyte of a concentration (in gramme-molecules
per litre) equal to the mean concentration of the mixture;
and (2) that the velocities of the ions of each electrolyte,
when passing through a region occupied by the other electro
lyte, were the same as they would be in a simple solution of
the former of a dilution equal to that of the latter. The
expression used for the conductivity was

electrolytes 1 and 2 respectively in simple solutions of the
dilutions which they have in the mixture, while u1 and us'
are the values these ionic velocities would have according to
the particular assumption employed, the velocities in all cases
being those corresponding to the same potential gradient.
As the graphical process above gave the dilution of each elec
trolyte in the mixture, the values of u and w' were readily
determined by the aid of Kohlrausch's table of ionic velo
cities*. I found that according to assumption (1) the con
ductivity would be greater than Bender's reduced value by
 1.6 per cent., and that according to assumption (2) it would
be greater by 1.3 per cent. Similar calculations could not be
 carried out in the case of solutions stronger than No. 18
 owing to lack of data. Such calculations are of course of
 little value; but they strengthen the suspicion that the excess
 of the observed values of the conductivity of mixtures over
 the calculated values is due to the impossibility of taking into
account the effect of mixing on the velocities of the ions.

           A. Thermal Expansion of Compressed Air.
§ 1.  AIM of the Work–It was an important advance in the
            theory of gaseous matter, when the experimental
investigations of Despretz, Pouillet, Rudberg, Regnault, and
several others demonstrated the approximate character of
the fundamental laws of Boyle and Charles. Instead of a
common and single law of compressibility and thermal
expansion for different gases, there arose the necessity for
determining specific corrections of these laws for every one
of them.
    But as soon as the range of temperatures and pressures
had been enlarged, new analogies between the physical pro
perties of these bodies became once more evident. First of
all, the theory of the critical state may be mentioned here,
supported by the discoveries of Andrews, Cailletet, Wrób
lewski, Olszewski, and many others. On the other hand,
these analogies found their expression in the laws of compres
sibility, thanks to the investigations of Natterer, Cailletet,
Amagat, and Wróblewski.
   At the present time the theory of gases seems to be entering
a third phase of its development, initiated by Van der Waals,
and supported by Wróblewski, L. Natanson, Ramsay, Young,
and many other investigators. There are many facts which
seem to show that possibly there may be found, not merely
an analogy, but even an identity of properties of different
gases, provided that for every one of them special specific
units of measure (of temperature, pressure, and density) be
employed: all matter seems to be built on the same plan;
but the scale is different for various bodies.
    It is difficult to judge nowadays whether this grand law
is an exact truth, or only an approximation: whether it is
really universal, or confined only to certain classes of bodies.
To confirm or disprove it, numerous and very exact experi
mental data are greatly needed.
   Investigations of the compressibility and thermal expansion
in very extended limits prove to be the best means of com
paring the thermodynamic properties of gases: in every case

they give fuller and more exact information than observations
of critical points, or other singular states. Amongst recent
work in this direction the very important investigations of
Amagat, extending to very high pressures, must be placed
in the first rank. They contain exceedingly valuable data,
relating to the compressibility and expansion of gases at
ordinary temperatures and at higher ones. Amagat’s results
give a very clear and extensive idea of the behaviour of
several gases, chiefly of those the critical point of which is
not far from ordinary temperatures.                       •
   Until quite recently the so-called permanent gases had not
been investigated at very low temperatures. So far as I
know the important paper by Wróblewski, “On the Com
pressibility of Hydrogen,” published after the author’s death
in the Sitzungsberichte of the Vienna Academy, is the only
one relating to this range of temperatures. This want of
information as regards the compressibility and expansion of
permanent gases in the vicinity of the critical state has
induced me to undertake the experimental investigation of
which the present forms an account. The properties of
atmospheric air are described here, at temperatures ranging
from + 100° to -145° Cent, and for pressures from 1 to 130
atmospheres.
   § 2. Outline of Method.—In order to determine the com
pressibility at different temperatures, and through it also
the expansion of gases, two experimental arrangements were
chiefly used : in one of them the quantity of gas remains
constant, in the other its volume. We might call them the
manometric and the volumetric method.          In the first of
these methods (Andrews, Amagat, &c.) a long calibrated
capillary glass tube, enlarged at the open end into a bulb of
Known volume, is employed. A certain quantity of gas is
shut up in the tube by mercury. By means of a compressing
arrangement the volume of the gas may be varied at will.
The experiment consists in determining the volume and
temperature of the gas and the amount of the applied pressure.
   The method of constant volume was invented, so far as I
know, by Natterer. A vessel of known volume was filled
with gas under a known pressure. The experiment con
sisted in measuring the quantity of gas contained in the
vessel at a certain temperature. This was done in the so
called pneumatic trough, under atmospheric pressure. This
method has been used also by Wróblewski in his experiments
on the compressibility of hydrogen at low temperatures (the
first method being useless here on account of the freezing
of the mercury).

290                  A. W. Witkowski on the
   The determination of the compressibility of a gas at a set
of temperatures, together with its thermal expansion under a
single pressure (say the atmospheric), gives at once the ex
pansion under any of the pressures employed. And vice versa,
if the compressibility at one chosen temperature be known,
it is sufficient to determine the thermal expansion of the gas
under different pressures, in order to obtain directly the
compressibility at any of the temperatures employed.
    The first of these two ways was followed by Wróblewski
in his above-mentioned work on hydrogen. In the present
investigation I have used experimental appliances modelled
on those of Wróblewski, and my theoretical aim was a
 similar one; but I preferred to apply the second way of
experimenting, viz., the thermal expansion, instead of the
 compressibility, has been considered as the principal subject
of the experiments.
    The following considerations have induced me to make
 this change.       irst, the difficulty of measuring pressures
exactly. Since absolute manometers, suitable for laboratory
use and sufficiently trustworthy, are still to be invented, we
are compelled to use gas-manometers, founded on the com
pressibility of gases (air or nitrogen). The pressure calculated
 according to the indications of an instrument of this kind,
as well as the law of compressibility of the gas under investi
 gation, depend, in this case, directly on the assumed law of
compressibility of the gas used in the manometer. Suppose
we take this law as known, say through the experiments of
Amagat, then our results will be inextricably mingled with
these results. . The method to be described presently, de
pending on determinations of expansion under constant
pressure, on the other hand, furnishes values of expansion
entirely independent of any accepted law of compressibility:
a dependence of this kind remains only in the values of the
pressures applied.                      .
    Another reason which induced me to depart from Wrób
lewski’s combination of the gas-manometer with the constant
volume method of Natterer, was the wish to invent a method
 of constant sensibility as regards pressure- meaurements,
 and the determinations of expansion and compressibility
as well. The gas-manometer is an instrument of variable
sensibility; the higher the pressure measured, the less is the
exactness of measurement. On the other hand, the volu
 metric method is one of constant sensibility; i.e. like incre
ments of pressure yield approximately equal increments
 of the quantity of gas.
    Instead of combining two methods of such opposite cha

               Thermodynamic Properties of Air.                  291
racter, I preferred to measure both pressures and expansions
by the volumetric method. By this device, as 1 hope, the
exactness and homogeneity of the results were materially in
creased.
   § 3. The Coefficient.—In order to determine the thermal
expansion of air at constant pressure (1 to 130 atmospheres),
I have applied the following arrangement:—Two vessels of
known capacity are filled simultaneously with gas, under any
desired pressure, by connecting them with a reservoir con
taining a sufficient quantity of condensed gas. One of these
vessels is cooled or heated to any temperature 6; the other is
kept at the constant temperature of melting ice. Let p atmo
spheres be the common pressure in both vessels; sl and so
their capacities, at the respective temperatures 6° and 0°, under
the common pressure p.
   The quantities M1 and M2 of gas contained in the vessels
are then brought under atmospheric pressure and temperature:
having measured their volumes, we calculate M1 and Mg in
the usual way. As unit quantity of gas I take here, and in
the following pages, the mass contained in unit volume (cub.
 mm.) at 0° Centigr. under the pressure of one atmosphere.
   The densities of the two masses, when compressed in the
vessels s1 and so, are unequal; the colder one is also the
denser. Let their densities be p1 and p2, then we have
                           _M1.

of the apparatus I have used to obtain the values of the co
efficient a will be found in fig. 1.
                              Fig. 1.
    The vessels denoted above by si and s, are two thick-walled
glass bulbs, melted on to capillary stems ai and as, the diameter
of bore of which is less than 4 mm. On each of the capillary
tubes a mark m is drawn at a distance of 3–4 cm. from the
bulb, to limit the capacity s. The capacities of bulbs and
stems were measured repeatedly, before and during the
 experiments, by mercury weighings. The capacities s1 and
 s, were nearly 2000 c.mm. (in some experiments at the lowest
temperatures, only 1000 c.mm.); the capacities of the capillary
stems (a 1 and oz) were not more than 8 to 10 c.m.).
    The upper end of each stem (a, and as) is connected with
a sort of distributing apparatus, provided with two screw
valves, of which one is used to fill the bulb with gas, the other
                                                                  .

be measured. This arrangement is quite similar in plan to .
that used by Wróblewski in his already-mentioned investi
gations on hydrogen. As regards details, I have adopted,
after several unsuccessful trials, the following construction,
which proved quite trustworthy and convenient —
   A brass cylinder, A (fig. 2), is bored along its axis from
         -                   Fig. 2.
                                     £N
both ends; in its centre the borings are connected by a very
short and narrow channel rs, communicating with another
vertical channel, t, of very small capacity. The channel t is
connected with the stem a in the following manner:—On the
upper end of a there is cemented, by means of fine sealing
wax, a thick-walled brass tube B, provided near its lower end
with a collar. The end of the glass stem, cut perpendicularly
to its length, protrudes some I'', of a millimetre from the flat
end of B. The glass bulb s, with its stem and brass tube B,
form a separate piece, which is to be connected tightly with
the  £        A. This is done by means of the external screw
M, in a way sufficiently indicated by the figure. To ensure

294           -      A. W. Witkowski on the
perfect tightness a circular perforated plate of lead, dd, care
fully cleaned, is placed between the flat end of B and the
bottom of the corresponding boring in A. Through the pres
sure of the screw the hole in the lead plate gets reduced to a
very small size, and at the same time a perfect pressure-tight
connexion is ensured. It is necessary, however, that the
metallic surfaces in contact be quite clean and bright.
   To shut up the compressed gas in the bulb two steel screw
valves, K, are employed (one is shown in the figure). The
consist of a cylindrical spindle, carefully turned and £,
provided with a conical end; near the outer end a screw
thread is cut, working in the screw-head G. By means of
the same screw-heads G a number of leather rings, cleaned
with ether and impregnated with beeswax and paraffin-oil,
are compressed in the stuffing-boxes around the cylindrical
polished parts of the spindles. This mode of tightening proved
perfectly capable of withstanding the highest pressures em
ployed, although the tightening of the screw-valves is far
less important than that of the channel r s t, which is effected
solely by contact with metallic surfaces.            -
   On both sides of the channel r s there are two metallic out
lets, C and D, soldered to A. Through C (fig. 2) the bulb si,
and similarly so, is charged with compressed gas; to do this
simultaneously in both bulbs, stout copper tubes of small
bore, soldered in C and C, are connected by means of a metallic
T-tube with the reservoir Z (fig. 1) containing compressed
air. In the connecting-piece another screw-valve P is in
serted, through which the interior of the bulbs may be made
to communicate with the atmosphere. The valves N1 and N2,
facing C and C, will be called here for brevity the “charging
valves.”
   Through the second pair of outlets D and D (fig. 2) the
charges of air, compressed in the bulbs s, are delivered for the
purpose of measurement; this is done by unscrewing the
“discharging valves” R1 and R2 (fig. 1).
   The measurement of gas-quantity has been effected in
special glass flasks E1 and E2 (fig. 1), which may be called
eudiometers. For the sake of distinctness of drawing, E, and
E2 are represented in the figure on opposite sides of the appa
ratus; in reality they were placed near one another.
   The discharging-tubes D and D were connected with the
eudiometers by means of capillary copper tubes ai, as (fig. 1),
ending on the eudiometer side in perforated steel stoppers;
these were cemented in the upper ends of the eudiometers by
means of sealing-wax.
   Each eudiometer consists of a vertical glass tube, some

               Thermodynamic Properties of Air.             295
80 cm. in length, on which five bulbs of nearly equal capacity
have been blown; the connecting-pieces are provided with
divisions in millimetres. The eudiometers are surrounded by
wide cylindrical jackets of clear glass filled with water. Two
thermometers, 61 and 62, immersed in the water give the
temperature of the gas; air-streams blown in through p’
and p" serve to equalize the temperature of the water.
    The eudiometers are connected by means of thick-walled
indiarubber tubing with open mercury-manometers M1 and
M2, fixed to two sliding pieces on a vertical wooden support
 (rot shown in the figure).
    The calibration of the eudiometers was effected after they
were put in their place and surrounded with water. To do
this by mercury-weighing, the glass stop-cocks near the lower
ends of the eudiometers were provided. Positions of the
mercury meniscus were read by means of a cathetometer, placed
in a position where it was to remain during the rest of the
experiments. In this manner both eudiometers were cali
brated twice. From the results of calibration I prepared a
table giving capacities in cubic millimetres (at the standard
temperature of +17° C.) corresponding to every scale
 division. Each of the five glass bulbs had a capacity of nearly
 40 c.cm., the whole eudiometer about 210 c.cm. One milli
 metre on the glass necks corresponded to 60 c.mm. capacity.
 Therefore the smallest volume which could be appreciated was
 about 3 c.mm.
    After calibration of the eudiometers, I made another set of
 measurements in order to determine the capillary depres
 sions &c. These corrections (of small importance) have been
 determined for every scale-division in an obvious manner.
     § 5. Preparation of Gas.—To complete the description of
 the apparatus, a few words remain to be said about the reser
 voir of compressed air and the mode of compressing and
  purifying the gas. One of the well-known carbonic-acid
 bottles of 11 litres capacity, resisting 250 atmospheres, is
 used as air-store.    The usual screw-valve is replaced by
 a simple stopper of brass with a copper tube soldered in it,
 connecting the reservoir Z with two drying-tubes S', S'.
 These are made of steel, and are filled with finely grained
 chloride of calcium and potassium hydroxide, stoppered by
  thick layers of cotton-wool. A considerable quantity of
  these substances is also contained in the reservoir Z in a
  vertical tube of wire-gauze. The air submitted to experi
  ment is compelled to pass the drying-tubes twice—during
  the charging of the reservoir, and again on its way to the
  apparatus. Besides that, it remains a long time in contact
  with the drying-substance in the reservoir itself.
     To condense the gas, a Natterer condensing-pump has been

296                  A. W. Witkowski on the
employed. The usual oiled leather piston is replaced by
one packed with fibrous asbestos, and lubricated by a very
small quantity of water (a device used also by Wróblewski).
Although this arrangement renders the working of the pump
exceedingly tedious, nevertheless I found it absolutely neces
sary, as the oiled piston yielded a very impure gas.
   The air was taken from the outside of the laboratory; it
passed through several washing-bottles filled with solutions of
potassium hydroxide and sulphuric acid. After condensation,
it was dried in the manner described above.         The air treated
in this way was submitted repeatedly to chemical tests, and
proved to be sufficiently pure and dry.
   $6. Determination of s1 and sz-Before commencing the
experiments, it was necessary to determine very exactly the
capacities of the bulbs s1 and ss. This was done by mercury
weighings at the temperatures 0° and +100°. The true
capacity during experiment depends on the temperature of
the bulb and on the pressure employed.
   To calculate the capacity at low temperatures, I used the
coefficient of expansion of glass, determined in the interval
0° to +100°, and corrected it in accordance with the expe
riments of I. Zakrzewski on the expansion of solids at low
temperatures*.
   The influence of pressure on the capacity of the bulbs has
been determined directly by submitting them to known pres
sures while filled with well-boiled mercury. From the observed
variations of position of the meniscus in the calibrated stem,
it is easy to calculate the variations of capacity with the aid
of Tait's and of Amagat’s determinations of the compressibility
of mercury. In the limits of pressure used this dependence
was a linear one. Denoting the corresponding coefficient by
w, we may write
                          sp=s(1+ap).
For a pair of bulbs of very unequal capacity (1:2), I have
found v=0.0000062 and v=0.0000064 (per atmosphere).
These values refer to ordinary temperatures. As there is
nothing known about the variations of elasticity of glass at
very low temperatures, I have always used the above value
of w; I consider the error resulting from this proceeding as
altogether insignificant, the more so as the correction itself,
depending on pressure, is very small.
   § 7. Mode of Euperimenting.—I will now describe the
mode of experimenting and calculation of the results.
            * Transac. Cracow Acad, vol. xx, (math, class).

               Thermodynamic Properties of Air.              297
  The apparatus having been filled repeatedly with pure and
dry air, I bring the movable manometric tubes Mi and M, to
such levels as to fill both eudiometers E, and E, with mercury;
the meniscs are then brought as near as possible to the zero
marks of the eudiometer-divisions. (The stopcocks P, Ni,
N2, R1, R2 are opened for this purpose.) The small volumes
in the eudiometer-tubes left between the meniscs of mercury
and the zero marks will be denoted here by wi and w.
   As soon as equality of pressure in the interior of the appa
ratus and in the atmosphere (=b) has been established, I close
the discharging-valves R1 and R2, as well as P, and charge
the apparatus with compressed air at that particular pressure
for which the expansion is to be measured. During the
charging both bulbs 81 and so remain in connexion with the
large store of air contained in the reservoirs Z, S', S'. This
connexion ensures great constancy of pressure in case there
should be a small leakage of air somewhere.
   During the charging of the bulbs I determine their tempera
tures (t and 6), as well as the temperature (=t) of the sur
rounding air. Next, I shut the charging-valves N1 and N,
both at the same instant, and immediately after that I open
the discharging-valves R1, R2, . The interval of time during
which the charge remains imprisoned in the bulbs is less than
one second.
   The air flows now from the bulbs into the eudiometers.
During this I lower the manometric tubes M1 and M2, so as
to reduce the gas (which fills now several bulbs in each eudio
meter) as nearly as possible to atmospheric pressure. The
temperatures of the water-baths surrounding the eudiometers
having been equalized by air-currents blown in through p’
and p", I proceed to determine, with the aid of the telescope
of the cathetometer,
   (1) The temperatures S1 and S9 of the gas in both eudio
meters;
   (2) The volumes u1 and us of air in both eudiometers,
reckoned from the zero marks;
   (3) The differences of level of mercury in the eudiometers
E and in the corresponding manometric tubes M1 and M3.
   Taking into account the corrections mentioned in § 4, as
well as the barometric pressure, it is easy to find the pressures
of air in the eudiometers E, and in the bulbs s, which are
now in communication with E. I shall denote these pressures
by B1 and B2.
  During these determinations the temperatures of the bulbs
are again measured (=t' and 6').
  In this manner every single determination of the coefficient

298                   A. W. Witkowski on the
a has been conducted.      It takes some time, from 10 to 20
minutes, to perform the necessary measurements.          At the
lowest temperatures this time was considerably longer, because
in this case it is necessary to provide a sufficient quantity of
the freezing substance (solid carbonic acid, liquid ethylene);
to regulate the speed of the pneumatic pumps and of the gas
motor by which they were driven, in order to obtain the
required temperature; to compare the electric thermometer
for low temperatures with the hydrogen thermometer, &c.
Under such conditions it happened that during a day I was
not able to make more than one or two determinations—to
say nothing of the frequent occurrences, when, after several
days of laborious preparations, the intended experiment has
been entirely lost, through some mischance or other. I think
it necessary to mention these difficulties of experimenting in
order to explain the comparatively small number of results
obtained at the very lowest temperatures.
    § 8. Calculation of Results.—By means of the experimental
data gathered in the manner described above, the results have
been calculated as follows:—
   The bulbs being charged, and the charging-valves closed,
we have the following quantities of gas in the apparatus:
    1. In the bulb of capacity s (index 1 or 2 omitted, since
the same formula applies to both) there is the quantity M
 (§ 3) under the pressure of p atmospheres, at 6 and t (re
spectively) degrees.
    In the stem or, and the narrow channels rst connected with
it, there is confined a quantity m; under the same pressure p,
but at the temperature t of the circumambient air. I shall
use the letter a to denote the small capacity of this space.
    Adding together we find in the apparatus the quantity
                            M +m =A
under the pressure p.
    2. In the copper tubes ai and a2 (fig. 1)—I shall use the
same letters to denote their capacities—and also in the eudio
meters themselves (in the spaces denoted above [$7] by
wi, wa), we have air under the barometric pressure b.
    I shall use for brevity the symbol w(S, b) to stand for the
expression                      -
                             QU     b
                           1+ys 750’
9 being the coefficient of expansion of air of ordinary density
at ordinary temperatures (=0.00367, very nearly a constant).

               Thermodynamic Properties of Air.                299
Then the above quantities are
                          a(t, b) + w(S, b)
expressed in normal volume-units.
   This same quantity of air which occupied after charging
the spaces s, a, a, and w, fills after discharge a space increased
by that capacity in the eudiometer (u is now the volume
occupied in it) in which the mercury has been replaced by
air, plus a small capacity (K=42 c.mm.) laid open by un
screwing the valve R (the valves were always opened by the
same number of turns of the spindle). The whole quantity
of air supports now the common pressure B. Consequently
we have a new expression for the whole quantity of air,
namely:
        s(6', B)+a (T, B) + K(t, B)+a(T, B) + w(S, B).
   Equating we find the formula :
           A=M+ m = u(S, B)—w(S, b)+ a(T, B-b)
                    +s(6', B)+ [K+ a |(T, B) . . . .           (3)
   $9. Corrections.—We have now to calculate the small
amount m which is to be subtracted from A.            Consider the
bulb No. 2, charged at temperature t = + 16°C. Suppose
the temperature of the corresponding space a were also
exactly +16°, then obviously we could write
Taking into consideration the small difference of temperature
between bulb (+16°) and stem (T2) we write instead
                      7m2
                          =Asi:                        . .  .   (4)
Simultaneously in the space a1, corresponding to bulb No. 1,
we have the following quantity of air :
                       m1 = A2
                                1+yt a
                                1+ yt s2 + q2'
because in every case

300                 A. W. Witkowski on the
In this manner we find, finally,
                  M1=A1-mi ; M2=A2-m2 ;
these values substituted in (1) or (2) lead directly to the
coefficient ar,9.
   § 10. Corrections continued.—The first of the small capa
cities denoted above by a and a I determined by a simple
volumetric method, with the aid of the calibrated eudiometer
E and manometer M. It is superfluous to enter into par
ticulars. I will mention only that the value of a has no
influence on the final result, provided we have exactly B=b;
in general any small error in a influences the result quite
insignificantly.
   The second of these capacities, viz. a, is composed of two
parts: the capacity of the glass stem, and of the narrow
channels rst, together with the very small hole in the tighten
ing lead plate. The capacity of the glass stem, reckoned
from the mark m, is obtained directly by weighing of mercury.
In order to find the rest (3 or 4 c. mm.) of the space a,
I stopped the connexion between the glass stem and the
rest of the space a by interposing another (not perforated)
lead plate and charged the channels several times with com
pressed air, at 50 or 60 atmospheres. The quantity of the
collected gas having been measured with the aid of the
eudiometer, it is easy to calculate the capacity of the channels,
by applying Boyle's law, or better Amagat's results, for the
compressibility of air at ordinary temperatures.
   § 11. Determination of Pressures.—The just mentioned
results of Amagat" render also possible the determination of
pressures. The pressures p, as already mentioned, I measured
by applying the “constant volume” method, with variable
quantity of gas. This I will now explain.
   If a given quantity of air be compressed more and more,
by application of increasing pressure, then, as is well known,
the product of volume and corresponding pressure—far from
being constant, as it would be according to Boyle's law
diminishes at first, until a certain pressure is reached, and
increases afterwards indefinitely (so far as known at present).
   Let us denote by vo the volume occupied under the pres
sure of one atmosphere (=p0), then we may express the law
of compressibility of air by the formula
                          Apv= e povo,
e denoting a coefficient variable with the pressure p. The

                Thermodynamic Properties of Air.             301
  values of e at ordinary temperature (+16°) have been de
  termined with great care by Amagat with the aid of a huge
  mercury-manometer.
     Consider now a closed vessel, capacity s, charged with
  compressed air, under a pressure p, at t degrees. Since a
  unit volume of air, exerting the pressure of one atmosphere
  (at + 16°), gets reduced to  v=: when submitted to p atmo
  spheres (by the last formula), then we infer that the air-mass
  compressed in the closed vessel when liberated and submitted
  to unit-pressure would occupy the volume ps, or, in the
                                                 e

                          M=#).
 It will be seen now that the apparatus described in the fore
 going paragraphs may be used also as a manometer, recording
 pressures to be calculated by the formula:
                         p=.M(lf"),
                                  S
 provided that t equals that temperature for which the values
 of e were determined, or at any rate that the difference be
 not too great. For this reason one of the bulbs of my appa
 ratus was always immersed in a water-bath at + 16°, together
 with a stirrer and a mercury-thermometer divided in #5 of a
 degree. Since the temperature T of the space a differed but
 slightly from +16°, we may write with sufficient accuracy:
                        - A(1+7)
                             s+ a '    '  '  '  '  '  '   '
                                                             (5)
    The method chiefly employed till now for measurements of
high pressures consists in the use of manometers charged
with a constant quantity of gas. I thought it interesting to
compare this method with the constant-volume method used
by myself. For this purpose I connected my apparatus with
a gas-manometer, charged at first with dry air, afterwards
with pure dry nitrogen. From a large number of comparisons
at various pressures, there resulted a slight but systematic
difference of results: the values of pressures, as determined
by my method, were constantly less, by several tenths per

302                    A. W. Witkowski on the
cent, than the values recorded by the gas-manometer; this
applies as well to the air- as to the nitrogen-manometer. The
sign of the difference led me to suspect a leakage of gas in
some part of my apparatus. Therefore it was indispensable
 to submit the apparatus to a severe test, the more so as any
 leakage in it would vitiate the results, as regards expansion,
 to an incalculable extent.
    To test the apparatus I charged it (both bulbs at +16°)
 with compressed air, under a sufficiently high pressure, the
 value of which was determined simultaneously with the aid of
 the gas-manometer. The bulbs were then immediately dis
 charged into the eudiometers. Next I repeated this same
 experiment, using the same pressure (as indicated by the gas
 manometer), but instead of discharging the bulbs immediately
 I left them charged for a relatively long time (an hour or
 two). I was satisfied to find that the quantity of air collected
 after long imprisonment was not less than in the first case.
    As an instance of this sort of testing, the following numbers
 may be given:—
      First experiment.—Nitrogen-manometer=89:06 atm.
        The bulbs discharged immediately after charging.

    It will be remarked that the pressure indicated by the gas
 manometer exceeds in both cases that calculated by (5) by }
 per cent, nearly. At the same time it is apparent that there
 was no sensible leakage, since in the long-charge experiment
 the difference of pressure is even less than in the first. I am
 not able to give a sufficient explanation of the observed
 difference, but considering that the constant-volume method
 employed in the present work deals with larger quantities of
   as, and enables us to measure them with greater accuracy,
 # am inclined to think that the results obtained with my
 apparatus are at least not less trustworthy than those recorded
 by an ordinary gas-manometer.

   § 12. Determination of Temperatures.—All temperatures
referred to in this paper are reduced to the scale of the con
stant-volume hydrogen-thermometer. In all experiments at
temperatures below zero there was placed in contact with the
cooled bulb s, in the same freezing-mixture, the bulb of a
hydrogen-thermometer. Yet the temperatures of the bulb
during the experiments on expansion were not read directly
on the hydrogen-thermometer—because of the waste of time
unavoidable in such readings, and because of the slowness
of indications, which renders the hydrogen-thermometer un
suitable to follow rapid variations of temperature. For this
purpose I constructed a small working thermometer based on
the variations of electric resistance of a fine platinum wire.
A description of this instrument will be found in the appendix
to the present paper. Here it will be sufficient to say that its
sensibility was about #5 degr. Centigr. and its quickness very
considerable.
   This electric thermometer has been compared very often
with the hydrogen-thermometer, and a table has been drawn
interpreting its indications in terms of the hydrogen-scale.
Nevertheless I never used the electric thermometer otherwise
than under control of the hydrogen-thermometer, because
slight secular changes of its resistance manifested themselves.
Comparisons of the working and the hydrogen-thermometer
were made in the intervals between two consecutive experi
ments on expansion.
   During the experiments themselves an assistant read the
electric thermometer a first time simultaneously with the
charging of the bulbs, a second time immediately after dis
charging them (it will be understood that the freezing-mixtures
used to obtain very low temperatures do not keep their tem
perature quite steady); the mean of these two readings has
been accepted as the temperature (6) of the bulb. Finally,
the temperature of the bulb was determined a third time (6')
during the measurement of the gas-quantity in the eudio
meters; this temperature has been used to calculate the exact
value of the gas-quantity remaining in the bulb.
   § 13. The Low Temperatures.—In the manner explained
above I executed some hundred and twenty determinations of
the coefficient of expansion ap, o, using different pressures up
to 130 atmospheres. One of the bulbs of the apparatus being
kept at + 16°, the other was heated or cooled to the following
temperatures — + 100° (steam), 0° (ice), -35° (a freezing
mixture of pounded ice and crystallized chloride of calcium),
 –78° 5 (solid carbonic acid and ether), -103°5 (liquid
ethylene, boiling under atmospheric pressure), -130°, -135°,

 brass plate, is covered with another brass plate PP, the dia
 meter of which is somewhat larger than the diameter of the
 upper flat edge of the glass vessel. By means of three brass
 pillars, fastened to the lower plate, and screw-heads pressing

               Thermodynamic Properties of Air.             305
 on the upper one, the cover can be made air-tight. Near the
 centre of the upper brass cover there are four circular open
ings. A fifth opening, with a short brass tube soldered in it,
is placed near the circumference; it is connected by means of
a lead tube with the pneumatic pumps.
    The just mentioned four openings are intended to introduce
into the apparatus (1) the bulb s, which is to be cooled :
 (2) the bulb T of the hydrogen-thermometer; (3) the electric
thermometer T". The stems of these three pieces are held by
 indiarubber stoppers cut into two halves and tightened by a
beeswax cement. Through the fourth opening enters in like
manner the delivering tube of the well-known apparatus of
Wróblewski and Olszewski for liquefying ethylene.
    The cold liquid ethylene flows down into the thin-walled
tall glass beaker C, surrounded by a wide glass tube B.
This tube rests on three elastic pieces of indiarubber which
press its upper edge firmly against the brass plate P. This
double walling is intended to cool the surroundings of the
beaker C by cold ethylene vapour, which is forced to circu
late as indicated by the arrows, until finally it is drawn out
by the pumps.
    Liquid ethylene is very liable to get superheated and to
evaporate in an explosive manner, especially when boiling
under diminished pressure. This property is a great incon
venience when it is to be used to obtain constant tempera
tures. After trying different contrivances to avoid it (air
currents, Gernez’s air-bubbles, &c.), I contented myself with
the use of a large flask D inserted just before the pumps, in
order to diminish the fluctuations of pressure accompanying
the strokes of pistons.
   With the aid of this arrangement, it is possible to vary the
boiling temperature of ethylene through a range of some
forty degrees. Any desired temperature may be obtained by
varying the number of air-pumps (I had three large Bianchi
at my disposal), by inserting Babinet's stopcocks, or by vary
ing the speed of the gas-motor driving the pumps. With
some practice it is possible to limit the range of fluctuations
of temperature in one series of experiments to no more than
2 or 3 degrees.
    § 14. Construction of Isothermal Curves.—The temperature
6 of the bulb s in different experiments belonging to one
series was not exactly the same. To obtain strictly isothermal
values of the coefficient a, the following graphical method of
interpolation was used. All series of experiments having
been completed I constructed, on a large scale, a diagram
similar to that represented on Pl. I, using uncorrected values

306                   A. W. Witkowski on the
of a. By means of graphical interpolation isothermals were
then drawn, differing but little from the final ones given on
Pl. I.     With the aid of these isothermals I constructed
another large diagram on which the values of a were col
lected on lines of equal pressure; i. e. temperatures were
drawn on the axis of abscissae, the values of a belonging to
like pressures formed the ordinates.
   The inclination of these lines to the axis of abscissae could
now be used to find the correction which was to be added to
the coefficient ap—33 say, in order to obtain the value of
ap-35, belonging to another isothermal, but to the same
pressure p (-35° in this example being the mean value of
temperatures in the chloride-of-calcium series). This I did
by drawing through the point a, , (experimental value) a
short piece of the corresponding isopiestic line, to its inter
section with the ordinate -35°, or any other desired tempe
 rature. In most cases these lines were nearly straight;
instead of drawing them I found it convenient to use a glass
plate on which a straight line had been drawn with a diamond
point. In some cases, however, the corrections were con
siderably larger, so that it was no longer possible to disregard
the curvature of these lines; they were then drawn with
reference to the inclination and curvature of the neighbouring
isopiestic lines.
    § 15. Results.—The whole of the results obtained are repre
 sented in a graphical form on Pl. I. The isothermal lines
for the nine temperatures experimented on have been drawn
 by hand along the dots, representing experimental results".
Although some of these dots fall off rather considerably from
their respective mean curves, yet, considering the whole of
the diagram, I suppose the final results may be considered
accurate, at least to four decimals. It is scarcely possible
at present to aim at a greater accuracy: this will be admitted
on considering the discrepant values of the coefficient of ex
pansion of air given by different experimenters in the relatively
 simple case of atmospheric pressure and temperature of
boiling water.
    From the diagram Pl. I., drawn on a large scale, I took
 the mean values of the coefficient ar, reproduced in the
 following table:—

      This table, or, better still, the diagram on Pl. I, shows very
  clearly the kind of variation of the coefficient of expansion in
  its dependence on pressure and temperature. For increasing
  pressures the coefficient increases, at every temperature, to a
  maximum, and decreases subsequently. The higher the
  temperature, the less pronounced is this maximum.
      The pressure corresponding to the maximum of expansion
  diminishes with the temperature. From this it follows, that
  the rate of increase of expansion is the higher, the less the
  temperature. In the vicinity of the critical state (temp. =
   -141°, pressure 39 atm. nearly) the rate of increase of ex
  £            is extremely great, the corresponding isothermal runs
     ere nearly vertically. The same holds good for temperatures
  below the critical, at points where liquefaction occurs, for
  instance at –145° and 30 atm.
      The isothermal lines of the coefficient of expansion form a
   fan-shaped bundle converging nearly to one point, namely,
   to the value 0.00367 at 1 atm. of pressure. If this were

308                  A. W. Witkowski on the
strictly true, the expansion of air, subject to a constant pres
sure of 1 atm., would be independent of temperature. Now
this is known to be approximately the case; but on the other
hand it is certain that the isothermals cannot converge strictly
to this point, since the pressure at one atmosphere has nothing
in common with the internal constitution of air.          From some
experiments it would appear that the isothermals do not
intersect at all low pressures; they come very near one
another, descending to a minimum at certain low pressures,
and probably return afterwards in a steep course towards
higher values.
            B. Compressibility at Low Temperatures.
    § 16. Definitions.—It is now a simple matter to calculate
 the compressibility of atmospheric air at any one of the nine
temperatures investigated above; the compressibility at +16°
 being assumed as known through the work of Amagat (§ 11).
    Let vo denote the normal volume (at 0° and 1 atm.) of a
 certain quantity of air. When heated or cooled to any
 temperature 6, and submitted to a pressure of p atmospheres,
 the air assumes a volume v. Admitting Boyle's and Charles's
law, we should write
                 "-#(1+%), or pv=vo(1+y6).
 Now, in reality, the product p" is not independent of the
 pressure p, and its dependence on 6 is not a linear one.
 Instead of the above, we must write:
                            pv= m . to, .     .    .  . .   . .  (6)
 m(p6) denoting a certain function of p and 6, the values of
 which are to be calculated.
 . This we may do as follows:—Consider a volume to of air
 in the normal state. Heat it, at constant pressure (= 1 atm.)
 to +16°; the volume increases to
                           vo(1 + y . 16).
 At this temperature submit it to a pressure of p atmospheres,
 then according to the notation of § 11 we obtain the volume

                                  p
 finally heat it at the constant pressure p to 6 degrees.
  Denoting by 2,1, and a, the coefficients of expansion corre.
 sponding to the pressure p and to the ranges 0–16 and
 0–6, we get

   These numbers are represented in a graphical form on
Pl. II. by means of so-called curves of compressibility
(abscissae=pressures, ordinates=isothermal values of m=pw;
the axis of abscissae through the point 0:1). It may be well
to remark that, on assuming Boyle's law to hold for all
pressures and temperatures, these curves would be straight
lines parallel to the axis of abscissae.
   Every one of these curves shows a minimum of the pro
duct pu for a certain value of p (depending on the tempera
ture of the corresponding isothermal). This expresses the
fact, verified for many gases at higher temperatures, that with
increasing pressure the compressibility exceeds at first that
given by Boyle's law until a maximum is reached, afterwards
it diminishes indefinitely. In the vicinity of the critical point
the curves of compressibility run downwards very steeply; at
points where liquefaction occurs their course is vertical.
   § 18. Comparison with other Gases.—The general proper
ties of atmospheric air as regards expansion and compressi
bility are quite analogous-apart from the large difference of
critical temperatures—with those of other gases which have
been investigated hitherto in this respect. It is interesting to
inquire £ this resemblance of properties is merely a
qualitative one, or whether it is more deeply rooted; in :
words, is it possible to calculate beforehand the properties of a
 gas, assuming the properties of another to be known P—this is
the thesis of van der Waals. Wróblewski, in his memoir on
the Compressibility of Hydrogen, asserts the possibility of such
predictions. Take for any one gas the critical pressure for
the unit of pressure; for the unit of temperature its critical
temperature (absolute): then Wróblewski's theorem asserts
that the dependence between the temperature and that value
of the pressure for which the product pv is a minimum, is the
same for all gases. A more general theorem is due to
L. Natanson, namely, that all gases have a common character
istic equation, i. e., a common relation (not necessarily that of
van der Waals) between pressure, temperature, and volume,
provided that these elements be measured by means of units
specially adapted to the nature of every gas; the critical
elements form one of the infinitely numerous groups of such
units.
   The critical elements of air are given by Olszewski as
follows:-crit. pressure=39 atm. ; crit. temperature = –140°
Cent. These data are also confirmed by my own experiments;
I should only consider-141° as a nearer approximation to
the true value of the critical temperature. A comparison of
atmospheric air with other gases may be best effected on the

               Thermodynamic Properties of Air.                     311
basis of Wróblewski’s theorem.           With the aid of the table of
compressibility given in the preceding paragraph, we calculate
the following values of the pressures for which the product
pv is a minimum :

     Draw a curve taking the T's and Tr's for abscissae and
  ordinates, then according to Wróblewski this should be one
  curve for all gases. Now it will be found that the curve
  plotted in accordance with the above numbers runs really very
  near that drawn by Wróblewski", and based chiefly on experi
  ments on carbon dioxide and methane.             It is difficult to tell
  if the remaining differences are real or else depend merely
  on experimental errors. At all events it may be taken for
  granted that these coincidences, as they stand now, are most
  remarkable.
     I have limited my experiments to the gaseous states of air,
   but at the same time I tried to approach to the limits of lique
   faction as near as possible. It is a very difficult matter to
   experiment near those limits; very constant temperatures are
   of great importance. It happened frequently that, in con
   sequence of a slight variation of temperature, the glass bulb
   of my apparatus was found full of liquid air, instead of com.
   pressed gas. For the present time I abstained from an ex

was necessary to obtain the results given in the present paper.

         Electric Thermometer for Low Temperatures*.
   Variation of the electric resistance of wires depending on
variation of temperature has been often
employed to construct thermometric appa
ratus. Fig. 4 shows (nearly true size) a
disposition of electric thermometer which
the author has found very useful in low
temperature work, on account of its sensi
bility and quickness. A short cylinder r
of thin sheet-copper is soldered at one end
of a narrow brass tube c through which
passes a rather thick silk-covered copper
wire d cemented with a mixture of resin
and india-rubber. The outer end of the
brass tube ought to be carefully covered
with this mastic in order to prevent con
densation of moisture on the thermometric.
wire. The copper wire and the brass tube
are furnished with binding-screws a, b to
introduce the current.        On the outer side               #
of the cylinder r there are wound 2 or 3
metres of a very fine silk-covered platinum                     c
wire (diameter about T'o millim.); one of
its ends is soldered to the cylinder r, the
other to the end of the copper wire d.
To protect the coiled wire, another sheet
copper cylinder r' of somewhat greater
diameter is pushed over it. Both cylinders
r and r" are joined by a small quantity of
solder applied round the circumference of
their bases.

   In this manner a platinum resistance is obtained of some
220 ohms at 0°. It forms one branch T (fig. 5) of a Wheat
stone bridge. A second branch is formed by a resistance of
                             Fig. 5.

german-silver wire contained in a case K of exactly the same
construction as shown on fig. 4, but on a larger scale; it is
kept at the constant temperature 0” by melting ice. The
third and fourth branches of the Wheatstone bridge are resist
ance-coils in one and the same box R, namely, a coil of
 1000 ohms and a variable resistance R.     B is a battery of
two elements of Leclanché, M a commutator, G a sensitive
galvanoscope.
   To every temperature of T there corresponds a determinate
resistance R in the box. By comparison with a normal
hydrogen-thermometer, it is possible to construct a diagram,
or a table, with the aid of which one may find by inspection
the temperature T corresponding to any ' resistance R.
Such a table does not cease to be true when the apparatus,
after having been dismounted, is to be used again several
days or months later; the relation of T and R is of course
independent of the electromotive force of the battery or the
sensitiveness of the galvanoscope.
   A table of this kind is given below; at the same time it
shows the relation of resistance and temperature (hydrogen
scale) for a certain platinum wire.

   The variation of resistance is about 2 ohms per degree;
therefore it is easy to obtain a sensibility of £5" Cent.
   Experience has shown that the relation between resistance
and temperature undergoes slight changes when the thermo
meter is employed at widely different temperatures. For
this reason it is better to avoid heating a thermometer destined
for low temperatures; this might cause a variation of resist
ance which would not disappear until after several months.
                    Note added by the Author.
  It has been found since that fine iron wire answers the
purposes of low-temperature thermometry still better than
platinum. Both constancy and sensitiveness are greater.

XXXIV. An Analytical Study of the Alternating Current Arc.
    By J. A. FLEMING, M.A., D.Sc., F.R.S., Professor of
    Electrical Engineering in University College, London, and
    J. E. PETAVEL*.
 An'                 the physical phenomena of the Electric
         Arc have received of late years very considerable
 attention, there are many points in connexion with the study
 of the alternating current arc which seem to us to have
 been insufficiently explored. The investigation which is here
 described is a contribution to the further examination of the
 mode in which the variation of the luminous and electric
 effects takes place in the alternating current arc.
     The first portion of the research is concerned with an
 analytical study of the variation of the light thrown out from
  different radiating regions in the arc, and the delineation of the
  periodic value of this illuminating power by graphical methods.
  The object of the first set of experiments was to record and
  represent by an appropriate graphical method the periodic
  value of the light thrown out from the carbons and from the
  true electric arc region when the arc is supplied with electric
  power of known constant amount and varying magnitude,
  and at the same time to record the periodic variation of
  current through the arc, and potential-difference of the
  carbons. The instrumental appliances involved in the first
  place the employment of means for keeping constant and

316       Prof. J. A. Fleming and Mr. J. E. Petavel:
measuring the mean value of the power supplied to the arc.
This was accomplished by the use of a suitable non-inductive
resistance and a bifilar reflecting wattmeter, the series coil
of which was in the circuit of the arc, and the shunt coil
of which was connected across the carbons of the arc.       The
following is a description of this wattmeter:—
   The series coil was wound with 10 turns of thick copper
wire (No. 10 S.W.G.) and had a resistance of .01 ohm. The
shunt coil was wound with 23 turns of thin wire, and had a
resistance of 3.76 ohms, and was placed in series with a
non-inductive platinoid resistance of 1200 ohms. The shunt
coil was suspended by two fine silver wires, which also served
to conduct the current in and out of the coil.          The con
trolling and deflecting forces so balanced each other at small
displacements as to make the angular displacement of the
movable coil very nearly proportional to the power passing
through the wattmeter. T' movable coil was provided with
a mirror by means of which the image of a wire illuminated
by an auxiliary arc lamp was reflected on to a fixed scale.
This scale was carefully graduated, so as to read directly in
watts. It was found that the earth’s magnetic field caused a
small deflexion of the movable coil when using continuous
currents and when the shunt current was passing through it,
when at the same time no current was flowing in the series
coil. This terrestrial field was neutralized by magnets, or
else the scale was shifted so that the part of the deflexion of
the shunt coil due to the terrestrial field was eliminated. The
best way would have been to have turned the wattmeter
round through a certain angle, but as it had to be screwed
up against the wall in a fixed position for steadiness, it was
found that the above method was the simplest plan for obviating
this source of error.   The vibrations of the movable coil were
damped by means of a mica vane dipping into a dash-pot
filled with oil. When all the adjustments were made, it was
found that this wattmeter produced a deflexion of the spot of
light on the scale almost exactly proportional to the power
passing through the instrument. This wattmeter was then
connected up to the arc lamp, so that the whole current
actuating the arc lamp passed through the series coil, the
terminals of the shunt coil being connected to the carbons
of the arc.                                                   -
   A series of preliminary experiments were then made for
the purpose of enabling us io eliminate from the wattmeter
readings, firstly, the power taken up in the wattmeter itself;
secondly, the power taken up in the shunt coil of the arc
lamp and other shunt resistances; and, thirdly, the power

taken up in the carbons themselves, right up to the point
where the arc is being formed. The observations, when
reduced by applying these corrections, gave us at once the
true mean power being taken up in the arc. The wattmeter
was constructed with all the precautions necessary in making
a wattmeter for measuring alternating-current power, so that
it served to measure the power taken up either in alternating
or continuous current arcs. The current supplied to the
arc passed through a series of non-inductive resistances, con
sisting of carbon plates, in such a manner that the power
given to the arc could be regulated with the greatest exact
ness. In addition to the wattmeter, an ammeter was placed
in series with the arc lamp so as to measure the current
passing through the arc, and a voltmeter connected to the
carbons so as to measure the potential-difference of the
carbons, these instruments being suitable both for continuous
and alternating currents. In all the experiments the mean
power was kept constant in the arc, and this was done by
adjusting the current so that the wattmeter took a certain
deflexion corresponding to the power desired, and the watt
meter was kept at a constant deflexion by regulating the
carbon resistances in series with the arc.   In addition to the
instruments described above, a lens was fixed so as to enable
the length of the arc to be measured in the usual manner.
   In the course of the experiments three arc lamps were
employed—a hand-regulated arc lamp in which the distance
of the carbons was adjustable by a screw with great accuracy;
a continuous-current arc lamp (the Waterhouse Arc Lamp);
and an alternating-current arc lamp (the Helios Arc Lamp);
 these last two being selected as excellent arc lamps of their
 respective types, our object being to select an arc lamp, the
 mechanism of which enabled it to be worked with electric
 powers varying over wide limits, and yet to yield a perfectly
 steady arc. In addition to these instruments there was set
 up the apparatus for delineating the curves of current of
 electromotive force, which have been described by one of us
 in the ‘Electrician, vol. xxxiv. p. 460, and which consists of
a synchronizing alternating-current motor, having its fields
separately excited and its armature circuit traversed by a
 shunt current from the circuit operating the arc lamp. This
alternating-current motor was set up on the photometer bench,
and it was used to drive an aluminium disk pierced by four
openings, in such a manner that the disk revolved synchro
 nously with the alternating current operating the arc. In
addition to this duty the alternating-current motor carried a

contact-maker on its shaft for the purpose of enabling the
curves of current of electromotive force to be delineated.    A
brief description of the motor is as follows :
    It consists of two sets of field magnets M, M (see fig. 1),
having eight poles on each side which are secured to two
cast-iron disks. Between these field magnets revolves a small
armature A, the iron core of which is formed of a very thin
strip of transformer iron wound up into a ring, the armature
coils being wound on this ring. The armature coils are joined
up in series with one another, so as to give a series of
 alternating magnetic poles round the ring when a current
 flows through the armature circuit. The diameter of this
 armature is about six inches. The field magnets have eight
 poles, and the armature eight coils. The field magnetic coils
 are bobbins about 2 inches long and 1% inch in diameter, and
 when joined up in series in the proper manner the field
 magnets take a current of about eight amperes to give them
 a proper amount of saturation. The armature is carried
 upon a hard wooden boss fixed to a steel shaft; and the steel
 shaft is carried through small ball bearings made like bicycle
 bearings. In order to prevent any side shake of the armature,
 there are at opposite ends of the base cast-iron pillars with a
 gun-metal screw through each, against which the rounded
 end of the shaft bears; the position of the shaft can thus be
 adjusted with great nicety, and runs with great freedom from
 friction. The ends of the armature circuit are brought to
 two small insulated collars fixed on the shaft, against which
 press two light brass brushes marked B, B kept against the
 shaft by means of an expanding steel wire W. The armature
 shaft carries on one side an ebonite disk with a steel slip let
 into it. Two insulated springs S, S are carried on a rocking
 arm H; this rocking arm can be traversed through half a
 circumference, and is centred upon the gun-metal screw
 which prevents side shake in the shaft, and a pointer and
  graduated scale enables the exact position of the contact
  springs to be determined. One of the stop-screws keeping
  the shaft from side shake is pierced with a longitudinal hole,
  and through this hole passes a stiff steel wire; this serves to
  drive an aluminium disk 27 centims. in diameter and 4 milli
  metres thick. This disk is carried on a shaft which runs in
  a cast-iron bearing, and the disk is therefore driven syn
  chronously by the motor. This aluminium disk has four slits
  in it separated by angular intervals of 90°; the slits are 0:5
  centimetre wide and 4.5 centimetres long. If the field
  magnets of the motor are excited by a continuous current of

       Analytical Study of the Alternating Current Arc. 319
about eight amperes, and if an alternating current of about
two amperes is passed through the arm ture of the motor,
then, on turning the motor rapidly round by hand, which can
best be done by passing a strap round the shaft and pulling
at the strap so as to spin the motor like a top, the motor will,

if sufficient speed be gathered, drop into step with the alter
nating current driving it. Since the motor has eight mag
netic poles, it makes one complete revolution in four complete
periodic times, so that if the motor is being driven from an
alternating-current circuit having a frequency of 100, then
 the motor has to run at 1500 revolutions per minute before
 it will drop into step, but at that speed it will fall into step
 with the current passing through its armature, and will be
 driven as a synchronous motor. Under these circumstances,
 if a ray of light is passed transversely to the disk in such a
 manner as to pass through the slits of the aluminium disk
 during the progress of rotation of the disk, the beam of light
 will be interrupted, but will obtain passage four times during
 each revolution through the slits in the disk as it goes round.
     If the motor is being driven by the same alternating
  current circuit which supplies the alternating current to an arc
  lamp, it is evident that, on looking through the slits in the
  revolving disk at the alternating current arc, it will be seen in
  one constant condition during its periodic variation, such
  instant being determined by the position of the slits with
  reference to the phase of ". current. Without entering
  into a longer description, it will be evident that this synchro
  nizing motor driving a disk and a contact-breaker enabled
  two things to be done—first, to delineate all the current and
  electromotive-force curves of the arc taken in the usual way;
  and, secondly, a ray to be taken from the arc selected at one
  particular instant during the complete period through which
  the variation of illumination passes. These arrangements
  were completed by the construction of a photometer of a
   particular kind.   Öw:     to the slow variation of position of
   the electric discharge in the alternating current arc, it would
   have been useless to photometer the instantaneous value of
   the light coming from the alternating current arc against any
   fixed standard of light; but it was found possible to make a
   very exact comparison between the intensity of the light
   coming from any part of the arc, and selected at any one
   constant instant during the complete phase, with the mean
   value of the light coming from that same part of the arc
   during the complete period; in other words, it was found
   possible to photometer the arc against itself, and so eliminate
   to a large extent the difficulties arising from slow periodic
   variations of the light sent out from the arc in any one
   direction. It is well known that the light of an alternating
   current arc, taken in any one direction, undergoes a slow
    periodic variation quite independently of the variation of

current during the phase, neither is it dependent upon any
variation of the mean square value of the current, because it
 takes place even when that current is perfectly constant. It
appears to be due to slow changes of position of the points on
the carbons between which the discharge takes place. The
discharge is as it were seeking out new points between which
to take place, and it continually changes these positions as the
arc burns. The photometric arrangements finally adopted
were as follows, and are shown in outline in fig. 2:—

round a horizontal line co-linear with the axis of the revolving
disk, and the motor placed in front of the lens Li. The ray
was then reflected upwards into another mirror M2, and by
this mirror reflected at an angle very nearly equal to 45° in
such a manner as to pass through the slits in the revolving
disk D, when any one of the slits was in a position to allow
the ray to pass. The two mirrors M1 and M2 were rigidly
connected to a rocking-arm so centered that the line M1 M2
could be rotated round into any required position, always
moving parallel to a radial line of the disk D. The disk D
was the disk carried on the shaft of the synchronizing motor
above described; the motor, together with its associated disk,
was placed on the photometer bench in the required position
opposite to the arc-light lantern. In fig. 2 the motor itself
is not shown, but its position is indicated by the letter C.
The angular position which the rocking-arm carrying the two
mirrors M, and M3 occupied with respect to the vertical line
passing through the centre of the revolving disk could be

322      Prof. J. A. Fleming and Mr. J. E. Petavel:
observed on a graduated scale. It will be clear, then, that if
the disk driven by the motor was in synchronism with the
alternating current producing the alternating arc at A, an
observer, looking through holes in the rapidly revolving disk,
would see by reflexion in the mirrors Mi and M, the alterna
ting current arc at A ; but he would see it, not as it is seen
when looked at directly, but in some constant condition taken
at one definite instant during the phase, which instant would
depend upon the position of the line M1M3 with regard to the
vertical line through the centre of the disk. Thus by rocking
over the arm M1 M2 in various positions the observer could
see, through the window W as the disk revolved, the arc at
A, either in the condition when the electric discharge is
taking place, or when the true arc is extinguished, according
to the position in which the arm M1M3 was set. If, instead
of observing with the eye, a disk of paper with a photometric
grease spot upon it was placed at P, the lens L could be so ad
justed as to throw an enlarged and well-defined image of the
arc upon the disk at P; and by rocking over the arm carrying
the mirror into successive positions, the observer would see
the image of the arc pass slowly through all those successive
phases which in the arc itself actually take place during one
periodic time. As the image of the arc is much larger than
the photometer disk, it was possible, by slightly shifting one
of the mirrors, to bring any desired part of the image of the
true arc or of the craters of either of the carbons to cover the
grease spot. In addition to this interrupted ray, another ray
was gathered from the same part of the arc by a lens L,
placed on the same level with the lens L, but slightly to one
side of it. This lens gathered a beam which was reflected by
a mirror M3 placed at an angle of 45°, and which reflected
the ray upwards to another mirror M. In fig. 2, for the
sake of clearness the lens L2 is shown beneath the lens Li,
but it must be understood that in the real apparatus the
lenses Li and L2 were on the same level and placed side by
side. The ray reflected from the mirrors M3 and M, was set
horizontally, so as to be received on a lens L3, and by this lens
L3 was gathered to a focus at a point I. The lens L2 was so
adjusted as to form a large image of the arc on the screen
which carried the lens Ls, and by slightly moving the mirror
M4 any part of this image could be made to cover the lens L3.
It will be seen, therefore, that the light gathered together at
a focus at the point I could be made to be light coming
from any assigned area in the arc or from the craters.         A
movable stand carried two other mirrors M, and Ms fixed at

        Analytical Study of the Alternating Current Arc.      323
angles of 45° in such a way as to reflect the ray coming from
focus at 1, and reverse its direction so as to bring it round
and make it fall on the left-hand side of the photometer-disk P.
It will thus be seen that, by moving the mirrors M, and Mg,
the light falling on the left-hand side of the photometer-disk
P could be made to have any desired intensity within certain
limits, and could be gathered from any desired part of the
arc or craters; and, moreover, this illumination was the mean
illumination, or proportional to the mean illuminative power
of any part of the arc selected for examination.     It will thus
be clear that the arrangement enabled us to project on to the
right-hand side of the photometer disk P the rapidly inter
mittent ray taken from any part of the arc, and always
gathered at one constant phase condition during the complete
period; whilst on the left-hand side of the photometer disk
we could project a ray gathered from the same part of the arc,
but not interrupted. We could therefore compare the mean
value of the light proceeding from any part of the arc with
the instantaneous value of the light taken from the same part
of the arc and selected at any assigned instant during the
period. Thus the arc itself became its own standard, and
difficulties due to slow fluctuation of the mean light of the arc
disappeared. At the same time the contact-maker on the
motor enabled us to delineate in the usual manner the curves
of current and potential-difference of the arc, and thus to
record the variation in the arc of the arc current, the carbon
potential-difference, the power expended in the arc, the
resistance of the arc, and the luminous intensity of any part
of the arc. A long series of experiments was then made
with alternating current arcs of different lengths and powers,
the periodic electric quantities being delineated and the light
being taken, either from the centre of the true arc halfway
between the carbons or from one of the craters of the carbon
terminals,—generally the bottom carbon. The process of
taking measurements was as follows:-                              -
   After setting the lenses and the mirrors so that the lens Li
and the mirrors M1 and M2 gave a sharp image of the arc on
the right-hand side of the photometer disk with the selected
area of the image covering the grease spot, the mirrors M5
and Ms were moved backwards and forwards until the balance
was obtained between the illumination falling on the right
and on the left-hand side of the photometer disk. The right
hand side of the photometer disk being illuminated by an
 intermittent stream of light always selected in the same phase,
when considered as belonging to a periodically varying illu

324       Prof. J. A. Fleming and Mr. J. E. Petavel:
minating beam, whilst the light falling on the left-hand side
of the photometer disk is a uniformly illuminating beam of
the same quality and colour coming from the same part of the
arc but not interrupted, and representing therefore the mean
value of the light emitted from that selected area of the arc.
Observers were deputed to measure all the various quan
tities by the different instruments, and a power of constant
definite amount was supplied to the electric arc from an
alternating-current machine driven by a continuous-current
motor. By means of the carbon resistance and the reflecting
 wattmeter this power was kept constant at a selected value
 for a sufficient time to enable all the various periodic quan
 tities to be observed at sufficiently frequent intervals during
 the phase. In all cases the arc was allowed to burn quietly
 for half an hour to get the carbons into a constant position
 before any observations were taken. It is hardly necessary
to go into the details of delineating the current and electro
motive-force curves, as the process of doing this is now well
 understood. The Kelvin vertical multicellular voltmeter,
 having a half microfarad condenser placed across its ter
 minals, was employed for the measurement of the potential
 difference of the carbons in the following manner:—
    The voltmeter, with its associated condenser, was connected,
 through the contact-maker driven by the shaft of the alter
 nating motor, to the carbons of the arc; the contact-maker
 thus closed the circuit at a certain instant during the phase,
 and the voltmeter gave the instantaneous value of the potential
 difference of the carbons. In series with the arc was placed
 a non-inductive resistance of suitable magnitude. A switch
 was arranged so that the voltmeter with the condenser in
 parallel with it, both being in series with the revolving
 contact-maker, could be put across either the terminals of
 this non-inductive resistance, or else between the carbons of
 the arc. By rocking over the arm carrying the spring
 brushes of the contact-breaker, the voltmeter circuit was
 closed at a particular instant during the phase, and the volt
 meter reading gave therefore, when corrected, the instanta
 neous value either of the potential-difference of the carbons
 or the instantaneous value of the current through the arc.
 As the Kelvin multicellular voltmeter used by us only begins
 to read at 60 volts, in order to get readings for lower values
 than 60 volts, it is necessary to add a known electromotive
 force to the voltmeter circuit in order to block up the needle
 of the voltmeter to a false zero. This was done by connecting
 a known number of small Lithanode secondary batteries, the

       Analytical Study of the Alternating Current Arc. 325
potential of which was determined by the same voltmeter, in
series with the voltmeter. In this way the series of obser
vations were successively taken of the following quantities:–
First, the instantaneous value of the potential difference of
the carbons taken at equidistant intervals throughout a com
plete period; secondly, the instantaneous values of the
current through the arc taken throughout the complete
period; and, thirdly, the instantaneous values of the luminous
intensity of a certain selected portion of the arc taken at
intervals throughout the complete period and expressed in
terms of the true mean luminous intensity of the same portion
of the arc at that time. These quantities having been obtained,
it was then possible to plot them down in a series of curves,
and to deduce therefrom curves representing the periodic
variation of power through the arc, and the periodic variation
of the resistance of the arc. Five sets of experiments were
made, taken for different frequencies and different lengths
of arc, each set comprising an observation taken with the
light proceeding from the centre of the true arc, and also
an observation taken with the light proceeding from the
centre of the crater of the lower carbon. The frequencies
employed were 83, 50, and 26. In all cases the current
was kept at 14 amperes (mean square value); the results
of these observations are embodied in the following 10 tables
arranged in 5 pairs. Table I.A, for instance, gives the
results of the observations taken with an arc having a fre
quency of 83°3, the light being taken from the centre of
the true arc. Table I. B gives similar results of observations
for the same arc, the light being taken from the centre of the
lower crater. By holding a magnet at the back of the arc,
noticing which way the instantaneous image of the true
arc was projected by the magnet, and noting the pole of the
magnet presented to the arc, it was possible to determine
when the lower carbon was positive and when it was negative;
and the diagrams corresponding to the above 10 tables are:
marked so as to show the half of the wave when the lower
carbon is positive and when it is negative, in all those
diagrams which refer to the light coming from the crater.
 The results of the observations given in the 10 tables are
 delineated graphically in diagram in figs, 3 to 12; and on
 referring to these diagrams a periodic line will be seen in
 each, delineating the variation of the potential difference
 of the carbons, and another periodic line indicating the varia
 tion of the current through the arc, whilst a third line indicates
 the periodic variation of the luminous intensity of the selected

 326      Prof. J. A. Fleming and Mr. J. E. Petavel:
 portion of the arc.   In the diagrams figs. 13 to 17 are given
 curves representing the periodic variation of the light from
 the crater in the various cases, and extending over several
periods. It will be noticed that those diagrams represent
ing the periodic variation of the light from the arc show
that this light undergoes a regular fluctuation between a
maximum and a minimum, the maxima having equal values.
The light in the centre of the true arc never falls quite to
zero. This seems to be due to a little luminosity which
hangs in the interspace between the carbons, but at the
present moment it is difficult to say whether this persistence
is due to a very small admixture of stray light (although
every effort was made to keep this out), or to a persistence
of the illuminating-power of #. incandescent vapour in which
the arc has been formed. On examining the true arc during
its complete periodic variation, it is found that the blue
or purple strip of light forming the true arc undergoes a
periodic variation in intensity. As far as the eye can judge,
the blue or purple light completely vanishes at a certain
instant during the phase; but there is, outside the true arc, a
dim halo of golden light which is persistent; and it is therefore
probably on account of this persistent aureole of faint light
round the true arc that the ordinates of the curve representing
the periodic variation of the luminous intensity of the arc
never become zero, but always indicate the outstanding
constant amount of light. On the other hand, in the diagrams
which represent the periodic variation of light coming from
the centre of the crater of the lower carbon, we find the
luminous intensity of the crater varies between a minimum
value and two maximum values of different magnitude.
During the time when the crater is positive it reaches a higher
maximum intensity of illuminating power than during the time
when it is negative, and, moreover, the curve representing
the periodic variation of light rises more steeply than it
comes down, which indicates a slow cooling of the carbons
after they have been heated; in other words, they heat more
quickly than they cool. This is particularly noticeable in that
part of curve corresponding to the crater being negative; and it
 is only what would be expected, because after the carbon has
 reached its negative maximum and is beginning to cool, the
opposite carbon is cooling from a condition in which it has
been positive, and as it has been heated to a higher tempera
ture than the negative carbon, it must assist by its radiation
 in keeping up the temperature and retard the cooling of the
 negative carbon, These diagrams will also show many other

       Analytical Study of the Alternating Current Arc.       327
interesting facts : they show, for instance, that in the case
of the long arc the self-induction of the arc is more marked
than when the short arc is employed, and in that case there
is a very distinct lag of current behind the potential
difference.
   It may also be noted in comparing the diagrams W. B and
IV. B in figs. 12 and 10, which represent the curves for arcs of
the same frequency but of lengths 1.2 centim. and 32 centim.
 respectively, that in the case of the long arc there is no lag of
 light behind power as far as regards the points of maximum
when the carbon is positive, but in the case of the short are
thère is a sensible lag. This might be expected to be the
case, because for a long are the influence of the opposite
carbon in keeping up the temperature of its neighbour as this
last is cooling is less felt than in the case of a short arc.
 Broadly speaking, the facts may be summed up as follows:–
The purple light of the true arc undergoes a periodic varia
tion, and, as far as the eye can judge, is completely extin
 guished during a certain interval during the phase; it has
equal maxima values during the period, at instants slightly
lagging behind the instants of maximum power-expenditure
in the arc. On the other hand, the illuminating-power of the
carbon crater varies between a minimum value and two maxima
of unequal values; the greatest maximum occurring when
the carbon is positive and at an instant slightly lagging behind
the instant of maximum power-expenditure in the arc. A
series of curves are also given (see figs. 18, 19, and 20)
in which the periodic variation of the current, potential
difference, power, and apparent resistance of the arc for
various powers and frequencies are represented; and it will
be seen from these curves that the resistance of the arc,
including in this any counter electromotive force which may
exist, varies periodically, the resistance being a minimum
when the current is a maximum, and vice versa.

    N.B.—Owing to an accidental shift of the brushes, in this table the angle
 corresponding to the instantaneous light is not the same as that corresponding
 to the current. The position of the curve of instantaneous light with regard
 to the E.M.F., current, and power curves cannot therefore in this case be
 determined.

        Analytical Study of the Alternating Current Arc. 349
    The second portion of the experimental work here recorded
consisted in an investigation of the efficiency of the alternating
current arc as a light-giving agent, when compared with the
continuous-current arc taking up the same mean power. The
question in all its generality, whether alternating-current arcs
are less efficient as light-giving agents for a given amount of
power expended in them than continuous-current arcs absorb
ing the same power, is not one which we have attempted to
settle, for the simple reason that a far more extended series of
experiments would be necessary before it would be possible to
say whether an alternating-current arc can or cannot be made
to give the same mean spherical candle-power as a continuous
current arc absorbing the same mean power. Limitations of
time compelled us to reduce our investigation to one definite
problem. Taking alternating-current arcs, formed with the
length, voltage, and the current and the carbons as described
below, and taking continuous-current arcs also with the length,
current, and voltage and carbons most usually employed in
practice, we have investigated the relative magnitude of the
mean spherical candle-power produced by these arcs for equal
expenditure of powers in the arcs varying from 200 to 600
watts. This, it will be observed, is an investigation which has
nothing whatever to do with the relative mechanical or elec
trical efficiency or excellence of the arc-lamp mechanisms, but
it is purely a physical measurement made of the two arcs them
selves under the conditions which are found to obtain in
practice. In order to settle this question, an alternating
current arc lamp was taken with good regulating qualities;
it was furnished with cored carbons 15 mm. in diameter, and
being placed under the conditions above described, in which
the power supplied to the arc could be regulated and mea
sured, a series of observations was made of the mean spherical
candle-power of the arc for different powers expended in the
arc and for two frequencies of 83.3 and 50-. A similar set
of experiments was made with the continuous-current arc,
 using in one case the same carbons—15 mm. carbons, both
cored—and in the other case the positive carbon 15 mm. cored
and a negative carbon 9 mm. solid, These sizes were chosen
because the 15 mm. cored and 9 mm. solid sizes are those that
are frequently employed in continuous-current arc lighting.
The arrangements for obtaining the mean spherical candle
power consisted of a mirror—the coefficient of reflexion of
which had been determined—which was employed to reflect
the light from the arc proceeding in different directions to the
horizon into the photometer, the ray always falling upon the
mirror at an incidence of 45. The standard of comparison

was an incandescent lamp, which was worked at rather a high
temperature in order to diminish the difficulty of making the
photometric comparison by diminishing as much as possible
the colour-difference in the lights compared. This incan
descent lamp was kept constantly standardized against another
standard incandescent lamp worked at a rather lower tempe
rature. The means of comparison was a Sugg’s Star Disk.
Photometer. It was found that by focussing the eye to a
point rather nearer the eye than the images of the Star Disk
as seen in the two mirrors, the difficulty of discriminating
between a small difference in the brightness of the two images
in spite of a small colour-difference was to a great extent dimi
nished. We abandoned as perfectly useless any comparison of
the two lights in terms of red and green candle-power. By
the employment of the reflecting wattmeter and carbon resist
ance as above described, it was perfectly possible to keep the
power expended in the arc constant to a certain number of
watts throughout long periods. In the case of the alternating
current arc lamp experiments, the alternating-current arc lamp
 was turned round its vertical axis so as to take a series of
 observations quickly in different directions, but at the same
angle to the horizon, and the mean of these observations was
taken as the effective illuminating-power in any angular
 direction; at the same time, the current through the arc and
 the potential-difference of the carbons were observed. These
 observations having been taken, involving many hundreds
 of photometric measurements, the results were set out in a
 series of photometric diagrams, as shown in figs. 21 to 24, which
 delineate the respective form of the photometric curves for the
 two arcs and for different wattages expended in the arc. These
 photometric diagrams were then integrated, and the mean
 spherical candle-power calculated in the usual way by means
 of a Rousseau's diagram, and finally the results embodied in
 one complete table and diagram, as given below (pp. 356, 357).
    The results in the Table are graphically embodied in the
 diagram in fig. 25, from which it will be seen that, taking the
 alternating-current arc as employed, the total mean spherical
 candle-power is always considerably less than that of a con
 tinuous-current arc, taking the same mean power. Lowering
 the frequency seems to increase the efficiency of the alter
 nating-current are, as one might naturally assume it would
 do, and it is obvious that increasing the diameter of the lower
 carbon of the continuous-current arc would diminish its total
 mean spherical candle-power at any given wattage. This
 table and diagram therefore, we think, settle the question
 that for a given expenditure of power in the arc a greater

               True Power in Watts Expended in the Arc.
amount of mean spherical illumination can be obtained, if that
power is supplied in a continuous current form than if it is
supplied in an alternating form. It has been suggested that,
with proper carbons and under proper conditions, the alter
nating and continuous-current arc should give the same mean
spherical candle-power for the same expenditure of power, as
has been shown to hold true in the case of the incandescent
lamp by the investigations of Profs. Ayrton and Perry. We
think, however, that no & priori reasoning can apply in the
case of the arc. It is perfectly clear that, owing to the
interval of cooling that elapses, the mean temperature of the
 two carbons in the case of the alternating-current arc must
be less than the temperature of the positive crater of the
 continuous-current arc, and that therefore the result we have
 obtained is only what might be expected. If the question is
 asked, how do we account for the difference in efficiency? the
 answer must be that the energy absorbed in the case of the
 alternating-current arc is radiated at a lower temperature,
 and the two arcs were therefore exactly in the same condition
 as regards comparison that two incandescent lamps would
 be, both taking the same total power but worked at different
 temperatures, and therefore different watts per candle, and
 therefore giving different mean spherical candle-powers with
 the same total power expended in them.
    It may be observed in all cases the alternating-current arcs
  we employed in our experiments took 16 to 17 amperes, and

 360 Prof. W. Ramsay and N. Eumorfopoulos on the
 the power was varied by varying the potential-difference of
 the carbons, and the alternating-current arc lamp used was
 one which effected this variation automatically, even although
 the power expended in the arc was varied from 200 to 600
 watts. In order to complete the comparison of the continuous
 and alternating-current arcs, it will be necessary to compare
 the behaviour as regards illuminating-power of alternating
current arcs, taking the same mean power but formed with
larger currents and less carbon potential-differences; that is
to say, comparing alternating arcs of equal power-absorption,
but taking very different currents and therefore having dif
ferent lengths. We hope to extend this investigation to
cover these additional questions at some future time.
   The above observations have necessitated an enormous
number of photometric and electrical measurements, and we
have in the above work been very efficiently aided by Messrs.

XXXV. On the Determination of High Temperatures with
   the Meldometer. By WILLIAM RAMSAY, Ph.D., F.R.S.,
   Professor of Chemistry, University College, London, and
   N. EUMORFoPoULos, B.Sc., Demonstrator of Physics, Uni
   versity College, London*.
Th:       meldometer, an instrument devised by Dr. Joly, has
       been sufficiently described by him (Proc. Roy. Irish
Acad. 3rd series, ii. p. 38, or Chem. News, vol. lxv.), and we
need therefore only give a very brief account of it here. The
essential part of the instrument is a length (about 10 centim.)
of thin uniform platinum ribbon, about 1 millim. wide. This
is heated by a current of adjustable strength, and the increase
in length of the ribbon is measured by a delicate micrometer
screw, the ribbon being kept gently stretched by a small
spring. The temperature of the ribbon is, of course, lower
where the two forceps hold it; but if it is suitably cut at
each end nearly to a point, a length of, say, 6 centim. in the
middle may be made of a very uniform temperature, as can be
proved experimentally by taking the reading of the melting
point of the same substance at different points along the
ribbon.
   An infinitesimal quantity (scarcely visible with the naked
eye) of the substance to be melted is placed on the ribbon and
viewed with a low-power microscope. The small quantity of

    Determination of Temperatures with the Meldometer. 361
the substance required enables it to be purified very com
pletely. The current is then put on and increased rapidly
until the substance melts, and thus an approximate reading is
obtained. This is repeated more cautiously, to obtain an exact
reading. Several readings can be taken by remelting the
same, and also by using fresh substance, the latter method
being usually adopted.                                             -
   To translate the readings into temperatures, it is necessary
to standardize the instrument by taking the readings with
substances of known melting-points. Of these, unfortunately,
there are none known with certainty beyond about 350° C.
One reading is obtained by taking the temperature of the air,
another is the melting-point of potassium nitrate (339°), and
for a third one the melting-point of potassium sulphate (1052°)
was adopted, for reasons that will appear. The melting-point
of silver is irregular, apparently because of absorption of
oxygen, and consequent spitting. Gold can be used, and
also palladium. As, however, the expansion of the ribbon is
almost a linear function of its temperature, and as the obser
 vations hitherto taken did not extend beyond about 1050°, it
was considered unnecessary to take readings with palladium,
the general character of the expansion of the ribbon being
 already known from Dr. Joly’s observations. The question
 next arises, what is the melting-point of gold * There have
 been two or three determinations of value, which unfortu
 nately differ from one another.
    M. Violle (C. R. 1879) determined it by a calorimetric
 method, and obtains as a result 1045° (on the air-thermo
meter).
    Messrs. Holborn and Wien (Wied. Ann. xlvii, and lvi.,
 1892 and 1895), who give 1072°, compared a thermo-element .
 with an air-thermometer, and then used the former for deter
 mining the melting-points of silver, gold, and copper. This
 was done by inserting in a porcelain crucible the thermo
 element, and also two platinum wires connected by a wire of
 the substance whose melting-point was to be taken. The
 platinum wires formed part of a circuit containing a battery
 and a galvanometer. When the wire melted, the circuit was
 broken, and the temperature read at the same moment with
 the thermo-element. The melting of the substance must in
 general lag a little behind the thermo-element; and as no
 mention is made of the rate at which the temperature was
 raised, it is difficult to know how far the results can be trusted.
 They obtain, however, very concordant readings.
    Besides these, there are two determinations with the plati
 num pyrometer: one by Professor Callendar (Phil. Mag. Feb.

 362 Prof. W. Ramsay and N. Eumorfopoulos on the
 1892), and the other by Messrs. Heycock and Neville (J. C. S.
 Trans. 1895, p. 160). By a somewhat violent extrapolation"
 from a formula which, as far as we know, has been compared
 with the air-thermometer only to about 625°, they obtain —
                                                               Heycock and
                                                  Callendar.       Neville.

    Callendar then, taking the melting-point of silver as 945°,
makes the melting-point of gold 1037°. Now Violle's deter
mination for silver is 954°, which, using Callendar's formula,
would give for gold 1049°. Holborn and Wien's value for
silver is 968°. # view of the variance between the numbers,
it was determined to take Violle's value, though the correct
value may be a few degrees higher (compare Le Chatelier,
 C. R. cxxi. p. 323, 1895).         In any case, allowance can easily
be made, when further researches have determined the true
melting-point.
   The gold used by us was a very pure specimen obtained
from Messrs. Johnson and Matthey. The salts used, with the
exception of some of the iodides, were pure specimens, pre
pared specially by ourselves. In a few cases the salts so
prepared were recrystallized, and melting-points were taken
both of the recrystallized salt and also that obtained from the
mother liquor. No difference could be detected, and hence
no further mention is made of these determinations.
    Gold on melting alloys with the platinum, and hence must
destroy to a certain extent the uniformity of the ribbon. A
   * In Holborn and Wien's last paper (loc. cit.) the resistance of pure
platinum is determined at different temperatures with their thermo
element, and their results cannot be expressed quite satisfactorily (“nur
ungenigend”) by means of Callendar's formula. The resistance of two
of their pure platinum wires began to differ beyond about 900°, while
agreeing below this temperature. They therefore consider this property
unsuited to extrapolation.
   t In a recent paper (J. C. S. Trans. 1895, p. 1025) Heycock and
Neville state that “Callendar did not rigidly follow the method of cali
bration, which was afterwards developed by Griffiths and himself, and
which we have always adhered to. That method requires that the
resistance of the pyrometer should be determined at three standard tem
peratures,” viz., at 0°, 100°, and the boiling-point of sulphur, 444°5.
And lower down they say, “If Callendar had standardized his thermo
meter on the boiling-point of sulphur. . . .;” hence they infer that Callen
dar did not use the boiling-point of sulphur for this determination. But
the determination of this boiling-point is given in Phil. Trans. 1891, i.e.,
it was published before the paper referred to, and the latter is also later
than another paper (Phil. Mag. July 1891, p. 109), in which the boiling
point of sulphur is directly referred to. We do not quite see how to
reconcile the various statements.

     Determination of Temperatures with the Meldometer.         363
remedy for this is to dust the ribbon lightly with finely
powdered talc. This, however, is not very satisfactory, and
interferes somewhat with the observations; but with care,
fairly good results can be obtained, as the following numbers
show:—                                     -

              Ba(NO”)* .      .  .   583           575
   It was then found that the melting-point of potassium
sulphate is very little different from that of gold, viz., 7
degrees higher or 1052°; and this salt was afterwards used
instead of the gold; thus there is no need to use talc.
   Some melting-points are sharply marked, others are not.
In these cases the lowest point was taken at which spreading
over the ribbon could be detected.
   For purposes of comparison determinations by other ob
servers are given; some determined the melting-points (e.g.,
Carnelley, and Meyer, Riddle and Lamb), others the freezing
points (Carnelley, Le Chatelier, Heycock and Neville, and
McCrae). The data are taken from the following references:
   Carnelley (calorimetric method): J. C. S. Trans. 1876,

       —ln this method the salt has been previously fused in a
       platinum tube with a wire down its centre, and to this
       wire is attached a weight passing over a pulley. When
       the salt melts, it is pulled out by the weight, and the
       temperature is determined at the same moment by an
       air-thermometer.                                          -
    J. McCrae (Wied. Ann. lv. p. 95), relying on Holborn and
       Wien's results, standardized his thermo-element with
       boiling diphenylamine (304°) and boiling sulphur
       (444°5). For his thermo-element he used platinum
       against an alloy of platinum rhodium, and also against
       an alloy of platinum and iridium. The numbers in
       brackets given below refer to the latter, and the others
       to the former. It will be noticed that they do not agree
       perfectly. This may, of course, be due to his metals not
       being of the same purity as those of Holborn and Wien.
       The latter also from their observations find that the iridium
       alloy is not as well suited as the rhodium alloy.

   The lithium carbonate bought as pure gave a conspicuous
sodium coloration to the Bunsen flame. It was purified
by successive precipitation and washing, until it gave a
brilliant carmine coloration to a Bunsen flame, free from
yellow fringe, showing an absence of sodium. The melting
points are not very well marked as a rule.

   It will be noticed that there is here no agreemént between
the results of different observers.             Our results are as a rule
about 100 degrees lower than Carnelley’s, except that of the
sulphate. Our resistances did not allow us to take the
melting-point of lithium iodide, as we had not arranged for
temperatures below 330°, but its melting-point is below that
of potassium nitrate (339°). Lithium iodide is very hygro
scopic, so that on placing it on the ribbon it quickly liquefies;
then on putting on the current, it becomes solid and then
liquid again at the temperature given above, i.e., it has
melted, and remains so indefinitely.
                                 Salts of Sodium.
   The salts of sodium and potassium were prepared from the
bicarbonate, precipitated by carbonic acid from a solution of
the pure carbonate. The melting-points are well marked,
though all are not equally so, e. g., the iodides.

   The agreement between Messrs. Heycock and Neville's
results and our own is only apparent, as they find 106.2° as
the melting-point of gold, while we assume 1045°. The fact
that they are determining freezing- and not melting-points
may introduce some difference.

    Calcium chloride is very difficult to observe, as it slowly
softens. We found it practically impossible to take the
melting-point of calcium iodide, as it is exceedingly hygro
scopic, and, on heating, it is almost immediately oxidized.
We do not think it can be above the value given, though it
may be below it.

XXXVII. A Method of Determining the Angle of Lag. By
   ARTHUR L. CLARK, S.B., Prof. of Mathematics and Physics,
   Bridgton Academy, North Bridgton, Maine, U.S.A."
Th: power or rate of expenditure of energy at any given
       instant of time, on an electrical circuit, may always be
found from the equation
                            W = EI;
where W is the power in watts, E the E.M.F. in volts, and
I the current in amperes. But if the average power is
desired this formula is not general. It suffices only where E
and I are constant or nearly so.
   It is a problem at the present time to measure the power
expended on circuits through which flow alternating currents
whose E and I vary harmonically with the time. In this
case the formula becomes
                           7–  EI       -
                            ==cos p;
where p is the difference in phase or is the angular magni
tude of the delay of the rise of I behind E. E. and I are the
maximum values of the E.M.F. and current respectively.
   It is obvious that cos p is a very much desired value, and
different methods for determining it have been conceived.
There have been several phase-indicators brought before the
scientific world during the past year or two, but of these
there are very few, if any, which furnish a convenient means
of accurately measuring a difference of phase.
   The instrument herein described is the outcome of ex
tended investigation carried on by the author during the past
year at the W' Polytechnic Institute. Many of the
different forms of apparatus which depend upon the inter
ference of sound waves, vibrating wires, &c., were constructed
and experimented upon, with unsatisfactory results.
   It was found that indicators which are influenced to a
marked degree by small variations of the vibration-period are
of little value. As this variation interferes seriously with
results, and as no dynamo furnishes a current absolutely
periodic, such an indicator is worthless commercially,
   The well-known Lissajous’s figures have been used at
different times as a means of determining the angle of lag,
and are the basis of the herein described apparatus. The
current from the dynamo passes through a single loop of wire
                 * Communicated by the Author.

370             Prof. A. L. Clark on a Method of
clamped at one end, and carrying a small mirror on the other
end, which is free to vibrate. This loop is suspended between
the poles of a magnet (electro or permanent), so that with
every change of direction of the current through this loop, it
will tend to rotate one way or the other according to Max
well's rule, i.e., “Every portion of the circuit is acted upon
by a force urging it in such a direction as to make it enclose
within its embrace the greatest possible number of lines of
force.”
   Now if a beam of light falls on the mirror, the reflexion
will be drawn out into a line by the vibration of the mirror.
This beam of light coming from this mirror falls on a second
mirror, arranged as the first but actuated by another current
and with its plane of vibration perpendicular to that of the
first.  In the resultant reflexion we find our means of mea
suring the amount by which one mirror leads the other, or, in
other words, by how much the phase of the current in the first
leads that in the second.
   We will call the direction of vibration of the beam of
light as given by each mirror alone the axes of X and Y
respectively. £ is, the axis of X is the figure from the
first mirror while the second is stationary, and the axis of Y
that from the second while the first is stationary.
   The equation of a simple harmonic motion of amplitude a
along the axis of X may be expressed
                              w=a sin 6,
where 6 is a linear function of the time.
   Also the equation of another harmonic motion of amplitude
b, along the axis of Y, whose time differs from 6 by an
amount b, is
                        y=b sin (6–4).

                 v=# (w cos b– A/a"—a "sin p),
an equation in w and y, independent of the periodic time.
This equation is the equation of an ellipse. The resultant
reflexion, then, is an ellipse whose shape depends upon a, b  5
and b.

                             3/=  a".
   Then since the short diameter is perpendicular to this, its
equation is
                            y=- i.e.
   Treating either of these equations as simultaneous with the
equation of the ellipse, the coordinates of the intersection of
these diameters with the curve may be found, from which
may be deduced the lengths of the diameters in terms of p.
This result is general but too cumbersome to be of service.
   Suppose a=b, a condition which may be easily attained by
increasing or decreasing the current in the vibrating loops,
or by varying the strength of the actuating magnets. The
equation of the ellipse would then be
                  y=w cos p – V1-a” sin p,
the equation of a family of ellipses whose parameter is b.
   The equation of the diameters is

   The reflexion is examined in a telescope with micrometer
eyepiece, having two separate scales so that the lines on these
scales may be made perpendicular to the long and short dia
meters of the ellipse. It makes no difference what the scale
divisions are, if they are alike on both scales.
   When the ellipse becomes a straight line, D,”=0 and
cos b=1, from which p=0, or the currents are in phase. If
the ellipse becomes a circle, D,”=D,” and the numerator be
comes 0, consequently cos (p=0, and b = 90°, or the currents
are in quadrature.
   The amount of self-induction in the apparatus itself is in
appreciable, and the loops keep well in time with the current.
Even a considerable variation in period does not hinder the
vibrations, which in this case are forced. This is possible since
the mirrors, while moving very slightly, still vibrate sufficiently
 for telescopic observation.                                  -
    Thus we have overcome the two great difficulties of many
 forms of this apparatus, namely, self-induction and the in
 ability of the vibrating wires to follow a change of period.
 And with these objectionable features eliminated and a method
 of finding the exact value of cos b, we have a practical means
 of determining the difference of phase.                    -

       of which the modulus is the product of the two constant sides.
       The simplicity of the corresponding graphical or mechanical
       tracing of the curve depends simply upon our choice of tri
       angles and choice of sides. In the method of construction
       which I most frequently employ, the two similar triangles
       have a common vertex at the origin o, fig. 1, and the two

                                      a? + b2
and at a distance from it equal to 4 " Then to the points

of the edge of the T-square or an auxiliary ruler, and the
lines cb, c'b', c'b" by means of the triangle or bevel-gauge.
Project the points of intersection e, e, e" of the first set of
lines with the line dq upon the second set of lines, giving us
the points s, s', s” on the required hyperbola. This method
is particularly rapid and convenient in plotting rectangular
hyperbolas on cross-section paper, the only instrument then
necessary being a rule to draw the radial lines oc, oc', &c.
    If desired, an instrument can easily be constructed on these
lines to trace the curve mechanically, but generally the
graphical process is more rapid. A whole series of contours
to the thermodynamic surface (pv=const.) can be drawn by
this process in a very few minutes, the same set of lines oc,
oc', oc", and cb, c'b', c'b", answering for all the curves.
   2nd method.—Make the vertices of the two similar triangles
coincide at c instead of o as before, and make ab=oc=w, and
cd=y (fig. 3). Take a point a on the axis of y at unit dis
tance from the origin and draw from it the lines ac, ac', ac"
to points on the axis of x, and the lines bc, b'c', b’c’’ parallel
to the2 y 2axis as before. Mark off a distance equal to
ji="#" on the edge of a triangle (or bevel-gauge), Q, of
which the angle at d is equal to the angle yov, and slide this
triangle along each of the lines bc, b’c’, b’c’, &c., until the
point f intersects the corresponding line ac, ac', or ac'. The
points d, d', d' will then evidently be points on the hyperbola.
In practice it is not necessary to draw the lines bc, b/c', &c.
at all, it suffices to place a T-square whose blade is parallel
to the axis of y, so that its edge passes through any of the
   * It is convenient to use for this purpose, an ordinary steel bevel
gauge the two blades of which may be adjusted to the required angle.

points on the axis of a ; slide the triangle along this edge
until the point f falls on the corresponding line from a, and
mark the position of the vertex d of the triangle (see fig. 4).
This method is perhaps even more rapid and convenient than
the first, as it involves the drawing of only one set of lines
ac, ac', &c. Like the first, it involves the use of only a triangle
and a T-square.
   3rd method.-Let the vertices of the two similar triangles
coincide at b (fig. 5). Then if bc= unity we have as before
                              a y=fb.
   To determine the points on the curve graphically in this
case, we need a triangle or bevel-gauge of an angle equal to
yox and a parallel ruler. The side bc of the triangle or bevel
                                                             a2+ b”
gauge should be of unit length and a distance fö= 4
laid off on the side bq. The triangle is placed with its side
bq coinciding with the axis of v, and one edge of the parallel
ruler is brought against the point c of the triangle and a pin
placed at the origin. The other blade of the parallel ruler is
then moved out until it passes through the point f on the

horizontal edge of the triangle, as in fig. 6. The point e at
which the blade of the ruler intersects the side bc of the
    \
 .#
triangle will be one of the points on the required curve, the
others of which may be found by sliding the triangle along
the axis of a, always keeping the two edges of the parallel
ruler in contact with the three points o, c, and f. This method
is somewhat simpler mechanically, but not quite so rapid and
convenient as either of the preceding.                         -
   It is evident that there are six other possible solutions to
be obtained by combining the sides ac, ae (fig. 1) with each
pair of adjacent sides. But these solutions are unsatisfactory
graphically, because simultaneous values of w and y will be
represented by lines inclined to each other at an angle dif
ferent from the angle between the axes. If the angle at a is
made equal to the angle between the axes, we have one of the
three solutions already considered.
   The use of two similar triangles in the graphical, and more
particularly the mechanical tracing of curves, is of wide ap
plication. By their aid we may always express the product
or quotient of two variable quantities geometrically as the
length (tensor) of one of the sides. Other applications of
this principle will be found in a recent paper of the author's
on the mountings of concave grating spectroscopes”.

   The Use of the Quadruplane as a Hyperbolagraph-The
two asymptotic coordinates of any hyperbola evidently form
two sides of a parallelogram of constant area. Hence any
hyperbola can be readily traced by the use of the Sylvester
Kempe quadruplane linkage, the four vertices of which lie at
the four angular points of a parallelogram of constant area
and constant obliquity*.
   The product of the adjacent sides of this parallelogram, or
as Sylvester calls it the “modulus” of the cell, is equal to
                             sin x, sin a
                                 " ' "2 = M y
                    B2 – A2 " Sin”6
where B and A are the distances between the pivotal points
of the long and short links of the cell, 21 and as the angles
adjacent to the line joining the pivotal points, and 6 the angle
subtended by this line at the intervening vertex. If we make
each link of the cell symmetrical we have
                         21=22=90–6/2,
and                      •        B”– A2
                        : M-1 #2.
The obliquity of the parallelogram is equal to 6.
   Hence to describe an hyperbola whose axes are a and b we
must make the modulus of the cell equal to the modulus of
the hyperbola, or
                            M _a^+b”    9
                              -     4
and the angle 6 equal to the angle between the asymptotes, or
                                     2ab
                          6=sin-1
                                   a2+b^*
    Then if one vertex of the cell is fixed and an adjoining
vertex is moved along a straight line (the edge of a T-square
or straight edge for example), passing through the fixed
vertex, the vertex diagonally opposite the latter will describe
the required hyperbola, having the fixed point as origin and
the straight line as one of the asymptotes. To describe
 different hyperbolas it is necessary to be able to vary both 6
 and M. The first may be easily done by making each link
in two halves, pivoted together at the vertex of the link with
a divided sector and clamp, by means of which the desired

378                    Mr. R. W. Wood on a
angle 6 may be laid off. The modulus of the cell is best
changed by varying either A or B. This may be conveniently
done by making each of either the long pair or the short pair
of links like the legs of a pair of proportional dividers.
   A small model of an instrument on the above lines has been
constructed and found to work very easily and accurately.
Like all hyperbolagraphs, however, the range of motion is
limited (although larger in this than in most forms), and a
considerable amount of time is necessary for the preliminary
adjustment. For these reasons I have generally found one
of the preceding graphical solutions more rapid and con
venient, especially when a number of curves are to be drawn
on the same sheet.
   This application of the quadruplane, which occurred to me
recently while making an application of the Peaucellier
linkage to a concave grating mounting *, seems so simple and
obvious that I feel sure it must have occurred to others as
well as myself; but as I have not been able to find any sug
gestion to this effect in any of the papers on the subject that
I have examined, I have ventured to present the foregoing
description as another illustration of the practical application
of the beautiful geometrical discovery of Prof. Sylvester and
Mr. Kempe.

            XXXIX. A Duplex Mercurial Air-Pump.
                         By R. W. WooD +.
IN working with highly exhausted            tubes, such as are used
      for the production of the Röntgen rays, one of the
difficulties met with is the speedy deterioration of the vacuum
due to the liberation of gas from the electrodes and the glass.
If the tube be thoroughly heated, while on the air-pump, this
trouble is partially remedied, but even with this precaution
the tubes are not very durable and have to be pumped out
frequently. In order to overcome this difficulty I have con
structed a new form of mercurial air-pump, which can be
made on a very small scale and attached permanently to the
Röntgen tube. By this arrangement, any traces of gas that

make their appearance can be easily           £        out.   The
apparatus is so compact that it can be held in the hands while
in operation, not requiring mounting on a board. The pump
is very simple, and a glance at the accompanying diagrams
will make its construction clear.     It will be seen to consist of
                            Fic. I,
 two bulb-pumps joined at the base by a U-tube of glass (fig. 1).
 The pumping is done by rocking the apparatus, the mercury
 filling the exhaust-bulbs AA alternately. This duplex action
 makes the pumping very rapid, for one bulb exhausts while
 the other fills, there being no lost time. The traces of gas
 liberated in the discharge-tube are pumped over into the ex
 hausted bulbs BB, where they are stored, being prevented
 from returning by the mercury which remains in the W traps
 between A and B. The upper bulbs are joined by a tube E,
 which has a small lateral tube P blown into it; this arrange
 ment being necessary for the preliminary exhaustion.
    Mercury is first introduced through P until the bulbs AA
 are half full. A gentle rocking of the apparatus is necessary,
  as the fluid is held up in the bulbs B by the compression of
  the air in A.                               -
     When enough mercury has been introduced, the apparatus
  is placed in the position shown in fig. 3, when the fluid
  should stand at the level indicated in the diagram. The side
  tube P is now drawn out into a thick-walled capillary in a
  blast-lamp, in order to facilitate the subsequent closing of the
  apparatus. This tube being connected with a good mercury
  pump by means of a well-greased, thick-walled rubber hose,

the apparatus is exhausted as completely as possible. During
the exhaustion it must be supported in the position shown in
fig. 3; otherwise the air escaping from the discharge-tube
will throw the mercury violently against the top of the bulbs.
It is a good plan to carefully heat the bulbs and the discharge
tube by means of a Bunsen burner while the pump is in
action, in order to drive off moisture.    The current of a fair
sized induction-coil should also be passed through the dis
charge-tube for a few minutes to rid the electrodes of air as
completely as possible. It will be found that the vacuum
cannot be made perfect enough to give a Crookes dark space
of more than an inch, owing to the leakage through the
rubber hose. The capillary part of P is now heated to fusion
in a small flame which hermetically seals the entire apparatus.
The comparatively poor vacuum in the discharge-tube can
now be made as perfect as is possible with any mercury-pump
by slowly rocking the apparatus, holding it by the bulbs AA.
If the pump is properly made, the traps hold and require no
attention: if not, a little dexterity is required, to prevent the
mercury from running out into the bulb, and they have to be
constantly watched. Care must of course be taken that the

air-bubble, compressed into the trap by each stroke, is driven
entirely around the bend and into the reservoir B. If for
any reason the pump requires to be subsequently opened, it
must be placed in the inclined position and a file scratch
made on the tube P. A bit of red-hot glass pressed against
the scratch will cause a crack through which the air will
slowly enter. If the tube be broken open suddenly, the
mercury will be forced over into the discharge-tube. I con

structed my apparatus with the Röntgen tube projecting to
one side, as shown in the side view, fig. 2. This makes a
support for the pump so that it will stand alone. A pump of
this description in connexion with an ordinary “Dark-space”
tube makes a very convenient piece of lecture-room apparatus
for showing the character of the discharge at different pres
sures. By tipping the pump far enough the upper trap can
be emptied, and the air stored in B returned to the discharge
tube again, showing the phenomena at higher pressure.
    Owing to the absence of rubber connexions and stopcocks,
the mercury remains always clean and there is no leakage.
    I am now constructing a pump on this principle on a large
scale for general laboratory use in which the rocking motion
is to be effected by water-pressure, which, if found serviceable,
will be described in a subsequent paper. The chief objection,
of course, is that the entire pump is in motion, which makes
its connexion with a stationary receiver somewhat difficult.
This can perhaps be done by bringing the exhaust-tube into
coincidence with the axis of rotation, and using a rubber tube
surrounded with mercury as a joint.

           NOTES OF OBSERVATIONS ON THE RöNTGEN RAYS.
  BY HENRY A. ROWLAND, N. R. CARMICHAEL, AND L. J. BRIGGs.
 TH: discovery of       Hertz some years since that the cathode rays
       penetrated some opaque bodies like aluminium, has opened up a
 wonderful field of research, which has now culminated in the
 discovery by Röntgen of still other rays having even more
 remarkable properties. We have confirmed, in many respects,
 the researches of the latter on these rays and have repeated his
 experiments in photographing through wood, aluminium, card
 board, hard rubber, and even the larger part of a millimetre of
 sheet copper.
     Some of these photographs have been indistinct, indicating a
 source of these rays of considerable extent, while others have been
 so sharp and clear cut that the shadow of a coin at the distance
 of 2" from the photographic plate has no penumbra whatever, but
 appears perfectly sharp even with a low-power microscope.
     So far as yet observed the rays proceed in straight lines, and all
  efforts to deflect them by a strong magnet either within or without
  the tube have failed. Likewise prisms of wood and vulcanite have

no action whatever so far as seen and, contrary to Röntgen, no
trace of reflection from a steel mirror at a large angle of incidence
could be observed. In this latter experiment the mirror was on
the side of the photographic plate next to the source of the rays,
and not behind it as in Röntgen's method.
   We have, in the short time we have been at work, principally
devoted ourselves to finding the source of the rays. For this
purpose one of our tubes, made for showing that electricity will
not pass through a vacuum, was found to give remarkable results.
This tube had the aluminium poles within 1" of each other, and
had such a perfect vacuum that sparks generally preferred 10" in
air to passage through the tube. By using potential enough,
however, the discharge from an ordinary Ruhmkorff coil could be
forced through. The resistance being so high, the discharge was
not oscillatory as in ordinary tubes but only went in one direction.
   In this tube we demonstrated conclusively that the main source
of the rays was a minute point on the anode nearest to the
cathode. At times a minute point of light appeared at this point
but not always.
   Added to this source the whole of the anode gave out a few
rays. From the cathode no rays whatever came, neither were
there any from the glass of the tube where the cathode rays
struck it as Röntgen thought. This tube as a source of rays far
exceeded all our other collection of Crookes’ tubes, and gave the
plate a full exposure at 5 or 10" in about 5 or 10 minutes with a
slow-acting coil giving only about 4 sparks per second.
   The next most satisfactory tube had aluminium poles with ends
about 3" apart. It was not straight but had three bulbs, the
poles being in the end bulbs and the passage between them being
rather wide. In this case, the discharge was slightly oscillatory
but more electricity went one way than the other.           Here the
source of rays was two points in the tube, a little on the cathode
side of the narrow parts.
   In the other tubes there seemed to be diffuse sources, probably
due in part to the oscillatory discharge, but in no case did the
cathode rays seem to have anything to do with the Röntgen rays.
Judging from the first two most definite tubes, the source of the
rays seems to be more connected with the anode than the cathode,
and in both of the tubes the rays came from where the discharge
from the anode expanded itself towards the cathode, if we may
roughly use such language.
   As to what these rays are it is too early to even guess. That
they and the cathode rays are destined to give us a far deeper
insight into nature nobody can doubt.—American Journal of
Science, March, 1896.

many kathode rays emanate from the upper surface of the concave

GENTLEMEN,
   With respect to Prof. Lodge's question on page 152 as to the
simplest convention of signs in dealing with focal lengths for junior
students, it appears to me to be a matter which can be best settled
by one who has had experience in teaching two or more methods.
Hence, as this is a qualification to which I can lay no claim, I
forbear to dogmatize.
   It would seem to me, however, undesirable, apart from weighty
reason, to teach an elementary student to let the algebraical sign
of a given line depend, not upon its direction, but upon the physical

nature of the optical image at which the line terminates. Still
there is a manifest advantage in the convention proposed, since it
allows the relation of focal length and conjugate focal distances to
be represented by a single equation for both mirrors and lenses.
    I give below the adaptation of the graphical method to the
convention of signs proposed by Prof. Lodge (and used in Ganot's
‘Physics’), viz.:-Distances to real images to be considered positive
and distances to virtual images negative.
    The fixed points through which the rotating lines pass are now

concave mirrors, and in the left-hand lower quadrant for concave

   SOLUTION AND DIFFUSION OF CERTAIN METALS IN MERCURY.
                           BY W. J. HUMPHREYS.
    The investigation, of which this is a summary, was begun with
 the object of determining the extent to which these phenomena
 differ, if at all, in this case from the solution and diffusion of non
 metallic solids and liquids.
    The method of investigation was to fill a vessel of constant cross
 section with pure mercury, put on its surface a freshly amalgamated
 piece of thé metal to be examined, and after allowing it to stand
 a definite length of time in a place free from external disturbances
 and of fairly constant temperature, to remove from known depths
 below the surface samples of the amalgam and analyse them.
     The metals examined were lead, tin, zinc, bismuth, copper, and
 silver, and the results indicated that there is no essential difference
 between the solution and diffusion of these metals in mercury and
 the same phenomena in any other case.
     Probably the most interesting results were those given by copper
 and silver, both of which dissolved to a much less extent than any
  of the other metals examined, but diffused more rapidly. At 28°
 C. the silver dissolved to the extent of only about one part in two
 thousand, and the copper to a still less extent—about three parts
  in a hundred thousand; - while the rate of diffusion of the silver
  was about twenty millimetres per minute, approximately sixty
 times that of copper and fully six hundred that of zinc.
     This investigation, of which the details will soon be published,
  was suggested to me by Dr. J. W. Mallet, F.R.S., of the University
  of Virginia, and carried out there under his supervision during the
 months of August and September, 1895.—John Hopkins University
  Circulars, February 1896.

XLI. On the Laws of Irreversible Phenomena. By Dr.
    LADISLAs NATANSON, Professor of Natural Philosophy
    in the University of Cracow *.
IT      can scarcely be doubted that the theory of dissipation of
        energy is still in its infancy. Reversible phenomena
are well understood, but they do not involve dissipation at
all ; and what is known about irreversible phenomena is
merely the qualitative aspect of their general laws. In fact,
of the general quantitative laws of irreversible phenomena
we are as yet utterly ignorant. Now I venture to think
there is a general principle underlying irreversible phenomena
which is easily seen to be consistent with fact in various cases

386                  Prof. L. Natanson on the
sitions equivalent to those indicated by these investigators
could be enunciated in the form of a simple and very general
formula; we venture to think that the fundamental principle
which it embodies is worth attention.      Besides, it seems to
afford the proper foundation for an attempt to arrive at some
deeper insight into the laws of dissipation of energy.
                             PART I.
    § 1. Introductory.—Conceive a system : it may be either
finite or infinitely small; it may be an independent system,
or it may be only a part of some other system. Let the state
of the system, at time t, be determined by the values of
certain variable quantities, q, and of their first differential
coefficients with respect to the time, s, or day/dt. We shall
suppose that the energy of the system consists of two parts,
the first of which, T, is a function of the q, and the so homo
geneous of the second degree with respect to the s, and the
second, say U, is a function of the q, only. Let S denote the
absolute temperature of the system : S may be an independent
variable, or otherwise it must be a definite function of the
variables. Suppose that the quantities q, s, received certain
arbitrarily chosen infinitesimal increments 89,8s, ; the energy
T will then become T+8T, and U will become U +8U.            Let
then XP8q, be the work done on the system reversibly,
during the transformation, by extraneous forces, and let 8Q
or XR,89, be the quantity of heat simultaneously absorbed by
the system from the exterior; P will then be the generalized
or Lagrangian extraneous “force” in the “direction” of
 the variable q, and R, will be the “caloric coefficient,” as
 it is called by M. Duhem, or the generalized “thermal
 capacity” of the system with respect to the variable q.
    With respect to the quantity 80 we now make the following
 assumption, which we shall find is in accordance with fact.
 Let us suppose that every variation 8q, takes the special value
 dq, or sidt; then the values of the variables q, will become
 q,+dq.; the energies T and U will become T+dT, U+dU:
 the work done by external forces will be XPaq.; and the
 quantity of heat absorbed will be d0 or XRdq. If now the
 variables be allowed to return to their primitive values q, T
 and U will resume their former values T, U, the external
 work –XPdo, will be done, but the quantity of heat absorbed
 will generally not be d0 but a different quantity, say d,0.

  therefore              —d"Q= -d, Q-d'Q. .              .  .    .    .   (3)

  and                    —dq=-d'Q+d'Q: . . . . . (5)
  thus d"Q is the reversible, and d'Q the irreversible part of
  the heat absorbed. Now, if we assume that these quantities
  are of the form
                    d"Q =XR'dq, 5      d'Q=XR'dq, . . . . (6)

                      800–XR389, 8'Q=XR8q.,                 . . . (7)
  8"Q+ 8'Q gives again 8G). Let us generally define 8Q, 8"Q,
  8'Q to represent the expressions which result if in the ex
  pressions of the quantities d(), d"Q, and d"Q (which we sup
  pose to be empirically known"), variations 8q, are substituted
  in place of the corresponding differentials dge
     § 2. Statement of the Principle.—Let us consider a given
  period of time, from t=to to t=t.1. Let 8q, 8s, 8T, 8U,
  XP89, as usual, represent variations which, between the
  limits t = to and t=ti, are functions of the time susceptible of
  being differentiated, and which vanish at these limits them
  selves; finally, let 80, 8"Q, 8'Q be the corresponding in
  finitesimal expressions calculated as above stated. The
  following principle seems then to hold in physical phenomena:
  between t=to and t=t.1 events which occur in the system
  must be such that the equation
                  | alter-sursrantso)=0 .                      .    .    (I.)
  is satisfied. For brevity, this, when necessary, will be re
  ferred to as the Thermokinetic Principle.
    * To write down the expressions of d() and d'Q, a much greater
  number of variables would evidently be required in most cases than to
  write d"Q; thus in most cases many of the coefficients R' will be equal
  to zero. A similar remark applies to the coefficients P, 0T/oq, oT/0,,
  and oU/09.

   § 3. Lagrangian Equations.—From (I.), remembering the
definitions laid down, we obtain by a well-known calculation

               dt  #)-###              P-R, =0.

                                                     .   .   (II.)
   These equations, a thermokinetic extension of Lagrange's
well-known dynamical equations, have been given implicitly
by Helmholtz and explicitly by M. Duhem; the form they
take in an important particular case had been previously ex
plained by Lord Rayleigh.
   §4. Conservation of Energy.—Considering a real trans
formation d7, ds, multiply each of these equations by sidt
respectively, and add , we find
                   dT+dU-SPAq,—d0=0. . . . . (1)
The principle of conservation of energy in its general form is
thus seen to follow from the thermokinetic principle. That
inversely the thermokinetic principle cannot be deduced from
conservation of energy is an obvious proposition which scarcely
requires special mention.
   § 5. Free Energy.—We shall suppose in the following
(except when the contrary is expressly stated) that one inde
pendent variable is the temperature; and accordingly we
shall use q, to indicate all the other variables. That work is
not required for merely changing the temperature of a system
is an experimental fact ; hence, when the variables S, q, and
s, receive increments 83, 89, 8s, the work done on the system
will be still XP8q, (in our present modified notation) and no
term including 88 will appear. Variables with such properties
attributed to them have been employed by Lord Kelvin as
long ago as 1855; they have been often adopted in general
thermodynamical investigations. M. Duhem calls them
“normal” variables.
   Let us suppose that S, q, represent a system of “normal”
variables.   Write
                                           OW

The function V, if it exists, will be called the free energy of
the system, because, as we shall find hereafter, V defined by
equation (1) will agree in the case of Reversible Thermo

                                     dt
they are found to hold good in all cases of which we have
precise knowledge; lastly, let us suppose that there is no
term containing 88 in the expression for 8'Q. (With respect
to this point compare $ 12.) Equation (2) may now be
divided into
                          U    , ,0
and
                        #-R =0, .           . . . . . .      (4)

            J. a ("T-s:#;">P3." Q}=0 . (III)
This equation expresses the principle in a form similar to
 that of equation (I.). It is a useful equation, owing to the
 readiness with which it admits of application in various cases,
 but its abstract generality is of course much more restricted
 than that of the fundamental equation.
    § 6. Reversible Dynamics.—In Dynamics properly so-called,
 i.e. in Reversible Dynamics, ideal phenomena of motion are
 dealt with, and the notion of temperature is not taken into
 account. Therefore, in Reversible Dynamics a function V can
 be considered, depending on the remaining variables q, only,
 which does not differ, except by a constant, from the “poten
 tial energy’’ U; this is a remark already made by M. Duhem.
 Of course it must be restricted to the Dynamics of points and
 of rigid bodies, since, for instance, in Hydrodynamics and
 Aerodynamics the difference between the quantities V and U
 is variable and depends on the compressibility of the fluid.
     From (III.) we obtain, leaving out the irreversible term
 8'Q, the fundamental principle of Reversible Dynamics.
     § 7. Electromagnetic irreversible phenomena.—Energy stored
  in the aether can be transferred to matter and converted into
 heat; this phenomenon, when it occurs, is a thoroughly ir
  reversible one.

 We shall return to this case in § 13 below.
    § 8. Reversible Thermodynamics —At present the imme
 diate object of the science called Thermodynamics is the study
 of states of equilibrium. The modifications assumed in Ther
 modynamics to occur in a system are, for that reason, virtual
 reversible transformations which lead from one state of equi
librium to another one.        Let us admit the following assump
tions:—first, that that part of the energy which we call T is
a constant quantity; secondly, that the variables are “normal”
variables; thirdly, if a function of the variables S and qi, called
the entropy, be denoted by S, that the term 8"Q is of the
form

and, lastly, that the supposed transformation being reversible,
the term 8'Q is equal to zero. Hence the laws of ordinary
Thermodynamics must be contained in

   § 10. Irreversible Hydrodynamics.—Let us now proceed to
consider a viscous fluid; we shall call u its coefficient of
viscosity. Owing to the viscosity of the fluid its motion is
accompanied by irreversible production of heat; owing to its
compressibility, there is reversible production or destruction
of heat. We shall suppose that every such loss or gain in
every element of the fluid is being immediately and exactly
compensated, so that the temperature of the element remains
constant. At the interior of a large quantity of fluid we
take a portion, of mass Wdwdydzp, p being the density at the
point (w, y, z). Let p be the ordinary mean pressure; u, v, w
the components of the velocity, X, Y, Z the components of
the extraneous acceleration, at the point (w, y, z) and time t.

and Maxwell, are as follows:-                                   -

                             PART II.
    § 14. Introductory.-The foregoing naturally raises the
question, Does a general law exist concerning the infinitesimal
expressions d'Q and 8'Q, which have been found to charac
terize dissipation of energy in the various particular cases
discussed ? I venture to answer this in the affirmative;
but the hypothesis I advance does not profess to be more
than a conjecture and an approximation.
    Let us consider in every particular case the quantity
                         d/
                          '-–2F say. .         . .    .   .   (IV.)
In the case of irreversible Dynamics, § 9, the function F is
well known, and has been called by Lord Rayleigh the
“Dissipation Function;” I should suggest that this term
be extended to all cases covered by equation (IV.).
    Let us imagine a material (or at any rate partly material)
system. Suppose that it is not in equilibrium, and observe,
in a quantitative manner, the disturbances which its state
involves. Let it be isolated so as not to be disturbed by ex
traneous action. We know from experience that under such
 circumstances the disturbances in the system must finally
 subside and tend to disappear. This general behaviour may
 be called the coercion of disturbances, because of the contrast
 it offers with inertia. (See Phil. Mag for June 1895, p. 509.)
 For definiteness let us consider a continuous body.            Let
 dic dydz p be the mass of an element do dydz, and let
 drdy depf represent its dissipation function, so that F, the
dissipation function for the portion   £de dy dz     of the body,

400                 Prof. L. Natanson on the
be  ='dw dy depf.       Then, generally speaking, F is suscep
tible of three kinds of variation, and dF/dt is the sum of three
terms:—1. A surface-integral relating to the action between
the body and the exterior world through the boundary of the
body; 2. A volume-integral expressing “action at a distance”
between the body and the exterior world; and 3. A volume
integral representing “coercion,” i. e., that intimate action
whose constant tendency it is to attenuate and finally to efface
inequalities and disturbances, if there is no extraneous action to
maintain or to excite them ; and whose ultimate nature is, of
course, unknown to us. It would not be difficult to translate
our statement into symbols. Let us adopt, for instance, that
general Molecular Theory due to Maxwell, which we have
called (on a former occasion) “Kinematical Molecular
Theory.” Let u + š, v+ m, w-H & denote the components of
the velocities of individual molecules, f a function of the
(u +%), (v + n), and (w--8), f the mean value of f within an
element, and D/Dt the rate of “coercion.” Then

The three terms on the right-hand side refer to the three
kinds of variation as above stated.
   The assumption we propose to examine is that the third, or
coercive term DF/Dt is always proportional to the value
of F. Thus, writing t for a constant period of time,
                            DF      2F

This equation, we shall find, is general; in the neighbour
hood of states of equilibrium at least it is exactly fulfilled.

   in an important case it received the name of the modulus of

   called so in other similar cases.
      Equation (W.) may be verified in various cases, which we
   shall take in order.

            by (3), we infer that DF/Dt = -2F/t, as stated
   The value of t in air, at the temperature 0°C. and normal
pressure, is approximately 2.10" of a second (Maxwell, Phil.
Trans. 1867, p. 83). We may also compare the relative
values of T in two fluids. In doing so we may assume, in
accordance with Prof. Van der Waals’ leading idea, that the
values of T would bear a constant proportion if they were
calculated for “corresponding” states of the fluids". Hence
the coefficients of viscosity will likewise, in corresponding
states of two fluids, bear a constant numerical ratio f.
    § 16. Diffusion.—The signification of the symbols being

sion to be
F=    £ da dydz Apip2((u2—wi)*-i- (v2-v1)*-- (wo-wl)*}.           (1)
The theory of diffusion can be deduced, in the case of two
gases, from “kinematical” equations and from the following
equations “of coercion,” in which D/Dt refers to the total
coercive action of both gases:
               D                      I)
               # =Ap,(us-ul); # =Ap1(ui-uz),                   .  (2)
and four other equations of similar form. If the dynamical
equations of Maxwell and Stefan are true, equations (2) must
likewise be fulfilled; they may be said therefore to agree
with experience. Let us now pass to the usual case of slow
and quiet diffusion (Maxwell, Phil. Trans. 1867, pp. 73–74).
If we write S for the temperature, R for the gaseous con
stant, we shall find the value of the coefficient of diffusion,
or h say, to be RS/A(p1 + p2); and, if p=p, + p.2, the charac

TH: height of the barometer           is generally reduced to 0°C.

where Bo is the reduced height, B, the observed height at the
temperature t, and 8 and y the coefficients of expansion of

general both very small, we may write
                        Bo=B,U1–(8–9)t].
     In order to facilitate the reduction, tables containing the
 corrections corresponding to definite temperatures and observed
 heights have been compiled, and in the laboratory it is only
necessary to consult such a table, and if necessary perform a
 simple interpolation in order to find the correction which

£ be subtracted * from the observed height to reduce it to
O°C.
   Graphic methods are sometimes used to obtain the tem
perature correction, and one of the best of these, which was
first brought to my notice by Prof. Ramsay, is described in
the Appendix as it seems to be little known.
   During the course of an investigation it was necessary for
me to read and correct the barometer several times daily,
and as this operation became rather tedious I was induced to
make a barometer which indicated the height and the cor
rection simultaneously. The construction of the barometer
presents no great difficulties, and as it is extremely useful in
its new form I now beg to lay a description of it before the
scientific world. It can be read with certainty to 0.1 millim.,
which is sufficiently accurate for most purposes. Whether an
improved method of reading and better workmanship than I
have been able to bestow upon it would make it suitable for
meteorological observations must be left for meteorologists to
decide. For ordinary laboratory work, however, it meets all
the requirements. It is not necessary to know the temperature
at all; and by mentally subtracting the correction as indicated
by the correcting instrument from the observed height (also
obtained directly by setting the barometer), the observer is
enabled in one entry to write the corrected height of the
barometer in his note-book.
   The most suitable form of barometer to employ with the
correcting instrument is that described by Dr. J. Norman
Collief, but an ordinary syphon barometer may also be
adapted for the same purpose. The lower end of the baro
meter is cemented or otherwise securely fitted into a brass
cap A, fig. 1, to which is attached a rod B, which moves
vertically in a guide in order to prevent the barometer from
rotating when it is raised or lowered by means of the screw C.
The barometer itself is kept in a vertical position by the
guides DD which are attached to the framework. The back
of the framework consists of a long, narrow board, the lower
end of which is shown at E, and to which the nut carrying
the screw is fixed. A plate-glass mirror F, carrying the
graduations, is firmly screwed down on the main frame by
means of the picture-frame moulding G G, which is planed
down at the back to such an extent that the mirror is held
tightly clamped in position. The plate-glass mirror is care
fully graduated between 700 and 800 millims., and has also

a zero line etched on it, but the space
between zero and 700 millims. may be
left ungraduated.
    This particular form of mounting the
barometer, independent of the correcting
instrument which has yet to be described,
is in itself very useful; as by setting the
lower meniscus of the barometer at the zero
line by means of the screw at the bottom
of the frame, the uncorrected height can
be read off directly, and this obviates the                 |-D
necessity of taking down the upper and
lower readings and adding or subtracting
 as the case may be.
     Before proceeding to show how the
 device for indicating the amount of the
 temperature correction can be attached to
 a barometer mounted in this way, it is well
 to note that the areas of the upper and
 lower    reservoirs  of the barometer are
 supposed to be equal, and are in fact
 approximately so, if these reservoirs are
 cut from adjacent parts of the same piece
 of tubing. Assuming now that the baro
 meter is accurately set, and that the
 pressure of the atmosphere then changes,
 if the pressure rises or falls n millim.,
 then, on again adjusting or setting the
 barometer, any point on the stem will ob
 viously be raised or lowered n/2 millim.
 Should, however, the cross section of the
 capillary tube, which connects the main
  stem of the barometer with the lower
  cistern, be large when compared with the
  cross section of the lower cistern, then the
 above relation will not hold good.
     This source of error may be eliminated
  either by making the cross section of the
  capillary small, or by selecting a lower
  cistern with a proportionally larger area.
  It may also be eliminated, if necessary,
  in graduating the scale of the correcting
  instrument, but any slight error intro                     —C
  duced in this way has scarcely any ap
  preciable effect on the accuracy of the              else –4–E
  readings.

         the Temperature Corrections of Barometers.          409
   The precision of the complete barometer is limited not so
much by the accuracy of the temperature correction, as this
can easily be made to read correctly to 0.01 millim, but by
the precision with which the barometer can be set and by the
accuracy of the graduations. As has already been mentioned,
the combined error in setting the barometer and reading the
scale at the top should not exceed 0.1 millim. Of course all
danger from the above source is removed if the common
syphon form of barometer is employed; but as Collie's
modification presents other advantages which are clearly set
forth in his paper*, his form of barometer is to be preferred,
especially as it is only necessary for the purposes of the
correcting instrument #: the above relation between n and
n/2 should hold good within a millimetre or two.
   In designing #. correcting instrument use has been made
of the fact that the variation in position of a point on or
attached to the stem of the barometer is proportional to the
variation of the height of the barometer. The point is repre
sented by a horizontal thread of mercury H (figs. 1 and 2),
contained in an ungraduated thermometer which is firmly
attached to the stem of the barometer in a horizontal position.
Behind the horizontal thread of mercury is fixed a scale or
small plate of curves K, in such a position and drawn in such
a manner that the position of the horizontal thread of mercury
(the ordinates) indicates approximately the height of the
 barometer. The correcting instrument is shown on a larger
 scale in fig. 2. The distance from the top to the bottom of
the plate of curves, i.e. from L to M, is actually 50 millims.,
 but this, from what we have already said, represents altogether
 100 millims, the position of L corresponding to a barometric
 height of 800 millims., whilst M corresponds to 700 millims.
 The position of the horizontal thread of mercury at the time
 of setting the barometer thus corresponds approximately to
 the actual height of the barometer. A series of lines 1, 2, 3, 4,
 &c. millim, are drawn or engraved on the plate K, so that the
 position of the meniscus of the horizontal thread of mercury
 gives the temperature correction directly in millimetres. The
 method of drawing these lines requires some explanation. It
 is desired to reduce the height of the barometer to 0°C.
 Obviously, then, the line of zero correction 00 must lie
 immediately behind the point corresponding to 0°C. on the
 horizontal thermometer, and it must furthermore be vertical,
 as no matter what the height of the barometer may be the
 correction at 0°C. must always remain zero.

   Before the position of the other lines can be fixed, it is
necessary to ascertain the length in millimetres corresponding
to 1°C. of the horizontal thermometer.    Let this be n millim.

We have already seen that the formula for reducing the
height of the barometer to 0°C. is
                     Bo=B.[1–(8–9)t],
hence the correction which must be subtracted from the
observed height is
                          (8 -Q) B,t.

         the Temperature Corrections of Barometers.          411
In order to fix the position of the top of the lines giving the
corrections 1, 2, 3, 4 &c. millim., all that we have to do is to
make B.E.800, and calculate the temperature t, which would
make the above expression equal to 1, 2, 3, 4 &c. millim.
Thus, for the top of the line representing a correction of
4 millim., we have
                        (8-y). 800. t =4.
For all ordinary purposes we may make 8-y for mercury
and a glass scale=0.000181-0-000009=0.000172, hence
                        t=         4
                         T 0.000172 x 800'
But since the thermometer is not graduated, we must multiply
the value of t so found by n to get the distance in millimetres
of the point 4 from the     £      0. Similarly the tops of the
other lines may be found, but in general it will be found
sufficient to calculate the greatest correction only, and then to
divide the distance between it and 0 into the required number
of equal parts. In the same way the corrections correspond
ing to a barometric height of 700 millims. (the lower ends of
the lines) may be obtained by making B::=700. Then, since
the correction is proportional to the   £      of the barometer,
straight lines joining 1 and 1, 2 and 2, and so on will repre
sent the corrections between 700 and 800 millims. The spaces
between 0 and 1, &c. may also be subdivided into halves or
tenths if necessary.
   The scale is either drawn or engraved on paper, a plate
glass mirror, or other convenient material, and then mounted
on a bridge in front of the stem of the barometer and behind
the correcting instrument. The final adjustment is made by
moving the correcting thermometer into the proper position
before clamping it tightly to the stem of the barometer. A
piece of wood or other soft material interposed between the
stems of the barometer and thermometer prevents any risk of
breakage on screwing up. In adjusting the correcting
instrument or thermometer, care must be taken that, firstly,
the zero point of the thermometer is precisely in front of the
line of zero correction, and, secondly, that the thread of the
mercury is truly horizontal, and that its position between the
700 and 800 millim. lines of the correcting scale corresponds
as nearly as possible with the actual height of the barometer
at the time.
   For convenience, the completed barometer should be sus
pended on a vertical wall with a good light falling on it. In

  412         Dr. J. Shields on a Mechanical Device for
 order to take a reading it is first gently tapped, the lower
 meniscus is then set exactly at the zero line by means of the
screw at the bottom, and the temperature correction as
indicated by the correcting instrument at once read off lest
the heat of the body should cause any alteration; the height
of the barometer is then observed at the top of the instru
ment, which, after subtraction of the temperature correction,
gives the barometric height reduced to 0°C.
    By considering the correcting instrument it is obvious that,
the temperature remaining constant, the rise or fall of the
barometer is accompanied, after setting the lower mercury
meniscus to zero again, by an upward or downward displace
ment of the horizontal thread of mercury, and, consequently,
to an increase or decrease in the correction. Similarly, a
rise or fall of temperature is accompanied by an increase or
decrease in the correction.
    The instrument I have just described is one out of four
possible modifications. Both scales may be fixed whilst the
barometer and thermometer are displaced simultaneously or
vice versá. Again, the barometer and correcting scale may
be fixed whilst the other parts are adjustable or vice versá.
    The first two will probably be found most useful. Distinct
advantages might be gained by fixing the barometer with the
thermometer above it, and at the same time etching the
barometer and correction scales on the same piece of plate
glass mirror, which could be placed behind them and be
moved vertically by a set screw at the bottom of the
instrument.

XLIII. An Addition to the Wheatstone Bridge for the Deter
   mination of Low Resistances. By J. H. REEVEs, M.A.,
   City and Guilds of London Central Technical College *.
       HILE it can be assumed with fair certainty that
         even in moderately equipped laboratories there will
be found one sensitive galvanometer and a good set of resist
ance-coils arranged in the form of a Wheatstone bridge, it is
by no means so common to find a convenient method for
determining low resistances, such as, for example, a Kelvin
bridge. The piece of apparatus which forms the subject of
this paper is a comparatively cheap addition to the ordinary
bridge, and enables the resistances of exact metre-lengths of
even thick wires to be directly measured with almost as much
ease as larger resistances can be determined with the ordinary
Wheatstone bridge. The method also possesses the advantage
that all the measurements are made in terms of a standard
wire with fixed contacts, and, therefore, not subject to the
wear which accompanies the frequent use of a slider; further,
in the case of copper wires no temperature-correction is
needed.
   The apparatus is represented in fig. 1. On a mahogany

two screws S, S' will raise the springs when required for
inserting or removing this wire.
   At points B, C in the standard are soldered two short
lengths of wire terminating in binding-screws Q and T. The
gauge of the standard wire, which is of copper, and the
distance apart of B and C are so chosen that the resistance
between B and C is 0.01 ohm at the temperature of the wire
at the time of its final adjustment, which should be noted.
The method of determining these points is given later on.
   The arrangement is a variation of the Kelvin bridge, with
this difference: that in the latter the measurements are made
by varying the length between the knife-edges of sliders
which press on the standards, of which several are required :
whilst in the former only one standard resistance is employed,
and the measurements are effected by the alteration of the
other resistances in the arrangement. If the whole apparatus
had to be bought, the Kelvin bridge would be the cheaper,
but the new Addition utilizes the box of coils, which as before
mentioned is sure to be available, and only requires in addition
one standard to be made and adjusted.
   The theory of the Kelvin bridge is to be found in the text
books. In Gray's ‘Absolute Measurements, for example,
vol. i. p. 359, it is proved that if fig. 2 represents the usual

      The whole arrangement is joined together as shown in
   fig. 3, the dotted lines indicating the temporary connexions.
   By comparing this with figs. 1 and 2, no detailed description
  is necessary, as R, r, w, y, a, b, s are lettered to correspond.
      The battery may with advantage be a storage-cell with two
  resistances in series with it. One, p, may be an adjustable
   carbon resistance, while p' may be constructed of wire and
   should have a considerable resistance. This latter terminates in
  mercury cups m and n, so that by joining these cups together
  with a short connector the resistance can be easily short
  circuited.
      The resistances w and y are resistances unplugged from the
  box of coils forming the ordinary Wheatstone bridge; y is
  the 1000-ohm coil of one of the ratio arms, and v is in the
  adjustable arm. If such a set of coils be not available, y may
  be any 1000-ohm coil, and v any box of coils containing
  resistances up to 5000 ohms. The two leads joining w and y
  to B and B' respectively should be as stout and short as
  possible. The resistances from d, d' to I form the a b of
  fig. 2.
      To make a measurement, insert the wire whose resistance
  is required in its proper clamps, taking care that it lies quite
  straight between them. Its diameter and material being
  known, the resistance of one metre of it can be approximately

                     to the Wheatstone Bridge. .               417

    Remove the plug P, and, including p' in the battery cir
 cuit, obtain balance by shifting the slider I, the galvanometer
 being also shunted if necessary. The arrangement is now an
 ordinary Wheatstone bridge,

    Next insert the plug P, short-circuit p so that now a
 strong current passes when the battery circuit is closed, and
 obtain balance by altering v. Let the new value be "s. Then,
since approximately

    In any case this new value of R is very much nearer the
true value than the approximate value R1. If the value of a
has to be but little altered, it may be taken as the true value
of R, but if, on the other hand, the first estimate was con
siderably in error, and, in consequence, a large alteration
has to be made in a in order to obtain balance, the much
closer value thus obtained must be taken as the first approxi
mation, and both experiments repeated.
   Now, since the wires are so close to one another, their tem
perature can be called the same, and, if the tested wire be of
copper, their temperature-corrections are the same. There
fore, if R be a certain fraction of r at one temperature, it will
be the same fraction at any other. But in the actual bridge
on which the experiments described later on were first
made, this temperature was 17°7 C. Therefore, substituting
numerical values in the last equation,
             R= === 1000 *< 0.1––*—                   O.
                             01 = 100,000 ohms at 17°7 C.
   Of course, if R be not made of copper, the temperature
must be noted and allowed for.            -

three conditions:— .       .    "       -          -         -

              Matthiessen's standard has been taken to be a specific resistance (resistance
           per cubic centimetre at 0°C.) of 1:620 International Microhms.
                Towards the end of this table it will be seen that even a
            sensitive galvanometer barely allowed an accuracy of 0.1
           per cent. The Daniell cell was therefore                   £,            and a             |
            small accumulator with a resistance of 2 ohms in series with

                     to the Wheatstone Bridge,                   419
it substituted.   The last three wires were then again tested,
and a marked improvement was at once seen, for now an
alteration of 1 ohm in a produced a difference of deflexion of
10-15 scale-divisions, thus giving the interpolated figure
correct to the first place given, i.e., R correct to 1 part in 3000.
   To further test the capabilities of this method, a strand
cable composed of 7 copper wires, each of No. 16 S.W.G.,
was taken, the strands being flattened to pass under the
Springs, which had not been constructed for a wire of such a
large diameter. The results, using the same cell and resist
ance, are shown in the next table.

    Here only 44 divisions correspond with a change in w of
 1 ohm : thus an error in reading of a division means an
error in R of 0.1 per cent. The effect of using a still larger
current was next tried, the 2-ohm coil being removed, and the
two resistances p, p' of fig. 3 substituted. An ammeter was
also included in the battery-circuit, so that the actual current
could also be measured.                           -
   Now, on passing a strong current both wires heat, and if
the wire r has the smaller diameter it will heat the faster.
Therefore its resistance will also increase the faster, and hence
the resistance of the wire R will apparently diminish, and
vice versa. In order to see how much this diminution might
amount to, the resistance p' was short-circuited, and p was
adjusted until the battery-current was 6 amperes, and the
results are shown in Tables III. and IV.

   A few days later these experiments were repeated with a
current of 2 amperes. The slight discrepancy in the value of
R was due to the fact that in the interval the cable, which

slightly less length must have been included between the
knife-edges. As, however, these experiments were being
made solely to find the sensibility of the measuring arrange
ment, no attempt was made to straighten it. The results are
shown in Table W., experiment (a) being for the short dura
tion of current, and (b) the result after the current had flowed
continuously for 3 minutes.

    From the above results it will be seen, firstly, that 13
 divisions correspond with 1 ohm difference in w, thus making
 the fourth significant correct, in other words, an error in R is
 less than 0.1 per cent.; and secondly, the passage of a current
 of 2 amperes only produced in 3 minutes a difference of like
 amount.                       -                                  -
    No larger cable was tried, nor was              any wire smaller' than

  No. 22 S.W.G., but between these limits an accuracy of 0:1
  per cent. was easily obtained so far as the sensibility of the
  method was concerned.
     The accuracy of the standard now remains to be considered.
  This can be best seen from a description of the method by
  which the correct length between the points B, C was de
  termined.           -
     In order that this length might be of a convenient amount
  to suit the dimensions of the base-board, it should have been
  made of copper wire No. 17 S.W.G.; but a piece of this gauge
  which was bought for the purpose proving unsatisfactory, a
  piece of No. 16 was taken and stretched till of the required
  diameter.
     One, QB, of the two short arms of fig. 1, was soldered on,
  the other, TC, being left loose. The whole was then screwed to
  a rough board, and the wire annealed by passing through it
  a current of about 50 amperes till it was too hot to touch and
  then allowing it to cool, the operation being repeated ten
  times. The arrangement represented in fig. 4 was next made.

     By following out this figure, it will be seen to be the same
  arrangement as fig. 3, except that now the place of the plug
  is taken by the gap P. The standard was a 1-ohm coil of
  manganin wire, constructed by Messrs. Nalder, Bros. Its
  terminals rested in mercury-cups from which the various leads
  were taken, the ends of all wires dipping in the mercury being
  freshly amalgamated. The leads joining the 10- and 1000
  ohm coils together and to the binding-screws T and M respec
  tively were short and stout.
     The arm TC was then put approximately in position, and
  good contact at C was maintained by pressure. To avoid
  thermoelectric effects this pressure was made with a piece of
  wood, and in order to see if any such effects were present a
 commutator, not shown in the figure, was put in the battery
 circuit.   It was then found that if balance had been obtained

422             Determination of Low Resistances.
for one direction of the current, a reversal produced no appre
ciable deflexion, thus showing that this piece of wood had en
 tirely prevented such effects. As a precaution, however, the
 current was reversed each time balance was obtained, and in
 no instance was any deflexion caused by the reversal.
    The experiments were then conducted in the same order as
 before.   W'    the gap open, balance was obtained by movin
 the slider I. The gap was then closed and balance obtaine
 by altering the position of the arm TC. The gap was next
 opened, and the slider moved till again no deflexion was noted.
 This motion was very slight, and the alteration, after closing
 the gap, was not found to have produced any observable want
 of balance. The correct position of C was thus determined.
     In order to see with what degree of accuracy this position
  had been arrived at, the arm was shifted 1 millim. in both
  directions, and the want of balance was indicated by a de
  flexion on either side of zero of one division; hence, as
  the length between B and C was over one metre, the error
  in the position of C was well under 0.1 per cent.
     The arm TC was then soldered to the wire, and the tests
  repeated. No deflexion was observable with the ratio       I'
  but on adding a 1-ohm coil to the 1000, making the ratio
  I' the want of balance produced           nearly 2 divisions de
  flexion. The wire was then screwed in its proper place and
  there tested in a similar fashion with the same result, viz.,
  with the ratio  I'. no deflexion was noted, while with the
     •     0          •               • - -
  ratio IOO1 * deflexion of over 1 division showed the want of
  balance.    A thermometer lying beside the wire indicated
  17°7 C. Thus the resistance between B and C was 0.01 ohm
  at 17°7 C., with an error of less than 0.1 per cent.
     Thus on all three conditions an accuracy of 0.1 per cent.
  was obtained. This simple apparatus is, therefore, capable of
  measuring the resistances of metre-lengths of wires between
  the limits of No. 22 S.W.G. and a stranded cable of 7
  No. 16's (and probably over a still greater range) with an
  accuracy throughout of 0.1 per cent, an accuracy quite suffi
  cient for all commercial purposes.                  -

XLIV. On the Absorption Spectrum of Solutions of Iodine
   and Bromine above the # Temperature.                    By R.
   W. WOOD *.
IN examining solutions of iodine above the critical tempera
      ture with a spectroscope, I have found that the fine     lines
which characterize the absorption spectrum of gaseous iodine
may be either present or     £,        epending on the amount
of the solvent present.
   These lines are not present in the spectrum of iodine
solutions, and their disappearance under the above-mentioned
conditions seemed to be £ either to the pressure exerted by
the vapour, or to something akin to solution.
   The tube containing the liquid was heated in an iron tube
provided with two vertical slits, cut opposite each other, for
the passage of a light ray, which was subsequently analysed
with a large spectroscope of high dispersion.

424 Mr. R. W. Wood on the Absorption Spectrum of
     For the preliminary investigation four tubes of similar
size were prepared (1, 2, 3, & 4, fig. 1) containing equal
amounts of iodine, but successively increasing amounts of
bisulphide of carbon.
             Fig. 1.        Fig. 2.              Fig. 3.

  ... These tubes were successively heated until their contents
 were homogeneous, and their absorption spectra observed.
 No. 1 showed the lines almost as distinctly as iodine alone:
 in No. 2 they were fainter but still visible : it was with
 difficulty that they could be seen in No. 3, while in No. 4 they
 were entirely absent. No. 4 was then opened, and a little more
 iodine added. On reheating, the lines appeared. Variations
 in the temperature had no apparent effect. A mixture which
 at 300° showed the lines faintly, showed no change when
 heated to 350°.                          -
        A large number of experiments were tried with varying
 amounts of iodine, and with various solvents such as       £
 form, liquefied sulphur dioxide, and water, and all were found
 to act in the same way. It was difficult to get reliable results
 with water owing to its action on the glass with formation of
 iodides.
        To determine the effect of a greater pressure with less
 density, an apparatus (fig. 3) was constructed of glass, in which
 pressure could be developed by the electrolysis of water.
     he long arm, which contained the iodine, was heated in the

       Iodine and Bromine above Critical Temperature.       425
iron tube, and a current of electricity sent through the water
in the short arm. The absorption spectrum was watched for
an hour and a half, at the end of which time the apparatus
exploded, but up to the very end the fine lines lost nothing
in distinctness. The pressure was calculated from the time,
the current strength, and the capacity above the liquid, and
was found to have been about 250 atmospheres, or more than
double the critical pressure of bisulphide of carbon. This
indicates that the disappearance of the lines is due to the
density of the vapour rather than to its pressure.
   The quantitative investigation of these phenomena was
next undertaken. A powerful arc light was substituted for
the incandescent lamp, and a lens so arranged as to throw
an image of the “crater” on the heated tube. By this
arrangement, the spectra of much denser solutions could be
observed. A tube provided with a long capillary neck, of
the form shown in fig. 2, was constructed and carefully
graduated. The contents of this tube could be varied without
altering its volume by cutting off the tip of the capillary, and
by warming or cooling the tube cause the liquid to run out
or in; the tip could then be sealed once more. This operation
could be repeated about 60 times before using up the capillary,
only about 2 mm. being removed at each filling. A certain
amount of iodine and bisulphide of carbon being introduced,
the tube was sealed, heated, and examined. If the lines were
present in the spectrum, a little more of the bisulphide
was added, and this was continued until the lines just
disappeared, indicating complete solution. The density was
determined by noting the amount of fluid as measured by
the graduations, since, when the contents are homogeneous,
these values are proportional. Just before complete solution
the lines are so faint as to be invisible in the stationary
spectrum, but by moving the telescope to the right and to
the left, they could be detected, the eye being more sensitive
to a moving faint object than a stationary one. By using
this device, the density necessary to just cause the disappear
ance of the lines could be determined with considerable
accuracy.
   The iodine was measured in the following manner. A
saturated solution in CS2 was made at 12° and a capillary
 pipette (p, fig. 2) was dipped into it. The fluid rose to a
 certain height, which was marked. The iodine solution was
 then washed out of the capillary into the small tubet by means
of a drop or two of CS, put into the wide top of the capillary.
 This was immediately transferred to the graduated tube in
the manner described. The amount held by the capillary

426       Mr. R. W. Wood on the Absorption Spectrum of
  ipette made only a small drop of the saturated solution, and
£ 0.00031 gr. of iodine.       This was determined by filling
and emptying the pipette ten times, and determining the
iodine volumetrically, with sodium thiosulphite.
    The graduated tube was divided into 20 parts, and the
amounts of iodine that could be present with amounts of CS,
varying from 1 to 10 divisions, without showing the iodine
  as spectrum, were determined. With the tube half-full of
   S2, it was possible to add iodine until the tube was quite
opaque; consequently densities greater than 5 that of liquid
CS, could not be investigated.
    The values found directly are not in shape for discussion,
since as we increase the density of the vapour we also
increase its amount; in other words, we are working with
varying amounts of solvent as well as varying densties.
    To reduce these varying amounts of solvent to unity is
very simple, and the results are given in the following table.
For the various densities 8 are given the amounts of iodine x
which can be mixed with 1 gram of the CS, vapour without
the lines appearing in the spectrum; or, in other words, the
amounts of iodine which 1 gram of CS, will dissolve at
different densities.
    If the tube contain m grams CS2 with m grams of iodine,
 and if v be the volume of the tube in c.cm., then

  the left of the curve, and the lines should appear. This was
  found to be the case.
      Similar investigations were made with bromine, the absorp
  tion spectrum of which is very similar to that of iodine. A
  different method of measuring the halogen was adopted,
  however. Seven drops of # bromine were brought into

 428     Mr. R. W. Wood on the Absorption Spectrum of
 the tube, and bisulphide of carbon added up to the 11th mark.
 The absorption spectrum showed no trace of the lines. Half of
 the contents was then removed, and the amount of bromine in
 this determined. On sealing and reheating the tube the
 lines were distinctly visible, as was to be expected, and CS,
"was added little by little until the lines just disappeared.
 Half of this new quantity was then removed, and # Same
 process repeated. In this way data were obtained from
 which the following table has been made. The curve is
 shown in fig. 5.

    In the third column of the table is given the ratio of the
 x values for bromine and iodine for the corresponding 8
 values. A given amount of CS, vapour at any density from
 •05 to 40 will dissolve from 6 to 7 times as much bromine
 as iodine. Liquid bromine and CS, appear to be miscible in
 all proportions.
    These investigations show that to a certain amount of CS,
 vapour a certain definite amount of iodine vapour (depending
 on the density of the CS2) can be added without causing the
 lines characterizing the spectrum of iodine vapour to appear.
 If more iodine vapour be added, the lines are at once seen.
 The conclusion that one naturally draws is that the iodine
 molecules bind themselves in some way to the CS2 molecules,
 and are incapable of exercising the selective absorption
 peculiar to the molecules of pure iodine gas. On this
 supposition, we may look on the curves in figs. 4 and 5 as
 solubility curves, and may consider, in a certain mixture of
  CS, and iodine or bromine vapour, the halogen as existing in
  two states, one part dissolved in the CS, vapour, and the
  other free.

 determined.      In the second case a more accurate method was
used; '02 gr. of the salt (KI) was brought into the tube,
 and alcohol added little by little until no precipitation occurred
 above the critical temperature.

   The tube was heated in an air-bath and illuminated by a
beam from an arc light, so that the faintest crystal film could
be easily observed, and the amount of alcohol necessary to
completely dissolve the salt in the gaseous state very
accurately determined.
   Half of the contents was then removed, the tube resealed
and heated. A thick film appeared on the wall, which
corresponds exactly to the reappearance of the lines in the
spectrum, in the experiments with iodine and bromine.
More alcohol was added until the vapour had the density
requisite for the solution of this amount of salt.

   The curves plotted from these values (fig. 6) are quite
similar to the curves for iodine and bromine as determined by
the spectroscope, which is not unfavorable to the supposition
that the halogen vapour is in part dissolved in the vapour of
the bisulphide of carbon. If the dissolved substance is
volatile at the temperature used, as is the case with iodine
and bromine, the undissolved portion is in the state of a free
gas; if non-volatile, as in the case of HgI2 and KI, it is
precipitated as a crystalline film on the wall.
   In conclusion I wish to thank Prof. Warburg for the means
of carrying on the investigations which he has placed at my
disposal and for the interest that he has taken in the work.

     XLV. The Substitution Groups whose Order is Four.
                    By G. A. MILLER, Ph.D.”
IT    seems proper to say that Professor Cayley began the
      enumeration of all #. regular substitution groups of a
given order since he determined these groups for the first
order that presents any difficulties, viz., for the order 8f.

pp. 34–37.

432              Dr. G. A. Miller on the Substitution
Later he gave a list of all the regular groups whose order
does not exceed 12 together with a geometrical representation
of them". Kempe had previously given such a listf, but his
results were not quite correct.
     Since all groups are isomorphic to regular groups ; and
two distinct regular groups cannot be simply isomorphic $,
it is clear that the enumeration of all such groups within
certain regions is very important. Complete enumerations
for the first part of the two following series of orders have
been published: (1) when the order of the groups is the
product of a given number of prime factors ||, and (2) when
it does not exceed a given number".
    Two more comprehensive enumerations with respect to
order may be mentioned, (1) the enumeration of all the tran
sitive groups of given orders, and (2) the enumeration of all
the groups of given orders. The latter of these includes the
former, and each of them includes the regular groups. It
may happen that the transitive groups of a given order are
also regular. This is, for instance, the case when the order
is a prime number, or the square of a prime number. When
the order is a prime number (p) there is one group for every
degree which is a multiple of p : i.e. there are n groups of
£ p whose degree does not exceed np, n-1 of these are
transitive, n being any positive integer. It should be observed
that the number of the transitive groups of a finite order is
always finite, while that of the intransitive groups of any order
is infinite.
    When the order of the groups is a composite number, the
problem of determining all the possible groups becomes more
complex. We shall confine our attention to the groups
whose order is four. Since none of the transitive constituents
of these groups can be of an odd degree, we see that the
degree of such a group must be even and not less than four.
We may therefore represent the degree by 2n.
     To find all the cyclical groups of degree 2n we have
only to construct a 1,1 correspondence between a cyclical
                                               ~           -

each one of these groups and a group of the second order
whose degree is 2n-42. The number of such groups for a
given value of n is therefore equal to the largest value of a,
and the individual groups may be given by assigning to a the
successive integers beginning with unity.
    To find all the non-cyclical groups of degree 2n we may
construct a 1,1 correspondence between a four-groups*, and
(1) a 2,1 correspondence between each one of these groups and
a group of the second order whose degree is 2n-42, (2) a
1,1 correspondence between each one of these groups and a
group of the fourth order which is of degree 2n-42 and
contains n–22 systems of intransitivity. The number of the
groups of the first one of these two types is the same as that
of the cyclical groups, and the individual groups may be
given in the same way. The number of groups of this and
the cyclical type is therefore twice the largest value of a.
    The groups of the second type of non-cyclical groups
present somewhat greater difficulties. Here a may assume
the value zero in addition to its values in the two preceding
cases. We shall first determine the groups when x is zero;
 i.e., we shall first seek all the
       Groups which contain 2n Elements and n Systems of
                              Intransitivity.
    The average number of elements in the substitutions of
 such a group is nt, and the number of elements in all of its
 substitutions is 4n. The number of systems of two elements
 is therefore 2n. These 2n systems must occur in three sub
 stitutions. If the smallest number of systems in any one of
 these three substitutions is represented by S, we have
                                    =2n
                                   *>3.
 For each value of S which satisfies this relation there must
 be at least one group, since we have only to use the remaining
 systems for the second generating substitution in order to
 construct such a group.
     In general we have the following :

    The groups for the same value of S are all distinct; but it
 may happen that two groups, which correspond to different
 values of S are identical. This can, however, not occur so
 long as the value of S satisfies the relation
                                    - 70
                                  S=#.
 Identical groups can therefore only occur when the value of
 S is such that
                              ??,       = 2n
                              # =s=#.
 To the successive values of Swhich satisfy this relation there
 corresponds one of the following series of identical groups:--
                       2, 4, 6, 8, . . .     If n is even.
              (A)  {# 3, 5, 7, ...            , , odd.

                         Groups whose Order is Four.                     435
     ' to a particular value of n, we may therefore first find
     the sum of the number of these groups which correspond to
     the different values of S that satisfy the relation
                                         = 2n
                                       S=#,
    and deduct from this sum the sum of            [:] [:]
                                                         -         terms  of
    the corresponding series (A). These operations are indicated
    in the following formula:—

([:]*) [;]+)[]*)-                             loan (#1-[;]).
       By means of this formula we can readily determine the
    number of groups which contain 2n elements and n systems
    of intransitivity for any particular small value of n. The
    individual groups may be found by assigning to S the
    successive integers from 1 to         [#] and rejecting the identical
    groups according to series (A) when the value of S satisfies
    the relation
                                    2 < s-'
                                   #2    S< 3 *
       The groups of the second type of non-cyclical groups,
    which correspond to the other values of a, are found in
    exactly the same way. Their number may therefore be
    found by means of the given formula provided we use instead
    of n the following series in order,
                     n-2, n-4, n–6, ..., 2 or 3. .
    By adding the double of the largest value of a to the sum of
    the numbers of these groups corresponding to the different
    possible values of x, we obtain the number of groups whose
    order is four and whose degree is 2n. Two of the groups
    are transitive when n is 2.          For the other values of n all the
    groups are intransitive.
                                      Example.
       It is required to find all the groups whose degree and
    order are 14 and 4 respectively.

436         The Substitution Groups whose Order is Four.
   To find the number of these groups we observe that the
largest value of a is 3. Hence there are 6 groups of the first
two types. To find the number of groups of the third type,
i.e. of the second type of non-cyclical groups, we assign the
following three values to n:—
                                  7, 5, 3.

   When only the number of the possible groups for a given
degree is required, and when n is a large number, it is very
desirable to avoid assigning so many £ values to n as
are necessary if we employ the given formula.          By observing
that all the fractions in this formula are increased by integers
when n is increased by 6, we may readily find the following

positive integer, and 21 represents the largest value of a, i.e.

XLVI. On the alleged Scattering of Positive Electricity by
            Light. By J. ELSTER and H. GEITEL *.
TH: question        whether light which facilitates the passage
        of negative electricity from a conductor into the sur
rounding gas can, in like manner, accelerate the discharge of
positive electricity is not without significance for the proper
apprehension of the photoelectric process.

   If, in fact, this action of light can be shown to take place,
then it is no longer possible to believe that we have here to do
with a specific phenomenon of the kathode, and, moreover,
the view that the photoelectric process depends upon the
discharge of the one (the gaseous) coating of an electric
double layer which is continually renewed at the surface of
contact between the conductor and the gas must be put to
experimental proof, since the nature of the electricity escaping
in light must always be the same as that which the gas in
contact with the conductor itself takes. From this point of
view, therefore, it would not be intelligible that one and the
same conductor in the same atmosphere should give off both
electricities more easily in light than in darkness. Now
experiment shows that the illumination of a negatively
charged surface, with proper choice of light and of substance
illuminated, causes an active discharge of electricity into the
surrounding gas, whilst the corresponding phenomenon for
positive electricity—if it takes place at all—must be much
more insignificant. Thus Hrn. £ and Righi have not
been able certainly to recognize the action of ultra-violet
light upon   £y          charged surfaces, and we ourselves have
so far not been able to observe any loss of positive electricity
in light which was not sufficiently well accounted for by the
usual loss of electricity or by the sources of error to be more
definitely spoken of in what follows.
   A paper by Herr E. Branly has recently appeared", in
which the acceleration of the electric discharge by ultra-violet
light is maintained to hold good also for positive electricity.
On account of the importance of the subject we have repeated
the experiments described in this paper, and with the arrange
ments which seemed to us best suited to exclude sources of
error, and following the method of Herr Branly as closely as
possible in essential points. After we had failed in obtaining
the same result as Herr Branly, we tried whether the alkali
metals, which are so sensitive to ordinary light with negative
electrification, would show a photoelectric discharge also with
positive electricity. In what follows we venture to report
upon the results obtained in these experiments.
   The most obvious method of observing the scattering of
electricity in light, which method was also employed by Herr
Branly, is to connect the electrified surface to be examined
with an electroscope, and to judge of the loss of electricity
produced by the light in a given time from the decrease in the
divergence of the leaves. This method has the disadvantage
that, on account of the high tension employed, the whole of #.

           Scattering of Positive Electricity by Light.        439
electrified system of conductors must be extremely well
insulated so that a feeble action of the light may not be
hidden by the loss of electricity not connected with the action
of the light. But apart from this, there is a disturbing cause
arising from the fact that each time the observer changes the
sign of the electric charge, there is a return current from the
insulating supports of that electricity which had passed to
them during the previous electric condition.
   Much less exposed to these sources of error is the arrange
ment which Herr A. Righi and we ourselves have often em
ployed in photoelectric experiments, especially if it is necessary
to recognize feeble action. In this method the electrical
measuring apparatus, together with the conductor to be
illuminated, are at the commencement of the experiment at
zero potential, and the strength of the action of the light is
measured by the velocity with which the potential becomes
equal to that of a conductor kept at constant potential, which
stands opposite to the illuminated surface at a small distance
from it.
   The arrangement of the experiment was as follows:—The
ultra-violet light was furnished by the spark of a condenser,
which was connected with the poles of an induction-coil
actuated by 4 to 8 large Bunsen elements, the spark having
a maximum length of 18 centim. The current was broken
by means of a Wagner’s hammer with platinum contacts,
and the spark of the condenser was taken between two alu
minium wires at a distance of 2 millim. The galvanic battery,
the induction-coil, spark-space, and all the necessary con
nexions were placed in the open air in front of the closed
window of the observing room. One of the panes of the
window was replaced by a plate of thin iron connected to
earth, which was provided with a circular opening, in which
was inserted a quartz lens of 50 millim. diameter. Since the
focus of this lens coincided with the spark, a parallel beam of
ultra-violet light was formed by the lens within the room,
whilst at the same time the electrostatic action of the induction
coil and of the electrified air from the spark was shut off from
the room. Within the room, at a distance of about 25 centim.
from the window and at right angles to the beam of light, was
placed a piece of iron-wire gauze with a mesh of about
1 millim, and parallel to this, at a distance of 2 to 4 millim.,
the insulated plate of the substance to be examined. From
this a wire went to the quadrant electrometer (sensitiveness,
1 volt=23 divisions), whilst the wire gauze was charged
to a potential of about 525 volts by a battery of several
hundred Leclanché cells. According as the wire gauze was

   440       Profs. J. Elster and H. Geitel on the Alleged
   charged with positive or negative electricity, the plate parallel
   to it must become charged with negative or positive electricity.
   If now the earth connexion of the electrometer was removed,
   then as soon as a passage of electricity took place between
   the gauze and the plate, the change of potential in the latter
    could be read off on the electrometer.           It is to be observed
    that with a positive charge of the gauze, the plate to be tested
    has negative electricity on its surface, and that therefore from
    this clean metallic surface in ultra-violet light a free discharge
    towards the gauze was to be expected and a consequent
    positive charge of the plate. We used for the experiment a
    disk of amalgamated zinc, also similar pieces of zinc covered
    with a thin layer of paraffin or tallow, and also a plate of
    wood covered with tallow. According to Herr Branly, such
    surfaces covered with paraffin or tallow suffer a greater loss
    of positive than of negative electricity when exposed to light.
       W.   observed the deflexion           of the electrometer-needle
    which took place in one minute, both with positive and with
    negative charge of the gauze, and both in the dark and when
    illuminated with light from the spark. The Wagner's hammer
    was so arranged that it came into action of itself upon closing
     the current, it was therefore only necessary to keep the
    current closed for one minute.            The results of a series of
    measurements are brought together in the following table.
     The numbers give the change of potential of the plate,
    measured in volts, which took place in one minute: each

       As was to be expected from what has been said, we have in
    this series of observations evidence of the great photoelectric
    dispersion from a plate of amalgamated zinc charged with
     ": electricity.
          e were not able to expose the plate for a full minute to

             Scattering of Positive Electricity by Light.            441
the light, as the deflexion of the electrometer on the scale
could not then be read off. Therefore the plate was exposed
only five seconds, and the deflexion-reduced to volts—was
multiplied by 12*. But beside this action of the light—
undoubted and already known—the numbers show no other.
There are, it is true, deflexions of the electrometer-needle in
the dark as well as in the light, which, however, in no case
reach the amount of one volt, and which on account of their
inconstancy are to be referred to an irregular passage of
electricity from the gauze to the plate, probably caused by
the dust of the air.
    Only in two cases is this feeble transference of electricity
slightly greater in light than in the dark, viz., with a nega
tively charged gauze opposed to a plate of amalgamated zinc,
and with the gauze positive and the plate of paraffined zinc.
If one wishes to find. in this a proof of an action of light,
then only the first case can be taken to show a photoelectric
dispersion of positive electricity. But here also a sufficient
explanation is to be found in the fact that the ultra-violet
light reflected from the polished surface of the amalgamated
zinc strikes the side of the gauze turned towards it and pro
duces a passage of negative electricity from it to the plate,
so that in this case the photoelectric discharge is not from the
positively charged plate but from the negatively charged
ga U1ze.
    We    have now to describe an experimental arrangement in
 which this action of the reflected light appears perfectly
 clearly. All the observations show that the paraffined or
 greased surfaces are not photoelectrically sensitive; in no
 case is the scattering of electricity from these found to be
 greater with a positive charge than with a negative charge
 or in the dark.
     The small deflexions of the electrometer observed in the
     * A more accurate calculation of the change of potential during an ex
 posure of one minute would be obtained by use of the formula
                              W–v, =V. e-kJt,
  in which V denotes the potential of the charging battery, V, that of the
  illuminated plate, k a constant, J the intensity of the light, and t, the
  time of exposure. From this we should have for two times of exposure
  t1 and t2 and the corresponding potentials vi and v, :
                         *('w')=# is ('w')
  from which v, can be easily calculated. In the foregoing case we obtain
  for v2 the value shown in brackets, +123 volts.

442       Profs. J. Elster and H. Geitel on the Alleged
dark, which always indicated a loss in the charge of the
gauze, show that the instrument is too delicate for experi
ments such as these, in which a thin plate of air is exposed to
a fall of potential of more than 100 volts per millimetre. We
have therefore repeated these experiments with the much less
sensitive aluminium-leaf electroscope, and were able to make
the charge of the gauze and the time of exposure twice as
great as before. But then also the photoelectric discharge
took place only when the gauze had a negative charge.
Thus the charge of an amalgamated zinc plate rose in five
seconds to 400 volts, of an oxidized zinc plate in two minutes
to 190 volts, and with greased or paraffined zinc or wood
plates the potential remained at zero, irrespective of the sign
of the charge of the gauze.
   From the result of this experiment we concluded that in
the experiments of Herr Branly some unsuspected source of
error must have existed. In order to discover what this may
have been, we have repeated the experiment of Herr Branly,
essentially according to his arrangement as far as was possible
from the data which he gives. The sparks of the induction
coil were taken within a box of sheet-iron connected to
earth, in the side of which there was a quartz window.
Opposite to this was the insulated and electrified plate con
nected with an aluminium-leaf electroscope.         Since there
was no gauze placed in the way of the light rays, any elec
tricity escaping from the plate must be lost in the air or partly
pass to the side of the iron box, and from there pass to the
earth.
   So long as the plate was some distance (about 50 centim.)
from the quartz window, we also observed with this arrange
ment an increase of electric dispersion in light with a negative
charge. But if the plate is brought to within a few centi
metres of the window, and, consequently, near to the box, it
may happen, if the surface of the plate is covered with tallow
or with paraffin, that a positive charge decreases in light more
rapidly than a negative charge. # here, as in the above
discussed analogous case, it is to be remembered that the
positive charge of the plate collects negative electricity upon
the side of the box turned towards it by induction; if there
fore this surface is struck by the ultra-violet light reflected
from the surface of the layer of fat, a passage of negative
electricity from it to the plate must result, and give the
same effect as if a photoelectric dispersion of positive elec
tricity from it had taken place.
   This suspicion was converted into certainty by the obser
vation that the phenomenon is dependent upon the nature of

           Scattering of Positive Electricity by Light.          443
the surface of the bow. If this is covered with bright metal—as
tin-foil—the transference of electricity largely increases, and
becomes strikingly great if a piece of amalgamated zinc is
placed upon it.
   Since Herr Branly gives no information as to the distance
of the illuminated plate from the quartz window of the metal
box, we may consider it not improbable that this was chosen
too small, and that the dispersion of positive electricity
observed by him in ultra-violet light was caused by the
deceptive action of the light reflected from the surface of the
electrified disk.
   We believe that we are justified, by the results of the
experiments described, in asserting that an increase in the
dispersion of positive electricity by illumination of the elec
trified surface by ultra-violet light has not been proved.
   The striking inability of surfaces of alkali-metal to retain a
charge of negative electricity in ordinary light might suggest
that a possible action of light with a positive charge might be
expected to take place most readily with such surfaces. As
we have mentioned in a previous paper*, exhausted glass
globes of which the one electrode is formed by an alkali
metal, the other by platinum, also allow a photoelectric
current to be observed in more or less distinct manner when
 they are reversed, i. e. when the alkali-metal forms the
positive pole. But we had also arrived at the conclusion that
 in this case the photoelectric action had its seat not at the
 surface of the alkali-metal, but at the platinum electrode.
 There is, in fact, formed upon the platinum a superficial layer
by condensation of the vapours of the alkaline metal from
 which in light negative electricity passes to the anode. By
 heating the platinum wire with a galvanic current this layer
 is volatilized, and the photoelectric cell becomes—in its
 reversed arrangement—for a short time insensitive to light.
    When we recently repeated this experiment with better
 arrangements and greater care, we found that after the wire
 had been heated there remained a small amount of sensitive
 ness to light, which, perhaps, had its origin in a scattering of
 positive electricity from the surface of the alkali-metal. It
 seemed important to determine the seat of this action without
 doubt, whether anode or kathode.
    We started from the observation that the current as usually
 produced by illumination of the kathode is dependent upon
 the position of the plane of polarization of the incident light
 with respect to the surface of the kathodef. It was to be

expected that any discharge possibly produced by light at
the anode would also be in some way dependent upon the
direction of the light-vibrations toward the surface of the
anode. The experiments made in this direction gave, how
ever, a negative result: if we allowed a ray of light to
fall through a Nicol's prism upon the fluid surface of the
sodium-potassium alloy which formed the anode, and altered
the position of the plane of polarization by turning the Nicol,
we found the photoelectric dispersion to be independent of
the azimuth of the light.
   It must be remarked that in the “reversed” arrangement
of the cell here employed the current strength, even in strong
light, is far too small to give a measurable deflexion, even on
the very sensitive galvanometer which we employed to measure
the photoelectric currents. We therefore employed the same
method which we had used in the experiments upon ultra
violet light, i.e. we connected the alkali-metal surface with
the positive pole of the above-described battery, and the
opposed platinum electrode with the quadrant electrometer.
The passage of electricity through the cell betrayed itself
then by the constant increase in the deflexion of the electro
meter-needle. A constant condition of the instrument may
be attained by making an earth connexion through a very
large resistance (a pencil mark on an insulating surface) to
the wire leading to the electrometer.
   Not only does the fact that the transference of electricity
is not affected by change in the direction of the light-vibrations
with respect to the plane of the anode prove that the seat
of photoelectric action is not at the anode, but we have the
further evidence that this action is perceptibly increased if
the platinum wire which serves as kathode is exposed to the
direct action of the light. It even continues of the same
intensity when by inclining the bulb the alkali-metal is made to
flow over into the side bulb and is thus removed from the cell*.
   Since a clean platinum-wire in a vacuum shows no photo
electric action in ordinary light, its sensitiveness can only
have been communicated to it by contact with the alkali
metal or its vapour. As we see, the result of this experiment
also leads us to the conclusion that the light has acted not on
the anode of alkali-metal but on the platinum kathode made
sensitive by its superficial coating, and we might expect that
the “reversed” cell would lose its sensitiveness upon ignition
of the platinum wire. But, as we have said, this expectation
was, curiously enough, not verified by experiment. There

remained then only the supposition that the inner glass wall of
the bulb had become covered with a layer, by contact with
the alkali-metal, from which negative electricity escaped when
the light fell upon it. In order to remove this source of error
also the whole wall of the cell must be maintained at the
same potential as the anode of alkali-metal, so that there could
be no fall of potential from it to the wall. We attained this
result by covering the outside of the bulb with silver by pre
cipitation; with the exception of a small space where the
kathode-wire was melted into the bulb and a “window ’’ for
the entrance of the light.
    If now the alkali-metal surface and, with it, the glass wall
of the bulb was charged with positive electricity, and the
kathode-wire was connected to earth, then immediately after
ignition of the wire no loss of electricity occurred in light,
 not even when a beam of sunlight entered through the window
in the silver coating. Not until after some time, when the
 wire on cooling had again covered itself with a coating of
alkali-metal, could the photoelectric discharge be again ob
 served with increasing distinctness.
    Thus the experiments with ordinary light on surfaces of
 alkali-metal in a vacuum lead to the same result as those with
 ultra-violet light, namely, that the photoelectric action is
 limited to the kathode.
    We have pleasure in gratefully acknowledging the assistance
 we have received in this work from the Elizabeth Thompson
 Science Fund in Boston.
 XLVII. The Tinfoil Grating Detector for Electric Waves. By
    T. MIZUNO, Rigakushi, Professor of Physics, First Higher
    Schools, Tokio".
 § 1.  IN   a papert, which not long since I communicated to
            this Journal, I suggested that the change of the
 resistance of the grating might be due to a mechanical effect
 exerted upon it by impinging trains of electric waves. In
 other words, electric waves might give impulses to some of
 the strips of the grating in such a way as to let leaflets on
 their margins come in contact with one another, thereby
 causing a diminution of resistance. In order to confirm this
 view, further inquiries were carried out soon after the com
 munication of the above-mentioned paper.

    § 2. Having constructed about forty gratings and tested
their action, I found to my surprise that while some were
extremely sensitive, others were not, being even utterly
indifferent to the impulses of electric waves, although the
had all been prepared with the same care and apparently wit
the same success.
   This led me to undertake a closer examination of such
gratings, which gave results that throw much light upon
their nature. But before these results can be stated, it is
necessary to describe in detail my way of preparing the
gratings, because upon that their sensibility wholly depends.
   § 3. The face of a flat wooden block of convenient size, say
10 centim. on a side, was pasted over with very fine tinfoil, as
described in my former paper.
   Then came cutting lines into the tinfoil, to which particular
attention was given. Along the edge of a bamboo ruler a
sharp knife, held always inclined away from the ruler, was
drawn lightly across the surface of the tinfoil. In this way

line, as shown in fig. 1.
   A few of the gratings, thus carefully pre
pared, were found to be sensitive.               But
experience has taught me that success in
preparing good detectors depends, to a large
extent, upon the nature of the wood block on
which the tinfoil is pasted in the first place,
and next upon the degree of adhesion of the
foil to the wood. A soft wood is preferable
to a hard one, and the paste used should not
be thick enough to make the foil adhere too firmly.
   §4. The majority of the slits of the sensitive gratings, when
examined under a microscope, presented such an appearance
as that shown in fig. 2. A B and CD represent
two strips of foil with the very narrow slit or gap       Fig. 2.

the tinfoil found at one edge of each strip.
   For the sake of clearness, there is shown in
fig. 3 an end view, that is, a section of the two
strips perpendicular to their lengths. The shaded
portions indicate the tinfoil strips, A B and CD in
fig. 2, of which the edge of one strip, CD, extends
some distrance into the gap, a b, and forms the

that the gaps £ be narrow and their margins sloped and
in folds.
    § 5. Although I have been unable to see clearly the interior
of a gap, yet it is quite reasonable to assume that in sensitive
gratings there will be numbers of leaflets along the margins
of adjacent tinfoil strips; and the existence of such leaflets
 once admitted, the explanation of the action of the gratings
becomes clear. For in a properly constructed grating some
of the leaflets may easily come in contact with one another
under the action of the electric waves, because of the extremely
 small distance between any two opposite leaflets in the narrow
 gap. Then, too, it seems to me that these leaflets must be of
 various dimensions and, accordingly, some of them will be
 extremely sensitive, others less so but still highly sensitive,
 others again only moderately so. This being the case, the
 amount of change in the resistance of the grating must depend
 upon the intensity of energy of the impinging electric
 oscillations, for, when it is not great enough, only the most
 sensitive leaflets will come into play, but when it is sufficiently
 great all the effective leaflets will be brought into action.
 All the experiments I have yet made are in agreement with
 this representation of the matter.
    § 6. A grating, well prepared so as to fulfil the conditions
 mentioned above, proves to be an extremely sensitive detector
 for electric waves, as will be seen from the experiments which
 I now describe.
    Eaperiment 1. A Hertzian parabolic vibrator, ABC, was
 placed horizontally with aperture turned upwards, as shown
 in fig. 4. The aperture was
 covered with a sufficiently large              Fig. 4.
 wooden plate, ADC, entirely
 coated with tinfoil. A grating,
 whose initial resistance was about
 71 ohms, was placed at about
 5 centim. from the plate and in
 a vertical line with the primary
 conductor, O, radiating electric                  E.
 waves of 60 centim.wave-length.
 Then, exciting the primary oscillations, I always found that

448             T. Mizuno on the Tinfoil Grating
the resistance of the grating was diminished by from 1 to
nearly 2 ohms.
   The experiment was repeated after raising the plate, ADC,
parallel to itself and   £          it at some height from the
aperture, A.C. Similar changes of resistance were also ob
served in this case. This phenomenon may of course be
understood by considering the fact that some electric waves,
which pass out of the uncovered portions of the parabolic
vibrator, will, after going through the room and being reflected
from the surrounding walls, ceilings, &c., come back ultimately
to the grating in a much enfeebled state.
   Experiment 2. The above experiment was modified by
placing on the plate, ADC, a
 zinc box, a b c d, 17 centim. by                Fig. 5.
 27 centim., without top or bottom
 and putting the grating inside it.
 In this case also, a change of
 resistance was observed, though
 smaller.   It is then certain that
 although the side effects were
 got rid of, the top effect still
 remained, through which traces
 of waves might affect the re
 sistance of the grating.      The
 fact that we can annul the change of resistance by completely
 closing the top of the box with a metallic plate, seems especially
 to favour the above explanation.
    Experiment 3. The grating was connected with the Wheat
 stone bridge by means of two leading wires, and at the same
 time placed inside the zinc box, just as in Exp. 2. After
 balance had been well established and the top of the box closed,
 the primary oscillations were excited. This time, the balance
 was at once destroyed and the resistance of the grating showed
 an appreciable diminution, in spite of the fact of the grating
 being wholly enclosed in a metallic box. Taking away one
 of the leading wires the phenomenon yet remained the same,
 though the change of resistance seemed somewhat smaller
 than in the former case. The leading wires thus appeared to
 catch up electric oscillations and guide them to the grating.
 Hence in experiments with electric waves it is necessary to
 keep the grating free from any exposed wires, which might
 easily take up electric disturbances. Such effects due to
 leading wires were observed also by Herr Aschkinass during
 his researches with these gratings.
    § 7. To what extent the sensibility of the grating reaches

                     Detector for Electric Waves.               449
 will now be quite clear from the results of the above experi
 ments. It is next of great importance to describe some
 experiments as to the variation of the sensibility. In its
 primitive state, the grating properly constructed is so sensi
 tive that it can detect even the smallest electric oscillations.
 But after having been used a few times, its sensibility under
 goes a sudden and decided diminution, and then remains
 nearly constant. At first, when the grating is exposed to
 electric waves and its resistance consequently diminished, a
 single tap given to it is almost enough to restore the resistance
 to its initial or primitive value. But when we have used the
 grating repeatedly, we find it necessary to give it a greater
 number of taps to effect this restoration. Later on, when the
 sensibility has diminished to a certain value, it seems to retain
 that value without any decided further change for a long time.
 This variation in the sensibility may be accounted for in the
 following way:—As mentioned in § 5, the effective leaflets
 along the margins of the several tinfoil strips may be of
 different sizes, and some of them possibly very small. The
 smaller the leaflets the more sensitive to electric disturbances,
 and consequently the more liable to fatigue will they be.
 Hence in the primitive state such leaflets are easily affected
 by even very weak electric impulses, but soon lose this
 sensibility as a result both of the repeated electric distur
 bances and of the mechanical taps given to them each time.
    $ 8. Though the sensibility of the grating thus always
diminishes to a certain extent by a little use, still it is even
in such a state far superior to that of an ordinary Hertzian
resonator. Even where the latter fails, the grating always
shows the presence of electric waves if there be any. Experi
ments on the nature of electric waves, namely, on rectilinear
propagation, reflexion, refraction, diffraction, polarization, &c.,
can all be easily carried on by means of a properly constructed
grating. Moreover, such a grating gives not only qualitative,
but also quantitative results, to a certain extent, because the
amount of diminution of the resistance depends upon the
quantity of energy of the impinging waves. Hence, I believe,
it may prove to be of great advantage to make use of such
gratings in all lecture experiments as well as in laboratory
researches on electric waves.
   In conclusion I wish to express my thanks to Mr. U.
Takashima for the kind and earnest assistance he has given
me in the preparation of many of these gratings and in carry
ing out researches upon them.

             XLVIII. Carbon and Oxygen in the Sun.
                      By JoHN TRowBRIDGE*.
   N 1887 Professor Hutchins, of Bowdoin College, and
     myself brought forward evidence to show that the peculiar
bands of the voltaic-arc spectrum of carbon can be detected in
the sun’s spectrum. They are, however, almost obliterated by
the overlying absorption-lines of other metals, especially by the
lines due to iron.      In order to form an idea of the amount of
iron in the atmosphere of the sun which would be necessary
to obliterate the banded spectra of carbon, I have compared
the spectrum of carbon with that of carbon dust, and a defi
nite proportion of iron distributed uniformly through it. The
carbon dust and iron reduced by hydrogen was formed into
pencils suitable for forming the arcf. Chemical analysis
showed that the iron was uniformly mixed with the carbon
dust; specimens taken from different sections of the terminals
showed in the carbons which I burned in the electric arc
28 per cent of iron and 72 per cent. of carbon.
    The method of experimenting was as follows:—That por
tion of the spectrum of the sun which contains traces of the
peculiar carbon band lying at wave-length 3883:7, and which
had been almost obliterated by the lines of absorption of other
metals, among them those of iron, was photographed. The
pure carbon banded spectrum was photographed on the same
plate immediately below the solar spectrum, and the spectrum
of the mixture of iron and carbon immediately below this.
The sun's spectrum can be regarded as a composite photo
graph, and the iron and carbon can also be regarded as a
composite photograph. It was speedily seen that from 28 to
30 per cent. of iron in combination with 72 to 70 per cent. of
carbon almost completely obliterated the peculiar banded
spectrum of carbon. This proportion, therefore, of iron in
the atmosphere of the sun, were there no vapours of other
metals present, would be sufficient to prevent our seeing the
full spectrum of carbon.
   The iron in the carbon terminals which I employed greatly
increased the conductivity, as will be seen from £ I.,
which was obtained in the following manner.
    The carbons were separated by means of a micrometer
screw, and the current and difference of potential were mea

   The length of the arc could be nearly doubled with the
same current and the same voltage by the admixture of 28 per
cent. of iron. The light was apparently greatly increased,
but the difference in colour between the pure carbon light
and the iron-carbon light made measurements unreliable.
   Moissan” has shown that the carbon in an electric oven
through which powerful electric currents have flowed is free
from foreign admixtures. Deslandres has confirmed this,
and finds only a trace of calcium present. The self purification
comes from a species of distillation of the volatile impurities.
The purest carbon is found at the negative pole. The
light of the electric furnace is due to the combustion of
carbon.     Can we conclude that the sun is a vast electric
furnace P

452             Prof. J. Trowbridge on Carbon
brilliancy diminishes greatly. On the other hand, an atmo
sphere of oxygen greatly augments its vividness. The question
therefore whether oxygen exists in the sun is closely related
to questions in regard to the presence of carbon, when we
consider the temperature and light of the sun.
    If suppositions also are made in regard to the magnetic
condition of the atmosphere of the sun, it is of great interest
to determine whether oxygen exists there, for oxygen has
been shown by Faraday, and later by Professor Dewar, to be
strongly magnetic.                     -
    Professor Henry Draper brought forward evidence to prove
 the existence of bright oxygen lines in the solar spectrum.
 Professor Hutchins, of Bowdoin College, and myself examined
 this evidence, and after a long study of the oxygen spectrum
 in comparison with the solar spectrum, came to the conclusion
 that the bright lines of oxygen could not be distinguished in
 the solar spectrum. We published our paper in 1885. I have
 lately studied the subject from another standpoint; having
 carefully examined the regions in the solar spectrum where
 the bright lines of oxygen should occur, if they manifest
themselves, in order to see if any of the fine absorption-lines of
iron in the spectrum of iron were absent, for it is reasonable to
 suppose that the bright nebulous lines of oxygen would
obliterate the faintest lines of iron.
    The method adopted by Draper for obtaining the spectrum
of oxygen consisted in the employment of a powerful spark
in ordinary air. To obtain this spark, the current from a
dynamo running through the primary of a Ruhmkorf coil was
suitably interrupted. By the use of an alternating machine
and a step-up transformer, powerful sparks can be more
readily obtained. Since the time of exposure with a grating
of large dispersion is long, considerable heat is developed in
the transformer from the strong currents which are necessary
to produce a spark of sufficient brilliancy. I have therefore
modified the method in the following manner. The spark
gap is enclosed in a suitable chamber, which can be exhausted.
When the exhaustion is pushed to a certain point, the length
of the spark can be increased ten or twenty times over its
length in air, and a suitable spark for photographic purposes
can therefore be obtained by the employment of far less energy
in the transformer. A pressure of eight to ten inches of
mercury in the exhausted vessel is sufficient. A quartz lens
inserted in the wall of the exhausted chamber serves to focus
the light of the spark on the slit of the spectroscope.

lines in the same region of the spectrum :

 The faintest iron lines are therefore not obliterated in the
 spaces where the oxygen lines should occur.
   If we examine the great absorption region about the K
line, we find that between wave-lengths 3930'29 and 3938:55
 Rowland gives eight lines which coincide with iron lines.
   From the table of wave-lengths of iron lines in the arc
 spectrum given in the Report of the British Association for
 1891, I find the following lines given between these limits:—
                                3930-37 %
                                3931-22 %

                               3938-59
   The starred lines are probably the iron lines given by
Rowland in his list of standard solar lines.    The iron lines
that are not starred apparently are obliterated in the great
absorption-band near the calcium line K.

454        H. Nagaoka and E. T. Jones on the Effects
   Lord Salisbury, in his address before the British Association
at Oxford, 1894, remarks:—“Oxygen constitutes the largest
portion of the solid and liquid substance of our planet, so far
as we know it; and nitrogen is very far the predominant
constituent of our atmosphere. If the earth is a detached bit
whirled off the mass of the sun, as cosmogonists love to tell
us, how comes it that in leaving the sun we cleaned him out
so completely of his nitrogen and oxygen that not a trace of
these gases remains behind to be discovered even by the
sensitive vision of the spectroscope?”
   Although we have not succeeded in detecting oxygen in
the sun, it seems to me that the character of its light, the
fact of the combustion of carbon in its mass, the conditions
for the incandescence of the oxides of the rare earths which
exist, would prevent the detection of oxygen in its uncombined
state. Notwithstanding the negative evidence which I have
brought forward, I cannot help feeling strongly that oxygen
is present in the sun and that the sun's light is due to carbon
vapour in an atmosphere of oxygen.

XLIX. On the Ffects of Magnetic Stress in Magnetostriction.
            By H. NAGAOKA and E. TAYLOR JonEs”.
       ATHEMATICAL expressions for electric and magnetic
         stresses were given first by Maxwell in his ‘Electricity
and Magnetism. In Art. 105 of this treatise the values are
found of stresses in a dielectric medium, which may be re
 garded as producing the observed electric action between two
 systems; in Art. 644 corresponding expressions are found
 for a magnetic medium. The expressions in the two cases
 are, however, not similar; i.e. the electric stress in a dielectric
 cannot be deduced from the magnetic stress in a magnetic
 substance simply by substituting specific inductive capacity
 for magnetic permeability. It does not seem quite clear
 whether Maxwell intended his expressions to apply to the case
 of induced as well as rigid magnetization.
    In 1881, v. Helmholtzf published expressions for the stresses
 which are more general than those of Maxwell, since they
 contain terms depending on possible changes of density in
 the medium. These expressions were assumed to have the
 same form for a dielectric as for a temporarily magnetized
 substance, but not necessarily for a permanent magnet; and if

 cluding in his equations terms depending on elongations in
the direction of the electric or magnetic force, as well as
terms depending on the change of density. The fundamental

where u, v, w are the component displacements of a particle

nature of the medium. It is to be noticed that the quantities
in the brackets are nearly equal to the susceptibility, because
the elongations and change of volume are considered to be
very small. From these and the principle of Conservation of
Energy, Kirchhoff deduces his general expressions (in Max

These expressions reduce to those of v. Helmholtz if it be
assumed that K'=0, and to those of Maxwell for electric

in iron is a quantity which may amount to 10" for moderate
magnetizations, so that in this case K is quite negligible
in comparison with one or both of the two other coefficients.
    The preponderating influence exercised by these latter factors
 will, perhaps, explain the existence of a maximum elongation
 in iron and the continual contraction in nickel.                Maxwell's
 expressions for magnetic stress (Art. 644), in the case when
 B and H have the same direction, are, however, apparently
 by a coincidence deduced from the above expressions of
 Kirchhoff by putting K’’=0, K'=K=susceptibility.
     About the same time Lorberg" and J. J. Thomsont discussed
 the present problem in a manner similar to that of Kirchhoff.
 More recently Hertzi arrived at expressions of precisely the
 same form as those given by v. Helmholtz. In comparing
 his expressions with those given by Maxwell for the general
 case of a magnet in which the induction and magnetic force
 have different directions, Hertz says (p. 281):—
     “A difference of far greater importance (i.e. than the effect
 of a change of density by electromagnetic strain) is that in
 Maxwell's theory the tangential stresses P, and P, have
 different values, while in our theory they are identical.
  Under our system of stresses every material element, when
 left to itself, will only change its shape; under that of
 Maxwell it will also experience a rotation as a whole. The
 Maxwellian stresses cannot therefore arise from processes in
 the interior of the element, and can have no place in the
 present theory. They are, however, admissible on the assump
  tion that in the interior of the body in motion, the aether
  remains at rest and furnishes the necessary fulcrum for the
  rotation which takes place.”.                  . .   .
      In attempting to calculate the change of dimensions of a
  body due to magnetization we are at once placed face to
  face with the question as to whether these stresses actually

     Hertz, speaking of equation (6c), p. 284, which is obtained as a
  simplified form of stress agreeing in the general case with that found  '
   y. Helmholtz, says that the stress is the same as that given by Maxwe l
   in Art, 642 of the treatise. His expression, however, is not that given in
   Art. 642 but in Art, 105,

exist in the body, or whether they, existing in a medium in
which the particles of the body are imbedded, produce modi
fied stresses in the body.
    Kirchhoff supposed the surface tractions acting on a piece
of magnetized soft iron to be the same as if the stresses P.
actually existed in the iron and in the surrounding air, where
K, K’, K" are put =0, and proceeded to calculate the changes
in the dimensions of a soft iron sphere placed in a uniform
magnetic field, due to a system of stresses which satisfy the
ordinary equations of an elastic solid and at the surface of
 the sphere have the above given values.
    Having obtained the general solution for the strain of a
sphere, Kirchhoff gives a numerical example, neglecting the
terms affected with (K-K') and K", supposing these quan
tities to be very small in comparison with K”. Kirchhoff's final
value for the elongation of a soft iron sphere is therefore pre
 cisely the same as that which would be given by Maxwell's
 system of stresses (Art. 644).
    Proceeding exactly on the lines of Kirchhoff, Cantone”
 has calculated the variations öl and öv of length and volume
 of a soft iron ellipsoid of revolution, and finds that for an
 ellipsoid of great eccentricity and length l,

 the changes of length and volume of a soft iron ellipsoid due

     The change of length of a soft-iron ellipsoid has, however,
been investigated over a much greater range of field-intensities
by one of us*, and the results represented by curves as
functions of magnetizing force, of the square of mag
netization, and of the former, respectively. If the change
of length due to Kirchhoff’s system of stresses be calculated
from Cantone's formula, and the result subtracted from the
observed change of length, these curves (K' and K" being pro
visionally disregarded) assume the forms shown in figs. 1, 2, 3.
    Since the coefficients K' and K" are not known with any
accuracy, for the iron used, the correction due to them cannot
at present be calculated. The ordinates of the full-line curves
 represent therefore the changes of length produced by uniform
magnetization, corrected on Kirchhoff’s theory for the partial
stresses represented by terms containing H and K, which
 were measured at the same time. The residual change of
 length, represented by the ordinates in figs. 1, 2, 3, must be
 due to the other unknown terms in the expressions for the
 stresses, or to some change of molecular arrangement accom
 panying the magnetization.
     A similar process was followed by Moret, who measured
the change of length of part of an iron wire magnetized by a
coil. It was assumed, however, that there existed in the wire
              •           B2                 •             •           •
a contracting stress 87r' the reason given for this assumption
 being that if the wire were cut in two, the two ends would
be held together by a force        # per unit area.        Now, accord
ing both to Maxwell's theory and to that of Kirchhoff, the
tension in a narrow air-gap in the wire is               #,     and this
has been experimentally verified by one of us over a large
range of magnetizing fieldt; but both theories give different
values for the stress inside the iron.          Even if the wire were
cut2
      in two, the force holding the parts together would not be
E. Per unit area unless the coil were also cut into two parts,
into   which the pieces of wire were rigidly fixed, so that part
of the '" tractive force is due to the mutual attraction of the
two coils.

ON AN ELECTROCHEMICAL ACTION OF THE RöNTGEN RAYS ON
       SILVER BROMIDE.       BY PROF. D.R. FRANZ STREINITZ.
To      Röntgen we are indebted for his great discovery of the
      property of the a-rays of exciting fluorescence and producing
chemical reductions on a photographic plate. According to his
previous experiments, these properties are the only ones which the
rays have in common with those of light. Now light alters not
only the electromotive deportment, but also the conductivity of
the silver haloids. The proofs of this were furnished by
Becquerel and Svante Arrhenius. It can therefore scarcely be
doubted that electrochemical changes will be produced by the
Röntgen rays; of course it is a different question whether they
will be accessible to observation.
   Experiments were made in both directions.           In order to
establish the fact of a change in the conductivity, a method used
by Arrhenius (Wiener Berichte, vol. xcvi. p. 831, 1887) was
adopted. On a glass tube a silver wire was wound bifilar,
and then coated with ammoniacal solution of silver chloride.
After the ammonia and water had been evaporated, the glass tube
was then placed in a light-tight box, out of which the ends of
the wire projected. These ends were connected with a source
of electricity and a very sensitive galvanometer (Thomson
Carpentier). The deflexion in the galvanometer showed variations
when discharges were passed through a Hittorf's tube near to the
box. These, however, were manifestly due to inductive actions
on the galvanometer circuit. For when the induced circuit was
open, an increase in the deflexion could not with certainty be
established—as ought to be the case, since there was an increase
of the conducting power—in comparison with the deflexion
which was obtained before the discharge was set up.
   Experiments on the influence on electromotive behaviour were
attended with better success. A square platinum-foil, 2 cm. in the
side, was coated electrolytically with an exceedingly thin layer of

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            463
silver bromide. Combined in dilute potassium-bromide solutions
with a standard electrode, the electrode in question showed
sensitiveness to light.      This is easily proved with the help of
a quadrant electrometer (Luggin, Ostwald's Zeitschrift für phys.
Chemie, xiv. p. 387, 1894). A candle placed at a distance of 25
cm. from the electrode produced in half an hour a diminution of
0.022 W. in the electromotive force of the combination
           Zn/Zn SO, aq+K, SO, aq+BrKaq+Br Ag/Pt.
    At the same time it is to be remembered that the light only struck
one side of the platinum-foil, while the other, which was also
 sensitized, remained dark. If now a carefully enclosed discharge
tube through which induction-sparks passed was substituted for
 the candle, a diminution in the electromotive force could also be
observed. With a small induction-coil the change amounted to
 0.017 volt in the course of 45 minutes, and in another experi
 ment with a larger induction-coil to 0.019 in 40 minutes.
    By a corresponding increase in the delicacy of the method, the
 electrochemical deportment of Röntgen rays may possibly furnish
 a more convenient method of investigating them than that with
 the help of photography.—Wiener Berichte Feb. 6, 1896.
    TRIANGULATION BY MEANS OF THE CATHODE PHOTOGRAPHY.
                        BY JOHN TROWBRIDGE.
    Photography by means of the Röntgen rays seems already to be
 of great importance in examining certain portions of the human
 body to determine the presence of metallic bodies, calcareous
 formations, and fragments of glass. The shadow pictures as they
 are taken at present, however, do not give the approximate
 position of the shots, for instance, embedded in the flesh. They
 indicate only the line in which they are situated. It occurred to
 me that the principles of triangulation could be applied with
 success to determine more exactly the position of the metallic
 particles. I was led to this conclusion by considering Rumford's
 photometer. This instrument, it is well known, consists merely
  of a vertical rod placed opposite a suitable screen of white paper.
  The two lights, the intensities of which are to be compared, are
 placed in a fixed position, and throw two shadows of the rod on
 the screen. From a measurement of the positions of the lights
  when shadows of equal intensity are thrown on the screen, an
  extinction of the brightness of the lights can be obtained. More
  over, by measuring the distance between the shadows, and by
  drawing lines from them to the lights, the position of the rod
 throwing the shadows can be determined. This position is
  evidently at the intersection of these lines.
     I have used two Crookes' tubes with two terminals making an
  angle with each other, and have employed a to-and-fro excitation
 by means of a Tesla coil. A suitable screen of glass shielded the
  sensitive plate first from one cathode and then from the other.
 From the distance between the shadow pictures of a shot, for
 instance, on the back of the hand and from the position of the

  464          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 terminals, the height of the shot above the sensitive plate could be
 estimated. It seems to me that this method promises to be of
 importance in the surgery of the extremities of the body; for the
 question whether to make an incision from the palm of a child's
 hand or from the back of the hand is an important one. Stereo
 scopic pictures can also be obtained.
    The use of a Tesla coil in obtaining shadow pictures is advan
 tageous in certain respects, for by changing the size of the spark
gap in the primary circuit of the Tesla coil one has a great range
 of electrical energy at command. This range can be still further
 increased by putting the spark-gap in a magnetic field. I have
 taken such pictures in less than a minute, showing the bones in
the fingers. The tubes were, at first, destroyed by disruptive
 sparks over the surface of the tube which apparently penetrated
 the glass between the platinum terminals and the glass. I have
 lately discovered, however, that if the terminals of the tube are
 placed in a vessel filled with paraffin oil, and if the oil is kept cool by
an outside vessel filled with snow or ice, the entire energy developed
by the Tesla coil can be employed, and the tubes are not destroyed.
   I have tried wooden lenses, both double convex and double
concave, in order to see whether the rays travel slower or faster
in wood than in air, but my results are negative. A copper ring
placed on a double convex lens of wood of approximately six inches
focus, and one also on a concave lens of the same radius as the
surfaces of the double convex lens, gave shadow pictures of the
ring which were of the same size and character as those of an
equal copper ring placed in air at the same distance from the
sensitive plate.
   We naturally turn to Maxwell's great treatise on Electricity and
Magnetism, to see if a hint of this new phenomenon cannot be
found there: for I believe there is no manifestation of electro
magnetism since the death of Maxwell which has not been
predicted or treated by him in one form or another in his
remarkable book.        In section 792, vol. ii. of the treatise on
Electricity and Magnetism, he says:—“Hence the combined effect
of the electrostatic and the electrokinetic stresses is a pressure
equal to 2p in the direction of the propagation of the wave. Now
2p also expresses the whole energy in unit of volume. Hence in
a medium in which waves are propagated there is a pressure in
the direction normal to the waves, and numerically equal to the
energy in unit of volume. Thus, if in strong sunlight the energy
of the light which falls on one square foot is 83.4 foot-pounds per
second, the mean energy in one cubic foot of sunlight is about
0.0000000882 of a foot-pound, and the mean pressure on a square
foot is 0.0000000882 of a pound weight. A flat body exposed to
sunlight would experience this pressure on its illuminated side
only, and would therefore be repelled from the side on which light
falls. It is probable that a much greater energy of radiation
might be obtained by means of the concentrated rays of the
electric lamp. Such rays falling on a thin metallic disk, delicately
suspended in a vacuum, might perhaps produce an observable
mechanical effect.”—American Journal of Science, March, 1896.

                        By SILAs W. HoLMAN."
IN this paper are collected the several well-known types of
      formulae for expressing the thermal electromotive force
of a couple as a function of the temperature of its junctions,
Two new formulae are also proposed. All then are tested
against the most reliable experimental data upon the subject,
and their relative merits discussed.
                      The Evisting Formulae.
    Jonsider a simple closed electric circuit composed of two
different metals, each homogeneous in matter and temper,
the metals being in contact at two points. For simplicity,
assume the metals to be in the form of wires joined at their
ends. Let one junction be at a temperature of h”, the other
of c”, on the ordinary Centigrade scale. Let X'e be employed
as a suggestive symbol to denote the resultant electromotive
force in the circuit, induction being excluded from considera
tion. Then X e is a function of h and c which involves
constants dependent upon the nature of the metals, and which
may be represented by
                             X: e=f(h, c).
The discovery of the natural expression for f (h, c) is not only

of scientific importance, but is urgently needed in the develop
ment of the art of pyrometry. At present even a satisfactory
empirical formula for interpolation is lacking, the best still
 being probably that of Avenarius and Tait,
     The existing formulae are the five following :
     Ordinary or parabolic :
                       X' e=at +bt” +ct'+ . . . . . (1)
     This is, of course, merely a series in ascending powers of t,
 where one junction is at any temperature t°C., and the other
 at 0°C., a, b, and c being constants. A more general form
 for the case where the cold junction is at any constant tem
  perature, ti°, is
             X', e=a(t-ti)+b(*-ti”)+c(t'-ti") + . . .
  These expressions may, of course, be inverted, giving t as a
  function of X e.                         -

   “neutral point.”

   obviously reduce to the Avenarius form.

    where e, represents the thermal E.M.F. of the hot junction
    and e. that of the cold junction.    In view, however, of the
    existence of the Thomson effect, these symbols can strictly be
    interpreted only as having the meaning that e, -e =>'e.
         Note.—With regard to the Avenarius, Thomson, and Tait
    expressions, it may be remarked that they are not onl
    mutually equivalent, but that if t, or T. becomes 0°C, they
    reduce at once to the ordinary parabolic form of two terms:
      -                        X'e=at +bt”.
    They are all, therefore, forms which must apply if the latter

 purely empirical expression for the same temperature ranges
 applies, and with the same closeness, so that it is unnecessary
 to test more than one of the first four expressions against any
 one set of data.   Also the fact that the Avenarius and Tait
 equations approximately conform to the observed data does
 not necessarily in any material degree strengthen the hypo
 theses which are adduced to show that these equations are a
 natural expression of the law.
    Without attempting here a further analysis of the com
ponents making up the resultant E.M.F. X'e, which is the
 measured E.M.F. of the thermo-couple, the proposed interpo
 lation formulae will be merely developed and applied. It
 may, however, be suggested in passing, that there seems to
 the writer to be little hope of arriving at a close approxima
 tion to the natural law except through an expression which
 shall contain separate terms representing the temperature
 function of the component arising at the contact of the
 dissimilar metals, and that arising from the inequality of
 temperature of the ends of each (homogeneous) element
 (Thomson E.M.F.). The parabolic and Avenarius formulae
 would comply in part with this requirement on the supposi
tion that the E.M.F. at contact varied as the first power, and
 the Thomson E.M.F. in both wires as the square of the
 temperature. And looked at from that point of view, the
 neutral point would seem to have an explanation materially
different from that usually accorded to it.
                    The Proposed Formula.
   Evponential Equation.—The significance of this proposed
expression may be thus stated. Suppose the cold junction of
the couple be maintained at the absolute zero of temperature,
T=0°, and its E.M.F. to be consequently zero. Let the other
(hot) junction be at any temperature T,” absolute. The pro
prosed equation is based on the assumption that the total
E.M.F of the couple would then be representable by
                            e'=mt.
where m and n are numerical constants.         If then the cold
junction were raised to any temperature T.", there would be
introduced an opposing E.M.F. e", which would be expressible
by                         e"= mT".
The resultant E.M.F 2:e would then be e-e", and there
fore expressible by                      -
                       X'e=mt:-mr:. . . . . . . (6)

If in any instance, as is frequently the case in measurements,
the temperature of the cold junction is maintained constant
while that of the hot junction varies, then mt: becomes a
constant, and it will be convenient to denote this constant by
£ when r=273° abs. =0° C.         So that for this special case
where the cold junction is at 0°C, and the hot junction at
t°C., we have
                            X'e=mt"–8. . . . . . . (7)
    This expression is not advanced as a possible natural form
of the function f(h, c). It is essentially empirical, and is not
designed to account separately for the several distinct com
ponents entering into Xe. £ fact that it closely fits the
experimental data arises chiefly from the well known adapta
 bility of the exponential equation to represent limited portions
 of curved lines. The equation also leads to certain inferences
which appear inconsistent with the known thermo-electric
laws, and fails to explain some known phenomena.
    The evaluation of the constants m, n, and 8 is unfortunately
attended by considerable labour. No application of the method
of least squares readily presents itself, but by a method of
successive approximations the values can be obtained with any
 desired degree of exactitude. Only two measured pairs of
values of 25 e and t are necessary for this approximation
 method, the third required pair being furnished by X'e=0
 and t=0; although, of course, by the employment of three
 pairs of values well distributed in the data, a more closely
 fitting equation might frequently be obtained. The calibra
 tion of a thermo-couple for pyrometric work can thus be
 effected by the employment of but two known temperatures,
 and this, on account of the uncertainty of our knowledge of
 high melting-points, is of great importance in high tempera
 ture work.
    Let to =0°C., t', and t” be the selected observed tempera
 tures from which to compute the constant, so that To-273°,
 T'=t'+273°, t'=t"+273° abs. And let X'e=0, X'e, X'e,
 be the corresponding observed E.M.F's of the couple. Then,
 by substituting these in equation (7), and combining the
 three expressions, or their logarithms, we easily deduce

    By means of these the numerical values of the constants
may be calculated from those of T', t”, X'e, &c., as follows:–
    1. Assume as a first approximation some value of n, say n=1,
unless some better approximation is in some way suggested.
Substituting this value in (8), compute the corresponding
value of 8.
   2. Using this as a first approximation, substitute it in (9)
and compute the corresponding value of n.
   3. Using this value as a second approximation to n, insert
it in (8), and compute a second approximation to 8.
   4. With this compute a third approximation to n, and so
continue until consistent values of 8 and n are found to the
desired number of figures. Then compute m by (10).
   The rate of convergence is not rapid, but after one or two
approximations have been made an inspection of the rate will
enable the computer to estimate values of n which will be
nearer than the preceding approximation, and thus hasten the
computation.
   Where an equation is to be computed to best represent a
progressive series of observed values of t and X e, this method
is of course open to some objections, since it incorporates in
the constants the accidental errors of the selected observa
tions from which the constants are deduced. This difficulty
can be sufficiently overcome by computing residuals between
the equation and the data, and amending the equation if
necessary to give them a better distribution.
   Logarithmic Formula.—A very simple expression for inter
polation is of the general form
                              X'e=mt",
when m and n are constants. This serves fairly well for a
short range, t”—t', when tº-0° is not less than one third of
t’—t'.
   The convenience of the expression arises from two facts :
first, that its two constants are very easily evaluated either by
computation or graphically from the logarithmic expression
(whence the name)
                      log Že=nlog t-log m.
second, that its logarithmic plot is a straight line, since this

470          -     Prof. Silas W. Holman on
expression is the equation to a straight line if we regard
log X'e and log t as the variables. If, therefore, a series of
values of X e and t are known for a given couple, points
obtained by plotting log t as abscissas and log 2 eas ordinates
should lie along a straight line. Thus a couple may be com
pletely “calibrated” for all temperatures by measuring 2 e
and t for any two values of t (suitably disposed). The con
stants m and n may be computed, or a plot of log 2 e and log t
may be made, and a straight line be drawn through them:
Graphical interpolation on this line will then of course yield
 the values of log t and hence of t corresponding to observed
 values of X e, and vice versa, and, if desired, the constants
 m and n. The expression for t as a function of X e is of
 COurSe                                              1

                    t="Go", or =(#).
 This formula is well adapted to pyrometric work not of the
 very highest grade of accuracy, and has been advantageously
 employed in connexion with the Le Chatelier thermo-electric
 pyrometer in a method to be described in a later article.
                         Test of Formulae.
    This will be made by applying the several formulae to the
  experimental data of Barus, Holborn and Wien, Chassagny
 and Abraham, and Noll. These investigators employed
  modern methods of thermometry and of electrical measure
  ment. Temperatures are either made in or reduced to the
  scale of the hydrogen (C. & A.), or of the air thermometer
  (B., H. & W., N.).       Constants for the formulae will be
  deduced, and the residuals or deviations of the data from the
  equations (i.e. 8=data-equation) will be computed for the
  observed points. For discussion these deviations will be
                                        :
  expressed in percentages, viz. 100 rather than in micro
  volts or degrees. This is preferable because the process of
  measurement of the E.M.F., and to some extent at least of
  the temperature, is such as to yield results of a nearly constant
  fractional or percentage precision at all temperatures rather
  than of a constant number of microvolts or degrees. Thus by
  comparing percentages we eliminate a complication arising
  otherwise from the increasing value of 8 as t increases.
  Incidentally there are also other well recognized advantages
  £ attending the comparison of percentages rather
  than of absolute quantities. . .

with several porcelain bulb air-thermometers used under the
constant-pressure method.

are given by Barust later, as a basis from which to deduce

These constitute his “equation 3,” for which eo corresponds
to 20°C. The data and the deviations which I have computed
for it, viz. 8=data—equation, are given in Table I. The
last column gives the deviations expressed in percentages,
viz.,  100'.    where E=e+eo-H 1880. This value of E is
adopted to make the percentages comparable with those in
subsequent discussions. The number 1880 is 1730+ 150,
which are the values of e, and X'e of the next two pages.

    The lines AB and CD on the diagram (page 483),
 constructed with percentage deviations as ordinates and
 temperature as abscissas, show clearly that the deviations are
 systematic. Upon inspection of this plot it appears that the
 data may be separated into two groups, one including
 0°–300°, the other 400°-1000°, which appear to have entirely
 distinct forms of systematic error. This division corresponds
 to two distinct groups of data, one extending from 0° to 300°,
 the other including the second group and extending from
 350° to 1075°. The latter were given in the Bulletin as the
 final results of the high temperature comparisons of the irido
 platinum couple with porcelain bulb air thermometers. The
 detailed statement of the 0°–300° comparison I have not seen.
 Although the discrepancy between the two sets of systematic
 deviations is not extremely large, yet it has seemed to me
 that it is beyond the limits of concordance in the higher
 temperature work, and that it would be better for the present
 purpose to deal solely with the 350°-1075° data. Two points
 regarding Barus's work should be noticed: one the strikingly
 high degree of concordance between individual observations
 even with different thermometer bulbs and different thermo
 couples; the other the remark in which Barus notes a possi
 bility of being able still further to reduce the “stem error”
 entering into the result, which so far as I am aware has not
 yet been done.
     The high temperature air-thermometer comparisons (Bul
 letin, Series I., II, III., IV., and W.) of Barus are so
 numerous (108) and so distributed that the labour of utilizing
 them simply for deducing constants and testing an equation
  would be excessive. Also they are too concordant to permit
  interpolation on a direct plot without a sacrifice of some of
  their precision. For the purposes of discussion, therefore,
  I averaged them in nine groups. The first group contained
  all where the E.M.F. lay between 3000 and 4000 microvolts;
  the second group between 4000 and 5000 mv.; and so on by
  steps of 1000 microvolts, except that the seventh group
  covered 2000 my from 9000 to 11000. These groups were
  not exactly equal in number of observations, and therefore in
  weight, nor is the arithmetical average a strictly legitimate
  value where the function is not linear ; but, as easily seen by
  inspection of the originals, the errors thus introduced are
  negligible. In Table II. columns 1 and 2 give the direct
  values of the averages.       Column 3 reduces Xio e to X; e
  by adding 150 microvolts, the value of X'oe being elsewhere
  given by Barus as – 150 microvolts,          -      -    .

       Computing from this equation values of X'e for the
   successive values of t in column 1 and subtracting them
   from the data in column 3 gives the deviations between data
   and equation. These are expressed in microvolts in column
   4, and in percentages in column 5, the percentage being
   reckoned in terms of e, as deduced by the exponential formula.
   Objections may be felt to this use of eo (here as throughout
   the subsequent tables) as a basis, since e, involves eo which is
   an extrapolated value, certainly not exact, and possibly wide
   of the truth. Such a criticism is valid, but inasmuch as the
   values of eo employed are nearly equal, and as the percentage
   deviations are used merely for purposes of expressing relative
   accuracy, the possible error involved is nearly annulled.
   Hence, although it would be better to compute 8t, and express
   this as a percentage of the absolute temperature T, the added
   labour did not seem justified by the small gain,

 273°7 absolute, whereas in all subsequent tables 0°C. =273°0
 absolute is employed as a more probable value. The numerical
 values of the constants are therefore subject to a slight modi
 fication, but as for the present purpose we are concerned
 only with 8, which would not be sensibly changed, the
 recomputation is not worth while.]                             -

    The Barus Equation.—The excessive labour involved in
 the evaluation of the constants P, Q, P, and Q' of Barus's
 proposed equation detracts so seriously from its usefulness
that I have also allowed it to deter me from computing them
 for the above tabulated values. The comparison of the values
 of 8 for his “equation 3,” and for an approximate exponential
of my own based on the same data, is, however, decidedly in
favour of the latter.

    Holborn and Wien Data.—This important comparison * of
the rhodo-platinum thermo-couple with the porcelain bulb
air thermometer up to high temperatures was performed
under the auspices of the Reichsanstalt at Berlin, and appears
to be on the whole the most important and reliable contribu
tion to this subject in recent years. The experimental work
was evidently conducted with great care, and although not
showing the concordance of results, nor the multiplication
of observations of Barus's work, yet in respect to stem
exposure correction, to exposure of the thermal junction,
and to direct measurement of the coefficient of expansion of
the bulb, it is probably more free from systematic error. It
is to be regretted that the results were not more thoroughly
discussed, and that neither a chemical analysis nor even a

statement was given to indicate the reliability of the stated
percentage composition of the various alloys used. For when
closely examined, the data seem to indicate a definite relation
between the composition and the E.M.F., as was shown by a
relation discovered between the constants in my exponential
equations for the various alloys. The deviations were only
such as might be attributed to uncertainty of composition,
but as no measure of the latter was given, a statement of
 the relations and interesting inferences from them is not
warranted.        It is also unfortunate that an       analysis,   or at
 least a definite statement of the percentage purity, was not
 given for the gold, copper, and silver whose melting-points
 were observed. The assertion that the gold showed on
 qualitative analysis only a trace (“Spur”) of copper, and the
 silver a “trace” of iron, is hardly definite. The value of the
 whole work would have been enhanced by these additions far
 more than in proportion to the comparatively small labour
 demanded by them, and such completeness is naturally to be
 expected in work emanating from this source. It is to be
 hoped that a continuation of this research is in progress, and
 that additional high melting-points may be measured.
    Table III, columns 1 and 2, quotes the interpolated
 mean values of several comparisons expressed in international
  microvolts and degrees centigrade. With regard to these
  data it should be stated that below about 400° they were not
  supposed to be of as high accuracy as above that point. Also,
  that owing to unavoidable circumstances the data below 300°
  were obtained with only a single air-thermometer bulb, and
  similarly those above about 1300° with one bulb only, but a
  different one, while the data intermediate between 400° and
  1300° are the mean of observations with the two bulbs. This
  fact may partially account for the erratic character of the
  residuals above 1300°, where the deviations are so great and
  so distributed (see diagram, page 483) as to render these
  observations of very little service. Direct comparison with
  the air-thermometer was made with one 10 per cent rhodo
  platinum couple “A” only.                               -               -

in part offsets the disadvantage. Measurements of Xà e and t
were made with four thermo-couples, with the results shown
in Table VI. (international microvolts and degrees centi

    The Noll Data.—A contribution of much permanent value
to the data on thermo-electrics has recently been made by
 Noll*, who has measured X', e and t for thirty-two couples
over a range in most cases of 0° to 218°C. The metals em
ployed (including carbon) were usually of a high and stated
 degree of purity, and consisted of eighteen different sub
stances, two of which were alloys (german silver and brass),
and the remainder samples of different degrees of purity or
hardness of the pure substances. The couples contained, as
one element, for the most part, either copper or mercury.
Temperatures were reduced to the air-thermometer scale.
    The Avenarius formula was applied to fourteen of the more
 important of them by Noll. The deviations are given in
Table VIII.

 Table VIII, gives the constants for the exponential equation
 (those for the Avenarius may be found in Noll's article), the
 mean deviations (= data-equation) for each series, and the
 mean percentage deviations (= 100 8/e). (See remark as to
 use of e under “Barus Data.”) Table IX. groups the per
 centage deviations under their nearest values of t for exhi
 biting their systematic character. The fact that the experi
 mental method brought the observations all very nearly to
 the respective temperatures t given in the table renders this
 grouping possible. I have taken the liberty of correcting a
 few obvious numerical errors, and of dropping a very few
 values evidently containing a mistake.
    It may, perhaps, not be out of place here to caution those
 who would make use of Noll's data to their full accuracy that
 his original, and not his interpolated, numbers should be
 resorted to. The approximate linear interpolation which he
 has employed is not as accurate as his experimental data
 demand.

 typical of the Noll data yields

                    Discussion of the Deviations.
    Plots are given in the following diagram with temperatures
 as abscissas and percentage deviations between the data and
 the sundry equations as ordinates, i.e. 100 8/e where 6=data
 equation. Inspection will show that with one exception (viz.
 the logarithmic equation applied to the Barus data) these plots,
 whether the equation is the ordinary parabolic, the Avenarius,
 the Barus, the exponential, or the logarithmic, have the same
 general form, which may be imperfectly described as follows.
 If the equation be made to conform to the data at 0°C.
 and at two higher points, a and b, then the deviation will be
 of the negative sign from 0 to a, positive from a to b, and
 negative above b. The slight departures from this general
 form are clearly due either to accidental errors, or to failure
 to make the equation conform to the data at all three points,
 or at suitable ones.       The evidence is therefore conclusive

               Thermo-electric Interpolation Formulae.                          483
   that for all of the expressions the deviations are systematic and
   not purely “accidental ” in character.
      One of two inferences is therefore warranted :
      1. That neither the parabolic, Avenarius, Barus, exponential,
   nor logarithmic equation is the natural expression of the
   function.

      2. Or that the scale of temperature to which the values of t
   are referred in the foregoing investigations departs from the

484           -     Prof. Silas W. Holman on
normal scale by an amount and system roughly indicated by
the above residual plots.
   The latter inference, suggested by Chassagny and Abraham
in the interpretation of their results, does not seem to possess
much weight, notwithstanding the urgent need of renewed
elaborate experimental investigation of the relation between
the hydrogen, air, and thermodynamic scales of temperature.
   As to the relative usefulness of the various expressions for
purposes of interpolation and extrapolation some further
inspection is necessary. The Barus equation 3, line CD,
shows slightly smaller deviations on the plot than do the
Avenarius and exponential, lines E E and FF. This, how
ever, is due to the fact that the data against which 3 is
tested are mean interpolated values, and hence have a sensibly
less variable error than those against which the other equations
are tested. An approximate exponential equation showed
less deviations than 3 against the same data. There seems,
therefore, to be no advantage in this equation sufficient to
offset the difficulty of evaluation of its constants.
   Applied to the Barus data from 350° to 1250°, the ex
ponential equation shows deviations considerably less than one
half as great as those of the Avenarius, while those of the
logarithmic equation are so small as to lie far within the
range of the variable errors, and they moreover show no clear
evidence of systematic error between these limits of tempera
ture. For interpolation in the Barus data, therefore, the
logarithmic equation is far preferable, and must be conceded to
be representative of the data. For extrapolation it is un
doubtedly better than the Avenarius, which (as would the
exponential in less degree) would certainly give above 1000°
extrapolated values of Xe too large, or of t too small. The
advantage due to its simplicity is also to be noted.
   Applied to the Holborn and Wien data from 400° to 1450°
the exponential equation shows (line KK) the same sort of
superiority to both logarithmic (line LL) and Avenarius
(line II) that the logarithmic shows to the others with the
Barus data, but in a still more marked degree. Within the
limits 450° to 1450°, in fact, the distribution of the residuals
to the exponential is such as not to warrant of itself alone
any inference of systematic departure, especially when the
mean line M M from all the couples is considered. It will be
noted as an important confirmation of both the exactness of
the electrical measurements in the investigation and the
applicability of the exponential formula through a considerable
range of alloys (and therefore of values of m and n) that this

             Thermo-electric Interpolation Formulae.          485
 mean line M M is almost identical in form with the line K.K
for alloy A.     Relatively to the Holborn and Wien formula
 (line HH), the exponential possesses a similar advantage,
with also the merit of greater simplicity of form.
    It may therefore be affirmed that for interpolation between
450° and 1450° in the H. and W. data the exponential equation
is abundantly exact. For extrapolation above 1450° it would
not be entirely safe, although presumably better than the
 others, since the departure between 0° and 450°, and the
 similarity of the form to others, make a systematic departure
 sufficiently certain.                                           -
    Applied to the Chassagny and Abraham data, 0°-100°, and
to the Noll data, 0°–218° (see diagram), the Avenarius and
exponential formulae show about equal deviations, but with
the advantage slightly on the side of the former. In the case
 of the Noll data, the line indicates that the systematic error
 is slightly greater for the exponential than for the Avenarius
 expression. The average deviations in Table IX., on the
 contrary, show that for each individual equation the concor
 dance is greater for the exponential than the Avenarius. This
discrepancy is due to the fact that, in order to eliminate local
 accidental errors, the equations (both Avenarius and expo
nential) are not all made to coincide with the data at the
same temperatures, so that the process of averaging by which
the data for the Noll plots is obtained is not numerically rigid.
This does not, however, sensibly affect the general form of
the curve. The greater ease of computation of the numerical
constants of the Avenarius expression, and its applicability
where both t and to change, ought not to be overlooked. For
extrapolation the exponential would be safer, for the reason
that it has been shown above that for long ranges its syste
matic error is less.
    The logarithmic equation fits the Noll data very badly, as
shown by the deviation in Table IX. (not plotted), and also
is much less close to the Chassagny and Abraham data than
are the others.
    The general conclusion as to applicability, then, seems to
be that, while the Avenarius expression may be equally good
or better than the exponential for interpolation over short
ranges, yet for interpolation over long ranges and for extra
polation above the observation limits the exponential is decidedly
preferable. The exponential form is also preferable to the
remaining expressions with the exception noted.
    The logarithmic form, although closely applicable to the
 Barus data, is of more doubtful general value, yet on account

486                Prof. Silas W. Holman on
of its great convenience it may find application in industrial
pyrometry, as will be elsewhere indicated. Although failing
below 300° or 400°, it may probably be applied to the irido
or rhodo-platinum couple between 400° and 1200°C. with a
maximum error not exceeding about 5°. If extended to cover
400° to 2000° the error might rise to 15° or 20°.
   More in detail it may be briefly noted by way of
summary:—
   That the logarithmic equation fits the Barus data between
400° and 1250° with scarcely sensible systematic error, and
within the limits of variable errors of the data.
   That the exponential equation similarly fits the Holborn
and Wien data within the limits 400° to 1445°.                 -
   That when made to coincide with the data at about 450°
and 1200° the systematic deviations of the exponential equa
tion from the Barus data, and of the logarithmic equation
from the Holborn and Wien data, are in general of opposite
 sign and of roughly equal magnitude.
            Barus Melting and Boiling-Point Data.
   From the foregoing demonstration of its applicability, it
 seems proper to apply the logarithmic formula to the Barus
 thermo-electric data on melting-points".
   Whether the extrapolation above 1000° by the logarithmic
 formula is entitled to any great weight may be questioned,
 but there is no obvious reason why it is not more reliable than
by any of the others. I have employed the equation given
 on page 474, which represents very closely Barus's high
 temperature air-thermometer comparisons, calculating thence
the temperatures t corresponding to the values of X,e given
 by Barus for the various points, assuming Barus's value
 X#e = 150 mv.       The results are given in column 3 of
Table X. Column 4 quotes the most reliable previous
 determinations of the same points by other observers. As to
 which of the two columns of results best represents Barus’s
 work, there can be little doubt from the above evidence that
 below 1000° it is the second, that is, the one computed from
 the logarithmic equation. These combine both his own air
 thermometer and melting-point work. Above 1000° the
 logarithmic values are probably slightly too high.

   Review of the laborious researches which have been devoted
to the direct comparison of thermo-electric elements with the
air thermometer, mainly for the purpose of advancing the
art of pyrometry, has enforced the conviction that, at least
for the immediate future, this end would be better served by
accurate gas-thermometer measurements of melting-points of
metals. Each such determination made upon a reducible
metal of known high purity under proper reproducible con
ditions fixes an enduring and reproducible reference-point,
a pyrometric “bench mark.” And there are enough inex
pensive metals, together with a possible system of simple
alloys, to give points of sufficient frequency. These would
then afford a convenient means of obtaining accurately known
high temperatures for purposes of study of all           '      temperature
phenomena, and particularly for calibrating thermo-electric,
electrical resistance, optical, or other secondary pyrometric
interpolation apparatus, -for it must be remembered that all
such apparatus is necessarily secondary, the gas thermometer
being inevitably the primary.
   On the other hand, comparison with the air thermometer of
a thermo-couple, or of a resistance pyrometer, or the study of

488                   Mr. W. B. Morton on the
any progressive thermal phenomenon, while it possibly may
result in the eduction of a natural law, is very unlikely to
lead to anything more than the establishment of an approxi
 mate equation with constants characteristic only of the
 individual materials actually employed, and not transferable
to other, although similar materials. Such results are obviously
 of a much more ephemeral character than the melting-point
 measurements. Even when any pyrometer thus tested is
 applied to the establishment of melting-points, it must at best
 yield results inferior to direct application of the gas ther
 mometer, except in cases where the latter is hampered by
 want of sufficient quantity of the metal to be experimented
 upon,—a condition which need only affect such costly sub
 stances as gold and platinum.
     Stated broadly, the great need of the art of pyrometry is
 convenient methods of producing, or of recognizing :

    he analogous problem has been partially solved for ther
 mometry at temperatures up to 300° C. by the investigation
 of boiling-points of certain chemically pure substances under
 controlled pressures.                                - -

  1. THIS subject has been brought into prominence re
            cently by the use which Mr. Larmor has made of
 moving electrons in his dynamical theory of the aether. The
  matter was investigated in 1881 by Prof. J. J. Thomsont,
  who showed that a point charge moving so slowly that the
  electric displacement it carries is not sensibly disturbed
  generates magnetic force like a current element according to
  Ampère's rule; and by Mr. Heavisidet, who investigated the
  matter more generally in 1889, and showed that in steady
  rectilinear motion at any speed less than that of light, the
  lines of displacement continue to be radial but are concen
  trated towards the plane perpendicular to the direction of
  motion.     The displacement at distance ", in a direction

where u is the velocity of the moving charge and V the
velocity of light. The lines of magnetic force are circles
round the line of motion.
    2. This solution of course represents the state of affairs at
a great distance from a small charged conductor of any shape.
It would also give us the distribution of charge on a moving
sphere if it were correct to assume that the lines of displace
ment meet the charged surface at right angles. This
 assumption was made by Prof. Thomson and, at first, by Mr.
 Heaviside, but the latter, quoting a suggestion of Mr. G. F. C.
 Searle, subsequently pointed out that when there is motion
 the electric force is no longer derived from a potential
 function, and as a consequence does not meet the equilibrium
 surface at right angles. Substituting the correct surface
 condition, he showed that the charged conductor, whose motion
 would give at all points the radial distribution found for a
 point charge, was not a sphere but a spheroid of certain
 ellipticity.                           -   - -
     3. It seemed of some interest to inquire what the distri
 bution of charge on a moving sphere would be. The surface
 density at a point of the surface is now the normal component
 of the displacement at that point. By carrying the investiga
 tion a step further I have found that, if the conductor be a
 sphere or any ellipsoid, the ordinary static arrangement of
 charge is unaltered by the motion; i.e. the number of tubes
 of displacement leaving each element of the surface is
  unchanged, but the tubes no longer leave the surface at right
 angles. We may imagine that the motion has the effect of
  deforming the tubes, keeping their ends on the conductor
  fixed. The proof of this, involving a consideration of the
  general case, is here  £        and is followed by a note on the
  energy of a moving charge in a magnetic field.
     4. Suppose we have any distribution of charge moving
  with uniform velocity u parallel to the axis of 2, and that the
  field has assumed its steady configuration. We shall denote
        w?
  1- W. by k”, V being      the velocity of light. Then since we

surface of a conductor, inside which the vectors vanish, we
must see that the “curl” relations of the field are not violated

                Electromagnetic Theory of Moving Charges.        491
    for circuits which lie partly inside the empty space enclosed
    by the conductor. In particular, if there is a vector whose
    line integral round every circuit in the field vanishes, the
    lines of this vector must meet the surface at right angles.
    Otherwise we should have a finite value for the integral round
    a circuit drawn close to the surface outside and completed
    inside. In other words, if a vector is derived from a potential
    function, this function must be constant over the surface. In
    the ordinary static case it is the electric force (X, Y,Z)
    which is so derived; but in the case of a steadily moving
    field it is the vector  (x,   Y,  #)   which meets the surface at
    right angles.
       6. Let F(w y z)=C be the equation of the charged surface.
    Then p(w y z) has to be constant over this surface and satisfy
                          a'b d"b           d’t
                          da”      dy” +*::=0.
    Put z=k*, then p is a function of v, y, z, which is constant
    when F(x, y, kš)=C, and which satisfies
                          *#4 # 4 &# =0
                          #T W T TH =v.
    Therefore if we regard (a y £) as Cartesian coordinates of a
    point, b is the potential at external points of an electrostatic
    free distribution on the surface F(x, y, kg)=C. The com
    ponents of electric force due to this distribution, at a point
    (w y £) on the surface, are

magnetic field has been given by Mr. £, for the case
of motion which is very slow compared with the velocity of
 radiation.   It is eu A. cos (u/A), where A is the circuital
 vector potential of the external field. Mr. Larmor, in the
 second part of his “ Dynamical Theory” (Phil. Trans. 1895,
 p. 717), concludes that the same expression holds good for
 motion at any speed. He seems, however, to £ the
 fact that in the general case the displacement-currents in the
 medium—being no longer derivable from a potential function
 —will make their appearance in the result as well as the
 convection-current eu.
    If (FG H) is the vector potential, the part of the energy
 corresponding to the displacement currents will be
                        }(E-G#4H)dr,

Therefore if the velocity u ceases to be negligible in com
parison with W, we have a correction of the second order in
the ratio # in addition to the expression involving the
convection-current simply. It also appears from the above
that the force on the moving charge cannot, unless this term
be neglected, be expressed in terms of the magnetic intensity
at the charge, but will depend on the entire field.

LIV. On a Simple Apparatus for determining the Thermal
   Conductivities of Cements and other Substances used in the
   Arts. By CHARLEs H. LEEs, D.Sc., and J. D. CHORLTON,
   B.Sc., Joule Scholar of the Royal Society".
TH: following method of determining the thermal con
       ductivities of bad conductors has been designed with
the object of simplifying as much as possible the apparatus
and observations required in making determinations which
are not required to be of the highest order of accuracy, but
in which errors of more than 2 per cent. are to be avoided.
When the constants of the apparatus have once been deter
mined, the only observations necessary to determine a
conductivity are the thickness of a sheet of the substance
used and the temperatures of three thermometers. It is
hoped that this simplification will lead those who require bad
conductors of heat for structural purposes to carry out their
own tests of the materials they have available.
   Method.—The apparatus consists of a flat cylindrical metal
box, of 11.4 cms. diameter and 3 cms. depth, through which
steam can be passed. The bottom of the box consists of
a circular brass plate 1.3 cm. thick in which a radial hole
reaching to the centre is bored. In this hole a thermometer
is placed with its bulb at the centre of the plate. The top
and sides of the box are covered with green baize to prevent
loss of heat as far as possible. This vessel is supported on
a circular plate of the material to be tested, which in its turn
is supported on a brass disk similar to the one forming the
base of the heating vessel, and like it provided with a radial
hole and thermometer.
   The lower disk is suspended horizontally from a support
by three strings attached to three short pegs projecting from
the edge of the disk, and hangs about 30 centims. above the
table.   About 10 centims. above the table a thermometer is
placed horizontally, with its bulb under the centre of the
lower plate to give the temperature of the air ascending to
the disks. The bulb of the thermometer is protected against
radiation from the lower disk by a bright metal screen.        -
   The two surfaces of the disks which come into contact with
the material to be experimented on are amalgamated, so that
if the material is a solid, contact over its entire surface may
be obtained by using a thin mercury film between the solid
and disks.      In order to determine the thickness of the
                * Communicated by the Authors.

496          Dr. Lees and Mr. Chorlton on the Thermal
material used, two short pegs of brass, one vertically above
the other, project from the disks, and their distance apart is
measured by means of a wire gauge or calipers, when the
disks are in contact and when the plate to be tested is between,
the difference is the thickness of the plate of the material
tested. The under surface of the lower disk may be kept
polished, or it may be painted, in order that the heat radiated
from it may remain constant during a series of experiments.
     When steam is passed through the upper cylinder the tem
perature of the upper disk is raised to nearly 100° C.; heat
flows through the plate of material experimented on to the
lower disk, the temperature of which is therefore raised above
that of the surrounding air. It begins in consequence to lose
heat by radiation and conduction to the air, and eventually a
stage is reached when this loss of heat is equal to the heat
received from the material experimented on.
     Hence if the amount of this loss is found by a separate
experiment, a determination of the temperature gradient in
the material experimented on at its surface of contact with
the lower plate, will enable the thermal conductivity of the
material to be found.

   tity the two plates were separated by a layer of air 3 mm.
   thick, enclosed by a ring of badly conducting material upon

         Conductivities of Cements and other Substances.             499
which the upper plate rested; steam was passed through the
box at the top, and the temperature of the upper plate raised to
nearly 100°C. The lower plate was next heated a few degrees
above 100° C. by means of a gas-flame and then allowed to
cool, and as soon as its temperature fell to 100° C. the supply
of steam to the upper can was cut off and the hot water in
the can allowed to run out.
   Both plates were then found to cool at almost the same
rate; the difference in the temperatures of the two plates never
exceeded 1° C., the upper plate being always the warmer.
Since the conductivity of air is only about 00005 C.G.S.
units, the amount of heat conducted from the upper plate to
the lower is negligible, so that each plate cools independently
of the other.
  The thermometer in the lower plate was watched as the
temperature fell, and the times at which the mercury passed
every alternate degree were observed; the results are given
in the table below.
   The temperature of the air was steady at 18°C.

   The numbers in the 4th column are found by subtracting
alternate times in the 3rd column from each other and
dividing 4°C. by the differences.
   The numbers in the 5th column are obtained from those in
the 4th by multiplying by 1140 grams, the mass of the lower
disk, and by .093, the specific heat of brass, i.e. by 106.
   The numbers in the 6th column are obtained by dividing
by the total radiating surface of the lower disk, plus half the
radiating surface of the nonconducting ring = 148.5 + 5.5
 = 154 sq. centims.
   The values of h are obtained from these numbers by dividing
by the excess of the temperature of the lower disk over that
of the air.
                          Experiments.
   The following account of an experiment on a plate of glass
will show the method of treatment in each case:—
   A disk of plate-glass of diameter equal to that of the brass
plates—11.4 centims.—was placed between them, and contact
 made by means of thin mercury films. Good contact was
 easily secured between the glass and the lower plate; but
with much more difficulty in the case of the upper plate.
 Contact was eventually obtained by covering the surface
 of the upper plate with mercury, so that it adhered in pendent
 drops, at the same time placing a few drops of mercury on
 the surface of the glass, and then carefully lowering the
 upper plate on to the glass and allowing the excess of mercury
 to run out at the edges.
    Steam was then passed through the box attached to the
upper brass plate, and thermometers inserted in the upper
and lower plates, the temperature of the air being indicated
 by a third thermometer placed as described above.
    After a time, the duration of which depended on the con
 ductivity and thickness of the substance experimented upon,
 the thermometers became steady and the temperatures were
 observed.
          6, = temperature of upper plate = 96.1°C.
          61 =      35      , lower , = 92.4°C.
          60 =      92       , air          = 20.0°C.

          Conductivities of Cements and other Substances.               501
   The thickness was obtained by measuring with a micro
meter-gauge the distance between the two pegs, first, when
the plates were in contact with each other, and, secondly,
when the glass was between them.
   The following table gives the observations taken during
each experiment, and shows the method of determining the
conductivities from the observations:—
                   Remarks on Specimens Evperimented on.
(a) The plates of Portland cement and plaster of Paris, &c., were made
    by pouring the liquid cement on to a glass plate, on which three
    equal beads strung together were laid, a second glass plate was
    pressed down upon these beads, after a few hours the glass plates
     could be removed and a plate of cement of uniform thickness was
    obtained.
       The plate of plaster of Paris and sand consisted of two parts
     by weight of plaster of Paris to one part by weight of sand.
(b) When the substance experimented upon was a powder, the brass
     plates were kept apart by three stops of wood, and the powder was
     prevented from falling out at the edges by a very narrow circular
     ring of fibre.
(c) The three values given for the conductivity of garden-soil refer to
     three specimens of soil of the same kind but containing different
     amounts of moisture; the first value refers to dry soil, the second to
     slightly moist, and the third to damp soil. The results show how
     greatly a small amount of moisture affects the conductivity.
(d) The calico in the first experiment was dry, and weighed 8.91 grams.
     In the second experiment it was exposed for some time to a damp
     atmosphere, and its weight increased to 9:06 grams, so that the con
     ductivity of calico increases 20 per cent, for 1.6 per cent, increase in
     weight due to moisture absorbed.
(e) In the three experiments on old flannel, the flannel contained different
     amounts of moisture. In the first experiment the flannel was quite
     dry and weighed 8.21 grams, in the second it was exposed to a
     damp atmosphere, and its weight was 829 grams, and in the third
     experiment was damped with water and its weight increased to
     9:05 grams. Thus the conductivity of flannel increased about 11 per
     cent. for 1 per cent. increase in weight due to absorbed moisture,
     and afterwards increased 25 per cent, more for a further increase
    of 10 per cent. in weight.
        The flannel in the third experiment is almost as good a conductor
     as dry calico.
        The new flannel, flanelette, silk, and linen were dry.

LV. On the Relation between the Brightness of an Object and
       that of its Image.      By W. T. A. EMTAGE, M.A.”
IF an     object situated in a medium of refractive index u
      forms an image by means of rays refracted through any
number of surfaces and finally into a medium of index u', the
luminosities, I, I’, of object and image satisfy the relation
                            I: I'=tu”: u”,
supposing no light to be lost by reflexion at the surfaces or
by absorption in the media.
   This is generally proved, in the case where the pencils are
not all very narrow and along an axis of revolution of the
refracting surfaces, by showing that if this relation did not
obtain we could get an image brighter than the object by
viewing this through a suitable combination of lenses; a
result which would be contrary to experience. The following
direct proof may, however, be given for pencils of any sort:—
   We notice first that if a small luminous surface sends a certain
quantity of light to a second small surface, for the second to
send the same quantity of light to the first it must be equally
bright with it. For if sl, s, are the areas of the two surfaces,
II, I, their luminosities, d the distance between them, and
61, 6, the inclinations of their normals to d, the lights which
they send to each other are
        II si sa cos 6 cos 6,    al    I2 s, so cos 6 cos 6,
                  d?           , and – g –.
And for these to be equal Ii = I2.
   Now let s be a small area of an object in a medium of
refractive index u1, and let it send out a sheaf of rays which
is refracted across the surface RT into a second medium of
index ug. The cone of rays from s converging to the point
R is refracted into a cone of different solid angle. If i and r
are the angles of incidence and refraction at R, the angular
breadths of these solid angles in the plane of refraction are
di, dr; and their angular breadths at right angles to this
plane are proportional to sin i, sin r.               -          -
   Now
                           a sin i=p's sin r,
                      ".. a cos i di = u2 cos r dr.

And if the solid angles are oi, o,

                   o,    drsin r T uí” cos i
Now let II be the luminosity of s, and I2 that of the surface
RT as seen in the medium us by the light coming originally
from s. It is the luminosity RT must have to send back to s
the same amount of light as s sends to it, that is, as RT sends
on into us. If s is the area of the surface RT, the quantities
of light received and sent on by it are
                  I slo, cos i, and I2 s1 oscos r.
And these are equal. Thus from above
                         II : I.2=pû”: us”.
    In the same manner the luminosity of the second surface
across which the rays pass, as seen in the third medium of
index us, is proportional to us”; and so on.
    If the rays on passing across the last surface form a true
 image of s, so that the combination of surfaces is aplanatic for
 s, the brightness of this image is the same as that of the last
 surface ; for it subtends the same solid angle at the point of
 view as the portion of the surface which sends the same
 quantity of light to the point of view. Thus, if u, u' are the
 refractive indices of the medium in which the object is and
 that in which the eye is which sees the image, and I, I the
 luminosities of the object and image;
                          I: I'=u”: u”.

               LVI. Adjustment of the Kelvin Bridge.
                     By Rollo APPLEYARD".
 IN     a recent paper by Mr. J. H. Reevesf an alternative
       method of adjusting the ratios of the resistances in the
 Kelvin bridge was described; the following remarks may be
 regarded as a note upon that paper.
    The measurement of a resistance by the arrangement
 adopted by Mr. Reeves involves two operations. It may be
 shown, however, that for certain purposes the two adjust
 ments can be combined mechanically, and balance effected
  y a single
 by      ng test.              Fig. 1.

    Consider the conductors R, r, a, b, c, and y in fig. 1. It
 is required to compare R with r. In the accepted form of
 the Kelvin bridge a, b, c, and y have fixed values, such that
 ay=bv, and balance is obtained by the one operation of
 varying R or r. Mr. Reeves prefers to keep R and r fixed;
and, consequently, he has first to find provisional values of a,
b, a, and y such that ay £ by ; and then to balance again,
using these values, to find R: r; with the plug, this time,

    Since writing the above, I have referred to the original
paper of Lord Kelvin (Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. xi. p. 313, 1861),
and find that he proposes the use of parallel slide-wires for
his auxiliary conductors; I have no doubt he had in view
 some such apparatus as that which I have here suggested.
A Kelvin bridge with a single slide-wire was used by Mat
 thiessen and Hockin in their differential method ; it is
described by Clerk-Maxwell in ‘Elec. and Mag. vol. i. p. 406
 (1873).
 LVII. The Effect of Wave Form on the Alternate Current Arc.
           By JULIUS FRITH, 1851 Exhibition Scholar*.
 IN      the paper by Dr. Fleming and Mr. Petavel, recently
        read before the Physical Society, on the Alternate Cur
 rent Arct, I think too little attention was paid to the wave
 form of the alternate current used.
     It is known that if the arc is allowed to exert a prepon
  derating influence at all on the alternate current circuit, it
 alters the wave form of both the current and the P. D. in a
 very marked degree.
    As an illustration of the change produced in the wave
 form by the character of the external circuit, I give some
 curves for alternate current arcs taken from a paper which I
 read before the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society
 in March 1894.
     Here is shown, first the E.M.F. curve of the machine on
 open circuit, which is rather more peaked than a sine curve
 and involves the third harmonic largely. Next is shown the
  curve obtained under the same conditions, but with an are
  lamp taking 10 amperes at 40 volts joined direct to the
 machine.
     The lag recorded is due to the self-induction of the machine,

                  on the Alternate Current Arc.               509
which was a “Wilde” alternator, the armature of which
contained iron.
   It will also be noticed that the first ordinates of the curves
are not quite equal to the last ordinates; this is due to the
curve being slightly asymmetrical. The whole period is only
one third of the revolution of the alternator (shown as 120
degrees in the figure). In one complete revolution this lack
of symmetry would of course disappear.
   It is seen that the arc alters the wave form from a peaked
curve to a very flat topped curve, changing sign almost
instantaneously, and with two small maxima, which occur
respectively just before and just after each reversal. The
next curve shows the effect of adding a resistance of 1 ohm
in series with the arc. This smooths out the two maxima,
but otherwise does not affect the shape materially.
   The current and P.D. curves with 5 ohms in series with
the arc are next shown. Both waves now assume much more
the form of the E.M.F. curve on open circuit, except at the
zero line.    Here the P.D. curve crosses the line twice in each
direction, and the current curve runs parallel to the zero line
for some way before crossing it.
   These curves show, I think, the great effect that the arc has
on the wave form, and also how this effect can be destroyed
by placing resistance in series with the arc.
   In a paper by Rössler and Wedding, which appeared in the
‘Electrician’ for August 31st, 1894, it was proved that an
alternate current arc is more efficient, that is, gives a higher
candle-power for the same electric power consumed, when the
alternating current feeding it has a flat-topped than when it
has a peaked wave form.                              -
   Rössler was, however, mistaken, I think, in assuming that
the machine was making that curve. Indeed, this mistake
 runs through the whole of this otherwise most valuable paper.
 Rössler took three machines giving, as he thought, wave forms
 from the extremely peaked to the extremely flat wave, and
 determined the efficiencies of the same arc lamp for each of
 them. Whereas exactly the same results might have been
 obtained from one machine alone on causing it to give a
 higher voltage by increasing the field excitation and then
 absorbing the excess of voltage in resistance, exactly as in
 the case of the Wilde alternator above referred to.
   I understand that in the experiments described by Dr.
 Fleming and Mr. Petavel there was always a resistance
amounting to 7 ohms outside the arc, and hence a wave form
was forced upon the arc which, as Rössler has proved, is not
the most efficient one, and which the arc would convert into a

 510           Mr. D. McIntosh on the Conductivity of
 form better suited to itself if it had been allowed to do so, as
 it is in commerce. This consideration must affect, not only
 the efficiency, but also the curves which Fleming and Petavel
 obtained for the variations in the luminous intensity.
     Further, this action of the arc in modifying the wave form
 may throw some light on the discrepancy between the
 efficiency of alternate current arcs as determined in the labora
 tory and that stated to be obtained in practice.
    When an arc is run in the laboratory a large resistance is
 almost certain to be put in series with it to ensure that degree of
 steadiness which is essential to exact measurement, and hence
 the arc cannot alter the wave form.      In the commercial use of
 arcs, on the contrary, the circumstances are widely different.
 In this case, for economic reasons, the arc must form a large
 percentage of the total “reactance” of the circuit, and there
fore can easily alter the wave to the form required for the
greatest efficiency.
    It is interesting to note that the wave form giving the best
result for the arc is almost exactly the opposite to that giving
the best efficiency for transformers. In the former case a
flat-topped wave is best, while for the maximum efficiency of
transformers an exceedingly peaked wave is best, as lately
found by Dr. Rössler.
    This points to the building of alternators for use with
transformers in such a way as to give peaked wave-forms.
    In the case of the arc the building of machines to give the
most efficient wave form is not so necessary, since, generally,
the arc itself has the power of automatically converting any
wave form into the one best suited to its requirements.
Nevertheless, when the arc has to run in series with a large
resistance it is of the utmost importance for obtaining the
best efficiency that the machine should give a flat-topped
WaVe.

LVIII. On the Calculation of the Conductivity of Mixtures of
    Electrolytes having a common Ion. By Douglas M*INTosh,
    Physical Laboratory, Dalhousie College, Halifax, N.S.*
IN a paper published in          the April number of this Maga
       zine (supra, p. 276) Prof. MacGregor showed how to
obtain, by a graphical process, from observations of the elec
trical conductivity of a sufficient number of simple solutions
   * Abstract of a £ read before the Nova Scotia Institute of Science
on the 13th of April, 1896. Communicated by the Secretary of the
Institute.

         Mixtures of Electrolytes having a common Ion.      511
of two electrolytes having a common ion, the data necessary
for the calculation of the conductivity of a solution containing
both electrolytes, according to the dissociation theory of
electrolytic conduction; and in order to test this theory he
calculated the conductivities of a series of mixtures of solu
tions of sodium chloride and potassium chloride, which had
been measured by Bender. He found that for dilute solutions
his calculations agreed with Bender’s observations within the
limits of experimental error; but that as the strength of the
solutions increased the differences became larger, until with
a mixture of solutions containing each four gramme-molecules
per litre of salt (the strongest solutions with which Bender
worked) a difference of 3.6 per cent. was found. The method
of calculation assumed that the ionic velocities of the con
stituent electrolytes were not changed by the mixing; and
Prof. MacGregor attributed the differences between the calcu
lated and observed values to the change which, as he pointed
out, would probably be produced in these velocities by
 mixture.
    At his suggestion I have made the observations and calcu
 lations described in this paper with the object of determining
 (1) what the differences between the observed and calculated
 values are, in the case of mixtures of sodium and potassium
 chloride solutions of greater strength than those examined
 by Bender; and (2) how the calculated and observed values
 are related in the case of solutions containing sodium chlo
 ride and hydrochloric acid—electrolytes whose ionic velocities
 differ from one another much more than those of sodium and
 potassium chlorides.
           Preparation of Solutions and Determination
                         of Conductivities.
    The paper of which this is an abstract contains a full
 statement of the experimental methods employed and the
 precautions taken to secure accuracy. It will be sufficient
 here to make a general statement merely.
    The salts and acid used were purchased as chemically pure,
  and the former re-purified by crystallization. They were
  found by the usual tests to be free from probable impurities.
  The water was doubly distilled and was also tested.
     Simple solutions of salt or acid having been prepared
  their concentration was determined by volumetric analysis,
  the pipettes and burettes used having been tested by weighing
  the water they delivered. The volumetric analyses were
  found to be accurate to 0.1 per cent. when applied to solu
  tions specially prepared by the mixture of exactly determined
  quantities of salt and water.

  512        Mr. D. M'Intosh on the Conductivity of
    The mixtures in all cases consisted of equal volumes of the
 constituent solutions. In preparing them the same pipette
 was used for both solutions in exactly the same way, having
 been washed out before use in each case with a portion of the
 solution with which it was to be filled.   In all cases solutions
 were prepared and analysed at 18°C.                       -
    The method employed in the observations of conductivity
 was that of Kohlrausch with alternating current and telephone,
 the apparatus consisting of a bridge-wire of german-silver
 about 3 metres long, wound on a marble drum, a set of resist
 ance-coils (of which I needed to use but one), a small induction
 coil with a very rapid vibrator, and an ordinary Bell telephone.
 I calibrated the bridge-wire by the method of Strouhal and
 Barus, and was able to determine resistances to within from
 0-2 to 0.3 per cent.
    The electrolytic cell was of a U-shape, and was placed in a
 water-bath kept at or near 18°C. by a thermostat and stirred
 by a current of air. Its temperature was read by a ther
mometer graduated to 0-1 degree Centigrade, and capable of
being read easily to 0.05 degree. Its errors had recently
been determined at the Physikalisch-technische Reichsanstalt,
Berlin. When the bath could not be kept at 18°C., the
temperature coefficient was determined. In the platinizing
of the electrodes, and in the whole procedure of the deter
mination of the conductivity, I followed carefully the recom
mendations of Kohlrausch's recent papers.
   As I was to employ Kohlrausch's observations as data in
the calculations, I reduced all my observations of conductivity
to his standard (the conductivity of mercury at 0°C.). The
factor requisite for this purpose was determined by comparing
my own observations for certain solutions with the values
  iven by him for the same solutions. This factor I found (as
£ had also) to vary somewhat with            the conductivity of
the solution used in finding it, but not with the nature of the
solution. I therefore found its values as given by using a
series of solutions of different conductivities; and in reducing
the observed conductivity of a mixture to Kohlrausch’s
standard I used the value of the factor corresponding to the
conductivity of the mixture. All observations given below
are expressed in terms of Kohlrausch's standard.

514            Mr. D. McIntosh on the Conductivity of
                      The Data for the Calculations.
    The method of calculating the conductivity of the mixtures
was that described by Prof. MacGregor in the paper referred
to above. It requires as data the change of volume on mixing
 (if not negligible), the conductivities of sufficiently extended
 series of the simple solutions of about the same dilution as
 the solutions mixed, and the molecular conductivities of the
 simple solutions at infinite dilution.
     Specific gravity determinations showed that the change of
 volume on mixing was in all cases so small as to produce no
 practical effect on the calculated value of the conductivity.
     Kohlrausch's tables* of the conductivity of solutions of
 sodium and potassium chlorides furnished sufficient data for
  calculating the conductivity of mixtures of these salts; but I
  found it necessary to make additional observations on solu
  tions of hydrochloric acid. They are as follows:–

   The differences of the above table agree very well with
those found by Prof. MacGregor" in the case of the mixtures
examined by Bender, being of the same sign and, in general,
for mixtures of about the same mean concentration, of ap
proximately the same magnitude. The results seem, therefore,
to be worthy of confidence, and they show clearly that the
differences between the calculated and the observed values
increase rapidly as the constituent solutions become more and

    It will be seen that in the series of weakest solutions, the
 differences between calculated and observed values are of
 such small magnitude and show such alternation of sign as
 to warrant the conclusion that they are due chiefly to acci
 dental errors. In the two series of stronger solutions the
 differences are more irregular in magnitude and the alterna
 tion of sign is much less marked, the most of the differences
 being positive. The above results, therefore, seem to show
 that even in the case of two electrolytes with a common ion
 which differ so markedly in ionic velocity from one another
 as sodium chloride and hydrochloric acid, the dissociation
 theory enables us to calculate the conductivity of solutions
 containing both, within the limits of experimental error, up
 to a mean concentration of about one gramme-molecule per
 litre, and that in the case of solutions of greater mean con
 centration the calculated value is greater than the observed.

The Magnetic Circuit. By Dr. H. DU BoIS. Translated by Dr.
   ATKINSON. Pp. xviii-H.362. (London: Longmans, Green, &
   Co. 1896.)
IN view of the ever increasing employment of magnetic circuits,
     in some form or other, in experimental and applied electricity,
the importance of this work (so far the only one in which the
subject has been treated with anything like completeness) will be
recognized by both physicists and practical electricians.
   The book is divided into two parts and eleven chapters, the first
part (Chapters I.—W.) being devoted to the mathematical develop
ment of the theory, and the second chiefly to applications.
   Chapters I.–IV. contain a short account of the electromagnetic
field, the magnetization of bars and ellipsoids (considered as imper
fect magnetic circuits), and the general theory of perfectly “rigid”
and of temporary magnetization. The mode of treatment of this
part in general follows that of Maxwell, but the definition of both
“magnetic intensity” and magnetic induction by the currents
induced in an exploring coil is an improvement on the usual
method in which the forces acting on a magnetic pole in narrow
cavities of different forms are considered at the outset.   The term
“magnetic intensity” is thus used throughout the book (instead
of “magnetic force”), and magnetization is defined as the differ
: between magnetic induction and magnetic intensity, divided
 y 4r.
   In Chapter W. are explained the author's theory of the magneti
zation of an iron toroid with a radial slit (the typical case of an
imperfect magnetic circuit), and the verification of the results by
the experiments of Lehmann.
   With Part II. begins the more special part of the work—the
properties of magnetic circuits as such. The discussion of the
stress existing in a circuit follows Maxwell in assuming a longi
tudinal tension BH/47–H*/8T to exist at each point in the
direction of the lines of induction. Whether this is the magni
tude of the stress existing (even in a rigidly magnetized part of
the circuit where also B and H have the same direction) is, of
course, open to question: the balance of evidence tends to show
that the stress has a different value.
   The remaining Chapters VII.—XI. are highly interesting, con
taining a discussion of the analogy between the magnetic and other
circuits and the applicability of a so-called “Ohm's law,” of the
magnetic circuits of dynamos and electromagnets and principles of
their design as realized in the du Bois electromagnet for producing
very strong fields, and, finally, of methods and instruments for
measuring field-intensity, magnetization, and induction. Of the
instruments described, one of the most interesting is the author's
magnetic balance, by means of which a complete magnetic cycle
(H, I) can be obtained in a few minutes.
   The translation, though good on the whole, is not altogether

518                Notices respecting New Books.
free from inaccuracies. Thus, on page 340, § 221, the word
“circuitous” (which does not express “umständlich.”) does not
convey the author's opinion of a method necessarily full of detail
and one which is required in certain special circumstances. A
few other errors such as “normal” for “tangential” (page 83.
theorem iv.), and the occasional use of “magnitude” for “quantity”
are the most serious defects.
    The author has made several additions containing results
obtained chiefly during the past year.
   The printing and general appearance of the book are excellent,
and Dr. Atkinson deserves the thanks of English physicists for
introducing to them so important an addition to the fascinating
subject of Magnetism.
“Die Ausdehnungslehre, vollständig und                 Form bearbeitet
   von HERMANN GRAssMANN (Berlin, 18
THIs book is the second part of the first V
neous mathematical and physical works of their            us author,
which are in course of publication under the editorShºp of Dr. Fr.
Engel, in cooperation with a strong body of five other eminent
mathematicians. The volumes are being brought out at Leipzig,
and the one before us gives a reprint of the edition brought
out in Grassmann’s lifetime in 1862.           Clifford would have
been delighted with this edition.       In 1878 he contributed to
the first volume of the “American Journal of Mathematics’
an article on “Applications of Grassmann's Extensive Algebra”
(Mathematical Papers, pp. 266-276), which opens with the
statement:—“Until recently I was unacquainted with the Aus
dehnungslehre, and knew only so much of it as is contained
in the author's geometrical papers in Crelle's Journal and in
‘Hankel's Lectures on Complex Numbers.’ I may, perhaps, there
fore be permitted to express my profound admiration of that
extraordinary work, and my conviction that its principles will
exercise a vast influence upon the future of mathematical science.”
Prof. Tait writes:—“Hamilton and Grassmann, while their earlier
work had much in common, had very different objects in view.
Hamilton had geometrical application as his main object; when
he realized the quaternion system, he felt that his object was
gained, and thenceforth confined himself to the development of
his method. Grassmann's object seems to have been, all along, of
a much more ambitious character, viz. to discover, if possible, a
system or systems in which every conceivable mode of dealing
with sets should be included. That he made very great advances
towards the attainment of this object all will allow; that his
method, even as completed in 1862, fully attains it is not so
certain” (“Quaternions” in Encycl. Brit. 9th edit., where more
remarks on the same writers will be found). After these quota
tions as to the value of Grassmann's work, we need only state the
following partciulars. There are a few words, by way of preface,
by the editor, from which we learn that the text of the “1862 ”
edition (the first edition was published in 1842) has been carefully

                           Geological Society.                     519
 revised by the author's son. The text itself here occupies 379
 pages and is followed by an alphabetical index of terms explained and
 by a Table of Contents. Then there is a collection of the most
 important passages in which the present work differs from the
 “1862” text. This occupies pp. 384–396. Then the important
 “Notes” take up pp. 397–495. A full index completes the
 volume. What is now wanted—as has been pointed out else
 where more than once we think—is a translation into English
 which should render Grassmann's original views easily accessible
 to a much larger circle of readers than exists at present.
Graphical Calculus. By A. H. BARKER, B.A., B.Sc. (Longmans,
    1896. Pp. viii-H 188.)
 PROF. GOODMAN, who furnishes a brief introduction, writes:—“I
 have frequently h             ts come under my notice who, although
 fairly good mat                as far as bookwork is concerned, yet
through not                    e advantage of a practical mathematical
training we                 sea when they came to apply their mathe
matics to a          engineering problem.” It is Mr. Barker's object
in this boo         elp such a one to acquire an intelligent working
knowledge of the Calculus, and after a perusal of the major portion
of it we can endorse Prof. Goodman's commendations.           The stu
 dent who carefully goes through all the constructions and keeps
 in mind the author's injunction to aim at grasping the meaning
 underlying all the symbo's employed should be no mean proficient
 in their use, and not one “who performs algebraical operations in
 a haphazard fashion without making himself acquainted with the
 principle involved.” Besides a careful discussion of the principles
—and of the methods of differentiation and integration there are
 numerous applications to practical questions. In an appendix
 there is a figure and a description (given here for the first time)
of a Planimeter devised by Mr. Barker. We have detected very
few slips: on p. 5 it is not stated that the curve is a circle; on
 pp. 61, 133 + is given where the sign should be — ; on p. 96 the
 value of e is slightly incorrect; and on p. 156, ex. (1), there would
 seem to be some slip. The type and the figures are good, but the
 punctuation is defective. One little point the author might cor
 rect in subsequent editions, viz. the frequent statement “as will be
 presently explained,” and the like references to future chapters.

knowledge of the palaeontological details, has fully sustained the
results of the author's previous investigations. The rapid attenua
tion and final disappearance of the Speeton Series in a westerly
direction in Yorkshire is discussed, and though the available
evidence is held to be insufficient to demonstrate the exact conditions,
 it is stated that, contrary to the accepted view, the lower zones are
 probably the first to die out and are overstepped or overlapped by
 the higher divisions, since at Knapton, 14 miles inland, only the
 upper zones of the coast-section can be proved to occur, as shown
by the presence of marls with Bel. minimus passing upward into
 the Red Chalk, and by the fossils preserved in the old collections
 including Hoplites Deshayesii under the name of Amm. knaptonensis,
 Bean MS., and a few others of the same zone.                                -
    The ferruginous sands locally occurring beneath the Red Chalk
 on the western edge of the Yorkshire Wolds are recognized as
 agreeing in all respects with the Lincolnshire Carstone; and Mr. A.
 Strahan's conclusions as to the relations of this division to the Red
 Chalk are confirmed both in Yorkshire and in Lincolnshire.
     In Mid-Lincolnshire all the palaeontological zones of Speeton are :
 identified and traced, the presence of the leading zonal types of the
 cephalopoda readily establishing the general correlation proposed
 by Prof. A. Pavlow and the author, in spite of the greatly modified
 lithological aspect of the deposits and the corresponding modification
 of their fauna.     The chief features of this correlation, which differs
 in many respects from that adopted by Prof. Judd and the Geological
  Survey, are as follows:–

   simultaneously in comparative proximity to each other. The

during a temporary pause in the sedimentation.
    The ‘Zone of Bel. lateralis’ (Série Speetono-russe of Pavlow) is
shown to bridge over the space between undoubtedly Jurassic and
undoubtedly Lower Cretaceous strata; but according to the recent
results of Prof. A. Pavlow, if the accepted classification of other
areas is to be upheld, the division between the two systems must be
placed high enough to include this zone in the Jurassic, in spite of
the local inconvenience of this arrangement.

     The ‘mid-Glacial’ sands of the cliffs between Yarmouth and

  farther north than Corton some masses of the same clay occur in
 the interior of the cliffs, surrounded by the sands in undisturbed
 stratification, but passing into them by strings and patches such as
 suggest the melting off of enveloping ice. They have probably
 been floated and dropped there.
     Again, gravels lying in a valley of Chalky Boulder Clay in West
  Suffolk (Cockfield &c.), and indicating considerable denudation of
  the Clay, yet have some patches and sheets of that Clay overlying
  them as if carried down or slipped down from higher ground.
     This may explain some anomalous positions of Boulder Clay
  noted by writers. The Lowestoft observations suggest that Chalky
  Boulder Clay was being manufactured in one locality simultaneously
  with ‘mid-Glacial’ sands in another.

     The following communications were read:—
     1. ‘On the Morte Slates and Associated Beds in North Devon and
  West Somerset.—Part I. By Henry Hicks, M.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
     In a paper read before the Society in 1890 the author stated that
  he had found the Morte Slates to be fossiliferous, and had come to
  the conclusion that they were the oldest rocks in the North Devon
   area and had been thrust over much newer rocks, producing a
  deceptive appearance of conformity; and that there was not a con
  tinuous upward succession in the rocks from the Bristol Channel to
   the neighbourhood of Barnstaple. Since that paper was read, the

 522                      Geological Society :
 author has obtained much additional evidence bearing on the suc
  cession, which is given in the present paper so far as the position
  and age of the Morte Slates in the Ilfracombe area is concerned.
     The author describes the lithological characters and fossil contents
 of the Morte Slates, and their relationships to the Pickwell Down
  Sandstones and Ilfracombe Beds, treating of the development of the
 rocks in four areas, viz.:-Morthoe and Woolacombe to Bittadon ;
 Rockham Bay, Bull Point, Lee, and Slade; Mullacott, Shelfin, and
 Ilfracombe; and Woolscott Barton, Smithson, and Berry Down.
 The great abundance of detrital mica in the Ilfracombe Beds
 and Pickwell Down group, and its almost entire absence from the
 Morte Slates is noticed. The faulted junction of the Pickwell Down
 Sandstones and Morte Slates is described, and it is held that the
 faulting has not thrust older beds over newer, as maintained by
 Jukes, but that the order of succession is the original one, whereas
  the overthrust fault separates the Morte Slates from the now under
 lying though newer Ilfracombe Beds, which often dip away from
 the Morte Slates, while different members of the Ilfracombe series
 abut against the Morte Slates, so that the latter form a complex
  group of older rocks bounded on either side by newer strata.
 The author states that the fossils found in the Morte Slates belong
  to several horizons, some probably as low in position as the base of
 the Silurian (Upper Silurian of the Geological Surveyors), while
 none of the beds of the series appear to be newer than the older
 Devonian. In some places newer rocks may occur amongst them
 as the result of faulting or unconformity, but not in order of
 succession.
    A description of the species found in the Slates is appended
 to the paper.
    2. “Evidences of Glacial Action in Australia in Permo-Carboni
 ferous Time.     By Prof. T. W. Edgeworth David, B.A., F.G.S.
    The author, after summarizing the work of previous observers,
 gives an account of recent observations made by himself.
    In Hallett's Cove, near Adelaide, the pre-Cambrian rocks are
 strongly glaciated, striae being seen when the overlying glacial beds
are removed, as sharply cut as though caused by recent glacial
 action, and trending nearly north and south, the ice having come
 from the south. The overlying glacial beds are in places fairly
 stratified, while parts contain abundance of well-striated boulders:
these beds are from 23 to over 100 feet thick.     Proofs were obtained
that in this case the glaciation occurred in an age intermediate
 between Miocene and pre-Cambrian, and probably did not antedate
the close of the Palaeozoic period.
    In Wild Duck Creek near Heathcote, Lower Silurian (Ordovician)
beds exhibit strongly-grooved, polished surfaces, the grooves being
from S. 5° E. to N. 5° W., the ice probably having come from the
south. They are succeeded by Permo-Carboniferous glacial beds,
 consisting chiefly of mudstones with well-glaciated boulders.
    At Bacchus Marsh Ordovician beds are also well-striated and

              On certain Granophyres in Strath (Skye).             523
polished, and more or less moutonnée. Here also the ice came from
a southerly point. These beds are succeeded by Permo-Carboni
ferous glacial beds having an approximate thickness of at least 2000
feet, consisting of mudstones with well-glaciated boulders.
    It is extremely probable that the glacial beds of Bacchus Marsh,
Wild Duck Creek, and Springhurst in Victoria were of homotaxial
if not contemporaneous origin, and they may probably be correlated
with the glacial conglomerates at Mount Reid in Tasmania, these
correlations being mainly based on lithological evidence. The evi
dence for the correlation of the Bacchus Marsh glacial beds with
the erratic-bearing Permo-Carboniferous mudstones of Maria Island,
One Tree Point, and Bruni Island in Tasmania, of Maitland, Branxton,
and Grasstree in N.S. Wales, and of the Bower River coalfields in
Queensland, is that the genus Gangamopteris is distributed somewhat
abundantly throughout the formations in all these localities.
    This glaciation was probably homotaxial with that of the period
of the Dwyka Conglomerate and Ecca Beds of Southern Africa, and
of the Talchir Group of the Salt Range of India, the Boulder Beds
in Western Rajputana, and the Panjáh Conglomerates of Kashmir.
In the case of Southern Africa and India, as in that of Australia, the
general direction in which the ice moved appears to have been from
south to north.    In the Bacchus Marsh beds there are at least 9 or
10 distinct boulder-beds separated by sandstones and conglomerates;
this may possibly indicate a sequence of glacial periods separated
by milder interglacial periods. The glacial conditions in Australia
may have been prolonged into early Mesozoic times, as indicated by
the Mesozoic facies of certain plants in the uppermost glacial beds
of Bacchus Marsh.

    The rocks described form a group of irregular intrusions, the
 largest less than a mile in length, situated in the tract of volcanic
 agglomerate north and west of Loch Kilchrist. They differ from
 the normal granophyres, abundantly developed in the neighbourhood,
 in being darker, denser, and manifestly richer in the iron-bearing
 minerals, while in places are seen numerous small rock-fragments
 evidently of extraneous origin.
     The fragments are mainly of gabbro. Closer examination shows
 that they have been abundantly distributed through the granophyre,
 but most of them have been more or less completely dissolved. The
  clearest evidence of this is afforded by the augite of the gabbro,

version to hornblende.      The material dissolved has rendered the
acid magma less acid, and has influenced accordingly the products
of final consolidation. The granophyre is roughly estimated to have
taken up about one-fourth of its mass of gabbro, and this material
has been derived, not from the rocks seen in contact with the
intrusions, but from some subterranean source.
   3. ‘Observations on the Geology of the Nile Walley, and on the
Evidence of the greater Volume of that River at a former Period.’
By Prof. E. Hull, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The author draws attention to the two great periods of erosion
of the Nile Walley, the first during the Miocene period, after the
elevation of the Libyan region at the close of Eocene times, and the
second during a ‘pluvial’ period extending from late Pliocene times
into and including the Pleistocene. He notes the course of the
river through escarpments of the granitic and schistose rocks of
Assuan, the Nubian Sandstone, the Cretaceous limestone, and the
Eocene limestone, and observes that in places the line of erosion of
the primaeval Nile was directed by dislocations of the strata. Evi
dence of the unconformity of the Nubian Sandstone upon the granites
and schists of Assuan is given, and some observations made upon
the age of the different parts of the Nubian Sandstone.
    In the second part of the paper the terraces of the Nile Walley
 are described, and full details given of the characters of a second
terrace, at a height varying from 50 to 100 feet above the lower
 one, which is flooded at the present day. The second terrace is
 devoid of vegetation, and its deposits have frequently furnished
 river-shells such as Cyrena fluminalis, AEtheria semilunata, Unio,
 Paludina, &c.     The second terrace is traceable at intervals for a
 distance of between 600 and 700 miles above Cairo.             Two old
 river-channels are also described, one at Koru Ombo, and the other
 at Assuan itself. The author discusses the mode of origin of the
 second terrace and the old river-valleys, and believes them to be
 due to the former greater volume of the river, and not to subsequent
 erosion of the valley.   He gives further evidence of the existence of
 meteorological conditions sufficient to give rise to a ‘pluvial’ period,
 and points out that other authors have also considered that the volume
 of the Nile has been greater in former times.

ON THE DIFFUSION OF METALs.               BY W. C. ROBERTs-AUSTEN,
    C.B., F.R.S., PROFESSOR OF METALLURGY, ROYAL COLLEGE OF
    SCIENCE.
                 PART I.—Diffusion of Molten Metals.
IN     the first part of the paper the author alludes to some earlier
      experiments he made in 1883 on the diffusion of gold, silver,

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            525
and platinum in molten lead. He points out that although the action
of osmotic pressure in lowering the freezing-point of metals has
been carefully examined, very little attention has been devoted to
the measurement, or even to the consideration, of the molecular
movements which enable two or more metals to form a truly
homogeneous fluid mass. The absence of direct experiments on
the diffusion of molten metals is probably explained by the want of
a sufficiently accurate method. Ostwald had stated, moreover,
with reference to the diffusion of salts, that “to make accurate
experiments in diffusion is one of the most difficult problems in
practical physics,” and the difficulties are obviously increased when
molten metals diffusing into each other take the place of salts
diffusing into water.
    The continuation of the research was mainly due to the interest
Lord Kelvin had always taken in these experiments. The want
of a ready method for the measurement of comparatively high
temperatures, which led to the abandonment of the earlier work,
was overcome when the author arranged his recording pyrometer,
and the use of thermo-junctions in connexion with this instrument
 rendered it possible to measure and record the temperature at
 which diffusion occurred. Thermo-junctions were placed in three
 or more positions in either a bath of fluid metal or an oven care
 fully kept hotter at the top than at the bottom. In the bath or
 oven, tubes filled.with lead were placed, and in this lead, gold, or
 a rich alloy of gold, or of the metal under examination, was allowed
 to diffuse upwards against gravity. The amount of metal diffusing
 in a given time was ascertained by allowing the lead in the tubes
 to solidify; the solid metal was then cut into sections, and the
 amount of metal in the respective sections determined by analysis.
    The movement in linear diffusion is expressed, in accordance
 with Fick's law, by the differential equation
                              dy     d”y
                              * = k.     •
                              dt     da”
     In this equation a represents distance in the direction in which
  diffusion takes place, v is the degree of concentration of the diffu
  sing metal, and t is the time; k is the diffusion constant, that is,
  the number which expresses the quantity of the metal in grams
  diffusing through unit area (1 square centim.) in unit time (one
  day) when unit difference of concentration (in grams per cubic
  centim.) is maintained between the two sides of a layer 1 centim.
  thick. The author's experiments have shown that metals diffuse
  in one another just as salts do in water, and the results were
  ultimately calculated by the aid of tables prepared by Stefan for
  the calculation of Graham’s experiments on the diffusion of salts.
     The necessary precautions to be observed and the corrections to
  be made are described at length, and the values of the diffusivity
  of various metals in lead are then given.

526            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   The values for k, the diffusivity, given in square centimetres per
day, are as follows:—

                 Gold in mercury . . . .      0.71 at 11°.
   In order to afford a term of comparison, it may be stated that
the diffusivity of chloride of sodium in water at 18° is 1:04.
   The author at present refrains from drawing any conclusion as
to the evidence which the results afford respecting the molecular
constitution of metals. It is, however, evident that they will be
of value in this connexion, because, with the exception of the
gases, they present the simplest possible case of diffusion which
can occur—the diffusion of one element into another.
   Thus the relatively slow rate of diffusion of platinum as com
pared with gold points to its having a more complex molecule
than the latter.
                 PART II.—Diffusion of Solid Metals.
   The second part of the paper is devoted to the consideration of
the diffusion of solid metals.       Much of the evidence is historical,
for there has long been a prevalent belief that diffusion can take
place in solids, and the practice in conducting important industrial
operations supports this view. In this connexion the author cites
two truly venerable “cementation” processes. The object in the
first of these is the removal of silver from a solid gold-silver alloy,
while the second is employed in steel-making by the carburization
of solid iron. In both of these processes, however, a gas may
intervene, though the carburization of iron by the diamond, which
had been effected in vacuo by the author, suggests that if a gas
does intervene in the latter case, its quantity must be very minute.
In connexion with the mobility of various elements in iron the
work of Colson, of Osmond, and of Moissan is specially referred to.
   The author points out that in 1820 Faraday and Stodart showed
that platinum will alloy with steel at a temperature at which even
the steel is not melted, and they express their interest in the
formation of alloys by cementation, that is by the union of solid
metals.
   The remarkable view expressed by Graham, in 1863, that the
“three conditions of matter (liquid, solid, and gaseous) probably
always exist in every liquid or solid substance, but that one pre
dominates over the other,” is shown to have afforded ground for

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            527
the anticipation that metals would diffuse into each other at tem
peratures far below their melting-points. Reference is then made
to the important work by Spring in 1886 on the lead-tin alloys,
which retained a certain amount of molecular activity after they
had become solid; and special importance is attached to the proof
afforded by Spring, that alloys may be formed either by the strong
compression of the finely divided constituent metals at the ordinary
temperature (1882) or (1894) by the union of solid masses of
metal compressed together at temperatures which varied from
180° in the case of lead and tin, to 400° in the case of copper and
zinc.; tin melting at 227° and zinc at 415°.
   The evidence as to the volatilization of solid metals is then
traced, and allusion is made to the expression of Robert Boyle's
belief, that even such solid bodies as glass and gold might respec
tively “have their little atmospheres, and might in time lose their
 weight.”
   Merget's experiment on the evaporation of frozen mercury is
 quoted in relation to Gay-Lussac's well-known discovery that the
 vapours emitted by ice and water both at 0°C. are of exactly equal
 tension.
    Demarçay’s experiments on the volatilization of metals in vacuo
 at comparatively low temperatures is connected with the evidence
 afforded by Spring (1894), that the interpenetration of two metals
 at a temperature below the melting-point of the more fusible of
 the two is preceded by volatilization.
    The author then points out that, interesting as the results of
 the earlier experiments are, as affording evidence of molecular
 interpenetration, they do not, for the purpose of measuring diffu
 sivity, come within the prevailing conditions in the ordinary
 diffusion of liquids, in which the diffusing substance is usually in
 the presence of a large excess of the solvent, a condition which has
 been fully maintained in the experiments on the diffusion of liquid
 metals described in the first part of the paper. Wan't Hoff has
 made it highly probable that the osmotic pressure of substances
 existing in a solid solution is analogous to that in liquid solutions,
 and obeys the same laws: and it is probable that the behaviour
 of a solid mixture, like that of a liquid mixture, would be greatly
 simplified if the solid solution were very dilute.
    The author proceeds to describe his own experiments on the
 diffusion of solid metals. They are of the same nature as in the
 case of fluid metals, except that the gold, which is the metal
 chosen for examination, was placed at the bottom of a solid cylinder
 of lead instead of a fluid one.                                         -
    In the first series of experiments, cylinders of lead, 70 millims.
 long, with either gold, or a rich alloy of gold and lead at their base,
 were maintained at a temperature of 251° (which is 75° below the
 melting-point of lead) for thirty-one days. At the end of this
 period the solid lead was cut into sections, and the amount of gold
 which had diffused into each of them was determined in the usual

 528            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
way. Other experiments follow, in which the lead was maintained
 at 200°, and at various lower temperatures down to that of the
 laboratory. The following are the results:—
                                               o              k.

             92        35      39      39    100   . . . . 0-00002
   The experiments at the ordinary temperature are still in pro
gress, but there is evidence that slow diffusion of gold in lead
occurs at the ordinary temperature. The author points out that if
clean surfaces of lead and gold are held together in vacuo at a
temperature of only 40° for four days, they will unite firmly, and
can only be separated by the application of a load equal to one
third of the breaking strain of lead itself.
   The author thinks it will be considered remarkable that gold
placed at the bottom of a cylinder of lead, 70 millims. long (which
is to all appearance solid), will have diffused to the top in notable
quantities at the end of three days. He points out that at 100°
the diffusivity of gold in solid lead can readily be measured, though
its diffusivity is only 1/100,000 of that in fluid lead at a tempera
ture of 500°. He also states that experiments which are still in
progress show that the diffusivity of solid gold in solid silver, or
copper, at 800° is of the same order as that of gold in solid lead
at 100°.
   He concludes by warmly thanking Mr. A. Stansfield, B.Sc., who
assisted him in all but the earlier portion of the work, and by
expressing the hope that the experiments described in the paper
will show that the diffusion can readily be measured in solid
metals, and that they will carry one step further the work of
Graham.—Proceedings of the Royal Society, February 20, 1896,

RöNTGEN RAYS NOT PRESENT IN SUNLIGHT.               BY M. CAREY LEA.
   If Prof. Röntgen's views as to the nature of the w-rays are cor
rect, it would seem that they ought to be found amongst the
many forms of radiant energy received from the sun, and various
observers have thought that they so found them. Some experi
ments, the most important of which will be here briefly stated, do
not seem to support this opinion.
   1. A very sensitive dry plate (S. 27) was placed between the
leaves of a book so that 100 leaves and the red paper cover should
be between the sensitive film and the sunlight. The book was
then packed in a box-frame to exclude all light from the sides. A
large and thick lead star was then fastened on the outside of the
book and the arrangement was exposed to exceptionally bright
sunshine from 11 A.M. to sunset, March 7. The plate when put

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.          529
into a developing-bath behaved as if unexposed. A prolonged
development did not bring out a trace of an image of the lead star.
   It will be remembered that Prof. Röntgen found that the w-rays
penetrated easily through a book of 1000 printed pages. Indeed
G. Moreau has recently stated that in his hands the v-rays had
penetrated through “several metres” of cardboard". So that the
above experiment seems to be very significant.
   2. A piece of sheet aluminium 1.2 millim. thick was accurately
fitted into a frame. A very sensitive plate was placed behind it
and a lead star in front. With three hours' exposure not a trace
of an image could be obtained. This experiment was varied by
substituting thin aluminium-foil for the plate, also by using
bromide-paper as the sensitive surface. No images in any case
were obtained.
   3. The sun's rays or some portion of its radiation passes readily
through wood if the latter is not too thick. Thus, through a piece
of white pine # of an inch thick, images that could readily be
developed were obtained by three minutes’ exposure to afternoon
sunlight. With half an hour's exposure the images were brilliant.
   A panel about 12 inches square was removed from an inside
shutter and replaced with a piece of white pine # inch thick.
When the room was thoroughly darkened, reddish light could be
seen to pass through the board. So that wood of this thickness is
plainly translucent to the sight.
   The sun's light may be examined for a-rays also by fluorescence.
   4. The panel just described was replaced by one of stout book
board. With the sun shining on this book-board directly and not
through glass, paper marked with a saturated solution of barium
platinocyanide exhibited no indications of fluorescence when placed
behind the board.
   5. Three thicknesses of Bristol-board were pasted together, a
circle was cut out, to one side of which barium platinocyanide was
applied. The circle was then placed in a pasteboard tube (an
arrangement, I believe, proposed by Prof. Magie). When the sun
was looked at through this tube the barium salt exhibited fluor
escence. But the interposition between the card and the sun of
very thin aluminium-foil sufficed to cut off the fluorescence.
   These concurrent results seem to indicate the absence of a-rays
from sunlight.
   Charles Henry" quotes an opinion of H. Poincaré that all
bodies whose phosphorescence is sufficiently intense emit in
addition to luminous rays the a-rays of Röntgen, whatever may
be the cause of their fluorescence. Henry quotes confirmatory
experiments of his own made with zinc sulphide.
   It seemed worth while to ascertain if this principle is of general
application. A dilute solution of uranin was exposed to sunlight,

 using a large surface of solution so as to get the best effect. A
 short distance over the surface was placed a sensitive film pro
 tected by aluminium-foil 1, of a millimetre in thickness and with
 a lead star interposed. Two hours’ exposure gave no result. The
 experiment was repeated with acid solution of quinine, with which
 five hours’ exposure gave no result.
    I have also examined the Welsbach light for a-rays. This light
 is usually burned under a chimney which increases the brightness
 but interposes glass between the source of light and the sensitive
 film. Even without a chimney the light is bright. The experi
 ment was therefore made both ways. No v-rays could be detected.

          ON A NEW AREOMETER.        BY L.-N. VANDEVY VER.
     The instrument is of glass, and consists of a cylinder di
 vided in two parts by a horizontal watertight diaphragm C. The
 part B forms a small reservoir, closed at D by a ground stopper.
 To the cylinder is attached a stem carrying a scale
 which may be graduated in different ways. We shall
 assume that this scale is graduated for liquids
 heavier than water, with densities between 1:00
 (water) and 1.6, for instance.
    The liquid whose specific gravity is to be deter
 mined serves as ballast.
    Suppose it desired to verify the initial point of
the graduation. For this purpose the instrument
 is inverted, and the part B is filled with distilled
 water at a temperature t; the stopper is inserted
 without allowing air to enter; the apparatus can
then be held upright without any fear of the stopper
 falling out; it is wiped and placed in a cylinder com
 taining distilled water at the same temperature t.
 The point to which it sinks should correspond to
 the point 1:00 of graduation on the stem.
    The same process is repeated for the liquid whose
density is to be determined, care being taken to clean
the apparatus each time it is used; distilled water
being always used for the immersion. The liquid
introduced into B being denser than water the total
weight of the apparatus is greater, and it sinks to a
greater depth, giving a new level which represents
the density.
    By taking for extreme limits of the scale densities which are
sufficiently near together, the densineter may be made         very
sensitive.

             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             531
  In order to prove this I constructed one specially for deter
mining the densities of the worts of Belgian beers, which vary
only between 1:00 and 1:06. The scale, extending over a length of
about 24 centimetres, is graduated 1:00, 1:005, 1:01, 1:015, ... 1:06,
Between each two of these divisions are four large and five inter
mediate ones, making nine equidistant divisions of about 2 millims.
The third decimal can thus easily be read with accuracy; and the
fourth can be obtained with approximation amply sufficient for
practical purposes, as is proved by determinations made by the aid
of the apparatus and rigorously controlled by the method of the
specific-gravity flask.
   This densimeter has many advantages which we may point out.
   I. All ballast is suppressed, whether shot or mercury, and thus
the apparatus is less heavy and less subject to fracture.
   II. Correction for capillarity is dispensed with, seeing that we
always work in distilled water, which can always be taken in the
same conditions.
   III. The volume of the liquid with which we work need not be
measured, being constant. (In this respect the instrument has
the advantage over other densimeters which depend on the same
principle, such as those of Rousseau, Pâquet, Laska.)
   IV. The density of even a small quantity of liquid may be
determined.
   W. It is convenient for determining viscous liquids.
   WI. The temperatures of the liquid and of the distilled water do
not differ during the operation.
   VII. Calculation shows that the results obtained are indepen
dent of the temperature worked at, at least for considerable
differences. Allowing for the expansion of the liquid, that of the
apparatus, and that of the water of immersion, it will be seen that
these effects almost exactly compensate one another, especially if
the liquid and the water are taken at the same temperature. Expe
riment shows that even with the instrument mentioned above,
which has been graduated at 15° C., we may take the density
indifferently from 8° to 9°C. to 19° or 20°C., without the results
differing by more than 1 to 2 units in the fourth decimal place.
   VIII. The instrument can, lastly, be easily cleaned.
   The apparatus is also constructed for liquids less dense than
water. The division 1:00 is then at the top of the scale; and
putting the division 1:00 at the middle of the scale, we can with
one and the same instrument, within certain limits, determine
densities above and below that of water, especially if we are
satisfied with a result correct to the second decimal and approxi
mately so to the third.—From a separate impression from the
Arch. Sci. Phys. et Nat. t. xxxiv. p. 409, communicated by the
