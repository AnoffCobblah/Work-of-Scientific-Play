manner : You first calcine a mixture of lead and tin, which
may be varied       in the following proportions ; viz. for ioo
 parts of lead, 15, 20, 30, and even 40 of tin.        A mixture of
 lead and tin calcines very easily in contact with the air.       As
 soon as this mixture is brought to a red heat, nearly a cherry
 colour, it burns like charcoal, and is calcined very speedily.
 The composition which calcines best, is that which in 100
 pounds of lead contains from 20 to 35 of tin. The tin here
 meant is pure tin.      In proportion as the calcination is ef
 fected, you must take out the calcined part, and continue to
  oxydate  the rest until the whole has become pulverulent.       As
  some small particles   always escape calcination, you must ex
  pose to the fire a second   time the oxyd obtained in order to
  calcine it completely; which may be easily known by its
  ceasing to sparkle ; that is to fay,    when you no longer fee
  any parts burn like coal, and when the whole appears of aa
  uniform colour.      When the proportion of tin exceeds 25
  or 30, a stronger fire is neceflary to produce the calcination.
  In a word, by varying the degrees of heat you will be able

 operate.
      A   hundred parts of the calx above mentioned, which in the
 French potteries is called calcine, is generally taken with 100
 parts of sand. From 25 to 30 pounds of fea-falt, or muriat of
 soda, are added  the whole is well mixed together, and it is
                           :
fused in the bottom of a furnace in which potter's ware is
baked. This matter is generally placed on sand, on lime
quenched in the open air, or on ashes.                                       The bottom of the
mass      is   in    badly fused.
                     general         This, however, does not
prevent the matter, after it has been pounded, and applied on
the articles, from becoming exceedingly white and hard in
the furnace.             When          taken from the furnace it is not white j
it    is even       often very black               :    in   general         it is marbled with
black, gray, and white.
   This process is that generally used      potteries.    In the       ii1
¦compositions destined for earthen-ware,  the proportion of 25
parts of tin to 100 of lead      never exceeded     for common

perfection of which                 it   is   susceptible.             In     that ease, you do
not employ           crude sand, but calcine                     it,   in   a    strong heat,        with
a    quarter os its weight               of marine           salt, cither        in   a   small quan
tity in    a   crucible,           or on      a   large scale          in    a   potter's furnace.
If you     wish (o have            a   very fusible enamel, you may even add
minium, or           lead calcined            by   the former operation, and nearly

the same proportions as sand : you may even diminish the
quantity of this matter to 50 per cent, if you are desirous to
obtain an enamel very fusible. This will depend also on the
calcine employed ; for that which is most charged             with tin is
the least fusible.
    When you      wish to have fluxes for the colours, you employ
the fame      compositions before mentioned, except that             you
put    little or no tin into the lead.        In the latter cafe     you
must generally employ minium. This flux is good for                  cer
tain colours, but not for all. There are some which                   be
come tarnished by fluxes, that contain the oxyds of lead.              In
that cafe, you must make fluxes without oxyd of lead. Nitre
and borax are generally used for making this glass, but you
add no calx of tin.        The following are those which I have
 tried   :
    Three parts of siliceous sand, one os chalk, and three of
 calcined borax, give a matter proper to be used as a flux for
 purples, blues, and other delicate colours.
    Three parts of white or flint glass, one of calcined borax,
 a quarter    of a part of nitre, one of the white oxyd of anti
 mony made with nitre well washed, give an exceedingly
 white enamel, which may         serve also as a   flux for purple, and
 particularly for blue.
    Sixty parts    of   enamel  sand or less, thirty    of alum, thirty-
 five   of sea-salt,   and  a  hundred of minium, or any other
 oxyd of lead,       give  a white    enamel    when      the fluxes do
 not predominate too much,          and  a  gelatinous glass when a
 great deal    of  fluxes has been    added.    This glass is good for
 ted, and the enamel        may be applied to all kinds of clay ca
 pable of sustaining a strong     heat.
     It is of great importance    to remark, and to know, that the
 sand employed       for  enamel  must not be sand which contains
 only silex : sand of that kind alone is of no use. The sand
 proper for this purpose is that which contains talc with silex.
 To make a sand proper for enamel and the fluxes of colours,
 8cc. there must be nearly one part        of  talc   and   three of  sili
 ceous sand.
     What appears to me most essential in regard to the success
 of enamel, is the choice of faud. It is very possible to com
                                                                      pose

I    have                 by
                 synthesis, that three parts of siliceous sand
               found
and one of talc form an excellent sand for enamel. From
this  may be readily seen, that, to compose with facility sand
      it
for enamel, nothing     necessary but to determine,
                                 is                       good                by   a
analysis, the quantity of talc. This  sand may be  procured in
places where earthen-ware       made. It may be easily known;
                                            is
for, besides the siliceous sand, which forms the greatest part
of     you may observe in
     it,                        talcky particles in great abun

                                                                           a
When        it  does not contain            a   sufficient quantity, the enamel         it
produces         fuses    with more difficulty,               and docs not become
smooth      remains granulated and pitted. There are cer
            ;    it
tainly some combinations   of earth which may produce very
good fluxes, either for enamel or for transparent colours.                              It
might be attended with advantage to try some of these com
binations.   Ponderous earth (barytes) and lime fuse very
well together      by adding
                      :       little silex, or
                                        a      little magnesia,     a
it   is probable that an excellent matter might be produced.
If    this glass, composed of lime and barytes only, had suffi
cient solidity to resist the air and weak acids, there would be
no necessity perhaps to add silex but       the marine salt, as
                                                   ;       if
I am inclined to think, ought also to enter into the compo
sition of this kind of glass, silex ought likewise to form part                    a
of it. The experiments on this head, for the fake of trial,
may be varied different ways. When the glass destined to
serve as flux for colours employed,     customary, in order
                                       is                it   is
that they may be rendered more fusible, to add   little nitre            a
and borax.             The common borax of the shops contains an
excess      of   soda,   which, in my opinion,    would be of benefit
                                                              it
to saturate           with the nitric acid.   think also that the flux
                                                       I
might          be rebaked       with the dose os nitre and borax, or                    of
nitric borax, which   might be added before being employed.
It   only
     is    to colours such as purple and the oxyd of cobalt
that nitre and borax are added.
 I        have tried to find       a   substitute for marine salt        in   the com
position of white enamel.     Potash produced only an ugly
and ill fused gray mass, which acquired no lustre in the fur
nace   j       nitre produced      a   green mass, but exceedingly friable              ;
                                                                                   sulphat

                         Composition      of Enamel.                        J
fulphat of potafli produced         very     nearly the same effect, only
the mass was a little whiter            :   but neither of these enamels
was worth any thing.            I   did net try pure soda: I have,
however, heard common            soda extolled     ; but as it contains a
great deal of marine salt, it must undoubtedly be on account
 of this salt that it produces a good effect.               Pure soda may
nevertheless       be tried, either alone or        with marine salt; it
perhaps might produce no bad effect with potash.
    I  have tried also a mixture of equal parts of lime and argil,
to which I added one part of silex, and likewise without silex ;
 but this mixture did not supply the place of talcky sand. This
sand is not in general found in grains ; it exhibits itself most
 commonly under the form of a stone, such               as free-stone   ; but
 some    of it is found also in grains.
    We     should     be much   deceived       in making white enamel
 were we to employ the oxyds             of tin and lead separately, as I
 have read     in all the authors    I   could find who treat on the art
 of pottery.       None of them        fay what they ought respecting
 enamel, nor even respecting the composition or nature of the
 earth proper for bearing an enamel.
     It is essential that the    lead      and  tin for making      the oxyd
 destined to produce white enamel, should be fused and mixed
 together before they are calcined ; and if you wish that the
 enamel should immediately acquire its full whiteness, it will
 be requisite that the calcination should be complete.
     Bismuth might perhaps be employed as a substitute for
 the lead, and it is not improbable that it would give a good
 product.        Bismuth also might be mixed with the lead in the
  following manner ; viz. one part of lead, one of bismuth, and
  one   of tin  :  or other proportions might be employed ; but I
  have not tried any others.         As the oxyd of bismuth, how
  ever, is exceedingly fusible, I think it might be admitted,
  with great advantage, into certain fluxes. I have not tried
  what might be produced by the white calx of zinc, nor by
  that of tin, made by dissolving it in the nitric acid or by de
  tonation with nitre. A mixture of lead and tin, detonated
  with nitre, would      be useful.       Though    the white    calx of re-
  gulus of antimony       made by nitre, and well washed,            (diapho
  retic antimony,) produces       a very     beautiful white enamel when
                                                                         fused

 with   half or fourth part of
            a                                           nitre ; yet this calx, so white
 when mixed with the composition of enamel, made with
 enamel sand and the combined oxyd of lead and tin, instead
 of increasing,
            tarnishes the whiteness, and only gives a blueish
 enamel of  livid colour*.
                       a      Perhaps enamels, completely
 made and mixed together in the first instance, would not
 produce the fame effect; but this I never tried. I have,
 however, employed this composition as a flux for colours,
 which, applied afterwards on the enamel of earthen-ware,
 preserved its beauty.                  I    put some of this pure enamel also
 over that of earthen-ware,                           and   I   think it           preserved      its
 whiteness.
      The principal quality of                      good    enamel, and             that which
 renders      for being applied on baked earthen-ware, or on
                it   sit
metals, is the facility with which it acquires lustre by a mo
derate heat, (a cherry-red heat, more or less, according to
the nature of the enamel,) without entering into complete
fusions. Enamels applied to earthen-ware and metals pos
sess   this quality.            They        do not enter         into complete fusion ;
they assume only the state                     of   paste, but of      a paste exceedingly
firm ; and yet when baked one might                              say   that they had been
completely fused.
   There are two methods of painting on enamel : on raw
or on baked enamel. Both these methods are employed, or
may be employed, for the fame object.  Solid colours, ca
pable of sustaining the sire necessary for baking the enamel
ground, may be applied in the form of fused enamel on that
which is raw, and the artist may afterwards finish with the
tender colours.   The colours applied on the raw material do
not require any flux ; there is one, even, to which filex must
be added, that               is,
                    the calx of copper, which gives       very                           a

 material, you must mix with it about two parts of its weight
 of silex, and bring the mixture into combination by means
 of heat. You afterwards pulverise the mass you have thu9
 obtained, in order to employ it.
    To obtain good white enamel, it is of great importance
 that the lead and tin should be very pure.                If these metals
 contain copper or antimony, as is often the cafe, the ena
 mel will not be beautiful : iron is the least hurtful.

    All the colours may be produced by the metallic oxyds.
 These colours are more or less fused in the fire, according as
 they adhere with more or less strength to their oxygen.                All
 metals which readily lose their oxygen cannot endure a great
 degree of heat, and are unfit for being wnployed on the- raw
 material.

    This colour is the oxyd of gold, which may                 be prepared
 different ways ; as by precipitating, by means of a muriatic
solution of tin, a nitro-muriatic solution of gold much diluted
in water. The least quantity possible of the solution of tin will
 be sufficient to form this precipitate.       The solution of tin must
be added gradually        until you   observe the purple colour begin
to appear : you then stop ; and having suffered the colour to
be deposited, you put it into an earthen vessel to dry slowly*.
The different solutions of gold, in whatever manner preci
pitated, provided the gold is precipitated in the state of an
oxyd, give always a purple colour, which will be more beau
tiful in proportion to the purity of the oxyd ; but neither the
copper nor stiver, with which gold is generally found allayed,
injure this colour in a sensible manner : it is changed, how
ever, by iron.       The gold precipitate which gives the most
beautiful purple is certainly fulminating gold, which loses
that property when mixed with fluxes. Purple is an abun
dant colour ; it is capable of bearing a great deal of flux,
and in a small quantity communicates its colour to a great
deal   of matter.     It  appears that saline fluxes are better suited
   • The colour is
                     always more beautiful,   if the. precipitate is ground
ivith the flux before it has become dry.—Edit.

10                     Researches    respecting   the
to it than those in which there are metallic calces. Those,
therefore, which have been made with filex, chalk, and bo
rax, or white glass, borax, and a little white oxyd of anti
mony, with a little nitre, as I have already mentioned, ought
to be employed with it. Purple will bear from four to twenty
parts of flux, and even more, according to the shade required.
Painters in enamel employ generally for purple a flux which
they call brilliant white. This flux appears to be a femi-
opake enamel, which has been drawn into tubes, and after
wards blown into a ball at an enameller's lamp. These bulbs
are afterwards broken in such a manner that the flux is found
in small   scales,   which                     of small hol
                             appear like the fragments
low spheres.   Enamel painters mix this flux with a little
nitre and borax.   This matter, which produces a very good
effect, I employed, without attempting to decompose it. It
may be a very fusible common white enamel which has been
blown into that form. It is to be remarked, that purple will
not bear a strong heat.
                                    Red.
     We   have              oxyd capable of giving directly a
                  no metallic
fused red ; that is to fay, we have no metallic calces which,
entering into fusion, and combining under the form of trans
parent glass with fluxes or glass, give directly a red colour.
To obtain this colour it must be compounded different ways,
as follows   :   — Take two parts, or two parts       half (you
                                                             and a
may, however, take only one part,)   of sulphat of iron and of
sulphat of alumine ; fuse them together in their water of crys
tallisation, and take care to mix them well together.     Con
tinue to heat them to complete dryness ; then increase the
fire so as to bring the mixture to a red heat.    The last
operation  must  be performed  in a reverberating furnace.
Keep the mixture red until it has every where assumed a
beautiful red colour, which you may ascertain by taking out
a little of it from time to time, and suffering it to cool in the
air.   You may. then        whether the matter is sufficiently
                             see
red : to judge of this it must be left to cool, because while
hqt it appears black. The red oxyds of iron give a red co
lour; but this colour        is exceedingly fugitive;         for,   as soon as
the oxyd of iron        enters into fusion, the portion of oxygen
which gives it its     red colour leaves    it,
                                            and   becomes black,
                                                        it
                                                                       yellow,

yellow, or greenish. To preserve, therefore, the red colour
of this oxyd in the fire, it must be prevented from vitrifying,
and abandoning its oxygen ; which may be accomplished by
the method I have indicated.      I have tried a variety of dif
ferent substances to give it this fixity, but none of them suc
ceeded except alum.      The doses of alum and sulphat of iron
may be varied.      The more alum you add, the paler will be
the colour.     Three parts of alum to one of sulphat of iron
give   a colour  which approaches flesh colour. It is alum also
which gives this colour the property of becoming fixed at a
very strong heat. This colour may be employed on raw
enamel : it has much more fixity than the purple, but not so
much as the blue of cobalt. It may be washed to carry off the
superfluous saline matter, but it may be employed also with
out edulcoration ; in that state it is even more fixed and more
beautiful.     It does not require much flux ; the flux which
 appeared   to  me to be best suited to       composed of alum,
                                                it,   is
 minium, marine salt, and enamel sand. This flux must be
 compounded in such          manner as to render
                             a                         sufficiently it
 fusible for its object    from two to three parts of
                           :                                     are              it
 mixed with the colour.      In general,  three parts of flux are
 used for one of colour    but this dose may, and ought to be
                             :
 varied according to the nature of the colour and the (hade of
it  required. Red calx of iron alone, when      enters intq fusion
                                                           it
 with glass, gives     acolour which seems to be black        but             ;         if
 the colour be diluted with sufficient quantity of glass,
                                    a                             at               it
 last becomes of transparent yellow. Thus, the colour really
                   a
 produced     by calx of iron combined with glass            yellow      is   a
 colour, but which being accumulated becomes             dark that       so
it   appears black.     In   the process above given for making the
 red colour, the oxyd        of iron    does not fuse           :   and this      is   the
essential point; for, this colour
                           if        carried in the fire to
                                             is                                        vi

the coat be thin, and the oxyd of iron present be only in                               a
small quantity.
                                    Yellow.
     Though yellow may           be obtained   in   a   direct manner, com
pound yellows are preferred        j    because they are more certain
 ifl   their effect, aud more easily           applied than the yellow,

  Ia                    Researches    refpeSing the
  which may     be directly obtained from silver.         The compound
  yellows are obtained in consequence of the same principles as
  the red colour of iron.       For this purpose we employ metallic
  oxyds, the vitrification of which must be prevented by mixing
  with them other     substances, such as refractory earths, or me
  tallic oxyds difficult to be fused.
     The metallic calces which form the bases               of the yellow
 colours are generally those of lead ; as minium, the white
  calx of lead, or litharge, the white calx of antimony, called
 diaphoretic antimony : that called crocus metallorum is also
 employed.       This regulus,     pulverised   and   mixed with white
 oxyd, gives likewise a yellow.           The following are the dif
 ferent compositions used : one part of the white oxyd of an
 timony, one of the white oxyd of lead (or two or three) ;
 these doses are exceedingly variable ; one part             of alum, and
 one of sal-ammoniac.          When     these matters have        been   all
 pulverised, and mixed well together, they are put in a vessel
 over a fire sufficient to sublimate and decompose the sal-am
moniac ; and when the matter has assumed                a yellow colour,
the operation is finished *. The calces of lead mixed in a
small quantity either with silex or alumine, also with the
pure calx of tin, exceedingly white,            give likewise yellows.
One part of      the  oxyd of lead is added to two, three, or four
of the other     substances above mentioned.          In these different
compositions for yellow, you may use also oxyd of iron, either
pure, or that kind which has been prepared with alum and
vitriol of iron : you will then obtain different shades of yel
low. From what has been said, you may vary these com
positions of yellow as much as you please.              Yellows require
so little flux, that one or two parts, in general, to one of th«
colour are sufficient;      saline  fluxes are improper for them,
and especially     those which contain nitre.             They must be
used    with fluxes composed of enamel sand, oxyd of lead, and
borax, without marine salt.
    A   yellow may be obtained also directly from silver.              AU
these mixtures may be varied, and you may try others.                  For
this purpose you may use sulphat of silver, or any oxyd of
that metal mixed with alumine or filex, or even with both,
              * This in colour-shops is called Naples yellow.

like purple, cannot endure     strong heat   a nitric solution   :    a

                                  the ammoniacal phosphat of
soda, and you         will obtain
                             yellow precipitate, which may be
                                         a
used to paint in that colour with fluxes, which ought then to
be  alittle harder.
    Besides the methods above mentioned,   the best manner of
employing    the oxyd   of silver in  my opinion,is,
                                                   to employ                                 it

the colour.           You must not employ                   too strong        a   heat: the
degree       will    easily be found            by   practice.    When the article
has been sufficiently heated,                   you take    it   from the fire and
separate the coating         of oxyd, which will be found reduced to
a   regulus     :   you will then  observe the place which     occu                 it

Jt    chiefly on transparent glass that this process succeeds
      is
best.  Very fine silver filings produce the fame effect but                              :
what seemed to me to succeed best in this cafe, was sulphat
of stiver, well ground up with little water, thata may be                       it
extended very smooth.    From what has been said, may rea                      it
dily be seen that this yellow must not be employed like other
colours that     must not be applied till the rest have been

h    would be injured              by   the other colours    ;   and as the coating
of silver which           is   reduced must be removed, the fluxes would
fix   it,   and prevent the possibility of its being afterwards sepa
rated.       Working on glass     not attended with this inconve
                                           is
nience, because the silver-yellow    applied on the opposite
                                                       is
fide to that on which the other colours are laid.
                                             Green.
      Green     is   obtained directly from the oxyd                       of copper.        All
the oxyds of copper are good they require little flux, which
                                                :

means of calx of copper. The process        as follows   You          is                   :
do not employ the calx of copper pure, out add to      calx of                           It
iron, which for that purpose must not be too 'much calcined                                          ;
you add also             a  small quantity
                              very                               of calx of copper             to the
mass     of   glass which you are desirous                 of tingeing. This glass
at first must have only                   a
                                              very flight tinge of green, inclining
to yellow.   When the glass has that colour you make    pass                                  it
to red, and even  very dark red, by mixing
                             a              with  red tartar                         it
in powder, and even tallow. You must mix this matter well
in   the glass, and           it   will   assume    a        very dark red colour.                 The
glass swells        up very much by this addition.      Before                                  it      is

we had certain processes for making this colour, we should
obtain all the shades of red from pure red to orange, by
 using, in different proportions, the oxyd of copper and that of
 iron. The calx of copper fuses argil more easily than silex i
 the cafe is the fame with calx of iron.        you fuse two or  If
 three parts of argil with one of the oxyd of copper, and if the
 heat be sufficient, you will obtain a very opake enamel, and
 of a vermilion red colour : the oxyd of copper passes from
 red to green          through yellow ;           so   that the enamel of copper,
 which   becomes           red at a strong heat, may be yellow             with a
 weaker heat.             The     fame  may be produced by deoxy-

 dating copper in different        degrees : this will be effected ac
 cording     as   the heat is more or less violent. The above com
 position might, I think, be employed to give a vermilion red
 colour to porcelain. The heat of the porcelain furnace ought
 to be of sufficient strength to produce the proper effect.
    The calx of iron fused also with argil in the same propor
 tions as the calx of copper, gives a very beautiful black. These
_ proportions may, however, be varied.

   Blue is obtained from the oxyd of cobalt. It is the most
 fixed of all colours, and becomes equally beautiful with a
 weak as with a strong heat. The blue produced by cobalt
 is more beautiful the purer it and the more  is,  oxydated.            it   is
 Arsenic does not hurt it. The saline fluxes which contain
 nitre are those best suited to   you add   little also when

    But the flux which, according                      to my experiments, gives to
 cobalt blue the greatest splendour and beauty,  that com                is

      Black calx of     manganese,     employed with saline fluxes,
  gives a very beautiful violet. By varying the fluxes, the shade
  of the colour may also be varied : it is very fixed as long as
  it retains its oxygen. The oxyd of manganese may produce
  different colours ; but for that purpose it will be necessary
  that we should be able to fix its Oxygen in it in different pro*
  portions.                                       I
                 How to effect this, as far as know, has never
  yet been discovered.
     These are all the colours obtained from metals*            From
  this it is evident that something still remains to be discovered.
  We    do not know     what might be produced by the oxyds of
  platina, tungsten, molybdena, and nickel : all these oxyds
 are still to be tried ; each of them must produce a colour,
 and perhaps red, Which is obtained neither directly nor with
 facility from any of the metallic substances formerly 'known
 and hitherto employed.
                        GENERAL       REMARKS.
     Those who paint on enamel, on earthen-ware, porcelain,
 &c. must regulate the fusibility of the colours by the most
 tender of those employed, as for example, the purple. When
 the degree which is best suited to purple has been found, the
other    less fusible colours may be so regulated, (by additions of
 flux,) when it is necessary to fuse all the colours at the fame
 time, and at the fame degree of heat.
     You may paint       also  in enamel without flux ; but all the
 colours do not equally stand         the heat which must be em
ployed.       If the enamel, however, on which you paint be
very fusible, they may all penetrate it. This manner of
painting gives no thickness of colour ; on the contrary, the
colours fink into the enamel at the places where the tints
are strongest.       To make them penetrate, and give them
lustre, a pretty strong fire will be necessary to soften the
enamel and bring it to a state of fusion. This method can
not be practised but on enamel composed with sand, which
I call enamel     sand, as already mentioned.      It may be readily
seen, also,     that the colours and enamel capable      of enduring

     But mercury, and            most, if not all       its oxyds, may, by
 treatment with nitric acid and alcohol, be converted into a
 whitish crystallised powder, possessing all the inflammable
 properties of gunpowder, as well as many peculiar to itself.
     I was     led to this discovery       by a late assertion, that hydro
 gen is the basis         of the muriatic       acid : it induced me to at
 tempt to combine different substances with hydrogen and
 oxygen. With this view, I mixed such substances with al
 cohol and nitric acid,            as   I thought might (by predisposing
 affinity) favour, as well          as  attract, an acid combination, of
the hydrogen of the one, and the oxygen of the other. The
pure red oxyd of mercury appeared not unfit for this pur
pose j it was therefore intermixed with alcohol, and upon
both nitric        acid    was   assused.    The acid did not        adt upon
the alcohol        so  immediately as when these fluids are alone
mixed together,          but first gradually dissolved the oxyd : how
ever,     after some minutes had elapsed, a smell of ether was
perceptible, and a white dense smoke, much resembling that
from the liquor fumans of Libavius, was emitted with ebul
lition.      The mixture then threw down a dark-coloured pre
cipitate, which by degrees became nearly white.                      This pre
cipitate     I   separated by filtration ;        and,    observing it to be
crystallised in small acicular crystals, of a saline taste, and
also finding a part of the mercury volatilised in the white
fumes,       I must acknowledge I was not altogether with
out hopes that muriatic acid had been formed, and united
to the mercurial oxyd.                 I therefore, for obvious reasons,
poured sulphuric          acid  upon the dried crystalline mass ; when
a violent effervescence ensued, and, to my great astonishment,
an explosion took place.
     The singularity of this explosion induced me to repeat the

     The instrument used in this experiment being familiarly

it to say, that it was of brass, mounted with a spring register,
 the moveable hand of which closed up the muzzle, to receive

     A gun belonging to Mr. Keir, an ingenious artist of
 Camdcn-town,          was next charged with 17 grains of the
 mercurial powder, and a leaden bullet.              A block of wood
 was placed at about eight yards from the muzzle to receive
 the ball, and the gun was sired by a fuse. No recoil seemed
 to have taken place ; as the barrel was not moved from its
 position, although it was in no ways confined.              The report
 was feeble : the bullet, Mr. Keir conceived, from the im
 pression made upon the wood, had been projected             with about
 half  the force    it would     have been by an ordinary charge, or
 68 grains, of the best gunpowder.              We therefore recharged
 the gun with 34 grains of the mercurial powder; and, as the
 great strength of the piece removed any apprehension of
  danger, Mr. Keir sired it from his shoulder, aiming at the
  same block     of wood.      The report was like the first in Sec
  tion  IV,  sliarp,   but not louder than might have been ex
  pected from a charge of gunpowder.             Fortunately, Mr. Keir
  was not hurt, but the gun was burst in an extraordinary
  manner.      The    breech was what is called       a patent one,   of
  the best forged       iron,   consisting   of a chamber 0,4 of an
  inch thick all round,       and 0,4    of an inch in caliber ; it was
  torn open and flawed in many directions, and the gold touch-
  hole driven out. The barrel, into which the breech was
   screwed,  was 0,5 of an inch thick ; it was split by a single
   crack three inches long, but this did not appear to me to be
   the immediate effect of the explosion. I think the screw of
                   9                                                 the

                   Oh a new fulminalUig Mercury.               ai
the breech, being suddenly enlarged, acted as a wedge upon
the barrel. The ball miffed the block of wood and struck
against a wall, which had already been the receptacle of so
many bullets, that we could not satisfy ourselves       about the
impression made by this last.
                            Section VI.
     As it was pretty plain that no gun     could confine a quan
 tity of the mercurial powder sufficient to project a bullet with
 a greater force than an ordinary charge of gunpowder, I de
 termined to try its comparative strength in another way.
     I procured two blocks of wood, very nearly of the fame
 size and strength, and bored them with the fame instrument
 to the fame depth.       The one was charged with   half an ounce
 of the best Dartford gunpowder, and the other with half an
 ounce of the mercurial powder ; both were alike buried in
  sand,   and fired by a train communicating     with the powders
  by a small touch-hole. The      block containing the gunpowder
  was simply split into three pieces ; that charged with the mer
  curial powder was burst in every direction, and the parts im
  mediately contiguous to the powder were absolutely pounded j
  yet the whole hung together, whereas the block split by the
  gunpowder had its parts fairly separated.         The sand sur
  rounding     the  gunpowder   was  undoubtedly most disturbed :
  in short, the mercurial powder appeared to have acted with
  the greatest energy, but only within certain limits.
                            Section VII.
      The   effects  of the mercurial powder, in the last experi
   ments, made me believe that it might be confined, during its
   explosion, in the centre of a hollow glass globe. Having
   therefore   provided such a vessel, 7 inches in diameter, and
   nearly   half  an inch thick, mounted with brass caps, and a
   stop-cock, (fee Plate I.) I placed ten grains of the mer
   curial powder on very thin paper, laid an iron wire 149th of
   an inch thick across the paper, through the midst of the
   powder, and, closing the paper, tied it fast at both extremi
   ties, with silk, to the wire. As the inclosed powder was now
   attached to the middle of the wire, each end of which        was
                                                          connected

  £t                On anew fulminating Mercury.
  connected with the brass caps, the packet of powder beeam»,
 by this disposition, fixed in the centre of the globe. Such
 a charge     of an electrical battery         was   then sent along the
 wire,  as a   preliminary experiment * had shown              me would,
 by making the wire red-hot, inflame the powder. The glass
 globe withstood the explosion, and of course retained what
 ever gases were generated : its interior was thinly coated with
 quicksilver in a very divided state. A bent glass tube was
 now screwed to the stop-cock of the brass cap, which being
 introduced under a glass jar standing in the mercurial bath,
 the stop-cock was opened.               Three cubical inches of air
 rushed out, and a fourth         was    set  at liberty when the appa
 ratus was removed         to  the water-tub.         The explosion being
 repeated,    and the air all received over water, the quantity
 did not vary. To avoid an error from change of tempera
ture, the glass globe was, both before and after the explosion,
immersed in water of the same temperature.                     It appears,
therefore, that the ten grains of powder produced four cu
bical inches only of air.
    To continue     the comparison between the mercurial powder
and gunpowder,         ten grains    of   the best Dartford gunpowder
were   in  a similar manner set fire to        in the  glass globe : it re
mained entire.         The whole of the powder did not explode,
for some complete grains were to be observed adhering to the
interior surface of the glass.          Little need be said of the na
ture of the      gases  generated     during the combustion of gun
powder : they must have been carbonic acid gas, sulphureous
acid gas, nitrogen gas, and (according to Lavoisier f) per
haps hydrogen gas.           As to the quantity of these gases, it is
obvious that it could not be ascertained; because the two
first were, at least     in part, speedily absorbed by the alkali of
the nitre,   left  pure after the decomposition of its nitric acid.
                             Section VIII.
    From the experiments related in the 4th and 5th sections,
in which the gunpowder proof and the gun were burst, it
might be inferred, that the astonishing force of the mercurial

                 On a new fulminating Mercury.                    aj
powder is to be attributed to the rapidity of its combustion ;
and a train of several inches in length being consumed in a
single flash, it is evident that its combustion must bd rapid.
From     the experiments    of the 6th and 7 th sections, it is suffi
ciently plain that this force is restrained to a narrow limit;
both because the block of wood charged with the mercurial
powder was more shattered than that charged with the gun
powder, whilst the sand surrounding it was least disturbed j
and likewise because the glass globe withstood the explosion
of ten grains of the powder fixed in its centre : a charge            I
 have twice found sufficient to destroy old pistol barrels,    which
 were not injured by being fired when full of the best gun
 powder.     It also appears, from the last experiment, that tea
 grains of the powder produced by ignition four cubical inches
 only of air j and it is not to be supposed that the generation^
 however rapid, of four cubical inches of air will alone ac
 count for the described force ; neither can it be accounted
 for by the formation of a little water, which, as will here
 after be shown, happens at the fame moment           :  the quantity
 formed from ten grains must be so trifling,            that I cannot
 ascribe   much    force to the expansion     of its vapour. The
 sudden vaporisation    of  a part of the mercury seems to me a
 principal   cause  of this  immense,  yet limited, force; because
 its limitation may then be explained, as it is well known
 that mercury easily parts with caloric, and requires a tempe
 rature of 600 degrees of Fahrenheit to be maintained in
  the vaporous state. That the mercury is really converted
 into vapour, by ignition of the powder, may be inferred from
  the thin coat of divided quicksilver, which, after the explo
 sion in the glass globe, covered its interior surface ; and like
  wise from the quicksilver with which a tallow candle, or &
  piece of gold, may be evenly coated, by being held at a small
  distance from the inflamed powder.          These facts certainly
 render it more than probable, although they do not demon
  strate, that the mercury is volatilised ; because it is not un
  likely that many mercurial particles are mechanically im
  pelled against the surface of the glass, the gold, and the
  fcdjow,

cipitated, upon the cessation of action and redaction. The
precipitate is to be immediately collected on a filter, well
washed with distilled water, and carefully dried in a heat
not much exceeding that of a water-bath.      The immediate
edulcoration of the powder is material, because it is liable to
the re-action of the nitric acid   and, whilst any of that acid

 analogy,          I    am disposed to         think    the whitest        is   the    strongest;
 for      well known,
         it   is          that black precipitates of mercury ap
 proach   the  nearest to  the metallic state.   The variation in
 quantity     remarkable

 so  productive   as  ioo grains of quicksilver.
    As   tn the colour,    it  seems to incline to black,     when the
 action of the acid on the alcohol is most violent,           and vice
 versa.
                             Section X.
    I need not observe,     that the     gases which   were generated
during the combustion, of the powder in the glass globe, were
necessarily mixed with atmospheric air j the facility with
 which the electric fluid     passes  through  a vacuum made such      %
mixture unavoidable.
    The cubical inch of gas         received over water was not rea
dily absorbed by it; and,          as it soon extinguished a taper,
without becoming red, or being itself inflamed, barytes water
was let up to the three cubical inches received over mercury,
when    a  carbonat of barytes was immediately precipitated.
    The residue of several explosions, after the carbonic acid
had been separated, was found, by the test of nitrous gas, to
contain nitrogen or azotic gas ; which does not proceed from
any decomposition of atmospheric air, because the powder
may be made lo explode under the exhausted receiver of an
air-pump.      It  is therefore manifest, that the gases generated
during the combustion of the fulminating              mercury consist
of carbonic acid and nitrogen gases.
                            Section XI.
    The principal re-agents which decompose the mercurial
powder are, the nitric, the sulphuric, and the muriatic acids.
The nitric changes the whole into nitrous gas, carbonic acid
gas, acetous acid, and nitrat of mercury.            I resolved it into
these different principles, by distilling it pneumatically with
nitric acid : this acid, upon the application of heat, soon dis
solved the powder, and extricated a quantity of gas, which
was found, by well known tests, to be nitrous gas mixed
with carbonic acid gas.        The distillation was carried on until
gas no longer came over.          The liquor of the retort was then
mixed with the liquor collected in the receiver, and the whole

yellowish -brown powder, nearly         as    it would have done from
a solution of nitrat of mercury.             This precipitate           was sepa
rated   by a                       liquor evaporated to a dry
               filter, and the filtrated
salt, which was washed with alcohol.      A portion of the salt
being  re-fused by this menstruum,  it was separated by filtra
tion, and recognised, by all its properties, to be nitrat of potash.
The alcoholic liquor was likewise evaporated to a dry salt,
which, upon the affusion of a little concentrate sulphuric
acid, emitted acetous acid, contaminated with                     a feeble smell
of nitrous acid, owing      to the solubility     of    a    small portion of
the nitre in the alcohol.
                           Section XII.
  The sulphuric acid      acts upon the powder               in   a   remarkable
manner,     as already   has been      noticed.        A    very concentrate
acid produces an explosion nearly at the instant of contact,
on account, I presume, of the sudden and copious disengage
ment of caloric from a portion of the powder which is de
composed by the acid.      An acid somewhat lets concentrate
likewise extricates a considerable quantity of caloric, with a
good deal  of gas ; but, as it effedts a complete decomposi
tion, it causes no explosion. An acid diluted with an equal
quantity of water, bv the aid of a little heat, separates the
gas so much less rapidly, that it may with safety be collected
in a pneumatic apparatus.    But, whatever be the density of
the acid, (provided no explosion be produced,) there remains
in the sulphuric liquor, after the separation of the gas, a
white uninflammable and uncrystallised             powder, mixed with
some minute globules of quicksilver.
  To    estimate the quantity, and observe          the      nature, of this
uninflammable               I treated 100 grains of the fulmi
                   substance,
nating mercury   with sulphuric acid a little diluted. The gas
being separated, I decanted off the liquor as it became clear,
and freed the insoluble powder from acid, by edulcoration
with distilled water;      after   which      I dried       it,   and    found   it
weighed only 84 grains consequently
                           ;                      had     oflost 16 grains
its original weight. Suspecting, from the operation of the
nitric acid in the former experiment, that these 84 grains
(with the exception of the quicksilver globules) were oxalat
                                   Ez                                            of

of mercury,     I digested them     in nitrat of lime, and found my
suspicion   just.  The mercury of the oxalat united to the nitric
acid, and the oxalic acid to the lime. A new insoluble com
pound was formed ; it weighed, when washed and dry, 48,5
grains.     Carbonat of potash separated the lime, and formed
oxalat of potash, capable of precipitating lime-water and mu-
riat of lime ; although it had bt-en depurated from excess of
alkali,   and   from carbonic      acid,   by a previous addition       of
acetous    acid.    That   the mercury      of the oxalat in the 84
grains, had united to the nitric acid        of the nitrat of lime, was
proved by     dropping muriatic acid into the liquor from which
the substance      demonstrated    to be oxalat ot       lime had been
separated; for a copious precipitation            of calomel instantly
ensued.
    The sulphuric liquor, decanted from the oxalat of mer
cury, was now added to that with which it was edulcorated,
and the whole saturated with carbonat of potash.                As etier-
vescence ceased, a cloudinels and precipitation followed ; and
the precipitate, being collected, washed, and dried, weighed
3,4 grains : it appeared to be a carbonat of mercury. Upon
evaporating a portion of the saturated sulphuric liquor*                 I
found nothing but sulphat of potash ; nor had it any metallic
taste.   There then remains, without allowing for the weight
of the carbonic     acid united to the 3,4 grains,         a deficit from
the 100 grains of mercurial powder, of 12,6 grains, which I
ascribe to the gas separated by the action of the sulphuric
acid.    To   ascertain  the quantity,    and examine the nature,       of
the gas so separated, I introduced, into a very small tubulated
retort, 50 grains of the mercurial powder, and poured upon,
it three drams, by measure, of sulphuric acid, diluted with an
equal quantity     of water,  and extricated the gas with the assist
ance of   a  gentle heat.    I first received it over quicksilver, the
surface  of which, during the operation, partially          covered itself
                                 '
with a little black powder .
    The gas, by different trials, amounted from 28 to 31 cu
bical inches; it at first appeared to be nothing but carbonic
acid, as it precipitated barytes water, and extinguished a
 taper, without being itself inflamed, or becoming red.              But,
                  * 1 cannot
                             account for this appearance.
                                                                     upon,

                   On a new fulminating Mercury.                            sty
upon letting up to it liquid caustic ammoniac, there was a
residue of from 5 to 7 inches of a peculiar inflammable gas,
which burnt with         a greenish blue flame.          When      I made use
of   the water-tub,     I obtained, from      the same materials, from
25 to 27 inches only of gas, although the average quantity
of the peculiar inflammable gas was likewise from 5 to 7
inches; therefore, the difference of the aggregate product,
over the two fluids, must have arisen from the absorption,
by the water, of a part of the carbonic acid in its nascent
state.     The variation of     the quantity      of the inflammable gas,
when powder from the fame parcel is used, seems to depend
upon the acid being a little more or less dilute.
     With    respect   to the nature      of the peculiar        inflammable
gas,    it is plain to me, from the reasons             I shall immediately
adduce, that it is no other than the gas (in a pure state) into
which the nitrous etherised gas can be resolved, by treatment
 with dilute sulphuric acid.
     The Dutch chemists have shown *, that                the nitrous ether
ised gas can be resolved into nitrous gas,             by exposure to con
 centrate sulphuric acid       ; and that, by using          a dilute instead
 of a concentrate acid,        a gas   is obtained which          enlarges the
 flame of    a  burning taper,      so much     like   the   gaseous oxyd of
 azot, that they mistook it for that substance, until they dis
 covered     that it was permanent over water, refused to deto
 nate with hydrogen, and that the fallacious appearance was
 owing to a mixture of nitrous gas with an inflammable gas.
     The inflammable        gas separated    from the powder answers
 to the description of the gas which at                   first  deceived    the
 Dutch chemists: 1st, in being permanent                  over water;      2dly,
  refusing to detonate        with hydrogen       ;  and, 3clly, having the
  appearance     of the gaseous oxyd of azot when mixed with

  nitrous gas.
     The    gas separable     by the same acid, from nitrous ether
  ised gas, and from the mercurial powder, have therefore the
 fame properties. Every chemist would thence conclude, that
  the nitrous etherised gas is a constituent part of the powder,

tricated from it by dilute sulphuric acid.
    It however appears to me, that nitrous gas was really pro
duced by the action of the dilute sulphuric acid ; and that,
when produced, it united to an excess of oxygen present                                    in
the oxalat of mercury.
   To explain how this change might happen,        pre                        I   must
mise, that my experiments have shown me, that oxalat of
mercury can exist in two, if not in three states.

above mentioned.
   3dly, A solution of nitrat of mercury boiled with dulcified
spirit of nitre, gives an oxalat more inflammable than any
other   perhaps

flammability, but contains globules of quicksilver    conse                        ;
quently,       it    must have parted           with   even more than its excess
of oxygen            and,   ifnitrous gas was present,                   would of course
                                                                 is it

       ;
that of the other, or the dilution of the acid may destroy its

   As        to the presence      of    the carbonic acid,       it   must have arisen

    The dilute muriatic acid, digested with the mercurial pow

quantity of gas.        The dissolution evaporated to a dry salt,
tastes like    corrosive  sublimate ; and the portion which the
acid does not take up, is left in the state of an uninflam
mable oxalat.
                           Section XIV.
    These effects all tend to establish the existence of the ni
trous etherised gas as a constituent part of the powder, and
likewise corroborate the explanation       I have ventured to give
of the action of the sulphuric acid.         Moreover, a measured
 ounce and    a half of nitrous acid, holding ioo grains of mer
 cury in solution, and two measured ounces of alcohol, yield
 90 cubical inches only of gas ; whereas, without the inter
 vention of mercury, they yield 210 inches.         Upon the whole,
 I  trust it will be thought reasonable to conclude, that the
 mercurial powder is composed of the nitrous etherised gas,
 and of oxalat of mercury with excess of oxygen.
     1st, Because the nitric acid converts the mercurial powder
 entirely into nitrous gas, carbonic acid gas, acetous acid, and
 nitrat of mercury.
     2dly, Because the dilute sulphuric acid resolves it into an
 uninflammable oxalat of mercury, and separates from it a
 gas resembling that into which the same acid resolves the
 nitrous etherised gas.
     3dly, Because an uninflammable         oxalat is likewise lest,
 after the muriatic      acid has converted a part of it into sub
 limate.
     4thly, Because it cannot be formed by boiling nitrat of
 mercury in dulcified spirit of nitre, although a very inflam
 mable oxalat is by this means produced.
     5thly, Because the difference of the product of gas, from
 the fame measures of alcohol and nitrous acid, with and
 without mercury in solution, is not trifling     :  and,
                                                              6thly,

ji                  On a new fulminating Mercury.
    6thly, Because nitrogen gas was generated during its com
bustion in the glass globe.
    Should my conclusions be thought warranted by the rea
sons I have adduced, the theory of the combustion of the
mercurial      powder will be obvious to every chemist. The
hydrogen of the oxalic acid, and of the etherised gas, is first
united to, the oxygen of the oxalat, forming water * ; the car
bon is saturated with oxygen, forming carbonic acid gas ;
and    a  part,  if not  the whole,   of the nitrogen      of   the etherised
gas is separated in the state of nitrogen gas; both which
last gases, it may be recollected, were after the explosion
present     in  the   glass globe.    The mercury      is revived,        and,  I
presume, thrown into vapour ; as may well be imagined,
from the immense quantity of caloric extricated, by adding
 concentrate sulphuric acid to the mercurial powder.
    1 will not venture to state, with accuracy, in what pro
 portions its constituent principles are combined.                    The affi
 nities I have brought into play are complicated, and the
 constitution of the substances I have to deal with not fully
 known.        But,  to   make round numbers,           I   will    resume the
 statement,      that 100 grains of the mercurial powder lost 16
 grains of its original weight          bv treatment with dilute sul
 phuric acid : 84 grains of mercurial oxalat, mixed with a
 few minute globules of quicksilver, remained undissolved in
 the acid. The sulphuric liquor was saturated with carbonat
 of potaffi,    and yielded     3,4 grains of carbonat of mercury.
 If   1,4 grain should be thought a proper allowance for the
 weight of carbonic acid in the 3,4 grains, I will make that
  deduction, and add the remaining two grains to the 84 grains
  of mercurial oxalat and quicksilver;          I shall then have,
     of oxalat and mercury                                         86 grains
     and    a  deficit, to be ascribed to the nitrous
         etherised gas and excess     of oxygen           -        14

  to the 48,5 grains, separated by nitrat of lime from the 84

grains of mercurial oxalat and globules of quicksilver, in the
Ilth section. These 48,5 grains were proved lo be chiefly
oxalat of lime; but they likewise contained a minute infer
parable quantity        of mercury, almost in the state of quick
silver,   formerly part of the 84 grains from which they were
separated.        Had the 48,5 grains been pure calcareous oxalat,
the quantity of pure oxalic acid in them would, according to
Bergmann*,          be 23,28 grains.        Hence, by omitting the two
grains     of   mercury    in   the   3,4 grains of carbonat, 100 grains
of the mercurial powder might have been said to contain, of
pure oxalic acid 23,28 grains; pf,mercury 62,72 grains; and
of nitrous etherised gas and excess of oxygen 14 grains. But,
as the 48,5 grains were             not pure oxalat, inasmuch        as  they
contained the mercury they received from. the 84 grains,
 from which they were generated by the nitrat of lime, some
 allowance must be made for the mercury succeflively inter
 mixed with the 84 grains and the 48,5 grains.
     In order to make corresponding numbers, and allow fof
 unavoidable errors,         I  shall estimate the quantity    of that mer
 cury to have amounted to two grains, which I must of course
 deduct from the 23,28 grains of oxalic acid.                  I shall then
  have the following        statement     :

    It  has been stated     (in section 9,) that 100 grains of quick
silver    produce,     under   different circumstances, from 120 to
 333 grains of mercurial powder; and if 100 grains of this
powder contain 64,72 grains, 120 grains, or 132 grains
must, by parity of reasoning, contain 78,06 grains, or 85,47
grains;      therefore,   13,34 grains, or 20,75 grains, more of the
 ico grains are immediately accounted for; because 64,72

grains = 85,47 grains.             The remaining deficiency of 21,94
grains,      or   14,53 grains, which, with the 78,06 grains, or
85,47 grains, would complete the original 100, of quick
silver,    remains partly in the liquor from which the powder
is separated, and is partly volatilised in the white dense
fumes, which in the beginning of this paper I compared to
the liquor fumans of Libavius.                 The mercury cannot, in
either instance, be obtained in a form immediately indica
tive of its quantity ; and a series of experiments to ascertain
the quantities in which many different substances can com
bine with mercury, is not my present object.                  After observ
ing,   that   the   mercury   left in  the  residuary liquor can be pre
cipitated in a very subtle dark powder, by carbonat of pot
ash,   I  shall content myself with examining the nature             of the
white fumes.
                              Section XV.
    It  is clear that these white fumes contain mercury: they
may be wholly condensed             in a range of Woulfe's apparatus,
charged with a solution of muriat of ammoniac.                   When the
operation       is over,  a white    powder   is seen  floating with ether
on the saline liquor, which, if the bottles arc agitated, is
entirely dissolved.        After the mixture has been boiled, or frir
some time exposed to the atmosphere,                  it yields to caustic
ammoniac         a precipitate, in all respects similar to that which
is separated hy caustic ammoniac from corrosive sublimate.
    I would infer from these facts, that the white dense fumes
consist     of mercury, or      perhaps    oxyd   of mercury, united to
the nitrous etherised gas; and           that, when the muriat of am
moniac containing them is exposed to the atmosphere,                   or is
                     8                                              boiled,

boiled, the gas separates from the mercury ; and the excess
ttf nitrous acid, which always comes over with nitrous ether,
decomposes the ammoniacal muriat,       and forms corrosive
mercurial muriat or sublimate.                  This theory    is corroborated
by comparing the quantity of gas estimated to be contained
in the fulminating mercury, with the quantities of gas yielded
from alcohol and nitrous acid, with and without mercury in
solution; not to mention that more ether, as well as more
gas,  is produced without the intervention of mercury; and
that, according to the Dutch chemists, the product of ether
is always in the inverse ratio to the product of nitrous ether
ised gas.   Should a further proof be thought necessary, of
the existence of the nitrous etherised gas in the fulminating
mercury, as well as in the white dense fumes, it may be
added, that if a mixture of alcohol and nitrous acid holding
mercury in solution be so dilute, and exposed to a tempe
rature so low, that neither ether nor nitrous etherised gas are
produced, the fulminating mercury, or the white fumes, will
never be generated ; for, under such circumstances, the mer
cury is precipitated chiefly in the state of an inflammable ox-
alat.   Further, when we consider the different substances
formed by an union of nitrous acid and alcohol, we are so
far acquainted with all, except the ether and the nitrous
Etherised gas, as to create a presumption, that no others are
capable     of volatilising mercury,            at the very low temperature
in which       white fumes exist, since during some minutes
                the

the manufacturing             of pig-iron with pit-coal,        i^     may not be
amiss     to make a few general             observations    as to    the origin of

£6                 On the   Origin and Progress of     the
period:?, to prove the flow but steady progress of improvement.
A       comparison betwixt the effects produced by the use of
charred wood        and     pit-coal in the blast-furnace      will  also
 afford subject for a     few reflections.
       It would   appear    that, towards the close of queen Eliza
 beth's reign, blast-furnaces had been constructed of size suf
 ficient to produce, with ores and the charcoal of wt>od, from
 2 to 3 tons per dav, or from 15 to 21 tons of pig-iron set
 week.       Such great produces in iron at this earlv period were,
 however, confined to situations where there was abundance
 of water,     and where water-wheels         and  leathern bellows of
  considerable     magnitude      were   used.    The more common
 modes      of operation    were confined to furnaces      of an inferior
 size, where air was supplied by means            of bellows excited by
 tittle or the labour of men.
       As  the manufacture       of  cannons, mortars,   &c.  was at this
  period considerable,       and as pit-coal had not vet been applied
 to any branch of the manufacturing of iron, it is probable
  that these articles would be cast from the large blast-furnaces
  at once; the flame of wood not being' well calculated for
 heating the large reverberating furnace where such heavy
 pieces of ordnance are now cast, and where several tons will
 be melted in one furnace by the flame of pit-coal ; the non-
  Applicatioti of pit-coal, either to the smelling of ores or melt
 ing of iron, would greatly retard the improvement of the
 smaller branches of the casting department. The difficulty
 with which most Englisti charcoal pig-iron melts, and it*
  almost immediate tendency to be converted into malleable
  iron in an arr-furnace, would, in every attempt           to improve
  ment, present an insurmountable obstacle.
       This would   appear, amongst      others  of inferior note, to be
  the chief reason why the          improvements of casting of every
  denomination have only kept pace with the original inven
  tion and improvement of cast iron with pit-coal char.
        From the tim* of tire invention by Dudley till about 60
  years ago, a period of 120 year?, Uie manufacture seems to
   have fallen asleep ; and it is only during the last 40 years
   that we can note     a  rapid improvement in the fabrication of
   castings.    The   universal    application of pig-iron, in almost
l   .. .                                                            every

tfvcry possible shape,      to the purposes of manufacture    and the
heceflaries of life, wherein taste, beauty, and durability are
frequently united, belongs entirely to the present improved
 state of the fabrication of pig-iron with the char of pit-coal.
     In  the early period    above alluded to, by much thfe greatest
 proportion of pig-iron was converted into bar-Iron by means
 of the refinery lire, and, in many of the small works, the
 pig-iron    was matured, or malleabilised, before      it was drawn
 from the furnace. The iron-masters in general considered
 their own period as that of the highest pitch of advancement
 in the iron business.        The erection of the great blast, capa
 ble, by powerful exertions, to make 21 tons weekly; the par
 tial substitution of the refinery sire for the purpose os making
 malleable iron     ;  and the abandonment     of  the hand and foot
 blast-bloweries where the dther erections could be procured,
 were grounds sufficient for the manufacturer to look with
  complacence upon the revolutions which had imperceptibly
  crept in, and kept pace with his practice.
      The advantages whifeh individuals derived from the manu
  facture of iron had induced many to engage in it. The bu
  siness in point of extent seemed only limited to the supply of
  wood.      New erections, for want of     a proper Tupply   of mate
  rials, became       impracticable : those already engaged Were
  more anxious to preserve their supply, howe\er much circum
  scribed, than to listen to innovalbn, which, by substituting
  pit-coal for the charcoal of wood, would give to the new
  establishing manufacturer a great superiority in the market.
   It was also highly probable that many of the iron-works then
  establistied were at a considerable distance from pit-coal, the
   universal introduction of which would have proved fatal to
   their interests.     Under such unfavourable circumstances the
   discovery,    or rather the practicability, of making pig-iron
   with pit-coal, we find announced by Simon Sturtevant, Esq.
   in the  year 161a, who, upon application, was favoured         with
   a patent   from king James for the exclusive manufacture of
   iron with pit-coal in all its branches for thirty-one years. In
   return, the said Simon Sturtevant bound himself to publish
   his discoveries,    which afterwards appeared      in quarto under
   the title of his Met&lliea,.
                                                                      It

     It is uncertain from what reasons,         but Mr. Sturtevant     faifeet
 in   the execution      of his    discoveries   upon   a large scale,   and
  was obliged next year to render up his letters          of monopoly.
     The second adventurer in this line we find               to have been
 John Ravenson, Esq. who, like Sturtevant, was                 successful in
 obtaining      a  patent for the new manufacture, but, like him
 also, was inadequate        to the completion of it upon an extensive,
 scale.     Ravenson was also enjoined to publish his discoveries
 under the title of his Melallica, printed for Thomas Thorp
 enno 1613.        Several other adventurers        stepped forth, all of
 whom had the mortification            of resigning their    patents with
 out having contributed to the success of the arduous under
 taking.
    In   1619 Dudley obtained his patent, and declared, that
 although he made only at the rate of three tons ot pig-iron
 weekly, he made it with profit.               The discovery was per
fected     at his father's works at Pensent in Worcclterstiire.
This gentleman's success in the various manufactures of
iron with pit-coal had united not only all the proprietors of
the charcoal iron trade, but many new adventurers, who
wistied to sliare in the emoluments of the new discovery*
Their interest was so powerful as to limit Dudley's patent
from 31 to t 4 years.           During the most of this period he
continued to manufacture pig and bar.-: iron, and various
castings, all of which he sold much lower than the charcoal
manufacturers.         In  the article  of callings  alone he must have
had greatly      the start  of the charcoal foundries, as the quality
of   carbonated      coke pig-iron is far superior to that of the
charcoal      iron of this country for the general             purposes    of
casting.
    The superior genius of Dudley           was   not always an object
of  passive   indifference in the narrow estimation of the long
established     manufacturers.       The   envy occasioned      by his un
common        success   produced     at last a spirit   of combination,
which     terminated    in a hostile attack upon his devoted works.
His improved bellows, furnace, forge, &c. all fell a prey to
a lawless banditti, betwixt whom and its furious leaders no
shades of distinction were visible, but those of avarice, igno
rance, and the most contemptible prejudice,
                                                                         To

            TSlanuJaBure of Pig-iron with Pit-Coal.                 39
    To evade the mode of operation discovered by Dudley, or
to introduce the making of pig-iron with pit-coal to greater
advantage, a new plan was adopted by Captain Buck, Major
Wildman,      and   others, in the forest of Dean, where they
•erected large air-furnaces,     into which they introduced large
clay pots, resembling      those  used at glass-houses, filled with
various proportions of the necessary mixture of ores and char
coal.    The furnaces were heated by the flame of pit-coal,
and   it was expected    that, by tapping the pots below, the se
parated    materials would flow out. This .rude process was
found entirely impracticable ; the heat was inadequate to
perfect separation, the pots cracked, and in a short time the
process was abandoned       altogether.
    The misfortunes which        successively befel the unfortunate
Dudley, arising from rivalship in the iron business and his
attachment to the royal cause during the civil wars, prevented
his improvements from being closely followed up.              The re
fusal of a new patent after the restoration            prevented him
from again entering into the business with his usual enter
prise.    From that period till about the year 1 740, nothing
of importance was done in the manufacture of coke pig-iron.
The application of the steam-engine for raising and compress
ing air, no longer confined the manufacturer to local situa
 tions. Larger furnaces, with a proportionate quantity of blast,
 were introduced.      Among     the first effects, from 8 to  to tons
of pig-iron     were produced     weekly.      Ever since, the weekly
quantity has in general been increasing. The produce being
considerably dependent upon the quantity of air used for re
 duction, it is now so well understood, that at some works the
 blowing-machine      is calculated   to produce frequently 40 tons
 of melting pig-iron    per week at each furnace. At some iron
 works in Wales, where       oxygenated     crude   iron is manufac
 tured purposely for converting into      bar-iron,   there are several
 instances of  a furnace producing 70, 71, and 72 tons of metal
 weekly. This astonishing quantity forms a most striking con
trast with the early exertions of Dudley, who conceived three
 tons a profitable produce, and whose greatest exertions never
 exceeded 7 tons of pig-iron weekly.
    After thii slight   sketch   of  the progress    of manufacturing
                                                                  P'g

  40                On the Origin and Progress          of the
  pig-iron with pit-coal,        it may    be gratifying      to make a sew
  observations    upon the process conducted with the charcoal              of
  wood.     The    superior purity of the carbonaceous matter               in,
  wood, and its greater degree of inflammability, render this
  operation more simple than that performed with pit-coal.
  The former properly admitted of a small furnace being used ;
  the latter required      a much     less   degree  of  blast to purify the
  ore, and give out satisfactory results both in the quantity and
  quality of the metal.        Few charcoal furnaces exceeded the
  height of 20 sect, and manv of them were from 12 to 15.
  A   very small column of blast was necessary to excite igni
  tion, and produce the reduction of the materials. Lanca
  shire and Cumberland ores were chiefly in use ; their superior
  richness in iron rendering them soon metallised when in con
  tact with ignited charcoal of wood : 12 to 24 hours were
  sufficient for this purpose, according to the size of the fur
  nace and the quality of the pig-iron wished. Not so in the
  manufacturing of coke pig-iron at present : the inferior
  quantity of iron which is contained in iron-stones, the im
  purity of the carbonaceous          matter in pit-coal, establishes a
  much    less degree   of affinity betwixt the metal and the prin
  ciple of its reduction.           The oxygen of the iron-stone is
  longer in being removed : this requires a,n additional period
  of contact. To procure this, the furnace must be heightened
  to 35 or 40 feet, and the descent of the materials protracted
   to three days.
      It will  be proper to exhibit        the comparative effects pro
  duced    by the char of pit-coal         and that of wood.         The fol
  lowing particulars      will  serve as   data  to make     a  calculation  of
  the relative effects of the two different fuels with a charcoal
  furnace of 26 or 27 feet high, 9 feet wide at the boslies,
   and blown by two 1^ inch pipes placed along side of each
/ other   at the tuyere of the furnace.         To make forge-pigs with
   this furnace, the following proportions have by experience
   been found requisite for each charge :
   2 sacks  of charcoal of ii2lb. each                -         -      2241b.

   In   24 hours 18 of the above charges would have been
consumed, and nearly 3 tons of forge-pigs produced.
   The    total quantity   of char   used for
       the quantity would be             -       a X 18 = 36 cwt.
   The total quantity of iron ore           -    7 X 18
                                                            = 126

   We find      therefore  that  iacwt. or 13441b. of the charcoal
of wood, produces of forge pig-iron 2240 lb. or 1 ton;
and that 126 cwt. of Lancashire ore + 9 cwt. of iron-stone,
yielded of metal 60 cwt.           This quantity, by an easy mode
of calculation, will be found to be at the rate of 44*4 per
cwt.
   When       carbonated     crude iron was produced, the charge
was,    200  cwt.   of  wood    char, 5 cwt. of ore, ~ cwt. of iron
stone, 141b. of limestone.
   The weekly quantity was always diminished in proportion
to the reduction of the quantity of ore used. In 24 hours the
quantity of the pig-iron produced, averaged 48 cwt. of carbon
ated crude iron. As this is the quality of metal which servej
as the basis of the calculation in Number XX. of the Philo
sophical Magazine, it will be the most proper standard to
compare the widely different effects produced by wood and
pit-coal.      In that Number a table is given of the quantities
of crude iron each variety of cokes produce, and which, for
the fake    of immediate comparison,         I shall here again insert.

    From this comparative view it is found that charcoal of
wood produces triple cffjcts, or carbonates three times the
quantity of crude iron that the clod-coal cokes do; 3^ times
as much as the      splint;   and 4.5 times as much        as a mixture
of  free and splint.

will   be prepared     on many of the present iron-work banks,
labour included, at 11 j. and at some places so low as 10s.
At   present the price     of charcoal    is upwards     of 4/. per ton.
So that at this period, although the effects of wood are 3':
times those of splint-coal cokes, yet the price of one ton of
charcoal wood will ptirchafe eight tons of cokes; the quan
tity of the former limited to, and produced from, land which
might be better applied to the purposes of agriculture ; the
latter found in immense fields, and in tracts of country which
are always augmented in value by the development of their
mineral treasure.
    A    charcoal   blast-furnace     which   smelts    the  whole year
round, and occasionally makes forge-pigs                and carbonated
iron    to the amount of icoo tons annually,               will  consume
14,000 sacks of charcoal ; which may be estimated at 1 cwt.
per sack, or 700 tons, or 1,568,0001b.                 This divided by
 18.751b. the pounds in a cubic foot, gives for the quantity
of timber in cubical         feet,  83.626.     This is going upon         a
former calculation, and is supposing the wood to shrink but
little during the process of charring.          In the present state of
the woods which are attached to iron- works, one acre will
not yield more than 1200 cubical feet of timber.                To  ensure
the annual supply,        --       = 69.69 acres     of land would      re
quire every year to be cleared, or nearly 1400 acres would
be requisite to form, with proper care, an unfailing source of
supply    ; aud at the rate of     4/.  per ton,  the fuel would       cost
2,800/.
    Let this  be compared       with   a blast-furnace manufacturing
the fame quantity and quality of coke pig-iron.                 The ave
rage quantity     for  each   ton  will  be  nearly  fix  tons  of splint,
or,    as they lose    50 per cent, in charring,       3 tons    of  cokes

kighest price stated, 115. per ton, amounts to 1,650/. or less
than the charcoal, 1,150/. 6000 tons of splint-coals will be
easily procured from one acre      of measurement where the                 seam
measures 4 ~ to 5 feet thick. An observation strikes us forci
bly here, that, great as the consumption of wood         suffi    is,   a
cient extent of country can from time to time replace any
given quantity.   No facts, however, which have hitherto
come under our observation, warrant us to suppose the re
formation of pit-coal.
 I  cannot close this paper without bringing forward to notice
a substance which has hitherto remained in      comparatively a
useless   state to society.   We   have         seen  how many extensive
      of excellent land have
forests                             been          cleared of their natural
timber; how many thousand              acres       restored   to agricultural
purposes, to supply the wants of the increasing population of
our country      by
                the immediate necessities of the iron-works                    ;
while at the fame time individuals received ample recompense
for their necessary labour.   May we not again look forward
         that the rapid strides which science in our times
and trust,                                                                     is
making towards  the perfection of manufactures, will devise                    a
method which will enable the manufacturer of iron to use
peat and  turf in his manipulations, either alone or as mix             a
ture? Many schemes have been tried to introduce these cheap
fuels to advantage.   Mixtures of charcoal and well dried peats
smelt and carbonate      considerable portion of metal.
                          a                                The
weekly produce, however, seldom exceeded eight or ten tons                    j
the extreme inflammability of the peat rendered     imprac        it
ticable to use   blast sufficiently compressed to produce
                    a                                                          a
quantity without risking the furnace. When peats were used
alone, the produce diminished       much as not to defray the
                                           so
labour.    But the quality of the metal was always superior,
and nothing was wanting but          preparation of the fuel
                                           a                                   in,

cut, are as various as those of pit-coal. That which seems
to have undergone the most complete decomposition, to have
become dense and compactly united in all its parts, forms
the hardest and most durable peat.    The blacker the colour,
the more carbonaceous is the fuel, and the firmer is the char
it produces. In moss-grounds where the decomposition is
not complete, the peat abounds more with earths and bog-
iron ore. The remains of the vegetables are more entire, and
its tendency to consolidation in burning is less.   I have ex
posed  such peat  as this to a  long drying   heat,  and found

The peat, when thoroughly dried, will weigh 3 pounds ;           the
product, therefore, will he 3 X 4000 = 12,000 lb. upwards
of 5 tons. The total expense of this quantity for this share
of labour would be,

    Suppose     that with additional     labour, and the trouble of
drying, a sum equal to the first was incurred, still we find
that peats may be furnistied in great plenty at zs.pcr ton.
By the former analysis it appears that 4 tons would do more
than make one ton of peat char, containing a portion of ve
getable carbon superior even to that contained in oak.          This
quantity of char would only cost at most 8 s. per ton, besides
the labour of charring, which, by proper erection and exe
cution, would not cost more than 2s. bd. making in all
 \Os. 6d.       The charcoal wood in this country at present
sells   at  the enormous price        of 4/. 6s. 8d. per ton, and
 is' scarce   in point of quantity.       Should it ever happen that
 peat moss     shall become a substitute for pit-coal, or obtain a
 preference from local advantages and cheapness by the ma
 nufacturers of iron, we shall then see a happy commence
 ment to the most rational and most likely way of regene
 rating immense heaths of country, and of rendering up large
 tracts of surface, which for ages have remained useless to the
 wants of -man ; this way conquering one of the most perni
 cious evils which the progress of agriculture ever encoun
 tered.
     It will,  however, most likely be found, that a procedure
 upon ancient modes of manufacture already established, will
 be productive of no greater success than has hitherto been
 experienced.       It is the business of the manufacturer to apply
 his knowledge of the principle of his process to the exigency
  of the structure and component parts of one or all of his
 materials.      The general introduction of peat or turf for the
  manufacture      of iron in preferable situations in our age,
 ought not to     excite the fame degree of wonder that Dudley's

very possible       that the bare attempt will meet with as keen
reprobation,        dictated by the fame narrow, selsissi, and unen

therto clouded the genius of our manufacturing class.
IV.     Advantageous Method                 of separating            the whole os the
     tartarous Acid from crude               Tartar.            By    M. Lowitz;
     abridged by      Dr. Van Mons, of Brussels*.
M,   -R. LOWITZ ssiowed, in the year 1786, that a tartarous
acid might be obtained by charcoal dust from crude tartar,
as pure as that obtained from white tartar ; but as the tartrite
of potaft, which is separated in this operation, is too strongly
united to the colouring matter of the tartar to be able to get
rid of     the loss of this fall, necessarily occasioned
            it,                                            the                 by
process, destroyed all the advantage derived from it.   Means,
indeed,  had  been found  to  decompose entirely the  acidulous
tartrite of potash   the means of quicklime
                          by                  but this process   ;
is accompanied  with  great inconveniencies, which  M. Goet-
tling attempted to obviate                 by
                                 proposing to decompose the
tartrite     by   the acetite of the same earth.
   This process, however, of Goettling cannot be employed
but with white tartar, on account of the impossibility of de
priving of its colour the acetite of potassi which results from
it. This induced M. Lowitz to endeavour to discover an
other method of decomposition.
   This method consists in mixing together 15 lb. of crude
tartar with 41b. of chalk, and adding gradually 200 lb. of
cold water. After the effervescence has ceased, the mixture
must be heated        ;   and at the moment when          boils, you throw
                                                                it
into   it   sometimes     a    little tartar, and sometimes     little chalk,
                                                                        a
until no more           effervescence       is   excited    : you then filter the
liquid,     and precipitate      it   by   means   of   a   solution of the muriat
of lime. You then decant the coloured liquid, and wash the
united precipitates until they have been deprived of all the
                     • From the Annales      de Cbimie,     No.      101.
                                                                            separable

separable part  of their colour, and until they become insipid.
This tartrite of lime is then decomposed by eight pounds of
sulphuric acid diluted with as much water ; and the acid se
parated, is again diluted with 50 or 60 pounds of that liquid.
It is necessary that the acid should contain a flight excess of
sulphuric acid. The liquor is then separated from the sul-
phat of lime ; and after it has been mixed with from four to
six pounds of charcoal dust, it is evaporated to the point of
crystallisation by being kepi in a continual state of ebullition.
When the liquor has cooled, you separate from it a small
remnant of the sulphat of lime which has been deposited,
and you subject it to insensible evaporation to make it crys
tallise.
      M. Lowitz     mentions     of ascertaining the just pro
                               a mode
portion of                         which the liquor ought to
               the free sulphuric acid
contain in order to prevent a portion of the tartrite of lime
from remaining dissolved in the state of acidulous tartrite,
which causes the tartarous acid, instead of crystallising, to
consolidate    itself into   a saline mass,    without form, and pul
verulent.     This method      consists   in diluting in an ounce of
water half a dram (gros) of the acid solution, and adding
from 10 to 1$ drops of the liquid acetiteof lead. On drop
ping nitric acid into this mixture, if the liquid immedi
ately becomes transparent, and remains so for several hours,
it is a proof that there is too little acid : if the liquid docs
not immediately become clear, there is too much : in the
last place,   if,
              after having become clear,     again grows turbid
                                                  it
at the end    of
               few minutes, the just point has been attained.
                    a
This trial ought to be made at the time when the liquor has
reached the point of saturation to be exposed to crystallise.
    This operation will furnish eight pounds of tartarous acid
 in very beautiful crystals, and exceedingly white.  To free
 from any of the sulphuric acid which may be adhering to                       it, it
 nothing will       be necessary but to throw         over   it   a   little cold
 water.
      We would      advise those who wish to follow this process, to
 dilute the sulphuric acid with at least four times its weight of
 water, in order to prevent the de-hydrogenating action of
 that acid on the tartarous acid not to dilute the acid with
                                          ;

the    whole quantity of water which the author prescribes,                        irt
order that the evaporation may be shortened ; not to con
tinue the ebullition when the liquor has acquired a certain
degree of concentration, with a view to prevent the de-hy-
drogenating effect of the heat ; and, in the last place, not to
add an excess of sulphuric acid till the whole of the sulphat
of lime, which this acid in acidulating would render soluble,
is separated.
     M. Lowitzjustly observes, that the salt which he employs
to decompose the tartritc of potash is found in all the labora
tories of druggists as the remains of other operations, and
that it is often thrown away as useless.
  The author proposes to draw tartarous acid                          in   the fame
manner, from tartrite of lime, which is precipitated in great
abundance after the first crystallisations of the acidulous tar*
trite of potash and of soda, and which remains in the mother-
water    of that   salt.
     M. Lowitz     terminates this memoir with advising to leave
in   the citric acid, as in the tartarousacid, a slight excess of
the sulphuric acid ; which is the more necessary in    as the              it,
acidulous citrat of lime    much more soluble
                                   is           than the tar
trite of that earth.       M. Lowitz         assures    us that this        practice
contributes much towards obtaining                   the citric       acid in large
and regular crystals.

substances ; and, as etherification is an effect which depends
on the action of this principle on the state of the hydro-car-
bonous combination of alcohol, the conversion of the alcoholic
liquor into ether could be hoped for only through the inter
vention of this principle.             Ludolph *, Baume\ and others,
attempted to make marine ether by means of common mu
riatic acid ; but without success, notwithstanding the con

combination         of oxygen with the muriatic            acid which con
stitutes the oxygenated           acid, (probably with     a  view to present
to the alcohol a highly concentrated acid,) employed for
making marine ether different oxygenated metallic muriats.
Thus, Basil Valentine, and after him Wenzel, tried with that
view the oxygenated muriat of antimony ; Neumann, Bayen,
de Bormes, the fame muriat of zinc ; Pott, that of arsenic ;
Rouelle, Courtanvaux, Spielmann, Erxleben, and lately the
celebrated Klaproth J, that of tin ; and others the oxygenated
muriat of mercury, the red muriat of iron, &c. and the results
have been attended           with more or     less success ;  but it was ne
cessary, as already        said, that the real preparation       of this ether
should be preceded by the discovery               of the oxygenated mu
riatic acid.

 marine ether by this acid are still imperfect, and, for the
 most part, betray inexperience and servile imitation.              Scheele
 did not fail to apply soon the wonderful properties which he
had discovered       in this acid (a discovery by which he has
been immortalised) to the preparation of the liquid in ques
tion*. Besides other processes,, he distilled muriatic acid
from off the oxyd of manganese ; received the oxygenated
acid in a vessel containing alcohol ; and rectified the liquid,
thus impregnated and etherified, by a gentle heat. But these
operations only furnished hints for conducting                chemists to a
better process ; for Hahnemann f, Westrumb                  J,  and Scheele
himself agree, that by means of the oxygenated                    acid they
obtained rather a vinous oil than real ether.
    PeUetier §, an4 before him Westrumb, as well as other
German chemists, adopted the process in which Scheele pre
scribed the distillation of alcohol from a mixture of the mu-
riat of soda, sulphuric acid, and the oxyd of manganese : but
this manipulation, in the state of imperfection iu which it
has hitherto been performed, either gave a little ether by th«
action of the sulphuric acid, or furnished only the produce of
the other processes employed by the Swedish chemist. I shall
enter into some details respecting the phenomena which take
place    in these operations.
   It   is impossible that this liquid, by the action of the oxy
genated muriatic acid on the alcohol, should not experience,
in a degree proportioned to its principles, that change from
which ether results. This, indeed, is what has been observed
bv those who put in practice the methods of Scheele and
Westrumb. They first saw the liquid float on the surface of
the water     ; but when they wished to submit it to rectification,
or when they did not separate it soon enough from the water
impregnated with the oxygenated acid, they found their ether
converted into oil, first liquid and floating on the water, when
they separated, it from the alcohol in which it was dissolved ;
but afterwards becoming thick, and falling to the bottom of

 the same liquid.  This olefication of ether                        is a natural effect
 of the oxygenating action of the acid, when                        care has not been
 taken to stop this operation immediately after the ether is
 formed. A like action is exercised by the air of the atmo
 sphere on natural oils.
      The   oxygenated           muriatic acid, which            passes     at the fame
 time as the ether, continues to act on that liquid, and makes
it undergo a modification of composition that brings it to the
state of oil, to which it had before nearly approached.  This
effect,     as   I    have said,      takes place       when the ether is left for
some       time mixed with the acid it has carried along with                             it,
or when          itrectified without separating
                      is                          from that acid. it
It    may readily be conjectured,                    that the continuation of the
same labour ought to make the liquid oil pass to the state                                of
thick oil,            would bring the latter to the state of
                 and that        it
grease, and, consequently, to that of wax. The same thing
takes place with the olefying gas of the Dutch chemists,
which from ethereous gas transforms itself,        the re-action       by
of the oxygenated muriatic acid gas on the state of the com
bination of its principles, into an oil, first liquid and float
ing on the water, but which afterwards becomes inspissated
to olefication when you add only     few bubbles of the latter
                                                       a
gas in excess.  When this excess of oxygenated gas was con
siderable,   I       have often seen the ethereous oil converted                   into   a
real white grease, opake, and                   of   the consistence    of half melted
tallow.     informed the public, more than ten years ago,
            I
that the oxygenated muriatic acid gas, kept over oil of col/at
(coleseed),  converted   into    waxy matter, taking from
                                      it         a
it its smell and colour, and rendering      perfectly white.   it
All    these effects            depend     on withdrawing         a  portion of the
hydrogen        ;     so   that ether      is   oil, plus    a   certain portion of
hydrogen; oil     grease, plus that proportion, &c.

most as speedily as muriatic ether does.                         Nothing      is   so   easy

5*           Preparation of 'Ether   by the   Muriatic Acid.
ether must       have given a preference, the motives         of which
are not difficult to be discovered,      to a certain process    which
prescribes    that the alcohol should be mixed with the sulphuric
acid before this acid is poured over the two other ingredients,
muriat of soda and oxyd of manganese.             There is formed by
the aid of the heat which           is excited   in this mixture, as
Fourcroy and Vauquelin observed, a quantity of ether by the
sulphuric acid, which first pastes in the distillation, and which
suffers itself to be separated with more certainty, being less
liable to be attacked by the oxydating principle than marine
ether; This sulphuric ether must have often been considered
by inexperienced judges as real muriatic ether ; from which,
however, it diners by a smell and taste peculiar to itself.
     In this state of the science respecting the preparation of
marine ether,        I have thought it my duty to communicate to
the Society       a process  which   removes    every difficulty in this
preparation.
     Place in a sand-bath, gently heated, the retort of Woulfe's
 apparatus as improved by Lavoisier, and composed only of a
 balloon and two bottles : introduce into it i .00 of any weight
 of the muriat of      soda, perfectly dry  ;  and in the receiver  and
 the two bottles distribute the fame weight of good alcohol.
 After having exactly luted the joinings, and furnished the
 last bottle    with a tube of safety, pour upon the salt in the
 retort 0*50 of concentrated sulphuric acid, and leave the ope
 ration to proceed cold for five or fix hours.            Then make a
 moderate     fire, which   must be augmented by degrees, to       bring
 the bottom of the capsule of the bath to a slight degree         of red
 heat. The muriatic acid in the natural state is gaseous             : in
 that   state it pastes over and dissolves in the alcohol.       It is of
 benefit in this operation to plunge the tubes of communica
  tion to a certain depth in the alcohol, that the gas may ex
  perience a condensation, which greatly contributes to its ab
  sorption.      This disposition of the tubes, when the disengage
  ment is rapid, makes the alcohol sometimes pass from the
  one bottle into the other; in which cafe the position of the
  Lotties must be changed in such a manners to make that
  which contains the greater quantity of liquid to communi
  cate with the receiver. It may readily be conceived that this
                                      5                          passage

            Preparation    of Ether   by the  Muriatic Acid.            53
passage    of the alcohol from one bottle to another, and even
its elevation to some centimetres above its level, is necessarily
the effect of a considerable degree of compression experienced
by the gas, and which re-acts, or is transmitted by the latter
to the liquid ; for, even by applying to the explanation of the
phenomena of a liquid in motion the general principle of
 mechanics,      that the masses and velocities are inversely pro
 portional, it    is nevertheless true, that at rest the force which
 raises and    maintains a liquid above its level, cannot be infe
 rior to the weight of a mass of that liquid having for height
 its elevation in the tube, and for base the internal dia
 meter of the bottle ; or, to make use of common language,
 having for bulk its elevation multiplied by its diameter : but
 a compressing      force, to be exercised by the gas, ought to be
  experienced by it ; and this compression, by concentrating its
  parts, disposes it to dissolve in the alcohol.          I have indulged
  in this fliort digression, which may appear foreign to my
  object, on account of its numerous applications in the prac
  tice of the chemistry of gases.
      When the whole muriatic acid has              passed, the liquors in
  the different bottles are to be united, and poured into the re
  tort, after first taking out the salt.         It forms a muriatic al
  cohol exceedingly concentrated.          You must add in the retort
   o-20 of the oxyd of manganese           in very fine powder; and
   put into the recipient, and the two bottles, a certain quan
  tity of a solution of caustic potaili.            You then distil at a.
   gentle  heat,  conducted    with  care.    It   is  here seen that the
   alkaline liquor serves to enchain the oxygenated acid which
   is in excess at the formation of the ether, and that it pre
   vents the action which oldies this liquid.               It is chiefly in
   this practice that the part of my method which preserves the
   ether consists.
       Notwithstanding      this precaution, it is not possible, how
   ever, to prevent a greater or less portion of the ether from
    being decomposed by the acid, which must traverse that
    liquid to reach the alkaline liquor : besides, the oxygenated
    muriatic acid united to the alkali, continues no less to act as
    an oxygenating substance        in its   state    of muriat  ; for, pro
                                                                       perly,

   54                     Observations    upon an unusual
    perly, it is the action of the acid, and not that of the oxy
   gen, which the alkali neutralises.               I have freed the latter
   entirely from these inconveniencies by receiving the ether on
   liquid ammonia, which is burnt by the oxygen in propor
  tion     as  it comes   in contact with it : but this manipulation is
  accompanied with too many dangers for me to venture to
  recommend it in general.
       Another method of separating the ether from the oxygen
  ated acid would           be, to receive this liquid on water ; to re
  move it in proportion as it floats on the surface, by means of
  a syphon or pump j to shake it with the alkaline solution ;
  and to decant it again on pure water. You then obtain the
  whole ether, which may be afterwards separated from the
  water by rectification.
      Ether, freed in any manner from its acid, must finally be
  mixed with twice its bulk of water, and rectified at a heat
 equal to that of Guyton's economical furnace.
      A marine ether may be composed by one operation if you
 distill, at a boiling heat, a mixture of alcohol and the oxy
 genated muriat of potash in the proportion of roo to 0*85.
      It  is not necessary to recommend to those who are ever so
 little habituated to this kind of labour, to cool, from time to
 time, in the course of the distillation, the receiver, by apply
 ing    to  it  a wetted sponge.

which account, altitudes of the heavenly bodies which are
not more than 50 or 6° ought never to be made use of when
any consequences are to be deduced from them.    The cause
of this uncertainty  is probably the great quantities of gross
vapours, and exhalations of various kinds, which are sus
pended in the air near to the earth's surface, and the varia
tions to which they are subject; causes, of- which we have
no instruments to measure the effects which they produce in
refracting the rays of light.               In     general, the course of a ray
passing through the atmosphere,                    is that of a curve which is
concave towards the earth, the effect                         of which          is to give an
apparent elevation to the object j and thus the heavenly bo
dies appear above the horizon, when they are actually below
it ; but it will not alter the position of their parts in respect
<o   the horizon ; that the image of the highest part of the
                                    is,
object will be uppermost, and the image of the lowest part
will be undermost. The figures, however, of the fun and
moon, when near the horizon, will suffer            change, in con   a
sequence    of  the  refraction   of  the  under limb  being greater
than that of the upper from which they assume an elliptical

form, the minor axis of which            perpendicular to the hori
                                              is
zon, and the major axis parallel to it. But           perpendicular      a
object,  situated  upon   the surface   of the earth,  will not have
its length altered       refraction, the refraction of the bottom
                              by
being   the   fame  as  that  of the top *. These are the effects
which are produced upon bodies at or near the horizon, in
the common state of the atmosphere,                what          by
                                                            shall call          I
the usual refraction.
   But, besides the usual refraction which affects the rays of
light, the atmosphere over the sea    sometimes found to be
                                                         is
in   a   state   which refracts the         rays in such manner as to pro

tions for 1797, Mr. Huddart has described some effects of
this kind, which he has accounted for      supposing that,           by
from the evaporation of the water, the refractive power of
the air   not greatest at the surface of the

56                        Observations        upon an unusual
manner, all the phænomena which he has observed.        But
effects very different from those which have been described
by Mr. Huddart are sometimes found to take place. These
I had an opportunity of observing at Ramsgate, last summer,
on August the first, from about half an hour after four
o'clock in the afternoon till between  seven and eight.    The
day had  been extremely hot, and the evening was very sultry;
the sky was clear, with a few flying clouds.   I (hall describe
the phænomena as I observed them with a terrestrial tele
scope, which magnified between 30 and 40 times ; they
were visible, however, to the naked eye. The height of the
eye, above the surface of the water, at which most of the
observations were made, was about 25 feet ; some of them,
however, were made at about 80 feet from the surface ; and
it did not appear that any of the phænomena were altered,,
from varying the height of the eye, the general effect remain
ing the same.
  The first unusual appearance which                     I   observed,    was that
which is represented in Plate II. fig. 1.   Directing my tele
scope at random, to examine any objects   which might happen
to be in view, I saw the top of the masts of a ship A, above
the horizon, xy> of the sea, as shown in the figure ; at the
same time also, I discovered in the field of view, two com
plete images, B, C, of the (hip in the air, vertical to the (hip
itself,   B being inverted, and C erect, having their hulks
joined.      The phenomenon                  was so strange that   I   requested       a
person present         to look into the telescope and examine what
                                by it,
was to be       seen      in             who immediately     described        the   two
images, as observed    myself; indeed they were    perfect,              so
that    was impoflible we could differ in our description.
       it
Upon this,     immediately took
               I                    drawing of the relative
                                                  a
magnitudes and distances of the (hip and its images, which,
at that time, were as represented in the figure, as near as                           it
was possible for the eye to judge; and       was very easy toit
estimate them to    very considerable degree of accuracy. As,
                          a
the (hip was receding from the shore, less and less of its masts
became           and, continuing my observations, in order
            visible   ;
to discover whether any, or what variations might take place,
I   found that,   as the       (hip descended, the images         B,
                                                                   C     ascended     \
                                                                                    but,

 but, as the sliip did not fink below the horizon, I had
 not an opportunity of observing at what time, and in what
 order, the images would have vanished, if the ship had so
 disappeared.
   Being desirous of seeing whether the same effect was pro
 duced upon the other (hips which were visible,  directed my          I
 telescope to another ship                 A, (Fig. a.)   whose   hulk    was just    in
 the horizon      xy   ;    when       I   observed a complete inverted
                                                        image
B, the main-mast of which just             that of the ship it
                                                    touched
self. In this cafe, there was no second image as before. The
ship A moving upon the horizon, B continued to move with
 it,
   without any variation                   in
                               its appearance.
  The next ship which       diredted my telescope to, was
                                     I                       far                so
on the other side of the horizon xy, as just to prevent its hulk
from being seen,           as   is  A, (Fig. 3). And here
                                     represented     by                              I
observed only an inverted imageof part of the ship, the imagery
of the topsail, with the mast joining that of the ship, the
image x of the top a of the other mast, and the image z of
the end      of the bowsprit, only appearing at that time.
              c
These images    would suddenly appear and disappear very
quickly after each other first appearing below, and running
                                      ;
up very rapidly, showing more and less of the masts at dif
ferent times,     as   they broke out           ;   resembling, in the swiftness
of their breaking out,                 the shooting     out of    beam of the
                                                                  a
Aurora borealis. As the ship was descending on the other
fide of the horizon, continued my observations upon
                                I                     in                        it,
order to discover           what changes might take place; when                      I
found that, as         it   continued to descend, more of the image
gradually appeared, till at last the image of the whole ship
was completed, with their main-masts touching each other;
and, upon the ship descending lower, the image and the ship
separated  ; but observed no second image, as in the first
                  I
cafe:  a  second image, however, might probably have ap
peared   if  the ship had continued to descend.
   Upon moving my                telescope along the horizon,             in order    to
examine any other ships which might                           be in sight,   I   ob
served, just at the horizon xy, (in Fig.                    4.) the top a of the
mall of ship; and here an effect was
         a                                                 observed which had
not been before discovered for there was   ;               an inverted image          B,

vertical to a, an erect image C, both of them very perfect
and well defined, and an image v-vj of the sea between thertl*
the water' appearing very distinctly. As the {hip was coming
up towards the horizon, I continued to observe    in order to                    it,
discover the variations which might follow, and found, that
as the ship approached the                        horizon,  the image     gradually
                                                                                  C
disappeared,                 and   at last   it   vanished   after that, the image
                                                             ;
vw        of   the sea disappeared           j    and during this time the image              13
descended    but the ihip did not rise so near to the horizon
                    ;
as to bring the main-malts       together. Had     directed my              I
telescope to the same  point  of   the horizon  little sooner,             a                 I
should have seen the two images before the ship itself waa
visible. In fact, the images were visible when the wholeV
ship was actually below the horizon     for> from the very       ;
small part of the mall which was at first visible, that part
must then have been below the horizon, and appeared above
it   by
     the usual refraction the altitude of a, above the ho
                                             ;
rizon, having then been much less than the increase of alti-
t-ide which arises from the common horizontal refraction.
The discovery of ships in this manner might, in some cases,
be of great importance; and, on such occasions,   might be                          it
•worth while   to appoint proper persons to make observations
for that purpose.
   The cliffs at Calais being very visible, directed my tele          I
scope towards them, in order to examine whether there was
any thing tmusual in their appearance; When observed an                         I
image of the tliffs above the cliffs themselves, together with
an image of the sea separating them, as          represented in            is

in^age of the sea immediately adjoining to the cliffs, but                                   a
partial elevation of the sea at some distance from them and                              ;

I  do not find that       I examined the appearance of the cliff AB,
and its image ab; which, had there at that time been any
striking marks in them, would have determined whether the
object and its image were of the fame magnitude.                               The
image     a  b was,   however,       erect   ;   the   boundaries      on  the  top
of  AB     and a b agreeing together.               Having examined this for
some time, and taken a drawing                   of the appearance, during
which     I could   discover    no variation, I directed my telescope to
other objects; and, upon turning it again to the fame cliffs,
after the space of about six or seven minutes, the images a b
and    viu     were  vanished; but, examining                   them again     soon
after, the images were again visible,                 and in every respect the
fame     as   they appeared before.            A    short time after, they dis
                                                              *
appeared,      and did not appear any more.
    Soon after the above appearances,                    I observed a ship C,
with the hulk below the horizon xy, passing by the same
 cliffs AB; an inverted image D of which appeared against
 the cliffs, as represented        in Fig. 6.         The (hip      was in motion,
 and    remained at the fame distance on the other fide of the
horizon:        I continued my observations upon it till it had
passed the cliffs for a considerable distance,                   but there was no
 change     of  appearance.        The     cliffs    were   illuminated     by the
 fun, and appeared very distinctly ; but there was no image
 above, as in the last case.
     Continuing      to observe       the same cliffs AB, Fig. 7, T soon
 after discovered        two partial elevations, m, n, of the sea, by
 the unusual refraction ; they changed their figures a little,
 and disappeared in the place where they first appeared, and*
 were equally distinct in even' part.
     About this time,        I observed a very thick fog coming upon
 the horizon from the            other side, rolling upon it with a pro
digious velocity       ;  curling as it went along, like volumes of
 smoke sometimes          out   of  a   chimney.          This appeared several
t'rmes.      I  conclude, therefore,          that    there   was a considerable
 fbjr on the other fide        of the horizon.
    The    last phænomenon which               I   observed was that \yhich. is
represented in Fig. 8.; where              xy     represents      the horizon,   ab
two partial elevations of the               sea,     meeting at c, and       conti-
                                         I a                                   nued,

60                  Observations    upon an unusual
nued to d;   e, another partial elevation of the sea, of which kind
 I observed several, some of which moved parallel to the hori
 zon with a very great velocity.         I conjecture, therefore, that
 these appearances     were,  in  part at least, caused by the fog on
the other fide of the horizon.          For, though    I  did not at the
 same time see the motion         of  these images      and   that of the
fog, yet, from memory, I judged the motions to be equal ;
and they were also in the same direction.             A fog which, by
producing an unusual refraction, might form these images,
would, by its motion, produce a corresponding motion of
the images.
    I have here described      all the different phænomena which
I  observed from the unusual refraction, of most of which I
saw a great many instances.             Every ship which I observed
on the other fide of the horizon of the           sea,   exhibited phæ
nomena of the kind here described, but not in the same de
gree.    Of two ships which, in different parts, were equally
funk below the horizon,         the   inverted   image of one would
but just begin to appear,         whilst that of the other would re
present nearly the whole of the ship.           But this I observed, in
general, that as the ship gradually descended below the hori
zon, more of     the image gradually appeared,         and it ascended ;
and the contrary, when the ships were ascending.                Upon the
horizon, in different parts,        one ship would have a complete
inverted image; another would have only a partial image;
and a third would have no image at all.                The images were
in general extremely well defined ; and frequently appeared
as clear and      sharp as the    ships themselves,     and   of  the fame
magnitude.       Of   the  ships on this fide      of the horizon, no
phænomena of this kind          appeared.      There   was no fog upon
our coast , and the ships in the Downs, and the South Fore
land, exhibited no uncommon appearances.                  The usual re
fraction   at the same time was uncommonly great                  ; for the
tide was high, and at the very edge of the water I               could   fee*
the cliffs at Calais a very considerable height above            the hori
zon; whereas they are frequently not to be seen                    in clear
weather from the high lands about the place.                 The French
coast also appeared both ways, to a much greater di stance
                                                                      than

                     horizontal Refraction of the Air.           6l
than      I   ever observed it at any other time ; particularly to
wards the east, on which part also the unusual refraction was
the strongest.
     During         the remainder         of my stay at Ramfgate, which was
about five weeks,                I   continued daily to examine all the ships
in fight ; but I discovered no phænomena similar to those
which I have here given a description of. The phænomenon
of the ship observed by Mr. Huddart, differed altogether
from those above described, as the inverted image which he
observed was below the ship itself.    An appearance of this
kind      I   observed on August the 17th, about                      half   an hour after
three o'clock in the afternoon,        of which Fig. 9. is a repre
sentation.        The real ship is represented by A, and the image
by   B;       er, mv, the hulks; st the flag, and <w x its image,
just touching    with the sea xy below.
                         it,                Between the two
 hulks some faint dark spots and lines appeared, but   could                        I
 not discover what they were the representatives of. The
vessel,                 of this
              at the time                     appearance,      was not quite come up
to the        horizon; and, as               it   approached    it,   the image gradu
ally diminished, and totally disappeared                            when the ship ar
rived at the horizon.
  It   remains now,                  that we inquire into the causes which
might          produce the            very extraordinary effects which have
been above related.                    From the phænomena, we are imme
diately led to the nature                 of the path of the rays of light to
produce them            ;      and we may conceive, that the air may pos
sibly be       in   state as will account for the unusual tract
                    such    a
which they must have described.        For, let bz (Fig. 10.) be

be the curves described.             We    have therefore to assign a cause
which may bring rays passing above the rays arE, bsE, to
the eye at E. Now, if there were no variation of the re
fractive power of the air, a ray of light pasting through it
would         describe   a straight    line; therefore,   the curvature     of    a
ray of light pasting through the atmosphere, depends upon
the variation qf the refractive power of the air.  If, there
fore, we suppose the air lying above arE, to vary quicker in
 ifsrefractive power than the air through which arE passes,
the curvature of ray proceeding above that of arE, will be
                         a
greater than the curvature            of   arE;    and upon this principle
we may conceive that           a                   anE: and,

sliould take place above the curve anE, than in that curve,
a  third raj may describe the curve amE.       The same may
be said for the rays bvE, bwE, diverging from          The        b.         al
terations of the refractive power may arise, partly from the
variations of its density, and partly from the variations of its
moisture; and the passage of the rays through the boundary
of  the fog may there suffer     very considerable refraction

 VII.    Cafe   of Tetanus cured by Wine. Communicated in a
     Latter to Dr. James Gregory, Professor of the PraBice
     of Physic in the University of Edinburgh, by Dr. David
     Hosack,       Professor    of Botany and Materia Medica                  in
     Columbia College *.
  Ti     HE treatment of lock-jaw by the use of tonic remedies,
 has been long since sanctioned by the successful practice of
  Dr. Cochran of Nevis, (fee Med. Commentaries, Vol. III.)
  Dr. Wright of Jamaica, (fee London Med. Obs. and Inq.
  Vol, VI.) Dr. Rusti of Philadelphia, (see American Philos.
  Transactions,) and Dr. Currie of Liverpool, (fee Med. Mem.
  of London, Vol. III.) but the fame treatment, in other
  hands, has not been equally successful, insomuch that it is
  still considered as one of those diseases which generally baffle
  medical prescription.        To what causes is this failure to be
  ascribed ? Not to any defect in the principle upon which
  those remedies      have    been prescribed     :  the cases which have
  been recorded      of   the  success  of tonic medicines       are too nu
  merous to admit       a  doubt, that the proximate cause of lock
  jaw consists in an exhausted state of the scnsorial power from
  violent irritation applied to the nervous system : stimulants
   and tonics are therefore        the remedies which are best calcu
   lated  to restore this lost energy.        Their failure I    have consi
   dered to proceed      from the complicated and inert manner in
   which    they have usually been administered.

 nessed in practice, or remember to have seen described, thi
 bark, wine, cold-bath, and, in many instances, opium, musk,
 and mercury, have been exhibited at the same time : I must
 except one case, recorded by Dr. Currie, in the Memoirs of
 the Medical Society of London, in which, the patient re
jecting       the mixture     of bark     and wine,        the bark was omitted,
 and the wine was employed alone, which ultimately ef
 fected a cure; but in this casej opium, mercury, and the
 cold and warm bath, had been previously employed, but to
 no purpose.
    This complicated         mode of practice cannot but           be prejudicial
in any disease ;         in lock-jaw it must especially
                                                   prove inju
rious, by harassing the patient, and by offending the stomach
with the discordant and nauseous mixture of the remedies
above mentioned          :   if, practice more simple, and,
                                   therefore,   a

          a                   in    the treatment         of this formidable and
fatal disease.
   Having, in       variety of diseases, attended with great ex
                     a
haustion of the vital powers, employed wine alone, with suc
cess, without the use of those remedies which are usually pre
scribed in this condition of the body,      long since resolved to

give  it  trial
           a    in lock-jaw.
   In January 1798,       mefchant of this city, while engaged
                             a
in opening box of goods, struck the inside of his right hand
                 a
upon  a nail  the skin was considerably torn, but the wound
                ;
did not appear to extend beneath the integuments. In twenty-
four hours his hand became painful, and swelled, attended
with great heat and redness, which                        spread over the wrist.
He immediately applied poultice of    a                   bread and   milk     to the
part          In forty-eight hours the pain extended the
      affected.
whole length of his arm, and produced some uneasiness
about his throat,        especially       in the    act   of chewing and       swal
lowing.   He became alarmed, and applied to me for advice.
I   found him in great pain but being free from fever,
                                          ;                                         I
directed him to have recourse to wine   to take    large wine
                                                     ;            a
glass full every  hour until his pain was  removed      and, in       ;
addition to the use of wine, to apply    compress,    wet with

   of four glasses, he felt himself very sensibly relieved;       and by
   the occasional     use of the wine for twenty-four         hours, his
  pains entirely left him ; the swelling subsided, and in a few
  days the wound was healed, without any unpleasant appear
  ances.
      What would        have   been   the progress and termination of
  this cafe,  had it been       left to itself, is uncertain ; but the
  immediate good effects of the treatment prescribed, encou
  raged me to make trial of the same remedy in a case where
  the disease might appear in a more formidable shape.
     On Tuesday, March          13, 1798,    about one o'clock     P. M.
 I was called     to visit a mulatto servant     woman of John Har
 rington, Esq. of this city.         I was informed that about an
 hour before, while engaged in washing clothes, she had
 pricked herself with a pin in the wrist of her right arm.
 The part at which the pin entered was upon the inside pf
 the wrist, immediately over the connection of the radius with
  the carpus.
     The pin was instantly removed, and, finding no inconve
 nience from the accident, she returned           to her employment.
 In a short time she felt a great degree of soreness in the part
 which had been injured, with pain shooting occasionally to the
 arm, shoulder, and neck. These symptoms, in a few minutes,
 Were succeeded by stiffness about the throat, difficulty of
 swallowing, some interruption of her speech, and, at length,
 a locked state      of  the jaws,    attended  with a spasmodic    con
 traction   of the    muscles    at the back part    of the neck, and
 occasional subsultus       tendinum,     with  some   coldness of her
 extremities.      In this situation I found her.
     She was naturally of a delicate and irritable habit of body,
 and had been much subject to hysterical complaints and fits
of fainting,     which     were    sometimes   induced by the most
trifling causes. Her irritability of habit was also at this time
probably increased, having but three months before borne a
child, which      she was then suckling.
                I
    Although have         been long since convinced     of the  insuffi
ciency of opium in        the cure of this disease, in the hurry of
the moment      I  gave   her about sixty drops of laudanum in a
small quantity of wine.          Her jaws being   " closely locked, it

  Was    with   great  difficulty administered.     In a few minutes
  after swallowing the laudanum stie sickened at the stomach,
  and vomited violently, complaining at the fame time of great
  pain and distress at the pit of her stomach. The anodyne
  draught was entirely rejected ; but, upon a moment's reflec
  tion I did not     regret this circumstance, as the disease assumed
  a very decided character, and I had made up my mind to rely
  upon the effects of wine alone, without the assistance of any
  other remedy     :  accordingly, about two o'clock, I     directed   a
. large wine-glass full of Madeira wine (the glass          containing
  about two ounces,) to be given punctually every           hour, and
  a cup of sago, or panado, with wine, to be given,         from time
  to time, as her nourishment.            At this time another physi
  cian, who had also been called upon at the time of the acci
  dent, arrived* I related to him what had been done, and the
  mode of treatment which          I directed  for the patient.    This
  gentleman having had frequent opportunities of seeing this
•
  disease, and having frequently witnessed the failure of the
  ordinary mode of treatment, he at once, with great candour,
  acceded     to the plan proposed,      and, in addition to the  use of
  wine, proposed the application of caustic to the part which
  had been wounded. Accordingly the wound was freely pen
  cilled with the lunar caustic, and afterwards covered with a
   poultice of bread and milk, with the view to obtain suppura
   tion as soon as possible.
      The wine was administered with great fidelity, by the mo
   ther of the patient, until about five o'clock the next morning.
   She had some slight convulsions in the course of the after-
   hoon$ but they were more of an hysterical sort, induced by
   her great anxiety of mind, than to be ascribed to the disease
   itself.   Generally speaking, there had been a very manifest
   abatement in all her symptoms, and she had passed a more
    comfortable    night than could have been expected.          At five
   o'clock on Wednesday morning, her mistress, alarmed at (he
    quantity of wine flie had taken, desisted from its further use.
    From this time     appearances   became more unfavourable,       and
    at eight o'clock her jaws, which had been relaxed during the
    plentiful use of wine, again became stiff and closed.            We
    saw her at nine,     and immediately gave her about half      a  pint
                            8                                          of

of wine,   and ordered     it to be     administered    as  before.    At
one her symptoms were greatly changed ; we found her sit
ting up in bed, eating small portions of roasted oysters, which,
she had called for.     At this time her jaws were almost in
their natural state.     She had taken her wine punctually as
directed, but experienced no inconvenience from it whatever,
although in health she had not been accustomed to its use.
Her pulses were still small and feeble, without any excite
ment from the      use of wine.     The    heat   of body   remained    at
its natural standard, but not at all increased.             The pain in
her head was abated, but without any appearance of suppu
ration.    Finding this mode of treatment to agree so well
with her, we directed it to be continued. We saw her again
in the evening : her symptoms still continued favourable,
without    the smallest    febrile action from the         use of wine.
Having     had   no discharge    from her bowels since her illness,
an injection was administered;         which remedy was afterwards
 employed, from time to time, in the course             of her    disease,
 whenever the state of her bowels required it.           The wine was
continued     through the night      :   she  slept, altogether, about
three hours in the course      of the night,     and took freely    of her
panado.
    Thursday morning at nine o'clock her complaints appeared
to be, in a great measure, subdued ; insomuch that we did not
 think it necessary to visit her again until late in the evening,
 and directed the wine to be given at longer intervals, and iho
quantity to be lessened.
    She remained in a very comfortable condition until the
afternoon : the pain in her hand returned with violence, ex
tending to her arm and neck         as   before; her jaws were again
 closed ; the rigidity of the muscles at the back of her neck
 returned ; her mind became greatly agitated ; ihe again com
plained of distress at the pit of her stomach; she fainted, and
had several slight convulsions.         Being called at that time,       I
gave her, with some difficulty, about half a pint of wine, and
ordered   a warm poultice to be immediately boiled.               When
prepared,   I  poured upon the surface       of it half an     ounce of
laudanum,      and   applied it   to the wound.         Her symptoms
                                   K   3                             were

  were in a sliort time allayed : I left her, directing the wine
  to be continued as before, a large wine-glass full every hour.
     We   saw her again at nine       in the evening. She remained
  tranquil : her jaws were less firmly closed, but the pain in
 her hand was not altogether removed. Although she had
 taken the wine punctually as directed, it had not produced
 the least apparent excitement. Having had no discharge from
 her bowels for the last twenty-four hours, an injection was
 administered.       The anodyne poultice       was renewed;     and, in
 addition to this application, we directed her arm to be bathed
 with laudanum occasionally through the night.
     Friday morning we found she had passed a more comfort
 able night than the last; had taken her wine every hour;
 her jaws were perfectly relaxed ; the pain in her hand had
 greatly abated, and she was enabled to extend her fingers at
 pleasure,   which    (he could not do before. Her pulses and (kin
 were natural    ;  her  appetite unimpaired ; her mind composed,
 without any inconvenience from the wine. We directed her
 remedies to be all continued as before, fearing lest any al
 teration might subject her to a return of her complaints.
     In the evening we observed the wine had exhilarated her
 spirits ; (he became very talkative ; her pulses became full,
 and free from all tension ; her skin was somewhat heated,
 and all complaints removed except the wound at the wrist,
 which exhibited a healthy appearance, and was entirely free
 from pain, but without any sign of suppuration.
    We directed        the  wine to be administered through the
night, but in smaller quantities and at longer intervals, un-            .
less her complaints should return and demand a continuance
 of it as before.
    Saturday morning         we were informed she had slept the
greater part    of  the night, and had taken but a small quantity
of wine: her symptoms being, in all           respects, favourable, the
wine was discontinued,         except   a small   quantity mixed with
nourishment.         A dressing of simple ointment was applied to
the wound.         From that time (he remained free from any re
turn of her complaints,         and has since been in perfect health.

VIII.     On the Expansion of Water during Congelation.                   Com
    municated in a Letter from Stephen Dickson,                         M.D.
    to Dr.   Mitchill*.
 IT    is well known that water, in the act of freezing, ex
pands with considerable force.           By calculations instituted on
some experiments         of the Florentine academicians, this force
appears to be so great, as, in a spherule of water only one
inch in diameter, to be superior to a resistance of thirteen
sons and a half.
    Some ingenious experiments on this subject were made, a
few years ago, in Quebec, during a very cold season, by
Major Williams.            He exposed to intense cold, water in»
closed    in an iron bomb-shell        :  the fuze was expelled             to a
 considerable     distance,    and  a cylinder      of  crystallised   ice was
 shot forth from       the aperture, which, by Dr. Hutton's cal
 culations,      in one instance, amounted to upwards of an
 eighteenth part of its original bulk.
    The philosopher who observes that this is not the uniform
effort   of   specific   particles mutually receding from one an
other,    since the specific gravity     of ice is greater than that of
 water, naturally inquires to what cause it is to be attributed.
 None seems to have a greater appearance of verisimilitude
 than the suggestion of Dr. Black ; viz. that, in the moment
 of the conversion of water into ice, the latent heat set loose
 enters into the air contiguous to, or combined with, the
 water, and expands it with such vehemence as to effect the
 divarication of the ice into irregular masses, and the ex
 plosion of resisting bodies.           This explanation is counte
 nanced by a minuter attention to the experiments to which
 it is applied ; for we find that ordinary rain-water was em
 ployed,     and   even    that the bomb-sliells        were but      " nearly
 silled."
     To put the inquiry,         however, to    a  more rigid test, I pro
  cured   two exactly equal        and similar cylinders of tin, closed

at the extremities, except by a small pipe in each issuing from
the upper surface.        One of these I filled with pure but ordi
nary rain-water; the other with water which I had carefully
distilled. The apertures of both were closed alike by well
fitted   plugs of wood, which       I  had previously boiled in oil.
I exposed     them to the open air, on the surface         of the snow,
in Quebec, the night of the 5th of January 1799, when the
thermometer stood at 28 degrees below zero of Fahrenheit's
scale.     About twenty minutes afterwards, I found both the
cylinders inclining to the horizon at an angle of about thir
teen degrees ; being so far rent from their bases, which yet
rested on the snow.         The intermediate space in each was
filled with rude masses of ice, which, on being examined
with the microscope, (in a room,) appeared to be composed
of crystals, chiefly in the form of parallelopipeds and trun
cated pyramids.         The whole of the appearances, in both
cafes,   were exactly similar.       I afterwards   repeated these ex
periments, without any variety in the result.
    From hence we perceive evidently that Dr. Black's solu
tion is inadequate to account for these remarkable pheno
mena.     At   the same time  I think  it impossible  not to admit   $he
original principles upon which his ingenious rationale rests.
It is impossible that water can be converted into ice without
the evolution      of one-tenth of the whole quantity of its spe
cific fire, which is equal to 146 degrees of Fahrenheit's ther
mometer.         Now, we know that water can be converted into
vapour, under particular circumstances, by much inferior tem
perature. — Qutere. Must not part of the water have been con
verted    into vapour in the very process of congelation ; and
may    not  this cause be adequate to the production of the most
violent expansive force of frost?

is          the immediate cause of certain phenomena,
     to explain
which seem hitherto to have eluded their research.      The
phenomena, which  seem to be exceptions from   general prin

culiar form, are included in the following questions — What                         :

arise volcanic         explosions       and earthquakes           ?     These inquiries
form the subject of my letter.
   As to the immediate cause of the bursting of vessels silled
with congealing Water, the celebrated Dr. Black, according
to the observation             of Dr. Dickson,             (see   Medical Repository,
Vol. Us. p. 35.)               seems,    in some degree, to have understood
 it,when he supposes, " that in the moment of the conver
sion of water into ice, the latent heat of the water, then set
at liberty, enters into the air which                      is
                                         contiguous to its sur
 face,   or combined with                   the water, and dilates             it      with such
 force that     it   produces    separation

 form, and      a     bursting of the containing and resisting vessels."
 But this explanation, however ingenious,    not entirely              is                            sa
 tisfactory.         Besides        the caloric extricated

 the sudden detachment of atmospheric air which                                            is   sound
 lodged in the interstices of the particles of the water.

       The   most simple     principles of natural knowledge         teach us-
    that atmospheric air cannot pass from its permanently aeri
    form state to that of fluid or solid, by any degree of cold with
    which we are acquainted. Admitting this td be true, there
   is no longer any ground of surprise in seeing the bursting of
   bodies which resist the force          of freezing    water.   The air,   a
   fluid  of permanent        elasticity* being compressed, and forced
   to give way to the particles of water, which cold, or the at
   tractive power of the atdms of bodiesj draws violently toge
   ther, it follows that the ice, into which the water is con
   verted, must break asunder, in order to afford a passage to
   this aeriform substance, which cold can neither condense nor
   make solid, and must rend and shiver, with a cracking noise,
   the  vessels no longer able to hold it*
      This theory is rendered probable, and strengthened, by a
  fact which I have observed myself, viz. that the fats, such as
  hog's fat, &c. settle considerably down in the vessels in which
  they are condensed.          I have also noticed cavities in the in
  terior parts of such masses of fat. Now, this shrinking of vo
  lume, and these cavities in fat, undoubtedly, can only arise
  from the extrication of atmospheric air in the process of con
  densation.       Independently of this fact, which every body is
  ready to attest, there is not a Canadian peasant who is igno
  rant that the cavities found in a mass of ice were folrmed by
 air, and contain it.         These facts, therefore, prove that, in the
 congelation of water, the atmospheric air which exists in the
 interstices of the particles of water is forced to detach^ or set
 itself at liberty, as soon as cold converts them into ice.
      On this principle it is easy to explain the rending and
splitting of trees, with a cracking noise, during the frosts of
winter    ;  the bursting of stones in the moment of the conver
sion of the water contained in them into ice ; and the break
ing, as well as the loss of the primitive perpendicularity of
walls which had been built during the autumnal season.
     According to the Academy Del Cimento, it appears to be
demonstratively true, that frozen water occupies more bulk
than fluid water.          This opinion     seems to clash     with all fact
and analogy      :   for we consider it     as ascertained,  that the   spe
cific gravity   of ice   is greater    than that  of water: that  is to fay,
                                                                        that

  ^hat
        a cubic soot of frozen water contains more watery par
  ticles than a cubic foot of fluid water, since, in the former
  cafe,  the particles are undeniably more closely approximated
  and compressed than in the latter. Now, is it possible th%t
  Frozen water, whose particles have been condensed, occupies
  more   space  than water in the      state  of fluidity ?   I have often
  seen  water freezing in open       vessels,  such as the copper vessels
 of kitchens, 8cc, and I have always remarked, towards the
  middle of the vessel, a rising, divided by chinks, which doubt
 less had been formed by the escape of atmospheric air during
 the congelation of the water.           It is this phenomenon which
 has probably led to a wrong conclusion.               Besides, the hog's
 Fat, which, like water, becomes solid by cold, or by the ab
 sence   of caloric,  is diminished in bulk by condensation;          and,
 if  the air which escapes in this process produce           no bursting,
 it  is because   the    fat is always set      to cool in open vessels.
  Upon what ground, then, could an exception be made to
 the general law ? But F now come to explain the effect pro
 duced by lightning when it strikes a tree, &C.
     No person, so far as I know, seems yet to have accounted
 For the shattering     of  trees by the stroke of lightning.      A mo
ment's reflection,       however,    suffices   to discover  and   explain
the cause.      As it is only by a careful analysis of facts that
we can deduce just conclusions, I proceed to examine what
 happens in the moment of the lightning striking a tree, and
 it will be  seen  whether this ladder will enable us to reach to
the cause of this phenomenon.
     Since the beautiful experiments of Lavoisier, of Fourcroy,
8cc. have demonstrated that caloric is the cause of the re
pulsive power     of the atoms     of bodies, there is no doubt that
the more the atoms of          a body are removed from one another,
the greater is the capacity of such a body to contain caloric,
or the more caloric it contains.                It is also incontestably
proved, that the bodies which are constantly in the state of
gas, in the common temperature of the atmosphere, contain
a great quantity of caloric, and in proportion to their specific
capacity for holding it. So likewise the electric fluid, or what
miu;ht, with more propriety, be called the electric gas, mult
contain a prodigious quantity of caloric, since this element

always exists in the state of gas, and the niorc this gas I*
accumulated, the more the amount of specific heat must also
be augmented.
     This being         premised,         whenever the lightning (which \t
only an accumulation                    of electric gas, discharged from one}
cloud to pass to another containing a less quantify) happens,
in   its Course,       to strike         a tree,      &c.           the tree becomes             so sud
denly overcharged               with caloric, that the                            air and other con

with heat, Undergo expansion, and thereby sliiver the tree,

troduction of caloric.
     In    like manner,         I       have every                 reason         to believe that the
violent rending of tree,        a              by   lightning or the electric                     gas,        is

caloric, which expands, with violence, the air, Stc. lodged in

                    concerning                    the immediate cause of the

  Whatever may be the agent which kindles and inflames

it is certain that atmospheric air must be found in great quan«

Ingenhouz, on combustion, it is admitted as a demonstrable
truth, that the burning of combustible substances is owing to
oxygen ; that is to fay, it is fixed and absorbed by the body

V><RAANER,                     an apothecary at Amsterdam,                    has just made
an experiment from which   would appear that fixed alka
                                               it
lies contain carbon. He introduced potash or soda, be
sprinkled with             water, under   bell filled with oxygen gas.
                                                    a
The     gas was absorbed,          and the alkali became effervescent.
Besides       this, an alkali which has been treated several times
with this       gas, or which has been suffered at several times to
become carbonated                 in pure air or atmospheric air,                        is   found
exhausted          of carbon, andean             be carbonated          no longer.              This
fact may explain why alkalies are   speedily converted into
                                                         so
alkaline carbonates even at elevations in the atmosphere
which the carbonic acid never reaches.
 I   long ago published that potash formed during the com
                                                        is
bustion of hydro-carbon, and during the fermentation of the
juice of grapes, by the intervention of the azot of the atmo
sphere.   When these operations take place in pure oxygen,
you  obtain neither potash nor acidulous tarlrite of that alkali,
and the wine becomes                   so    acid that    it    cannot be drunk.                  It
ispossible that fixed alkali                   is   an azoto-carbon,           or carbon of
azot.

    I,  however, formerly made an experiment which is con
trary to that of Craaner ; I treated in a retort, at a red heat,
with iron,       a mixture   of caustic   potash and red oxyd    of  mer
cury, and obtained only oxygen gas, nitric acid, and water.
.The alkali was totally dispersed. Another experiment, which
 I have just made, is equally unfavourable to it : I pounded
oxygenated        muriat of potash with crystallised caustic potash,
and poured the mixture, which had become liquid, into a
bottle : I corked the bottle very closely, and at the end of
three     days   poured    over  it muriatic acid, but I     observed no
effervescence.       As carbon       is not combustible in the air but
 at a red heat, if this principle enters into the composition of
alkalies, it must be united in them with hydrogen, unless the
 azot serves as the medium of its union with the oxygen.
    Brugnatelli has separated butter from cream without the
 aid of oxygen. He poured into one part of cream four parts of
 warm water, and made the mixture pass through a filter
 of cloth into      a close  vessel,   and in which were extended      se
 veral other filters    of the like kind formed     of coarse cloth.   At
 the end of twenty-four hours the serous part was found im
 bibed by the cloth, and the butter completely separated.
    Rouppe and Bicker have described, in the first volume of

 instruments.        Mention will      be made  of it in the Annales.
    A    spirit made    from the refuse of the beet-root, and con

    The memoir of Crell on the radical of the boracic acid
 has been published some time.               He treated that acid with
 oxygenated muriatic acid, and obtained carbon.

__,                           CRYSTALLOGRAPHY.
JT       OURCROY, in treating urine, observed a phenomenon.
of great importance  to crystallography.    It is known that
cubes of sal-ammoniac and octaedra of marine salt have been
sound in urine.               But whence           happens            it that marine       salt
crystallises in octaedra, and not in cubes, and that sal-ammo
niac crystallises in cubes, and not in octaedra ? Fourcroy is
of opinion that these forms are owing to the presence of urci*
This he proves by the following experiment :
     Marine      salt, or muriat         of   soda, exceedingly pure and                     in
perfect cubes, having nothing in common with human urine,
to which it never belonged, since it arose from spring-water
evaporated,   was dissolved, with an equal part of crystallised
uree, in five times its weight of distilled water. The solution
was put into a porcelain capsule, which was covered with paper
to prevent the access of foreign bodies, and was left to spon-
taneous evaporation.   In a few weeks there were formed oc-
taedral crystals exceedingly regular, and                         of    a reddish       brow*
colour.
     Sal-ammoniac,            or muriat       of ammonia,            in the same
                                                                      treated
manner, crystallised            in cubes,      though it crystallises in general
iu octaedra.
     "   It is      then, fully proved," fays he,
                  a fact                            that urit%                  "
distblved in the fame water as the two salts above mentioned*
modifies and reverses their natural form by combining with
each of them, and by penetrating the laminæ of their crys
tals.     To     it,   therefore,   is   due the octaedral form assumed                      by
marine salt, with which human urine has been saturated."
  Haiiy has described various crystals; such as those of cin
nabar or sulphurated mercury, of sulphat of strontian, and of
the arragonitc or calcareous spar crystallised in hexagonal
prisms, which           is   found in Arragon.

He is of opihion with me*,              that the   globe was formed by
•rystallisation.       In speaking of mountains, he fays, that vol
canic mountains, such as Vesuvius, Ætna, &c. existed ante*
Hor to the eruption of volcanoes, and that subterranean                    firci
were kindled up in their bowels.
     G. A. Deluc has attacked this latter part of the opinion of
 Kirwarii He thinks that the foci of subterranean fires are at a
great depth, and that volcanic mountains,                  such as Vesuvius,
 Ætna, the Lipari         islands*  &c. were formed chiefly from mat
 ters thrown      up by     volcanoes   and accumulated in the neigh
 bourhood.
     Breiflak    has given a physical topography          of Campania.       He
 first discovered there, in 1793, an         extinguished volcano, which
 seems to have been            much more considerable          than Vesuvius,
 and to approach near to Ætna. It is called Rocca-Montfina.
  He supposes with Gioeni, that the first origin of Vesuvius was
  at the bottom of the sea.           He observed a source of petroleum
  at the bottom      of the sea opposite to Mount Vesuvius, and at
  the distance of somewhat less than a mile from the more.
  When drops of this substance rise to the surface of the water,
  they form on it spots perfectly round, of from three to four
  inches in diameter, and of a' yellowish-brown colour.                        A
  spring   of  petroleum      near  Vesuvius    might      afford  some   assist
  ance to a framer of systems. By combining this phenomenon
   with other springs of petroleum in the neighbourhood of the
   Appertines, and with the fossil coal of Benevcnto and Gifone,
   which nothing prevents us from supposing to be extended
   below the earth, we may figure to ourselves under Vesuvius
   an immense reservoir of bitumen, kindled by an electric
   shock, or by some other unknown cause.
      The combustion will continue             as long as the mass        of the
   reservoir Is not consumed,           and may be renewed          whenever a
   Hew cause of inflammation             acts again upon a new quantity
   of bitumen.
      France at present is subject to earthquakes, which,                   if we
   are to judge by the considerable           number of extinguished          vol
   canoes found there, must formerly have been                   very common*

In    the month os         January        last year, a slight shock os an earth
quake was experienced in the whole of the west of France,
from Rouen to Bourdeaux.   The fame district experienced
                      in 1 755, at the time of the earthquake
also a violent agitation
which destroyed Lisbon. No extinguislied volcanoes, how
ever, are known in that district except in the neighbourhood
of Treguier.
   On the 29th of Prairial                      there was a terrible earthquake           at
Acapulco        :    whole districts were convulsed, and the port was
filled up.
   Salmon                         memoir on the origin of
                    has given a beautiful
volcanic basaltes. Some, among whom are the greater part
of the French naturalists, have considered them as the pro
duction        of fusion by fire. Others, such                         as the   celebrated
Werner,         are of opinion that basaltes has                       been deposited by
water.     Salmon undertakes to reconcile the two hypotheses,
and   asserts, that they have been produced by an aquoso-ig-
neous liquefaction.                 Water       reduced to vapour, for example,
in Papin's           acquires a great degree of heat, capable
                    digester,
of fusing various substances which require a strong heat to
he reduced to that state.  All volcanic vapours and all                                  spi
racles contain  great quantity of water.
                       a
   He     is   of opinion that             several substances contained             in   ba
saltes,   such as feld-spar, augitc,                     hornblende,      zeolithes, and
mica,     have been        in     accidentally while
                                enclosed           it   was                       it
liquid.   But he thinks that there are several others, such
as leucites, which have been fused with the basaltes, which
have afterwards crystallised                    apart,    and been separated from
the mass bv different laws of affinity.
  Buch entertains the fame opinion.                              lie   has no doubt that
Jeucite has crystallised    the mass of the basaltes at the mo
                                    in
ment of its liquidity.    The portions of hornblende or of ba
saltes, found     the centre of several crystals of leucite, seem
                      in
to these naturalists   convincing proof of their opinion,.

                           CHEMISTRY.
    The following articles of chemical news          were communi
cated to Samuel      L. Mitchill,   JVI. D. Professor of Chemistry
in Columbia College, New-York, by James Woodhouse,
M. D. Professor of Chemistry in the University of Pennsyl
vania, in a letter dated August 23, 1799        :
 I . Of  the  non-ASion of      the Nitric Acid   oH  Silver, Coffer,
                                and Tin.
    Having occasion to make a solution os silver in the nitric
acid, several thin pieces of silver were digested forty-eight
hours, in a small quantity of the most pure and concentrated
acid, prepared by distilling strong sulphuric acid on nitre,
from which the water of crystallisation had been thrown off
by means of heat, and the metal was not dissolved.               The
temperature     of the air varied between 73 and 90 degrees of
Fahrenheit's thermometer.
    This phenomenon was contrary to what ought to have
taken place, according to the chemists of all nations, who
declare that the nitric acid dissolves silver with the utmost          .
rapidity.
    Supposing that the non-action of the acid was owing to
 tin- metal being in small mastes, the filings of silver were
 tried, but no solution took place in the space of two days.
 Having    then   added a small quantity     of water to the    aci^l,
the silver was dissolved in a few minutes.                         .1
    Repeating this experiment upon copper, the fame effect
happened.
    Nitric acid was     poured    upon copper, and no action wu;.
produced; but, uppon the addition of water, solution imme-

 diately commenced, and oxygenous and nitrous air was dis
 charged ; the latter holding a portion of the copper in solu
tion, as appeared by immersing a lighted taper in the nitrous
acid gas, when it burned with an enlarged vivid and blue
flame. The flame of the taper was frequently blown out,
 and rekindled by dipping it into the air.
    Some concentrated nitric acid was also poured upon tin
 foil, when it remained in a quiescent state for the space of
 one week ; but, upon the addition of water, the whole was
 instantaneously converted into a white oxyd, with the pro
duction of a high degree of heat.
    The errors of chemists, in regard to the action of nitric
acid upon tin, will be seen more clearly by extracting what
has been laid upon the subject.
    Chaptal tells us the nitric acid devours tin, that the de
composition is speedy, and that the metal is instantly preci
pitated in the form of a white oxyd. The fame author fays,
Mr. Baume     even pretends that the     nitric acid   does not dis
solve tin ; but Kunckel    and the famous Rouelle have main
tained the contrary.
    Fourcroy declares that tin decomposes nitric acid, even in
the cold, with amazing rapidity, and that this is one of the
most astonishingly rapid solutions in all chemistry.
    From what    has been     said, it appears that   Mr. Baume is
right, and that Fourcroy, Chaptal,         Rouelle,    and Kunckel,
used an acid diluted with water.
    In what manner does water act in these experiments ?
   Dr. Priestley supposes that no air can be produced without
water, and that it is necessary to the constitution of every
kind of air : but this throws little light upon the subject, and
it does not account    for the manner in which water acts in
promoting the solution of silver, copper, and tin, in the nitric
acid ; and nitrous air may be obtained from zinc and bismuth
by the acid, however concentrated.
    It may be supposed that the water merely produces heat
by uniting with the acid, and so dissolves the metals ; but
this is not the case; for, if the acid is diluted with water,
and stands until it  ii cool,  it will speedily dissolve them.
                                                                  U

     It is a common thing with the teachers of chemistry to
fold up a portion of the dry nitrat of copper in tin foil, and
to let it remain for some time in contact with the tin, to             .
(how      tha^  it will not act upon the metal in   a dry state. The
tin    soil is then unfolded,     and a little water is added to the
nitrat of copper, and it is again        enclosed in the tin ; when &
violent action ensues, accompanied with sparks of fire, and a
discharge of nitrous air.
     The intention of this experiment is to show that bodies do
not act upon each other in a dry state — corpora run agunt
nist soluta.       But from the experiments which have been re
lated,      of the  non-action of the nitric acid on tin, the ex
planation of what takes place must be sought for in the action
of the water on the nitric acid of the nitrat of copper.
     Some writers have taken notice of the production of am
 moniac, when nitrous acid is added to copper and tin. As
 the concentrated acid has no action on these metals, the
 ammoniac must be produced by the hydrogen of the water
 uniting with the azot of the nitric acid, while its oxygen,
 and that of the water, unites to the tin and copper, and
 converts them into oxyds.
      Having related these facts, the language of chemists in
 future ought to be—The nitric acid has no action on silver,
  copper, and tin ; but,      if water be added to the acid, solution
  speedily takes place.
      Dr. Hope has taken notice of the non-action of the nitric
  acid on strontian earth ; and Mr. Leonhardi tells us, that it
 quickly destroys wool and silk, but that linen may remain
  immersed       in a bottle of the strong acid   a whole day without
  injury.
  a.    Of   the Difference in the Quantity of Ammoniac obtained
         from Bones, by distilling with and without a Lute,
      A quantity of the bones of horses and cows were placed in
  a distilling apparatus, formed of iron, which communicated
  with the worm of a refrigeratory, to which a large glass
   receiver was annexed. Upon applying a high degree of heat,
   three ounces     of volatile alkaline spirit, impregnated with the
                                                                 black

 black -animal oil of-Dippe], were obtained in three hours.
 The receiver was closely luted to the worm, and the air in
 it was perfectly transparent. Upon taking away a part of
 the lute, in 'such a manner as to permit the air of the atmo
 sphere to enter the receiver,        it became immediately filled With
 a. thick brown yellow cloud          of smoke.
   '.Having made a variety of comparative experiments, to de
 termine the difference in the quantity of the product, by dis
tilling with and without the lute, it was found that five time*
as much of the volatile alkaline spirit could be obtained                 by-
 carrying on the distillation without the lute, as could be pro
cured, in the; fame space of time, with the application of the
                       •'.
Jute.        •¦-
   Lavoisier supposes, that when ammoniac     obtained from
                                                        is
animal substances, the- hydrogen and the azot of these bodies
unite together, and form the volatile alkali  but    appears,
                                                        ;        it
from what has been said, that the azotic air of the atmo
sphere enters into the worm of the refrigeratory, joins the
hydrogen of the bones, and so- forms the ammoniac.
  i-Manufacturers of the volatile spirit of sal ammoniac may
take some valuable hints from these experiments.

of the oxygen gas of the cold atmospheric air?

                       Pavia, or Horse Chestnut.
  In  the 29th number of the Repertory of Arts, there is an
.account qf a patent, obtained by Lord William Mirrrayy for
making starch from the fruit of the æfculus hippocastanum.
A writer in the London Monthly Magazine for 1798 fays,
he has repeatedly, and in various ways, endeavoured to make
starch    of the fruit, but always         unsuccessfully            ; for   it turns to
a yellow colour.
 t
   The fruit of our æfculus pavia is much larger than that of
the æfculus hippocastanum, and is of a white colour : that of
the hippocastanum is yellow.
     A single
            nut, dried, weighed half an ounce and twenty-five
grains,  and yielded forty-four grains of fine starch.
   I prepared half a pound of this starch from the nuts of the
              pavia,    and have kept      it two    years, and the white col
 our is no way impaired.
fsfculus                                It is superior       to the finest      Poland
starch, and has been used, by several ladies, to starch various
articles of dress, without              imparting        any yellow           colour to
them;
   The method of preparing it                 is,
                                       to take' oft the (hells from
the nuts with     knife grate them
                       a       ;            vessel of water which,
                                                    in   a
will hold the fine particles of the starch suspended when they          ;
Are to be decanted intfi another vessel, which must remain at
reft until the starch subsides to the bottom.         The water                           is
then to be pdured off, and fresh    to be added, and the starch
                                             is
is to be well stirred about in it; when     must be again per*
                                                             it
mitted to subside.    The water      then    be thrown away,
                                             is               to
and the starch         is   to be dried   in the fun.
  Tiie water of the first warning holds                       a     poisonous    matter
in solution, which, when evaporated to the                          consistence os an
extract, and mixed with dough, will intoxicate and swell the
bellies of small fishes.

that ens veneris is sal ammoniac, coloured by an. oxyd of
copper : but         I
               can easily prove that the one consists of sal
ammoniac and the muriat of iron, and the other of sal am
moniac and the muriat of copper.
   ist, When iron or copper is added to sal ammoniac, the
salt is decomposed, the iron or copper unites to the muriatic
acid and forms a muriat of iron or copper, which, when ex
posed to heat in close vessels, sublimes with the sal ammo
niac, while the volatile alkali is
                                set at liberty.
  adly, Flores martiales, or ens veneris, may be made by
subliming sal ammoniac with the muriat of iron or copper,
prepared by adding the muriatic acid to these metals.
   3dly, When flores martiales, or ens veneris, are dissolved
in water, and suffered to crystallise, the muriat of iron and
copper will be obtained separate from the sal ammoniac.
6.    Of    Aromatic             Oils,     obtained from the Pellicle which
     envelops    the Seeds            of   the haunts Sassafras and Laurus
     Benzoin.
   The method of obtaining these oils                        is,
                                            to boil the pellicle
which surrounds the seeds of the sassafras and benjamin-tree
in water when they float upon its surface, from which they
            ;
may be skimmed with                   a    spoon.
  That of the sassafras differs materially from the oil ob
tained from the bark of the root of this tree. Its aroma                               is
different   ;   it   is   much lighter, and         it   congeals in   a   higher de
gree of heat.
   The oil of the benzoin-tree          delightful aromatic,
                                                    is   a                             is

in all those diseases in which the aromatic oils are useful.                       It
has been tried with success, as an external application,                          in   a
severe case of chronic rheumatism.    One half pound of the
pellicle of the          seeds   will yield    several ounce measures        of.oil.

  the air of Europe, and that the error lay in his instrument.

     Mr. William Lambe, in an             essay    in the fifth volume    of
 the Manchester Memoirs,            has attempted      to prove   that sul
 phurated hydrogen is the base          of the muriatic acid.       He  ob
 tained ox. muriatic        gas by dropping sulphuric acid upon the
 residuum     left  after  evaporating water which had been im
 pregnated with hepatic gas in which iron and manganese
 had been digested.         I have performed this experiment, and
 the result is exactly as stated by Mr. Lambe.
     Two drachms of the filings of bar-iron were placed in
twenty-two        ounce    measures    of  "distilled  watet, which     had
been     impregnated with      sulphurated hydrogen gas in Nooth's
apparatus.       In five days twelve ounce measures of inflam
mable air escaped from the water.               Six ounces of the clear
fluid evaporated to dryness, left a residuum, consisting of de-
phlogisticated muriat of iron, which attracted the moisture of

 two substances which            C. Guitand          prefers for reviving     writing
 effaced by oxygenated           muriatic acid.            The   disagreeable     smell

     An      establishment            has   lately been formed at Paris for the
vaccine inoculation.                   "A     trial of the vaccine inoculation,"
fays        a letter   from Paris, dated June 3,                 "
                                                    was begun here
yesterday.           Thirty children were inoculated with matter re
ceived from London, and according to the directions given
by Dr. Pearson. The matter was transmitted hither in phials
filled with hydrogen gas closed by mercury, and covered with
a piece of bladder.  The greater part of these children were
inoculated with the matter on lancets, which Dr. Pearson
recommended as most efficacious ; some of them with
threads, applied by means of vesicatories ; and a small
number with matter collected on glass.       A daily report
will be given of these trials, which are made at Vaugirard,
the house of C. Colon, at which the members of the me
dical committee are to meet every day at one in the after
noon."
  The following letter on this subject from Mr. Stromeyer,
of Hanover, to Mr. Hannehmann, dated 24th March last,
contains some further information respecting the state of vac
cine inoculation on the Continent                     :
     "      This   year we have inoculated forty persons, as well with
the vaccine matter received of Dr. Pearson, as with that from
Dr. Jenner; all of whom underwent                          the disease properly.
       " Betwixt
             the London and Gloucester vaccine matter, it ap
pears to me there subsists an essential difference. The London
matter produces frequently an eruption of small pimples, but
they disappear within a day or two at furthest. Dr. Pearson
calls these eruptions pustules.   The Gloucester matter has
never produced this effect here ; but it frequently occajioned
ulcerations        inoculated part, of a tedious and long dura
                     of   the
tion, which the former matter never did; on account of which
I  now only make use of Dr. Pearson's vaccine matter.
       "    The nettle-fever-like              eruptions   I   have observed several
times, but never that fort of eruption, repeatedly noticed in
London, which so much resembles the fmall-pox.
       **   Of all   those      I   have inoculated, none      of   them were severely

instances, in which               the    inoculated part attained to a due
degree       of maturity,            and where a swelling of the axillary
glands was observed, no signs of any illness existed, at least
no symptoms could be observed which proved the infection
to have acted upon the whole system.    These I shall re-ino
culate.  Should the result be as before, would it be fair to
suppose them secured against small-pox infection ?           ,
    "The most of our physicians here exclaim against the vac
cine inoculation ; and their only weak and almost refuted
argument is —Are people thus secured for all their lifetime
against the small-pox ? Nevertheless I have the satisfaction
to fee a partiality for it displayed by the greater part of the
public ; and I have already inoculated many noblemen's
children,       as well as those              of other      very       respectable     inha
bitants of Hanover; and, without doubt,                            I   shall always have
subjects sufficient            for continuing this inoculation.
    "   On     the   ninth, tenth, or eleventh day, when the inocu
lated     pustule     is filled with lymph, and the surrounding in
flammation       is complete, I then usually open   collect the            it,
lymph        on cotton thread, and immediately lay some more
thread upon           it,
                   which      removed the following day: all

hitherto desisted to repeat collecting more matter from such
a   pustule,    but wifli to know how long                       it    might be conti
nued.
    "I       shall esteem       ita    great favour    if    you       will lay   these re
sults and questions             before     Dr.   Pearson,     and beg he          will have
the goodness to answer them.

    A new voyage of discovery to the South Sea has been lately
projected by the French.            The National Institute have ob
tained two     corvettes   for that purpose, which are now fitting
out at Havre.        They   are to follow the route pursued by   Den-
irecasteaux,     and   to continue the researches made during the
late expedition into those seas in order to determine several
important points of geography. They will explore the south
east coasts     of New Holland, and bring back such vegetable
productions as are likely to answer the purposes of cultivation
in Europe. The command of this new enterprise is entrusted
!to Captain Baudin, who has already distinguished himself by
his nautical     talents and knowledge of the natural sciences,
and     who has enriched the Museum of Natural              History at
Paris with various curious objects which he collected during
% former voyage.          C. Quenot, an able navigator and ob
server; and C. Ciccolini, a cr-devant knight of Malta, who
 has long applied to astronomical pursuits in the College de
 France, are the astronomers         proposed for this expedition.

their journey, after leaving this place, the caravan was stop
ped by about a hundred Arabs on horseback,     who insisted
on Horneman and his fellow-traveller, a native of Cologne^
who, after residing long in Egypt, had become a Mahome
tan, being delivered up to them, on a pretence of their being
French spies j but they saved themselves by repeating Arabic
prayers from the Coran.     In forty-one days the caravan ar
rived at Mursok.        Here Horneman's          fellow-traveller      died,
and he himself was attacked           endemial fever, which
                                      by an
prevented him from continuing his journey with the caravan
to Soudan.   He therefore resolved, as soon as he was reco
 vered, to remain at Tripoli till the departure of the next ca
 ravan for Soudan, and in the mean time to arrange his papers,
 to make copies of them, and to transmit them to Europe
 by an English vessel. In the month of December he in
 tended      to return to   Mursok,    and    to wait there for the de
 parture of    the next caravan to Fezzan       in the spring.        It    ap
 pears by his letters, that,         now well acquainted with
                                 as he is

 tains great hopes of being able to accomplish his expedition

 I. An     Account     of some Experiments on the Fecundation
     of Vegetables.     In a Letter from Thomas Andrew
     Knight,      Esq.   to the   Right Hon. Sir       Joseph Banks,
     K.B.P.R.S,*
 T,     HE   result  of  some experiments which            I have amused
 myself in    making on plants, appearing to me to be interest
 ing to the naturalist, by proving the existence of superfœta-
 tion in the vegetable world, and being likely to conduce to
 some improvements         in agriculture,      I have taken the liberty
 to communicate them to you.
    The   breeders    of animals      have   very   long entertained an
 opinion, that considerable advantages are obtained by breed
ing from males and females not related to each other. Though
this opinion     has lately been controverted,          the number  of its
oppofers    has gradually diminished j and          I can speak from my
own observation      and experience,       that animals degenerate,     in
iize at least, on the fame pasture, and in other respects under
the fame management, when this process of crossing the
breed is neglected.
    The  close analogy between       the animal and vegetable world,
and the sexual system equally pervading both, induced me to
suppose, that similar means might be productive of similar
effects in each ; and the event          has,   I  think, fully justified
this opinion.     The principal object 1          had in view, was to
obtain new and improved varieties of the apple, to supply the

j8               Account   of some Experiments      on
place Of those which have become diseased and unproductive",
by having been cultivated beyond the period which nature
appears to have assigned to their existence.                 I
                                                     But, as foresaw
that several years    must   elapse  before   the success or failure of
this process could possibly be ascertained, I wished, in the
interval, to see what would be its effects on annual plants.
Amongst these, none appeared so well calculated to answer
my purpose as the common pea ; not only because I could
obtain many varieties of this plant, of different forms, sizes,
and colours 5 but also, because the structure of its blossom,
by preventing the      ingress  of  insects and adventitious farina,
 has rendered     its varieties remarkably permanent.          I  had a
kind growing in my garden, which, having              been long culti
vated in the fame foil,     had   ceased   to be productive,   and did
 not   appear to recover the whole of its former vigour, when
 removed to a foil of a somewhat different quality; on this,
 my first experiment, in 1787, was made. Having opened a
 dozen of its immature blossoms, I destroyed the male parts,
 taking great care not to injure the female ones ; and, a few
 days afterwards, when the blossoms appeared mature, I in
 troduced the farina of a very large and luxuriant gray pea
 into one half of the blossoms, leaving the other half as they
 were.     The  pods  of each grew equally well ; but      I soon per
 ceived that   in those into whose      blossoms   the farina had not
 been introduced, the     seeds  remained nearly as they were be
 fore the blossoms expanded, and in that state they withered.
 Those in the other pods attained maturity, but were not in
 any sensible degree different from those afforded by other
 plants of the fame variety; owing, I imagine, to the ex
 ternal covering of the seed (as I have found in other plants)
 being furnished entirely by the female. In the succeeding
  spring, the difference, however, became extremely obvious ;
  for the plants from them rose with excessive luxuriance, and
  the colour of their leaves and stems clearly indicated that
  they had all exchanged their whiteness for the colour of
  the male parent : ihe seeds produced in autumn were dark
  gray. By introducing the farina of another white variety,
   (or, in some instances, by simple culture,) I found this colour
   was easily discharged, and a numerous variety of new kinds
                                                              produced.

                   the Fecundation       of Vegetables.             99
produced, many of which were, in size, and in every other
respect, much superior to the original white kind, and grew
with excessive luxuriance, some of them attaining the height
of more than     twelve feet.     I had frequent occasion   to observe
in this plant   a stronger tendency to produce purple blossoms;
and coloured feeds, than white ones : for, when I introduced
the farina of a purple blossom into a white one, the whole of
the feeds in the succeeding      year became coloured ; but, when
I endeavoured     to discharge     this colour, bv reversing the pro
cess, a part only   of them   afforded plants with white blossoms ;
this part sometimes occupying one end of the pod, and being
at other times irregularly intermixed with those which, when
sown, retained their colour.           It may perhaps be supposed,
that something might depend on the quantity of farina em
ployed ; but I never could discover, in this, or in any other
experiment in which superfcetation did not take place, that
the largest or smallest quantity of farina afforded any differ
ence in the effect produced.
    The dissimilarity I observed in the offspring afforded by
different kinds of farina, in these experiments, pointed out
to me an easy method of ascertaining whether superfcetation
 (the existence of which has been admitted amongst animals)
 could also take place in the vegetable world.             For, as the
 offspring of a white pea is always white, unless the farina of
 a coloured kind be introduced into the blossom, and, as the
 colour of the gray one is always transferred to its offspring,
 though    the female be white, it readily occurred to me, that
if the farina of both were mingled, or applied at the fame
 moment, the offspring of each could be easily distinguished.
    My first experiment was not altogether successful ; for the
 offspring of five pods (the whole which escaped the birds)
 received their colour from the coloured male.             There was,
 however, a strong resemblance to the other male, in the
 growth and character of more than one of the plants; and
 the feeds of several, in the autumn, very closely resembled it
 in  every thing but colour.         In this experiment I used the
 farina of a white pea, which possessed the remarkable pro
 perty of shrivelling excessively when ripe; and, in the se
 cond year,   I obtained white feeds, from the gray ones above
                                  03                       mentioned,

I0O                jiccount                           on
                             of some Experiments
mentioned, perfectly similar to it.         I am strongly disposed to
believe, that the seeds were here of common parentage ; but
I  do not conceive      myself to be in possession of facts sufficient
to enable me to speak with decision on this question.
    If, however, the female afford the first organised atom,
and the farina act only as a stimulus, it appears to me by
no    means   impossible,    that the explosion of two vesicles of
farina,   at the fame moment, (taken from different plants,)
may afford feeds (as I have supposed) of common parentage ;
and, as I am unable to discover any source of inaccuracy in
this experiment,       I must believe this to have happened.
    Another     species  of  fuperfcetation  (if I have justly applied
that term to a process      in which   one feed appears to have been
the offspring of two males) has occurred to me so often, as to
remove all possibility of doubt as to its existence.            In 1797,
that year after I had seen the result of the last-mentioned ex
periment, having prepared a great many white blossoms, I
introduced the farina of a white and that of a gray pea,
nearly at the fame moment, into each ; and as, in the last
year, the character of the coloured male had prevailed,                  I
used its farina more sparingly than that             of the white onej
and now almost every pod afforded plants of different colours.
The majority, however, were white ; but the characters of
 the two kinds were not sufficiently distinct to allow me to
judge with precision whether any of the seeds produced were
 of common parentage or not. In the last year I was more
 fortunate : having prepared blossoms of the little early frame
 pea, I introduced its own farina, and immediately afterwards
 that of  a very large and late gray      kind, and    I sowed the feeds
 thus obtained in the end of the last summer. Many of them
 retained the colour and character of the small early pea, not
in   the (lightest degree altered, and blossomed before they were
 eighteen inches high ; whilst others, (taken from the fame
 pods,) whose colour was changed, grew to the height of more
 than four feet, and were killed by the frost, before any blos
 soms appeared.
     It is evident, that in these instances         fuperfcetation   took
 place  ; and   it is equally  evident,   that the   feeds  were   not  all
 of common parentage.          Should subsequent experience evince
                       7                                              that

                    the Fecundation    of Vegetables.                 101
that a single plant may be         the offspring of two males, the
analogy between animal and vegetable nature may induce
some curious conjecture relative to the process of generation
in the animal world.
     In  the course of the preceding experiments,          I  could never
observe that the character, either           of the male or female,     in
 this plant, at all preponderated       in the offspring ; but, as this
point appeared interesting, I made           a few trials to ascertain it.
And as the foregoing observations              had  occurred in experi
ments made principally to obtain new and improved varieties
of the pea, for garden culture, I chose, for a similar purpose,
 the more hardy varieties usually sown in the fields.              By in
troducing the farina of the largest and most luxuriant kinds
into the blossoms of the most diminutive, and by reversing
this process, I found that the powers of the male and female,
 in their effects on the offspring, are exactly equal.                The
 vigour of the growth, the size of the feeds produced, and the
 season    of maturity, were the same, though the one was a very
 early, and the other a late variety. I had, in this experi
 ment, a striking instance of the stimulative effects of crossing
 the breeds; for the smallest variety, whose height rarely ex
 ceeded two feet,     was increased to fix feet ; whilst the height
 of the large and luxuriant kind was very little diminished.
  By this process, it is evident, that any number of new varie
  ties may be obtained     ;  and it is  highly probable, that many
 of these will   be found better calculated to correct the defects
 of different foils   and situations,    than any we have at present;
 for   I imagine that all we now          possess, have in a great mea
  sure been the produce      of accident    ; and  it will rarely happen,
  in this or any other cafe, that accident has done all that art
  will be found able to accomplish.
      The   success  of my   endeavours       to produce improved va
  rieties of the pea, induced me to try some experiments on
  wheat; but these did not succeed to my expectations.                    I
  readily obtained as many varieties as I wished, by merely
  sowing the different kinds together; for the structure of the
  blossom of this plant (unlike that of the pea) freely admits
  the ingress of adventitious farina, and is thence very liable
  %o sport in varieties.     Some of those I pbtairied were excel
                                                                     lent ;

 loz                Account  of some Experiments    on
lent  j others very    bad ; and none of them permanent.          By
separating    the  best varieties, a moil  abundant    crop was  pro
duced ; but its quality was not quite equal to the quantity,
and all the discarded varieties again made their appearance.
 It appeared to me an extraordinary circumstance, that         in the
years 1795 and 1796, when .almost the whole crop of corn in
 the island was blighted, the varieties thus obtained, and these
only, escaped, in this neighbourhood, though sown in several
 different soils and situations.
    My   success   on the apple (as far as long experience and at
tention have enabled me to judge from the cultivated appear
ance of trees which have not yet borne fruit) has been fully
equal to my hopes.        But, as the improvement of this fruit
was the first object     of  my attention, no probable means of
improvement, either from foil or aspect, were neglected. The
 plants, however, which I obtained from my efforts to unite
 the good qualities of two kinds of apple, seem to possess the
greatest health and luxuriance of growth, as well as the most
 promising appearance in other respects.         In some of these,
 the character of the male appears      to  prevail ; in others, that
 of the female ; and in others, both appear blended, or neither
 is distinguishable.     These variations, which were often ob
 servable in the seeds taken from a single apple, evidently
 arise from the want of permanence in the character of this
 fruit when raised from      seed.
    The-   results  of similar experiments on another fruit, the
 grape,   were nearly the fame as    of those on the apple, except
 that, by mingling the farina of a black and a while grape,
just as the blossoms of the latter were expanding, I some
 times obtained plants, from the fame berry, so dissimilar,
 that I had good reason to believe them the produce of super-
 fœtation. By taking off the cups, and destroying the imma
 ture  male parts, (as in the pea,) I perfectly succeeded in
 combining the characters of different varieties of this fruit,
 as far as  the changes     of form, and autumnal tints, in the
 leaves of the offspring, will allow me to judge.
     Many experiments, of the fame kind, were tried on other
 plants; but it is sufficient to say, that all tended to evince,
 that improved varieties of every fruit and esculent plant may
                                                                   he

be obtained by this process,          and that nature intended that a
sexual intercourse sliould take place betweenneighbouring
plants of the fame species. The probability of this will,                       I
think, be apparent, when we take a view of the variety of
methods which nature has taken to disperse the farina, even
of those plants in which it         has placed   the male and female
parts  within the fame empalement. It is often scattered by ari
elastic exertion of the filaments which support                it,

opening of the blossom     ;and its excessive lightness renders                 it
capable of being carried to      great distance
                                 a                        by
                                                    the wind. Its
position  within the blossom        is
                                  generally  well adapted to place
it on the bodies of insects     and the villous coat of the nu
                                ;
merous family of bees,       not less well calculated to carry it.
                            is
I  have frequently observed, with great pleasure, the dispersion
of the farina of some of the grasses when the fun had just
risen in a-dewy morning.       It seemed to be impelled from the
 plant   with considerable   force;  and, being blue, was easily
 visible, and very strongly resembled, in appearance, the ex
 plosion of     grain of gunpowder.
                a                          An examination of the
 structure of the blossoms of many plants, will immediately
 point out, that nature has something more in view, than that
 its own proper males should fecundate each blossom    for the         ;
 means     employs are always those best calculated to answer
           it
 the intended purpose. But the farina  often     placed, that
                                                 is            so
it  can never reach the summit of the pointal, unless     ad               by
 ventitious means and many trials have convinced me, that
                      ;
 it   has no action on any other part         of it.      Inpromoting this
 sexual intercourse between neighbouring               plants of the fame
 species, nature appears to me to have        an important purpose
 in view   ;    for, independent of its stimulative power, this in
 tercourse      certainly tends to confine, within more narrow
 limits,   those variations which accidental richness                 or poverty
 of foil usually    produces.    It  may be objected,            by
                                                          those who
 admit the existence       of   vegetable mules, that, under this ex

    (with   all the deference I feel for the opinions of Linnauff
    and his illuftrious followers) whether nature ever did, or
    ever will, permit the production of fuch a monfter.                   The-
   exiftence of numerous mules in the animal world, between
   kindred    fpecies, is allowed 3 but nature has here guarded
   againft their production, by impelling every animal to feek
   its- proper mate; and, amongft the feathered tribe, when,
   from perverfion of appetite, fexual intercourfe takes place
  between thofe of diftintt genera *, it has, in fome inftances
  at Ieaft, rendered the death of the female the inevitable con-
  fequence.      But, in the vegetable world, there is not any
  thing    to direcl the male to its proper female             : its farina is
  earned,     by winds and infecls, to plants            of   every different
  genus and fpecies ; and it therefore appears to me, (as vege
  table mules certainly are not common,) that nature has not
  permitted them to exift at all.
      I cannot difmifs this fubjecl: without exprefling my regret,
 that thofe who have made the fcience of botany their ftudy,
 (hould have confidered the improvement of thofe vegetables*
 which, in their cultivated          ftate,  afford the largeft portion    of
 fubfiftence to mankind and other animals,              as little connected
 with    the   object of their purfuit.          Hence it has happened,
 that whilft much attention has been paid to the improve
 ment of every fpecies of ufeful animal, the moft valuable
 efculent plants have been almoft wholly neglected. But,
 when the extent of the benefit which would arife to the
agriculture of the country, from the poffeffion of varieties of
plants which, with the fame extent of foil and labour, would
afford even a fmall increafe of produce, is confidered, this
this fubjecl appears of no inconfiderable importance.                    The

J0<5                        On     the  Preparation of Sugar
more than four- pence or five-pence. But it may be readily
seen, that when this labour can be undertaken on a large
scale,      in which          case    one     workman,        during the process of
tapping, might be able to attend 500 trees, and if the liquor
could be boiled with coals or turf, a pound of such sugar
would         not cost nearly so much.                      The process of boiling
the juice is           so    simple that         it  may be undertaken by every
farmer.          As a proof of this I shall observe, that Count Von
Podevils,        of Guson, having brought his huntsman to me
in order that he might be present at the boiling of maple
juice, and to learn the method, he soon after tried the pro
 cess himself on his master's estate, and sent him a pretty
 large portion of maple sugar as a specimen.                               But it appears,
 from various experiments, that the sugar and silver maple*
 are the properest for this purpose.                      As the ash-leaved maple,
 acer riegundo ; common maple, acer camfejlre ; Norway ma
 ple, acer plantoid.es ; great maple or bastard sycamore, acer
 pseudo-platanus            ;   and all the other species,             are less abundant
 in juice,       and as the juice contains less saccharine matter,
 the manufacturing of maple sugar can be expected to become
 advantageous             only when sufficient plantations of the silver
  and sugar maples have been formed, and have come to ma
  turity, which will require a period                         of from twenty-five to
  thirty    years    *.
                                                                                            In
     *   I cannot   omit taking this opportunity           to refute some ridiculous      ideas
  which have      been entertained        in regard to the maple.        Sometimes it is said
  that it is apt to be killed by the severity of the frost in winter ; sometimes
  that it dies after being tapped ; and sometimes that it is destroyed by ca
  terpillars.    In regard to the fust objection, I shall refer to the maple plan
  tations of Count Veltheim            at Harbke.      The greater part of the sugar and
  silver   maples there are          above thirty     years old; they withstood the cold
   winters    of the    years     1776,    17SS, and 1793;       and will    still continue   to
   thrive, for the      least trace    of corruption,      not even     in the branches,    can
   be observed    in them.       Must not    these trees have been     long ago destroyed,     if
   they are so liable      to suffer from the effects       of frost ?    In regard to the se
   cond objection,       that also may be refuted by experience.               The   maples at
   Harbke have        been     tapped two years        successively  without one of them
   being hurt ; on the contrary,           they produced      blossoms     and feeds   the fol
   lowing spring. This winter Count Veltheim caused them to be tapped,
   for the third time.         In the like manner, several trunks of the acer pfiudo-
                                                                                      platanm

     In order, therefore, that Germany,                                  and       in particular the
Prussian states, may not be so long deprived of an opportu
nity of establishing manufactories of sugar from indigenous
productions, it would be of great benefit   among the many                   if,
saccharine                 plants which        nature has bestowed on Germany,
One       were         discovered          capable of producing    substitute for    a
West India sugar, until plantations of the maple-tree can be
formed. This consideration induced me, while employed in
researches respectingmaple sugar, to begin series of expe                           a
riments, the object of which was, to examine what the old
and modern chemists had done on this subject, and to en
large their discoveries                        by   my own.             The       result   of my           expe
riments was as follows                     :

     Turkish wheat, (zea mays,) according to Mr. Von Justi*,
contains     great deal of real sugar in the knots of the young
                  a
stalks.          Mr. Jacquin, of Vienna
                                    frequently succeeded in     f,
preparing sugar  from the stalks of Turkish wheat; and the
fame thing   asserted   Mr. Marabelli in
                           is              by treatise which                       a
he published on this subject. The manufacturing of sugar
from the stalks of Turkish wheat, and especially such as grows
in   a    marshy    soil, has been tried also in Italy on large scale;                   a
but      it   has been found that the sugar procured from this pro
duction          is        too dear,      when the price of                  it    is   compared with
piatanus arid arer p!antoitles, in the forests of Prince Henry of Prussia at
Rheinfberg, were tapped last winter (1798) without one of them sustain-
lng the       least   injury.         In order      to   try how far        it    was possible        to   kill   a
maple-tree            by   tapping,   I   caused two trunks to be bored with twenty-four
holes each, and when the sap had ceased flowing,                         the holes not only were
left open, but eighteen                deep wounds           were made in each tree with an axe,
end all the branches were lopped off; yet both these trees remained found,
and next summer all the wounds had dosed up                                 of themselves.           The     cafe
is   not the fame with the              birch, which, when tapped, and deprived of                                a
gteat deal of sap,               immediately   dies.  The third objection    so ritli-           is
culous, and           so
              contrary to experience,                           that nothing       needs be said on          thf

                      On the Preparation of Siigar
: that of raw sugar;       As ray principal object was to be con*
  vinced of this by my own observation, I made the following
  experiments :
      I sowed for this purpose, in the summer of the year 1796,
  on   a pretty good, but somewhat marshy soil, a certain quan
  tity os Turkish wheat.        When the young plants were about
  fix inches in height, the leaves, on being chewed, had a
, sweetish taste, but the stalks, particularly at the joints, had
  a real saccharine taste.      These young plants were cut close to
  the ground, and, after they had been freed from the leaves
  and dirt adhering to them, ten pounds of them were bruised
- in   a  stone mortar,     and   the   juice  expressed.  This juice,
  which weighed        three   pounds, and which had a sweet but
  herbaceous taste, was clarified with the white of an egg; and
  the liquor, which was now of a bright yellow wine colour,
  and which had lost almost entirely its unpleasant taste, was
  inspissated to the consistence     of  syrup, eight ounces of which
  would have afforded an agreeable syrup fit for use.
           3. Examination of the Ears of Turkish JVbcal.
      As  the young ears     of Turkish wheat, when they       are just
  beginning      to be formed, have       a very agreeable  saccharine
  taste, these also were subjected       to examination!   Ten pounds
  of them,     freed  from the surrounding leaves, being bruised
  in  a stone  mortar, and then pressed, gave four pounds of a
  milky juice, which could not be perfectly clarified by the
  white of an egg. When evaporated slowly to the consistence
  of syrup, I obtained from the above quantity of juice nine
  ounces of a brown well tasted syrup j which, however, was
  distinguished by a greater abundance of slimy matter than
  the former.
  g. Examination       of  the Stalks    of Turkish Wheat at    a later
                            Period of Groivth.
      Twenty pounds of the stalks of this plant at a more ad
  vanced period of growth being chopped, were bruised in a
   stone mortar with a little witter, and the juice was expressed.
   This juice, which had an unpleasant herbaceous and iomc
                                   8                               what

        What sharp taste, when clarified as before, with the white of
        ar\ egg, and then inspissated, gave twelve ounces of syrup,
        which      had a disagreeable saline taste, and might be considered
        rather as a vegetable extract than a syrup.
        4. Experiment                   made to obtain dry Sugar          from Turkish Wheat.
            To try how far it was possible to obtain crystallised sugar
         from this plant, a quantity of syrup prepared from the young
        .stalks, and another procured from the cars, were each dis
        solved by newly made lime-water,                                and then boiled slowly,
        during which process a great deal of impurities were thrown
    '
:       up.   When the liquors were strained through a woollen
        cloth, each of them was inspissated separately to the coii'-
        sistence of thick syrup, and suffered to remain for eight
        months in a glass in a place moderately warm.    At the end
        of that time I found small crystals of real sugar shot up in
        them; but it was with great difficulty they could be sepa
        rated from the fluid part, the quantity of which was far
        greater.  Each of the syrups was therefore inspissated, at a
         gentle heat, to complete dryness, and the dry mass was then
         digested with six parts of rectified spirit of wine.      The
         liquor, still warm, being speedily strained through a piece of
         linen as the undissolved flimy parts remained behind, real
         sugar     of
                    yellowifli colour crystallised from the spirituous so
                        a
         lution on cooling.    The alcohol was now drawn off from the
         remaining liquor, and more sugar was obtained from the re
         siduum by slow evaporation.   I procured in the whole from
         the syrup produced by the youngs stalks, two ounces; and
         from that produced by the young ears, one and a half ounce
         of   sugar.
              By this it
                       is sufficiently proved that real sugar may be ob
         tained both from the young fresll stalks and from the young
         ears of Turkish wheat.       The separation of     however, from    it
                                                                                it,
         the gummy and other parts with which            combined,           is                is
         attended with     much difficulty, and the produce in general
                                        so
         is    small, that
              so            pound of raw sugar of this kind will not

         sugar in this manner.

 The natives of Karhtschatka gather the stems and large stalks
 of the   leaves, and having freed them from the leaves, scrape
 the external rind with muscle-shells, and then leave them to
 dry   in the fun.
     The natives of Kamtschatka generally chew these dried
 stalks in order to extract from them the saccharine matter.
 When the moisture of the juice has been evaporated in the
fun, the surface of the stem becomes covered with a white,
saccharine, mealy substance, which is separated by making
 the stalks in leathern bags, and which is then preserved as
 powder sugar.        Forty pounds of dried stems produce, how
 ever, scarcely a quarter of a pound of this sugar, which there
 fore is scarce.     The stems and roots of this plant are em
 ployed also by the natives of Kamtschatka for preparing a
-kind of brandy f.
    As I did not find the stems of this plant nearly so abun
 dant in saccharine matter as those growing in Siberia are said
to be, I collected about four pounds of the roots in the end
 of harvest; they had a sweetish taste, something like that of
parsnips.      I scraped off the rind and then dried them, but         I
could observe on them no saccharine incrustation.              I there
fore rasped the whole four pounds, kneaded the raspings with
¦water, and expressed the juice, which had a sweetish and
somewhat sharp taste. I then boiled it with the white of an
egg, by which       it was clarified    ;  and  having inspissated the
liquor, it produced fix ounces of         a  brown and not unpleasant

ever, was not free from a foreign taste. That sugar can be.
obtained from this plant is therefore proved, but, in an eco
nomical point of view, neither the sugar nor the syrup it pro
duces would be advantageous,               as both would be too ex
pensive.       It is not improbable that this plant in our climate
is   less  abundant in sugar than that found in Kamtschatka.
   6. Experiment with the Juice           of Grapes in order to obtain
                                     Sugar.
     The liquor obtained from perfectly ripe            grapes, evidently
 shows,      by its sweet taste, that it contains abundance of
 saccharine matter, but mixed with a great deal of muci-«
 lage.      In order that I might try how far it was possible to
 procure from it real sugar, or at least syrup, fit for domestic
 purposes,      I. undertook the following experiment:. — Eight
 Berlin     quarts  of juice obtained from perfectly ripe and sweet
 grapes, by merely suffering it to distil spontaneously, wa*.
 mixed with the white of an egg, then boiled and clarified,
 and afterwards filtered.         The clear filtered liquor being eva
  porated, gave       three   pounds of a syrup not unpleasant, but
  which had a somewhat sourish taste. To free it from it*
  aridity it was. dissolved in lime-water, till it appeared by re
  agents that it contained no more free acid.             The liquor \v«
  then once      more   clarified  with  the white  of an egg, and again
  evaporated,      by which means      I  obtained a very pleasant syrup,
  but notwithstanding all my labour I was not able to procure
  from it crystallised sugar.           This syrup, therefore, while a
  hogshead      pf   new wine costs fifteen dollars, would be too
  expensive to be used for domestic          purposes.
  J.    Experiments with the Juice of the White and Black Birch
                           to obtain Sugar from it.
       Different    opinions    have   been   entertained   respecting  the
   poffibility   of obtaining      sugar from the     juice of  the birch.
   As    some have asserted      that sugar may be procured from this-
   liquor, while others have maintained the contrary, I was
   desirous to determine the question by my own experience.
                                                                According

 II*                     On the Preparation ns Sugar
 According to Stahlhammer's experiments *, eight quarts
 of the juice of the common white birch hetula alba, drawn
 off in the spring, gave a small quantity of syrup, weaker
 than that obtained from             the maple, but superior         to the
 common        brown    syrup.     We   are told, on the      other   hand,
 by Kalm t> that a great deal of sugar is prepared from the
juice of the black American birch Betula nigra carpinifolia,
 called also the sugar-birch,         but that this sugar is not alto
 gether so sweet as the maple sugar.                  By the kindness of
 Connt Von Veltheim, at Harbke, I was enabled to obtain a,
 sufficient quantity of the juice          of both these kinds of birch,
with which I made the following experiments :
    The trunks of fifty white birches, of from eight to ten
inches in diameter, being pierced in the month of April,
which is the most favourable period, gave in the course of
four days 140 Berlin quarts of sap, which by inspiffation
produced two and a half pounds of brown syrup, which had
an unpleasant taste, and from which                no crystalhsoble    sugar
could be obtained.
    On the other hand,            ten trunks os the black birch      which
had been tapped, gave in the course of ten days fifty quarts
of sap, which produced by inspiffation one pound and a half
of very good syrup ; which, however, was far inferior to that
obtained from the maple, though it was better than common
syrup, and therefore I am induced to believe that Stahlham-
mer for his experiments must have employed the black birch.
In the course of four months a considerable portion of sugar
had crystallised from the juice of this birch.              It is therefore
proved that real sugar may be obtained from the sap of the
Llf.ck birch, but inferior in quality Jo that of the maple-tree^
and much more expensive                                                      '
     &. Experiments -with the Wb'itt Beet Beta cicla alba.
   The     late   Margraf    made     various experiments, above fifty
vears ago, with several kinds of beet-root, in order to trv
how far it was possible to procure sugar from them, and
according to his own account he succeeded in obtaining from

the Beta cicla not only good syrup, but sugar, fit for domestic
purposes.    Two pounds of fresli roots gave on drying half a
pound ; and from this quantity he produced, after extracting
the juice by means of rectified spirit of wine, half an ounce of
good sugar.
    In consequence of these experiments            I  took 130 roots,
which weighed sixty-eight pounds, and having bruised them
and expressed the juice, I poured tepid water over the residu
um, expressed the juice again, and obtained altogether twenty
quarts of juice. This juice I evaporated to one-third, then
added to it twenty quarts of fresh lime-water, and boiled the
whole for half an hour.          The clear liquor, which was of a
yellow   wine  colour,   being   filtered   when cool, and then in
spissated, gave six. pounds of a pleasant brownisti-yellow trans
parent syrup.     A  part of this syrup I poured into a somewhat
deep glass evaporating vessel, in the inside of which I placed
some glass rods, and suffered the liquor to evaporate in a
moderately warm place for sixteen weeks, at the end of which
I found the glass rods covered with crystals of sugar, some of
which    were as large as lentils, and others as peas, and       which
had a perfect resemblance           to yellow sugar-candy.       As the
quantity of these beets which I employed cost half-a-crown,
 and as the rest of the expense amounted only to about eight-
 pence, a pound of such syrup would cost no more than fix-
 pence or (even-pence, which sufficiently proves that it might
 he used as a substitute    for common sugar syrup.           Sugar also
 &t for domestic purpose.3 might be made from it ; and though
it would be inferior to maple sugar, and though the process
 for pbtaining it would be somewhat tedious, it might be
 used  with   advantage    when we consider         the high price    ©C
 common sugar.

  Letter addressed         to   C.    Hassenfratz,       oj the Polytechnic
  School.        By C. A.        Prieur*.
       ^S   you request me to give you in writing the substance
of what I     said a few days ago respecting the phenomena of
the evening and morning                    dew,    I   sliall endeavour        to gratify
your wisties ; being as desirous as you are, that some utility
may result from it to the young citizens whom you instruct.
  The evening and morning dew occur to us so frequently,
and in so many climates, that there is reason to be astoniuied
that philosophers should have hitherto paid so little attention
to these phenomena, and been contented with the vague
explanations given on the subject.   In the year 1788, I often,
had occasion to ride out in the morning and evening; and
being thus exposed to the impressions of the dew, I reflected
particularly on the circumstances of these phenomena, which
have been as yet so little examined. I well knew that mois
ture deposited on bodies placed in the open air at the time
of sunset, was not the fame as that seen afterwards on these
bodies at the period of sunrise : that consequently there was
an interruption in the phenomenon ; an evaporation of the
dew or water which               appeared         in   the evening, and a new
production of water in the morning.                         I   was acquainted also
with this partial explanation in regard    to the evening dew,
viz.   that the moisture seen in the evening arises from the air
being no longer able to retain the water which it held in so
lution during the day.   But whence that wind which always
proceeds  from  the  quarter where the fun    and which           is,                 al
ways accompanies this precipitation of water     And besides,        ?
how happens        it,
               that when the fun      about to. appear above

 nas explained, in so ingenious a manner, the greater part of
 the phenomena of meteorology ; and I soon conceived that
 they were sufficient for the object in question.
    The principles from which we must set out, and which it
 is here proper to call to mind, are the three following :
    1    The air, every thing else being equal, dissolves more
        ft,
 water in proportion as       denser, that
                                     it   is  to fay, more comis
pressed.
     ad,      It   dissolves   a    greater quantity also       in proportion          as    its
temperature           is   more elevated.
   3d, The density or specific gravity of air which holds water
in solution,   less than the specific gravity of pure air, the
                     is
pressure and temperature being equal      and this specific gra
                                                          ;
vity    less according as the quantity of water dissolved in the
        is
air is greater.
      must, in the next place, be admitted, that the changes
     It
of     pressure and         weight which        may take place in some co
lumns of the atmosphere,                   must necessarily disturb its equili
brium, and produce       movements or currents.
                                    in
                                    it
     These      being laid down, let us suppose for moment,
                bases                                                         a
to render our examination easier, that the earth, deprived of
its rotary motion,     in an immoveable state before the fun
                               is                                                            ;
and let us set aside also the consideration of all local influ
ence, or in general all causes that tend to perturb the regu
larity of effects. In this state of things what will take place
in our atmosphere       The air exposed to the rays of the fun
                               ?
will be heated, and particularly that part of   near the earth,     it
on account of its greater density and the reverberation of the
planet. The air thus heated will acquire greater dissolving    a
power, and will indeed dissolve    great deal of water
                                                  a       there                   if
be any                         It will take up water therefore
              in contact with it.
from the sea,    from lakes, rivers, and ponds, and from re
servoirs, the surface of which    exposed to its action
                                                is         will                   :   it
even absorb part            of the moisture with which                   the earth may
be impregnated.
  Let         us now consider what              will   take place    in   a   vertical co
lumn assumed in the atmosphere, and first in one lying                                     di
rectly under the sun. The air being heated at its lower part,
                                               Cl»                                         and

116                         Observations   on the
ttnd bccomirtg specifically lighter by dissolving \Vater,             will
rise and      be replaced by the adjacent air.         A  current, there*
fore, will be established in the column from the bottom up
wards.        Were this column insulated from the neighbouring
columns, as it would be if contained in a vertical tube, in pro
portion as the inferior air charged with water rose, the upper
air would descend; would become charged with water in its
turn; and would ascend, arid be continually replaced without
interruption. Besides, the air holding water in solution, when
it attained to a certain height, and experiencing there a colder
temperature with a less degree of pressure, would become
super- saturated, and would abandon its excess of water. There
would thus be formed a fog or cloud, which might continue
to ascend in Consequence of the movement it had acquired,
but which, when accumulated to a certain point, would fall
down in rain.         It may readily be conceived that this trans
lation of air from a lower to a higher* and from a higher to
 a lower situation, would be performed by reciprocal infiltra
 tion, or by a current in both directions regularly maintained.
     But things are not altogether so in such a vertical cohtmn,
 because     in reality it  is not separated from the rest.     The latter
 is subject to the fame effects*        only that they are less in pro
 portion as these coldrhns are         removed from the direction of
 the fun    : the heat, solution os water, and ascensional          force^
 go   on  decreasing    the   further they  are distant  from  that direc
 tion.     If  the surface of the earth, therefore* be supposed »
 plane, it will be necessary to represent the air which rises as
 a fort of cone, with its summit directed towards the heating
  luminary ; and on the other band, as the absolute gravity of
  each columrt is increased         by the whole of the water it dis
  solves,    the  equilibrium requires that there should be a dis
  charge from each, info the lateral ones j a circumstance
  which must evidently be effected where there is the least
  pressure.      Thus, on     the fame supposition    of the  earth beings
   a plane, we should see the superior air descend and force it
   self along the sides of the cone above mentioned, producing,
   by this oblique motion at the surface of the earth, a current
   proceeding in every direction from the quarter of the sun               ;
                                                                        arid

                      Evening and Morning Heiv.                     ^\$
fend      this current would be increased      by the vacuum formed
at those places where the air, sufficiently elevated aud cooled,
precipitated its superabundant Water.
      We need only to modify this image a very little to make
 It correspond with the contour of our globe. The conical
 surface     will  be converted into a spherical segment       inclosing
the enlightened portion of the earth, and according to the
 curvature of which, the before-mentioned currents will be
 established.        This curvature will be seen in the annexed
 figure, (Plate III.) which represents the globe of the earth
 placed in the centre of a circular stratum supposed to be oc
 cupied by the atmosphere.           The circumference of the earth
 contains twenty-four divisions, from which arise as many
  perpendiculars to its surface, in order to give an idea of the
  variations of the phenomena from hour to hour.                The fust,
  placed      towards  S\ in the prolongation of the line TS, is sup
  posed to have his whole mass united in h'lB centre, which
  can do no hurt to the object which we have here in view.
   In the last place, the curve ABC, traced out at random be
  cause its law 'is unknown, will be sufficient to give an idea of
  the effects which we are desirous of illustrating.
       Such, then, will be the result of the circumstances supposed :
   Water dissolved by the inferior air in the part exposed to the
  'sun ; an ascending movement of the air in that part ; de
   scending currents diverging from all sides, and prolonging
  themselves over the earth ; these currents carrying with them
   water which they have taken from the heated columns that
    rise,   and which are forced off in a lateral direction         ; thfa
    water thus carried away precipitated, either because the air,
    coming from the upper regions, is too cold to keep it dis
    solved ;    of on account   of the diminution     of  pressure arising
   •from the weight       of the columns being     less  in proportion to
    their distance from that immediately under the fun; or in
    consequence of the mixture of currents with the atmospheric
   •feir, which they traverse at the surface of the earth when that
   :air is colder; and, in the last place, the earth, and all bodies
     which the currents touch, moistened by the water precipi
     tated.
        Every one must here perceive        the evening and morning
                                                                       dew

   Il8                     'Observations   in the
  dew, with the wind and the cold which accompany them t
  but a few remarks are still necessary to complete the defcfip*
  tion.    We (hall    first observe,   that the descending currents
  are prolonged until the resistance of the air which they tra
  verse has entirely destroyed their motion.         Besides, we shall
  fee directly under the fun a circular space very much heated,
  and which does not exhibit to the inhabitants of that part of
  the earth the phenomenon we are attempting to describe.
  Leaving this part, in proportion as the fun appears in a more
  oblique position, we shall arrive at a region of less heat,
  where we sliall begin to perceive a wind coming from the
  quarter of the fun, accompanied with a precipitation of
  water. This region forms a ring around the circular space
 before mentioned.        In a word, by removing from the internal
 edge   of this ring,   the wind is found stronger,      the cold more

 sects which still decrease at a certain distance,        and  cease en
 tirely on that part of the earth diametrically opposite to the
 sun.
     Thus, according to the hypothesis of the immobility of
 our globe in regard to the fun, there would be on that planet
 a very extensive region continually subject to the phenome
 non of morning and evening dew. Either of these expres
 sions   will  denote  the phenomenon according as the observer
 supposes himself placed      to the east or west    of the sun, since
 the one takes place at the rising        of that luminary, and the
 other at his setting;
     Let us now return to the real state       of things,    and restore
to the earth its diurnal     rotation.    In that   cafe   it will  suc
cessively present different parts of its surface to the pheno
mena above described.         Those who inhabit that part where
the sun is descending towards the horizon, will soon see the
evening dew appear, accompanied with a frefliening east wind;
they will see these phenomena increase more and more until
after sunset, when the effect will be diminished, and at last
cease altogether;       During the night the moisture deposited
by the evening dew will be evaporated, if the atmosphere be
not already too much charged with water, and no traces of

the fame gradations and the fame                   effect when the fun is still
below the horizon ; but with this very remarkable difference,
that the effects will be much stronger than those of the even
ing : there will therefore be more wind, more moisture de
posited, and a more sensible cold.                 The   of this
                                                         reason   that       is,
in  the evening the          precipitation of water, the wind, and the
cold, which accompany             it,
                            must be diminished, because the
whole takes place in the neighbourhood and         the mix             by
ture of air, which the fun has heated during the day; while
in the morning the coolness of the night-air leaves or gives
to the phenomenon      little more effect.
                             a
   We fee also that in the two temperate zones, where there
is   a   greater    difference between          the temperature         of summer
and winter,        and where the length           of the     days and        nights
vary     a   great deal, the effects     of the evening     and morning dew
will     be varied     and    irregular.      In    summer,       if   the air has
dissolved more water during the day, the distillation                        of    dew-
takes place        in air strongly heated, and that of the morning
dew      in air which    the sliort duration of the night has cooled
only to      a   certain point: in that cafe, the solution of water                  is
considerable,                       of dew lessened. In win
                    and the precipitation
ter, on the other hand, the cause of the solution    less, but          is
that  of precipitation greater. Local circumstances, and  par
ticularly the neighbourhood of water, must also have an in
fluence on these effects.               Fine weather increases them, and
renders them more sensible, but cloudy weather lessens or
annuls them.
     Under the torrid zone         a         equality prevails between,
                                        greater
the days and the nights,            since at the equator they consist of
twelve hours each throughout the year.   The difference of
temperature in summer and winter  less; that of the day in
                                                   is
comparison of the night    greater than in our latitude, the
                                    is
heat of the day  far more intense, and the sky
                       is                         almost al-r          is
ways serene and unclouded.                 It
                                 ought thence to follow, that
the evening and morning dew will be more sensible in such
a scorched climate than in any other part of the earth. This
ha; indeed been observed      travellers. In Egypt, Turkey,

Asia, the Antilles, and Mexico, and on board (hips whieri
navigate between the tropics, evening and morning dew have
been observed in such abundance, that bodies exposed to them
seemed as wet as             if they   had been drenched with rain.
     But    a   consequence      of    very great importance,          which   I think
may be drawn from these phenomena,                     is,
                                           that they must have
agreat influence on the production and duration of the trade-
winds   for the air of the torrid zone being excited to motion
            ;
almost  regularly every day, in two opposite directions, by
forces very different in quantity, must be impelled to assume
and to preserve    movement

as    acts in the inferior part of the atmosphere,
     it                                              and as,                        by
affecting  the  densest  part  of the air,      more capable of

establishing      a   current in the whole mass.
     Underthe frigid zone, where the fun, particularly during
printer, scarcely rises above the horizon   the course of thein
whole day, the precipitation of water will be considerable on
account of the coldness of the climate    the country will be
                                                       ;

                 tra£lin%      Sugar from White Beet-root* .
   I:IN   the month        of January      1799, Professor Lampadius,            hav
  ing   learned      that   Mr. Achard          had extracted        sugar from the
  white beet,      Beta cicla Linn.,           resolved to try an experiment
  of the like kind, and from a quintal of beet-roots obtained
  four pounds of sugar by the following process: — He took a
  hundred pounds of the roots, peeled them, and having freed
  them from the ligneous parts,                 rasped   them and expressed the
 juice    :  the quantity       of the  juice obtained was 44 pounds. He
  put the juice into a copper pan, brought some charcoal to a
  state of ignition in the sire, broke it into small fragments of
  the size    of a pea, throwing aside the dust, which would have
  coloured the sugar, and put forty-four ounces of it into the
 juice. He then boiled the whole for a quarter of an hour,
  strained it through a piece             of flannel cloth, and,          after being
  filtered, placed it again over the sire to bring it to the con
  sistence of syrup.          It is on this operation that the success of
 the crystallisation chiefly depends.                  When      the  juice  had ac
 quired the proper consistence, he put it into a cool place and
 left it there for the space of fifteen days : a crystallisation was
 produced, and at the end of that time the juice had become
 like thick syrup, and of a brown colour.                           On taking up a
 little of it between the singers, the crystals were felt in the
 form of small grains.             Professor Lampadius            then strained the
 syrup through         a piece   of linen cloth,       squeezing it very closely.
 The    crystals which remained behind were put into lime-water
 mixed with        a   pound of ox's blood, the whole was placed over
the fire, and during the ebullition care was taken to skim the
mixture well.            It was afterwards filtered through a p*iece of
flannel,      and     left to crystallise.         At the end of forty-eight
hours, being thrown upon                  a  linen   cloth, the crystals which
remained were not of so brown a colour as those first obtained,
and appeared to be           of  a  larger size.       They were again boiled
in lime-water with           a  pound of milk ; the matter which floated
at the surface          was fleirnmed off, and the crystals obtained

ing four pounds,                   and in taste          perfectly similar to that of com
mon sugar.
   In February, Professor Lampadius made a second 'trial :
the juice in this cafe was not altogether so white as the
former, and he obtained from it only three pounds and a
half of sugar.  From the different remains and syrups which
he procured by filtration, he obtained each time seven pounds
of a kind of rum or very strong spirit. Encouraged by this
success, Professor Lampadius                             and a rich citizen             of Freyberg
named Kanitzki,                          have    established         a large         manufactory of
this kind of sugar.                        The      first     results      of their undertaking
have been already                        published.

H          LITHERTO,       only has been said of the gas,

which the fame acid can resolve the nitrous etherised gas j
I    have further to speak of its peculiarity *.
      The characteristic properties of the inflammable                                            gas, seem
to me to be the following :

           ft,   It

   adly,             It     will not explode with oxygen                               by   the electric

green flame.   And,
      4thly,           It   is    permanent over water.                    (Section       XII.)
      • It must           be first noticed, that
                                                      it

nitroui etherised              gas   ;   nor am   1   aware how       it   is   to be purified,    unless the
 nitrous         gas      could    be 'taken      from   without being converted into nitrous

     It  is of course either not formed, or is convertible iato
 nitrous gas, by the concentrate nitric and muriatic acids;
 because, by those acids, no inflammable gas was extricated
 from the powder.
     Should this inflammable gas prove not to be a hydro-carbo-
 nat, I (hall be disposed to conclude that it has nitrogen for its
 basis  j indeed,     I am  at this moment inclined to that          opinion,
because     I find that Dr. Priestley, during his experiments on
his dephlogisticated nitrous air, once produced a gas which
seems to have resembled this inflammable gas, both in the
mode of burning, and in the colour of the flame.
     After the termination of the common solution of iron                   in
spirit of niti"e, he used heat, and got, says he *,
                                                                    " such a
 kind of air as I had brought nitrous air to be, by exposing
it to iron, or liver of sulphur; for, on the first trial, a candle
 burned in it with a much enlarged flame. At another time,
 the application of a candle to air produced in this manner,
 was attended with a real though not a loud explosion ; and,
 immediately after this,         a greenish       coloured flame    descended
from     the top to the bottom     of  the vessel     in which    the air was
 contained.       In   the next produce       of air, from    the fame pro
 cess, the flame descended blue and very rapid,                from the topi
 to the bottom        of the vessel."
      These greenish and blue coloured flames, descending                from
  the top to the bottom os the vessel, are precisely descriptive             of
  the inflammable gas separated from the powder. If it can be
 produced with certainty by the repetition of Dr. Priestley's
  experiments, or should it by any means be got pure from the
 nitrous etherised gas, my curiosity will excite me to make it
 the object of future research ; otherwise, I must confess,                   I
  shall feel more disposed to prosecute other chemical subjects :
  for, having reason to think that the density of the acid made
  a variation    in the product of this       gas, and having never found
 that any acid, however dense, produced an immediate ex
  plosion, I once poured six drams of concentrate acid upon
  fifty grains of the powder. Ah explosion, nearly at the in
  stant   of contact,     was effected   :  I  was wounded severely,       and

most    of ray         apparatus         destroyed.        A quantity, moreover, of
the gas         I   had previously prepared,              was lost by the inadvert
ency of a person who went into my laboratory, whilst I was
confined by the consequences of this discouraging accident*
But, should any             one be desirous              of giving         the gas a further
 examination, I again repeat, that as far as I am enabled to
judge, it may with safety be prepared, by pouring three drams
 of sulphuric acid, diluted with the same quantity of water,
upon 50 grains of the powder, and then applying the flame
of a candle until gas begins to be extricated. The only at
tempt       I       have   made to decompose                it,      was      by   exposing    it   to
copper and ammoniac          which, during several weeks, did not
                                     ;
effect the least alteration.

 I     will now conclude,                  by   observing, that the fulminating
mercury seems to be characterised                                by     the    following       pro

   Notwithstanding the composition of fulminating silver, and
of fulminating gold, differ essentially from that of fulminating
mercury, all three have some similar qualities. In tremendous
effects, silver undoubtedly stands first, and gold perhaps the
last.   The effects of the mercurial powder and of gunpowder
admit of little comparison.  The one exerts, within certain
limits, an almost inconceivable force its agents seem to be     :
gas and caloric, very suddenly set at liberty, and both mer
cury and water thrown into vapour. The other displays                                                a
more extended but inferior power: gas and caloric arc, com

     Hence it seems that the fulminating mercury, from the
limitation of its sphere of action, can seldom if ever be ap
plied to mining ; and, from the immensity of its initial force,
cannot be used in fire-arms, unless in cafes where it becomes
an object to destroy them ; perhaps, where it is the practice
to spike cannon, it may be of service, because, I apprehend,
it may be used in such a manner as to burst cannon without
dispersing any splinters.
     The inflammation          of fulminating mercury by concussion,
offers nothing more novel or remarkable,                    than the inflam
 mation, by concussion, of many other substances. The theory
 of such inflammations has been long since exposed by the
 celebrated Mr. Berthollet, and confirmed by Messieurs Four-
 croy and Vauquelin : yet, I must confess, I am at a loss to
 understand, why a small quantity of mercurial powder, made
 to detonate by the hammer, or the electric mock, should
 produce a report so much louder than when it is inflamed
 by a match, or by flint and steel.                It might at first be ima
 gined,    that  the    loudness  of the   report could be accounted for,
 by supposing the instant of the inflammation, and that of the
 powder's confinement between the hammer and anvil, to be
 precisely the same ; but, when the electrical shock is sent
 through or over a few grains of the powder, merely laid on
 ivory, and a loud report is the consequence, I can form no
 idea of what causes such a report.
      The operation by which the powder is prepared, is perhaps
 one of the most beautiful and surprising in chemistry; and it
  is not a little interesting to consider the affinities which are
 brought into play.            The superabundant nitrous acid of the
  mercurial solution, must first act on the alcohol, and gene
  rate ether, nitrous etherised gas, and oxalic acid.                 The mer
  cury unites to the two last in their nascent state, and relin
  quishes fresli nitrous acid, to act upon any unaltered alcohol.
  The oxalic acid, although         a predisposing       affinity seems exerted
      The   hard  black substance  mentioned      by the Count as remaining after
  the   combustion    of gunpowder, must,      I  believe, have been an alkaline
   sulphurct,   mixed chiefly with sulphit       and carhonat of potash.      The
   conjecture  that it is white when first formed, is certainly just, as my expe
   riment with the glass globe evinced.
                                                                               in

in  savour of its quantity, is evidently not formed fast enough
to retain all the mercury; otherwise, no white fumes, during
a considerable period of the operation, but fulminating mer
cury alone, would be produced.
    Should any doubt still be entertained        of the  existence   of
 the affinities which     have been    called predisposing    or con
spiring, a proof that such affinities really exist, will, I think,
be afforded, by comparing the quantity of oxalic acid, which
can be generated from given measures of nitrous acid and
alcohol, with the intervention of mercury, and the interven
tion of other metals.        For instance, when two measured
ounces of alcohol are treated with a solution         of ioo grains
of nickel in    a measured  ounce and a half of nitrous acid, little
or no precipitate is produced ; yet, by the addition of oxalic
acid to the residuary liquor, a quantity of oxalat of nickel,
after some repose, is deposited.      Copper affords another illus
tration  :  ico grains of copper,   dissolved  in a measured ounce
and   a half of nitrous acid,   and treated   with alcohol, yielded
me about 18 grains only of oxalat; although cupreous oxalat
was plentifully generated, by dropping oxalic acid into the
residuary liquor.      About ai grains of pure oxalic acid seem
to  be produced, from the same materials, when ioo grains of
mercury are interposed.        (Sec Section XIV.)       Besides, ac
cording to the Dutch paper, more than once referred to,
acetous acid is the principal     residue  after the preparation of
nitrous ether. How can we explain the formation of a greater
quantity of oxalic acid, from the fame materials, with the
intervention of     ioo grains of mercury, than with the inter
vention of     ioo grains of copper, otherwise than by the no
 tion of conspiring affinities,  so  analogous to what we       fee  in
 other phænomena of nature       ?
    I  have   attempted, without     success,  to communicate      ful
minating     properties, by means     of alcohol, to gold, platina,
 antimony, tin, copper, iron, lead, zinc, nickel, bismuth, co
 balt, arsenic, and manganese-; but I have not yet sufficiently
 varied my experiments, to enable me speak with absolute cer
 tainty. Silver, when 20 grains of it were treated with nearly
 the fame proportions of nitrous acid and alcohol as 100 grains
                                                                     of

                     On a neiu fulminating Mercury.                          lay
of mercury,         yielded, at the end of the operation, about three
grains of      a   gray precipitate, which fulminated with extreme
violence.        Mr. Cruickstiank          had   the goodness to repeat the
experiment: he dissolved 40 grains of silver in two ounces of
the strongest nitrous acid diluted with an equal quantity of
water, and obtained (by means of two ounces of alcohol)
60 grains of        a very   white powder, which fulminated like the
gray precipitate          above described.       It probably combines with
the fame principles           as the  mercury, and of course differs from
Mr. Berthollet's fulminating silver, alluded to in page 330.
I   observe that a white precipitate is always produced in the
first instance, and that it may be preserved, by adding water,
as soon as       it  is formed;      otherwise, when the mother liquor
is abundant, it often becomes gray, and is re-dissolved.
     P. S. Since        the preceding pages were written,           I  have been
 permitted, by the Right Honourable Lord Howe, Lieutenant
 General of the Ordnance, to make the following trials of the
 mercurial powder, at Woolwich, in conjunction with Colonel
 Blomefield and Mr. Cruickstiank*.
     Experiment I. From the manner in which the screw of
 the gun- breech, mentioned in Section V. had acted on the
 barrel, it was imagined, that by bursting an iron cafe, exactly
 fitted to the bore of a cannon, its sudden enlargement might
 make many flaws, and split the piece, without dispersing any
 splinters. In conformity to this opinion, a cast iron cafe was
 constructed, with a cylindrical chamber, of equal length and
 diameter, calculated lo hold 3-Uh ounces troy of the mercu
 rial powder. The cafe, being firmly screwed together, was
  charged through its vent-hole, and introduced into a twelve-
  pounder carronade, the bore of which it exactly fitted.                     The
  powder was then inflamed, with proper precautions.                          The
  gun    remained        entire,  but  the  cafe  divided   : the  portion form
  ing the upper surface of the chamber was expelled in one
  mass ; that adjoining            the breech, which constituted          the rest
  of the chamber,           was cracked       in every direction,     and in part
   crumbled;          yet it was      so   wedged     into some      indentations
      * It is with pleasure     I take this opportunity  of acknowledging  the civil
   attention  I  received from the different officers.
                                                                            which

   which    the explosion        had made in the fides      of the piece, that
   the fragments were not removed without great labour.
      Exp. 2. Another cast iron cafe was prepared, of the fame
  size as    the   former, with        a chamber       also cylindrical,   but
  wrought in       a   transverse direction,       and  of  a greater   length
  than diameter;         the thickness     of  metal at each extremity not
  being more than         a quarter of an inch.          This cafe was filled
  with nearly five ounces troy of the mercurial powder, and
  placed in the fame carronade.                  Three twelve- pound shot
  were next introduced, and brought into close contact with
  the upper surface of the ease, as well as with eaeh other.
  The gun a second time withstood the explosion : the case was
  divided, across the middle of the chamber, into two equal
  p3rts; that adjoining the breech was, as in the former ex
  periment, much flawed, and left immoveable ; that nearest
 to the muzzle was also much flawed, but driven out with the
 shot.     AH   the three shot were broken ; the two lower being
 divided into several pieces, and the upper one cracked through
 the centre.
     The   report    was    so   feeble,   in both experiments, that an
 inattentive person,        I  am confident, would not have heard it
 at the distance      of two hundred yards.
     Exp. 3. It     was found so difficult to extract the fragments
 of the   cafe remaining        in the   carronade   after   the last experi
 ment, that a channel was drilled through them to the vent-
 hole   of the  piece.      It  was then charged       with fix ounces troy
 of   the mercurial powder, made up as a cartridge, which did
 not occupy above one-half of the diameter of the bore. A
wad was placed over the powder, dry sand superadded, to fill
al! vacuities, and the gun silled to the muzzle with two
twelve-pound shot.            A block of wood was set at a small dis
tance, to receive the impreflion            of  the shot, and the powder
was inflamed as usual.            The carronade still resisted. One of
the shot was split ipto two pieces; and the block of wood
was driven to a considerable distance, but not penetrated by
the shot above the depth of one inch. The report was some
what louder than the former ones.                   In all three instances,
a considerable recoil evidently took place.               I presume, there
fore, that in the first experiment related in the fifth section,
                    9                                                  there

                  On a new fulminating Mercury i                      129
 there must have been a recoil, though too trifling to be ob
 served ; and, in the instances where the gun and the proof
 were burst, it was not so much to be expected.
     Exp. 4. Finding that the carronade, from the great com
 parative size of its bore lo that of its length, required a larger
 quantity of mercurial powder to burst it than we were pro
 vided with,   we charged a half-pounder swivel with an ounce
 and a half avoirdupois of the mercurial powder, (the service
 charge of gunpowder being three ounces,) and a half-pound
 shot between two wads.          The piece was destroyed from the
 trunnions to the breech, and its fragments thrown thirty or
 forty yards.    The ball penetrated five inches into a block of
 wood standing at about a yard from the muzzle of the gun ;
 the part of the swivel not broken, was scarce, if at all, moved
 from its original position.                    .
    Exp. 5. One ounce avoirdupois of         the mercurial powder,
 inclosed in paper, was placed in the         centre   of   a shell   4,4
 inches in diameter, and the vacant      space  filled with dry sand.
    The  shell burst  by the explosion of the powder, and the
 fragments were      thrown to a considerable         distance.      The
 charge  of gunpowder       employed   to burst    shells   of this  dia>
meter, is five ounces avoirdupois.
    Exp. 6. A sea grenade, 3,5 inches diameter, charged like
the (hell in the last experiment, was burst into numerous
fragments by     ^  of  an   ounce avoirdupois of the mercurial
powder.     The fragments were projected with but little force,
and only to the distance      of eight or  ten yards.       The charge
of gunpowder       required   for grenades    of this    size, is three
ounces.
    Exp. 7.   A  sea grenade,    os the same diameter as the last
mentioned,     and charged iti the like manner, with ^ of an
Ounce avoirdupois, or 57^ grains, of the mercurial powder,
Was split into two equal pieces, which were not thrown ten
inches asunder.
    The report in the sour last experiments was very sharp, but
hot loud in proportion.
    It seems, from the manner in which the swivel was burst,
jn the fourth experiment, that a smaller charge would have
been sufficient for the      purpose.    We may       therefore   itifer,
    Vet. VII.                       3                               both

i$0                On a new fulminating Mercury.
both from this instance and from the second experiment made*
with the gun, in Section V, that any piece of ordnance might
be destroyed by employing a quantity             of   the mercurial powder
equal   in weight     te   one-half of
                                 the service charge of gunpow*
der;    and, from the seventh and  last experiment, we may also
conclude that it would be possible so to proportion the charge
of mercurial powder to the size of different cannons, as to
burst them without dispersing any splinters. But the great
danger attending the use of fulminating mercury, on account
of the facility with which it explodes, will probably prevent
its being employed for that purpose.
     In addition   to the other singular properties             of the fulmi
nating mercury, it may be observed, that two ounces inflamed
in the open air, seem to produce a report much louder than
when the same quantity is exploded in a gun capable of re
sisting its action.        'Mri
                      Cruickstiank, who made some of the
powder by my process, remarked that it would not inflame
gunpowder.  In consequence of which, we spread a mixture
of   coarse and sine grained gunpowder upon a parcel                        of the
mercurial powder ; and, after the inflammation of the latter,
we collected most, if not all, of the grains of gunpowder.
Can this extraordinary fact be explained by the rapidity of
the combustion of fulminating mercury ? or is it to be sup
posed, (as gunpowder will not explode at the temperature at
which mercury       is thrown into vapour,) that sufficient caloric
is not extricated during this combustion              ?
     FrcSrri the late opportunity        I   have had     of   conversing    with
Mr, Cruickstiank,   I find that he has made many accurate
experiments   on  gunpowder; and he has permitted me to,
state,
       " that the matter which remains after the explosion                       os'
gunpowder, consists of potash united with    small proportion
                                                          a

sulphuret of potash,  and  unconsumed   charcoal.   That 100
grains of good gunpowder yield about 53 grains of this resi*
duumi of which three are charcoal.   That       extremely      it   is
deliquescent, and when exposed to the air, soon absorbs
moisture sufficient to dissolve part of the alkali; in conse

 enable us to acquire a clear conception of them, and to in-
 crease our knowledge respecting them *." Fourcroy observes,
 in his Elements of Chemistry, under the head Bone, that
 "  We cannot        refuse ^believing that the bones of man and of
quadrupeds       are  of a different nature from the soft and flexible
 bones    of fishes, reptiles, and, above all, the corneous skeletons
of insects, as well as from the          calcareous    testaceous covering
 of worms which have shells."
    Being desirous to ascertain the truth of what had been ad
vanced by C. Fourcroy, and guided by what is prescribed by
Buffon in the treatise above mentioned, I undertook a labour,
superior, no doubt, to my ability, and in which it is possible
 I may have been deceived, but which I submit to the judg
ment of those who are masters in the art.                 I was desirous of
procuring all the objects which              it  was   necessary should   be
subjected      to comparison,       such  as   a series  of human bones,
from which         I  might trace out the        progress of ofiification ;
but    as  I  could not, and wishing to know at least the differ
ence between products           of animal   bones at an early age,       and
those   of  the same animal at an advanced            age,  I employed for
that purpose        the bones     of  oxen    and  calves.    I wanted, to
 complete my experiments in this analysis, the bones of car
nivorous animals, the skeletons of insects, &c. When I am
able to procure them,         I  shall resume my labours.
    Being desirous       to comprehend        in this analysis, hair, cor
neous substances,        and the bristles    of different animals, I re
marked,      when treating the first           of these substances with
caustic soda, by means          of heat, that there was produced a
considerable      disengagement        of ammonia; that in pouring
into this solution the muriatic acid, there was disengaged
sulphurated      hydrogen, and that       a  blackish precipitate, but in
very small quantity, was thrown down.                  Having boiled this
liquor, there was still disengaged a great deal of sulphurated
hydrogen, from which I conjectured that it contained suit
phur; and this fact I wished to ascertain.                With that view,
I  put a silver spoon into the liquid, and again boiled it j the
spoon became exceedingly black, and I thence concluded
that the hair contained sulphur.                As this labour   presented

is found, at least in the gelatinous matter, since it is dried as
much as possible ; but as there still remains four parts,                       I
ascribe the loss to a portion             of the gelatinous matter which
is found dissolved in the liquid employed for the analysis, and
to a small quantity of a saline substance which I did not exa
mine,     and which         may be dissolved in it.          Should this    essay

VII.     Method       of determining         the Quantity of Sulphur and
   Iron contained         in   Yellow      Copper Ore.      By B. G. Sage,
   Diredor of the first School of Mines t,
 JL HE colour os this ore is a bright yellow inclining to
that of gold ; on the surface of it there is often observed red
dish, violet, purple, and greenish blue varying (hades, on which
account it has been called peacock's-tail or pigeon'sTneck
copper ore.        The form of this yellow copper ore is the equi
lateral tetraedron and its varieties. Though it is rare to find
these crystals regular, the ore, in a compact, irregular, and
sometimes       lamellaled mass; is very common; some of it is
met with in the schistous impressions of fish found at Eisleben
and Mansfeld.
    I have said, in the second volume of my Mineralogy, that
the yellow copper ore always contains iron and sulphur in
greater or less quantity : the proportions I have been able
to determine by the following experiments.                         The yellow
copper ore which           I   employed had no matrix.            Having pul
verised it   in  a   copper     mortar,     four  hundred    grains of it were
exposed     to torrefaction in a test, but, as it was too much
heated,    the   ore became fused, and produced a yellow compact
brilliant mass, which had a violet appearance in some parts
of   its fracture.       This     ore was not in       the  state of  stag, that
is to fay, in a black mass, as is the cafe when torrefied on a
large scale.
   * This analysis              pretty well with that of    Mr.  Hatchett already
                      agrees
given in this Magazine, Nos.         z\  and 24.
   f   From  the  Jomxul    tie Pbjt/iyue, 1'rakial, an. 8.
                                                                         Having

                    contained in    Yelhiv     Copper Ore.                        ijj
  llaving     roasted four hundred grains                 of the ore,        at a heat
proper for keeping it       red,    in   a test, four hours were required
to disengage all the sulphur.    There remained a blackish
brown powder composed     of  calx of iron and copper.   A
magnet plunged into this mixed calx, came out covered with
particles of iron.
   The yellow copper ore sustains no sensible diminution of
its weight by torrefaction ; the- sulphur^ however, burns, and
is exhaled in sulphureous acid ; but the metals becoming cal
cined, increase in weight by the acid and water which they
absorb : the sulphur furnishes acid, and the air decomposed
furnishes water.
   I determined the quantity of Iron contained in the yellow
copper ore, by putting a quintal of                 it,
                                       after being torrefied,
to digest cold in volatile alkali.  added ofI    to this calx      it

   it  was no longer coloured blue  the iron rfemained at the

bottom of the   vessel under the form of     blackish powder, a
which,  when  washed   and  dried, was susceptible of being at
tracted      by
           the magnet.     This iron was equal in weight ta
one-half of        the ore which    I    had put to digest           with    the vola
tile alkali  .
 I     disengaged     the sulphur from the yellow copper ore                         by
distilling    it   with two parts of concentrated vitriolic acid:
 there passed sulphureous          acid, and at the fame time the sul
phur was sublimated of citron -yellow colour, and condensed
                                a
in the neck of the retort.   When detached, washed, and
 weighed,     it   amounted to      a    fifth part of the ore.   This pro
 portion    the fame as that of the
             is                                     sulphur, which serves to
 mineralise antimony, bismuth, and cobalt.
   The residuum of the distillation of the yellow copper ore
 and vitriolic acid having been washed, filtered, and evapo
 rated, produced       in the   first instance      martial vitriol (or sulphat
 of iron) in beautiful rhombs              i   it   had  blueish tint, arising
                                                          a

of wine, and three parts of nitrous acid at thirty-two degrees,
adapted the retort to a series of balloons, which I did not
lute, and exposed to a small degree of heat the sand-bath

should       be sufficiently large to contain twelve times the quan
tity   of the mixture introduced into it.
     The ether being thus                 disengaged,   the fire was kept up
under the           sand-bath,          and the distillation was continued,
until no more than about a thirty-second part of the mixture
remained. The sand-bath was then suffered to cool, and                              I
Found at the bottom of the retort beautiful crystals of the
acid of sugar, in tetraedral prisms, under a little water flightly'
acid.
   From sixteen ounces of rectified spirit of wine, I obtained
one ounce, one dram, and twenty-four grains of concrete acid
of sugar. When it is in combination with ether and the
essential oilof wine, it neutralises their odour as well as the
oils which render it volatile.    What appears remarkable                       is,
that   burns with them, since the combustion of pure spirit
       it
of wine, which takes place in the open air, leaves nothing.
     Though        the       boiling   heat   is   necessary for disengaging from
wine the inflammable   spirit,    nevertheless exists in it.

D,      'JR.   SOLANDER      was the first person who observed,                with
 the eye of a philosopher, a disease known in West Bothnia •
 and the neighbouring parts of Lapland under the name of
Jk'dt or skutz f. This disease attacks those only who travel
or labour in the open air           ;    and       in    the above districts   it is
considered       as the effect   of the witchcraft of            the Laplanders.
The common people believe                that the Laplanders cause balls
of the hair of their cattle to          flythrough the air, and that the
hairs Which fall from these balls penetrate the bodies of men
and animals, according tb the pleasure of the witch or sor
cerer, and occasion their death with excruciating pain.
   Except in East and West Bothnia, Torneo, Kemi, and
other parts on the gulph of Bothnia, this disease
                                                                      it is
                                                      exceed
ingly rare in Sweden. In those part9, however,         gene*              is
rally known, and attacks some of the inhabitants every year.
Linnæus conjectured that this disease was occasioned        a-                  by
small kind of worm, one of which, in   dried state, had been
                                                          a
sent to him from Kemi     but he concluded, very erroneously,
                            J;
that the disease might be of the same nature as that prevalent
among the horses in Holland, and known under the name of
the vyvel or feyfel. This       now proved to be
                                        is            mistake.        a
I>r. Solander, however, has placed    beyond all doubt, that

with which healthy people are often unexpectedly attacked
in the before-mentioned districts.               According to his ob
servations, the extensive fens in the northern part of Bothnia
are the principal feat of this destructive insect, and the tu»
mours it produces have been remarked chiefly by the inha
bitants of these districts or those who travel through them.
In men, this disease generally attacks those parts of the body
which are exposed to the air, such as the hands, arms, neck,
&c. A prick like that of a needle is first felt, after which a
black speck is seen in the place, and a violent itching ensues.
This is soon after followed with extreme pain, a red spot is
produced, and the neighbouring parts are inflamed.                 As the
disease    increases,     the parts      become    more    irritated   and
painful,    and   the patients are seized with         an inflammatory
fever, accompanied with fits          of fainting  and delirium,    which,
often carries them       off in the course of a   sow days,     and some*
times of a few hours.           Some, however, get over this fever,
but are affected in the injured part with malignant and te
dious sores, which often remain incurable during their whole
lives.
    Dr. Solander was himself           an eye-witness    of a case  of this
kind,    and he mentions others which were related to him                by
 persons   worthy of credit.       The   greater part  of them occurred
 in the spring      and    summer, though instances of this disease
 have    been   observed    in winter.      When the worm        has pene
 trated into the flesh,      it is often impossible to save the patient
 even by cutting out the affected part ; but it sometimes hap
 pens that the small animal which is the cause of the evil may
he extracted     with   a  pair of pincers, or the teeth,    if the proper
 means     be employed immediately after            the puncture is felt.
 When this is      done     by cutting, the patient,    if the   worm has
 penetrated to a great depth, is exposed to the most excruci
ating pain. Old women, who perform the operation of cut
ting the flesh or extracting the worm with a variety of super
 stitious practices, are accustomed to apply birch-tar to the
 wound, and then to bind it up. In one cafe, the worm was
 extracted    by the accidental application of curdled milk or
new cheese, and the patient cured in the course of fix hours.
This    remedy was afterwards repeated            with success.     When
                                      T  %                              the

 14.0                 Diseases occasioned by Jnfe&s
 the patient dies, the destructive insect, it is said, comes forth
 of its own accord from the mortified part.
     But in whatever manner it may come forth, it has always
 the appearance of a very tender small worm, of the size of a
 hair, about half an inch in length, of a flesh or whitish yel
 low colour,    and often black at the extremities.           On    each side
 it  is armed with a single row          of uncommonly tender bristles
 standing    backwards,    which      enable    it to penetrate the flelh
 better ; and in all probability these bristles occasion that
 acute pain which is felt, and prevent it from being extracted.
 No rings     or, indentations can be observed on it j and, except
 the bristles, it has a great resemblance to the hair-worm.
     This is the singular animal which Linnæus has admitted
 into his system under the very proper name of the Furia in-
fernalis. It is however hardly possible to suppose, with this
 naturalist, that the above worm falls down from the atmo
 sphere; for it will be difficult to explain by what power it
 can raise itself into the air. But the wonder will cease if we
 suppose that this worm may be borne aloft on bits of straw
 or the leaves of trees, and may then be conveyed by the
  winds till it at length falls down on the body of some animal.
      In different parts of the Ruffian empire, particularly in dry
  summers, and in open marshy districts, dangerous diseases of
  the like kind have been observed, but essentially different
  from that of Sweden, though in all probability produced by
  a similar cause.
      The  elder Gmelin was the first person who remarked this
  disease  in Siberia. He mentions it in his travels *, and gives
  an account of its symptoms as well as of the remedies em
  ployed to cure it. In order that the effects of the Ruffian
  disease may be compared with those of the Swedish fury,                     I
  shall here give an account of the former according to the
  latest observations    on the subjects.         The open level country

        the districts between the
ticularly the low, marshy, and saline fens of these immense
plains which are dried up every year, and situations of the
like kind near the rivers and brackisti lakes from the banks
of which  the water retires during the droughty weather, are
the places where this disease breaks out every year, and pre
vails more or less both among men and cattle. In these
countries, the horses and other smooth-haired                       animals never
go out with safety           in summer    to pasture.        For this    reason the
inhabitants of the banks of the Irtisch,                    where this    disease    is
most dangerous, drive their horses in summer to the high pas
tures, at           from the river, where in that season cool
                a distance
winds prevail, and where this kind of plague is never ob
served to make its appearance.   In the northern and eastern
parts of Siberia, and also in the mountains, it is not known.
This disease, which is distinguished in the above districts
by the name of morowasa jafuia, or plague, is most common
in the summer months, when the sultry south winds prevail.
As soon as the winds and the weather become cold, no traces
of it are to be seen ; but if such a change of temperature does
not take place, the disease often continues till autumn, both
among men and horses.       Smooth-haired cattle also, and
camels, the (kins of which in summer are almost destitute
of hair, are subject it. If we now reflect, that people who
 reside much in the house escape this scourge,                      and that   it   at
 tacks those only who are exposed to the open air in the fields
 and meadows ; that it chiefly affects those parts which are
 naked or thinly covered,              and that it appears         most frequently
 in    horses    in   the belly, where the hair is thin ; that sheep,               by
 whose thick wool the              disease seems, as   it   were, to be checked,
 never suffer from           it,   and that the smoke         of   the fires   which
 the natives kindle, protects,            in   some measure,       their cattle; we
 shall naturally be led to conclude, when the symptoms also are
 taken into consideration, that something must penetrate im
 perceptibly into the body from without, and     its poisonous     by
 quality produce inflammatory  tumours  and ulcers.       pro             It   is
 bable, also, that      something endowed with life, which
                          it   is                                                        is
 conveyed  through the air to the marshy plains, where     at                  it
 tacks animals, and forces its way into their flesh. But what
                                                                                    ever

I4»                        Diseases      occasioned by Infetls
ever it may be, the nature of it has not yet been determined
by  certain observation.  The puncture of flies and gnats,
especially when they have fed upon carrion, is in those dis
tricts of   poisonous and inflammatory nature : but these in
              a
sects are too perceptible, and their effects so sensible, that we
cannot ascribe to them a disease which at first is not attended
with any remarkable pain,                 and   in this   respect   it is particularly
distinguished          from the Swedish.
   The symptoms of this disease, as generally observed,                             are as
follows: — Persons in perfect good health, of all ages                              and    of
both sexes, unexpectedly feel, while walking in the fields, an
itching accompanied with a small hard tumour, which at first
they are inclined to consider as the effect of the puncture of a
gnat or fly. It, however, speedily increases in size and hardness,
and before much attention has been paid to      has proceeded   it,
to such length, that     needle may be stuck into the hard
                                    a
swollen part without the patient being sensible of pain, unless
the needle    made to reach the found flesh.
                  is                            In the centre
of the tumour there    then seen, for the most part,
                                is                       red or                 a
blueish point like the prick of an insect, and in which,                                   if
proper means be not soon applied, mortification pr gangrene
ensues, and spreads itself to the neighbouring parts. In the
first stageof the disease, the patient has no internal affections;
but as   the  inflammation of the tumour increases (which,
however,     not attended with much pain), head-ache, dejec
              is
tion, and internal uneasiness take place     but      not impro
                                                          :     it     is
bable that the. fear                of danger may contribute to promote
                                                                    it by
these      symptoms.           Among cattle          attacked               this disease,
uneasiness and dejection                 are not observed till              has attained
to the utmost degree of its violence.
   Cattle attacked   this disease generally die, partly because
                               by
the tumours are observed too late, and partly because the
common people, being negligent, do not give themselves the
trouble to apply    cure   on the other hand, among the hu
                           a         :
man species,     cure seldom fails

                                                  if
been employed in time. The cure generally used                                      by   the
common people, as mentioned in Gmelin's Travels,                                     is,   to
run    long needle through the tumours in different direc
       a

and tobacco, and to forbid the patients the use of cold li
quors and of certain kinds of food. This cure, however,
has been rendered still simpler, and various other means more
effectual have been devised.    On the Irtisch, a strong lixi
vium of wormwood ashes is employed, and a decoction of
tobacco and sal-ammoniac, or alum, without scarification.
On    the   Ui
             line, a warm plaster made of pulverised night
shade, sal-ammoniac,    yeast, and oatmeal, is said to be an
infallible remedy; but the common people still adhere to
the old painful method of cure, which is used even by some
surgeons. In other places the common people consider the
application of a living frog to the tumours as of service ; but
I have no authority for warranting its good effects.        The
other means, as is  well known by long experience, are proper
for destroying vermin^ and therefore favour the conjecture
before mentioned respecting the primary cause of this disease.
   In the extensive low-lands on the Wolga, from Saratof
towards Astracan,  the cattle, and particularly horses, when
they are driven out to pasture too soon after the water with
which the fields have been overflown has run off, frequently
die   in    Consequence      of hard inflammatory tumours which
break out on the         breast and belly, and which, without doubt,
are of the fame nature as the above-described Siberian disease.
The Calmucs call these tumours mohmo, but, as appears, con
found under this name other maladies, accompanied with tu
mours, which attack cattle. This much, however, is certain,
that on the Wolga the tumours here described are prevalent
among the human species ; but they are most common in
dry summers ; and the men, who are daily exposed to the
 open air, are more subject to them than the women, who
 constantly reside in their smoky huts, or never remove to a
 great distance from them.     Among the Calmucs on the
 Wolga, the Songari, who           were acquainted   with this   disease
 in their former country, the Altai mountains, recommend,
 as a remedy for         it,
                     to burn on the tumour    bit of Chinese
                                                     a
 incense, which consumes in the fame manner as tinder, and
 then to thrust into* the black point which appears in the
 middle of     a copper or iron needle, till
                 it,                         penetrate to the

The    Torgatese    are accustomed          to stimulate     and scarify these
 tumours with the petrified tooth of a shark, which they call
a snake's horn.  I have been informed in a letter from a
person vtho was an eye witness, that tumours of this kind in
a horse, dissected after death, were found to consist of soft
watery matter. Harses often die on the day when the tu
mours appear*.      Among the Calmucs it is customary to
burn all the cattle which die of the so called mobmo, but the
poor are seldom so nice, they only cut out the flesh around
the tumours, and eat the remainder without any ceremony.
It is said that the blood of those who feed on such carrion
becomes corrupted, and that they are subject to running
sores, called cbattiga, which are often infectious.   But that
this observation is applicable rather to other diseases among
cattle, than to the tumours in question, I conclude from this
circumstance, that the Tartars fay, that the mobmo of horses,
which,    as is well known,         are most subject          to external tu
mours, are not always infectious ; those, however, of cows
and goats are more dangerous, so that not only the flesh of
these animals,      when eaten inadvertently, is infectious, but
even their skins    if a person lies or sits upon them. According
to some late observations          which    have been communicated to
me, purgatives      administered        to those attacked         with these tu
mours are pernicious         :   on the other hand, strengthening             spi
rituous remedies         are found to be serviceable       if   used before   the
appearance   of lethargic affections, which in those countries
seldom  fail to accompany this disease, and which sometimes
continue two or three days.        The Calmucs, as    am in         I
formed, are inclined to ascribe the mobmo tumours to the
poisonous puncture or filth of an insect, and therefore to an
external cause;

 V.ESPERTILIO plicatus f,                     tailed ; the nostrils round,
 simple perforations; the upper lip very large, and folded;
the ears as large as the head, folded, and half pendulous.
Inhabits old houses at Puttahaut in Bengal.
    From      its teeth  this bat can only be mistaken for the Ce-
pbaloles ; but the description of that species will not apply
 to this.
    From the point of the nose to the root of the tail three
inches    ;  from the extremity of one wing to that of             the1  other
twelve inches.
    The wings, and naked parts of the body,             are foot- coloured.
The hair is mixed with alh-colour, and is                paler  below than
on the back.
    The    head is large, thick     at the moulders, and tapers gra
dually to the snout       ; which    is blunt,     terminates   in   a  heart-
stiaped margin,       and   projects far beyond the        lower jaw.       It
is mostly naked ; but has several            long, erect bristles.        The
nostrils are small circular holes, remote from each other, and
placed under the margin of the snout.                   The upper lip at
the fides hangs over the under jaw, and at each fide is deeply
wrinkled with seven or eight vertical folds. The ears are
large, blunt, wrinkled, and somewhat pendulous.                          From
being bent in several folds, they at first fight appear to be
thick and fleshy.        They approach very near at their insertion
on the brow, and are naked, except on a sharp sinus towards
the hinder part of the head.            On their edge near the tips are
five or fix small warts. There are no internal auricles.                  The
eyes are in two small slits above the angles           of  the mouth, and
are almost covered        by the ears.      There are two strong tusks
in each jaw.        In  the   upper jaw there are two conical sharp
fore-teeth, half     as long as the tusks. Below, in place of these,
there are only two small points,           scarcely projecting from the
gums.       The grinders     are a little removed from the tusks, and

 lower jaw each grinder has two sharp points j in the uppef
jaw each, except the first pair, has three points.
     The neck is very short, and so covered with hair as to be
 scarcely observable.         The  shoulders are high and round,           with
 a deep cavity between          them.     The body at the         shoulders    is
 much wider than at the          haunches. The buttocks            are bare.
     The tail     is naked, round,       and   blunt  :  it is turned up at
 the end.        A strong hooked claw in place of the thumb. No
 carpus     nor   metacarpus. Four long singers serve to distend
 the membrane os the wing. The hind-fcct have five distinct
 toes,   with    small sharp claws.       The membrane of the wings
joins     the   hinder legs and tail, but it is not nearly so long as
 the latter.       A broad hairy list surrounds all round the body,
 and covers the bottom of the membrane.
     The drawing        and description were       taken from a male.           I
 could observe no nipple?.
     The natives of Bengal have only two names for all the
 species of bats found in their country.                    The large bats,
 which nestle on trees, and live chiefly on fruit, they call
 Badur:        those  which, like   the one     above    described,     inhabit
 caverns      and   old buildings,     and live chiefly on infects, they
 call Cbamcheeha.

 the process going on, which              Nature employs to enclose fo

      At   the bottom       of a deep ravine on the north-west fide of
  the Mendip       hills,  in Somersetshire,     near the little village of
  Berringtoh, there has been discovered a cavern of considerable

extent, in which             was     found a great collection                 of human
bones.
     As I                 in this cavern many circumstances
              have observed
which appear    curipus to me, I beg leave to mention them,
as I do not believe there is another place in the kingdom
where the different          stages      (if
                                          I    may be allowed the expression)
pf   bones  incorporating with limestone                           rocks can be       so   well

                                                             a

reous earth, deposits white kind of paste on most parts of
                                 a

ment, and       a   large    proportion of them arc actually fixed                              in,
the solid rock.        I      suppose, therefore, that this substance,
which    at first     is    in
                       state resembling mortar,
                                 a                 losing its                by

tunity of examining the process in every part.     Had the
cavern not been discovered, and these- deposited suhstanecs
not been removed,           I    do not doubt that the whole excavation
would,    in no great length of time, have been completely
filled up. The water was still bringing fresh quantities of
calcareous earth, and the bones were in some places com
pletely incorporated with the solid rock.  Every degree of
intermediate solidity was plainly discernible.   There were
several nqdules of stone, each of which contained     perfect                     a
human skull. The substance which         deposited from   the is
water effervesces with adds,                   and hasj         in fliort,    every cha

                                         is
a most beautiful stalactite, perfectly conical, which, when
the cavern was         first discovered,           reached         within    an inch       of   a
cone of the same kind which rises from the floor. By some
accident   small part of the stalactite was broken off; but
         is a
Nature    now busy iu repairing an injury which had been,
done to one of the prettiest productions of her mineral king
dom.     Had        these two cones, met,               a    beautiful column would
have    been    formed of nearly fifteen                         in height.

found that there                 was     adhering to         the surface    of many of
them,      a substance             which      resembled       the     spermaceti     I   have

  I  have to add, that this cavern was discovered                               about two
years    ago by accident, and  that no satisfactory reason has
been given for this singular accumulation of human bones.

OEVERAL       modes of counteradting the pressure of a de
creasing column of mercury having been thought of, in con
junction with Mr.                 W. Cox,      the following was at last adopted
as the most simple and effectual                    :
  Plate        V. Fig.        1. represents a section os the machine, which
consists       of   a strong glass cylinder             A,    cemented     to one    of    the
fame kind           B,    fitted to the solid block          C, into which         the glass
tube D         is cemented             for conveying air into the moveable                  re
ceiver E.
  The          brass axis         F,    sig. 2, having a double bearing at a, a,
is terminated at one end by the wheel G, the circumference
of which is equal to the depth of the receiver, so that it may
be drawn to the surface of the mercury, by the cord b, in one
revolution          ;    to the        other end is fitted          the wheel      H,    over
which the balance-cord c, runs in an opposite direction in
the spiral groove e : a front view of the wheel H is shown at

Cury, it is        balanced     by the small weight     K, which hangj
from that part of the spiral where the radius is equal to that
of the wheel G ; from this point the radius of the spiral must:
be increased in such proportion, that in every part of its cir
cuit, the weight K may be an exact counterpoise to the air-
holder.         In this way, so little friction will be produced, that
merely plunging the lower orifice of the tube D under mer
cury contained in the small vessel L, will be sufficient to
overcome every resistance, and to force the gas discharged
 from the beak of a retort into the receiver, where, whatever
 may be its quantity, it will be subjected to           a pressure   exactly
 corresponding to that of the atmosphere.                The edge of the
 wheel H being graduated, the balance-cord c may be made
 to indicate its volume.
      Should      it  at any time be necessary to reduce the pressure
  to the medium            standard  of the barometer,    it may   easily be
  done by graduating the lower end of the tube              D, and adding
  to the weights        I or K,   as  may be found necessary; ihe sur
  face of the mercury in the tube pointing out the increase or
  diminution.
      The concavity        at the top of the internal cylinder  is intended
  to contain any liquid it may be thought proper to expose ta
  the action of the gas.
       The upper orifice f, with its ground-stopper, is particulars
  useful in conveying air from the retort g, with its curved
  neck,      into    the receiver, without its pasting through the
  tube     D.     In al) cafes where a rapid extrication of gas is ex
   pected,     the retort    g should be firmly luted to the orifice, and
  the weight I removed from the top of the receiver ; this, by
   diminishing the pressure, will admit the gas to expand freely in
   the air-holder at the instant of its formation, and prevent an
   explosion of the vessels.         The fame caution mult be observed
   whenever any inflammation of gas is produced by the electric
   spark.
        The air may       be readily transferred   through water, or even
   tr.»  rcury, by the tube b, Fig. 1 .
        To  prevent an absorption of mercury in case of a condensa
   tion taking place in the retort made use of for generating air,
   Jdr. Davy has applied the stop-cock i} to which, the neck is
                         8                                             firmly

 firmly luted. This stop-cock is likewise of great service in
 saturating water with acid or alkaline gases, which may be
 effected by luting one end        of the tube k to the stop-cock and
 plunging     the other into      the fluid   in the small vessel /, ce
mented at top, and terminating in the bent funnel m\ the
 tube b having been previously removed, and the lower orifice
of   the tube   D either sunk    to a considerable    depth in mercury,
or   closed with a ground-stopper.          The bend of the funnel m
may be accurately closed by the           introduction of a few lines
 of mercury.
    The application of the stop-cock n, has enabled Mr. Davy
to perform some experiments on respiration with considerable
accuracy.

of a kind of sepia.        Naturalists    in  general   consider ii  as  a
kind of cornu ammonis.
    He     has the fame opinion respecting        the belemnite.     " It
is extremely probable,"        fays he,

    The numismal      is found in Europe, in Egypt,        in India near
the Ganges, and in Bengal.
    He found at Mount-Saleve           a petrified buccinum similar to,
those found at Ermenonville.

Scrapis near Pozzuolo        : they are in a part of the column,
raised at present      twenty-seven feet above the level of the
waters of the sea.       He supposes that this temple has been
thrown into the soa by an earthquake ; that the phollades
then penetrated      into the columns; and that a new earth
quake conveyed      them   back to the place where they now stand.

Whole jaw-bones,          more than four feet in length, have been
found in that mountain.               They   are supposed     to have be

 which appear to have belonged to the common tortoise, the
 tortue srancbe of Lacepede, or the tejludo my dat of Linnæus.
 This further confirms, that          the  remains of animals still ex
 isting are found among fossils.
       Denis Montfort              has published a memoir        on a par
 ticular fossil kind of the corhu ammonis,               found in the en*
  virons of Rouen and in other places.                It is not of a spiral
  form like the common cornua ammonis, but shaped like a
  buccinum.
       Villa its   has found fossil wood on the mountain           of Laus,
  in   the canton   of  Pisans, at the height    of 2537 feet, that is to
  to fay,     93a feet above     the most elevated line at which trees
  grow    at  present. The trees      of which  fossil remains are found,
  are the trembling poplar, birch, and common larch.

       Bertrand        has given a new explanation          of his geologic
   system.     He still supposes that the globe of the earth was
   briginally a frozen mass, and that along with motion it re
   ceived light, liquidity, heat, and life.
       Jens Esmarck,           a   learned mineralogist, has travelled
   through the Bannat, Transylvania, and Hungary, countries ex
   ceedingly rich in metallic veins. He has described these vein?
   with accuracy,      and explained the formation         of them  accord
    ing to the theory of Werner, who, as is well known, thinks
    that such veins were originally fissures, afterwards filled up
    with minerals. But some facts related by the author seem
    to show that this system cannot be maintained, for at Chem
    nitz there are veins of from 100 to 114 feet in thickness:
    at  Kremnitz,    the principal vein is 656 feet in thickness.        The
    author endeavours to stiow that these veins arise from                the
     union of more than twenty smaller veins divided by parti
     tions of the rock.

  because     he generalises    his observations.        The following are
  those which      he has transmitted      from Cumana respecting the
  famous Peak de Teyde, called commonly the Peak of Teneriff:
 ^— " The Peak of
                         Teyde, which rises to the height of 1904
  toises,   is an enormous basaltic mountain            that seems to rest
 on dense and secondary calcareous stone.                  The latter is of
 the fame kind as that found with a great deal of flint at Cape
 Non in Africa, at Cadiz, in the Channel, in Provence, and
 on which the basaltcs of Saint-Loup near Agde, and that of
  Portugal, rest.       It is thu3 seen with what uniformity the
 globe    is constructed.      The Azores,       the Canaries,       and   the
 Cape Verd ifles, appear          to be a   continuation of      the basaltic
 rocks of Lisbon."
     "  The waves thus carry with them, and cast on shore in
 Africa and Teneriff, granites, syenites, and granitic mica
 ceous schist, which I have seen at Sainl-Gothard.                    It is to
 be supposed that the high ridge of Mount Atlas, which ex
 tends from the East towards the coasts of Morocco, consists
 ef such rocks."
     " The basaltes of which the Peak is constructed, is not
 only basaltes containing foliaceous and crystallised olivin and
tolcanic chrysolite, but particularly towards the top there are
 strata of the porphyrosebiefer of Werner, or of another kind
 of porphyry with        an obsiadian base.       The   porpbyroscbieser is
 foliated, sonorous, semi-transparent at the edges, has a very
 hard green base, and contains crystals of vitreous feld-spar.

an example       of foresight and economy, does not, as has beest

 the latter to be employed       as  materials necessary for supporting
 subterraneous    galleries and      for giving occupation to labour
 ers; for their society, like that of the bees, consists of males
 and females, and a neutral species, or individuals without sex.
 It is the latter that are charged with the Internal labour, and
 the care   of nourishing the young. The labouring ants are
 distinguished from the rest by being destitute' of wings ; they
 enjoy also a longer life than the males dr the females, arid
they often remain alone with the larvae in the nest.              Ants
continue in a state of torpor during the winter; and it may
thence be presumed that the articles they store up do not
consist   of food   which     they wish to provide to afford them a
 supply during periods of scarcity.            Their granaries are not
filled with provisions, since they store up, along with grains
of corn, bits of straw and all other small articles which they
tan find.    Naturalists, therefore,      have been mistaken   respect
ing this pretended foresight, by ascribing to a laborious insect
a manœuvre of which man alone is capable.
    The ant   is not accounted      venomous; yet it is more so than
most other Insects.        There arises from its body an acid vapour
which is not perceptible but when they are collected in a
large number, as in an ant          hill, or when they are hea ed up
in a box or bottle, &c. For this reason antS leave traces be
hind them, by a sort of scorched appearance, on the grass
and    plants over which they pass and repass in going back-
Wards and     forwards from their nests.         Gardeners, therefore,
have great     reason   to wish     for the discovery of some certain
means that might free them from these troublesome guests,
which    some have supposed to be useful by having seen them
attack the small insects      which injure the leaves of fruit-trees,
and particularly those        of the peach. Ants, indeed, are at
tracted by the melleous liquor slied by some of these insects,
and which moistens their bodies, but they do not on that
account carry on war against them ; in concert with them
they destroy the plants and trees, on which they assemble             in
large bodies.
    The ant pinches        very strongly with     its mouth,  which is
armed with jaws ; it punctures also by means of a sting at
its extremity j which is warning in the males : it can do in-

jury,    therefore,                  Swammerdam fays that
                       three different ways.
the jaws or forceps of the ant have on each side seven points
or small teeth ; and Leuenhoek pretends that it emits from
its sting small drops of a certain liquor which occasions pain,
as is the cafe with that of the scorpion.    Probably it is no
 thing else than its acid liquor which is caustic.
    This infect: is very extraordinary, not only on account of
its form, but on account of its small size ; and being so com
monly seen, it has hot been examined with sufficient atten
tion. Those who with to see ants of a gigantic appearance,
may inspect the figure given of one by Gundelius Ab Ach,
who flattered himself that, in 1687, he had invented a mi
          that magnified twice as much as any ever before
    croscope
constructed.    The fame author has given the figure of a
winged  ant  of the dimensions of eleven inches.
- We may         consider ourselves happy, that among the smasl
number of        species      of this     insect    kilown in France, which
    Mr. Gcorsroy makes to be only sixj there are none of those
    voracious and destructive kinds so troublesome in the burning
    climates of Africa, in Egypt, and in South America. A swarm
of     ants which      have    lodged     in   a   hollow tree,   issue     from it on
its being in the least shaken, and, like a shower os fire, fall
on the unhappy person exposed to their fury.      One of our
most learned naturalists, going along the banks of the Niger,
found himself invested by a sort of re'd ants which lodge in
the icaco-tree.   The punctures they made were so venom
ous, fays he, that my face and hands were covered with blis-'
                                           the pain of which
    ters similar to those arising from burning,
    could be allayed
                   by nothing but a  heavy rain, which took
 place in the evening. The same traveller was pestered in the
isle of Goree by another kind of white ants {termites) \\ hich
 .gnaw and destroy every thing that comes in their way.
;   Botanists long ago observed, that when the flowers of suc
  cory were thrown into an ant's nest, their blue colour was
j changed into red, which           is,
                              no doubt, common to the greater
    part of blue flowers.       This phenomenon                 must   at   sipst    have
  excited some surprise,        was explained, no doubt, ac
                                and     it
  cording to the physical knowledge of the period   but   was          ;            it

to the acid liquor which the ants had shed upon It.      Thi3
acid spirit was carefully examined by several experiments, an
account of which was published in the Philosophical Trans
actions for the year 1670.    M. Tischer appears to have been
the first who ascertained the nature of this acid, and this dis
covery must have appeared the more astonishing, as it was
known that animals in general furnished alkali and an urinous'

spirit.
  After this, chemists hastened to analyse ants and the va*
pours exhaled from them.     Homberg extracted from them,
by distillation, abundance of acid, and showed it to the Aca
demy of Sciences in 1712.     Margraf soon obtained the fame
acid; but the learned Prussian chemist considered this acid
only in regard to its relation and combinations with other
chemical substances, and the solutions it is capable of effect
ing.         This acid      has a great        resemblance       to that   of   radical"
vinegar, though it does not resemble it in every thing: Neu-
man first perceived an odorous essential oil, of a peculiar smell,
which, however, occasions no burning sensation on the tongue.
Margraf obtained the same subtile oil, and another fat oil
similar to that of vegetables.  M. Thouvenel drew from ants
both these oils, and a particular extract ; a result of the most
complete analysis that ever had been made of these insects.
   The lateM.Roux, the edjtor of the Journal de Medecine, paic(
attention also to this object, and by his curious experiments
brought to light some facts very little known. For example,
if     ant-hill be opened, and a living frog be exposed in
        an                                                                            it,
the animal will die in less than four or sivp minutes, though
     has not been bit           by   the ants.       M. Roux, being employed
jn it
   collecting ants to sill bottle, perceived
                                     a       the evening that    in
his singers were somewhat hot, that they swelled and became
red    next day the epidermis separated from the skin as
        ;                                                  he!                   if
had          applied   a   vesicatory,    and       his fingers' became entirely
peeled.          It    appears also,     by   M.    Roux's experiments, that the
 acid vapour of ants      capable of suffocating them when they
                                is
 arc (hut up in      bottle. This may supply some hints for
                           a
 stifling their destructive  colonies                    by
                                          carefully closing up the
 apertures       of ant-hills    and heaping earth above them       . M Roux    .
 mentions also an observation                   similar to his own, which was
                                          X     2                           cornmu

communicated by Baron D'Holbach ; he made at the same
time some reflections on the nature of the poison of ants, re
specting which he would not venture to give a decisive opir
nion. This prudent modesty in an able chemist may serve
us as a lesion.
     Messrs. Ardwisson and Oerhne have also made                                     a   number
of curious experiments on this acid, which they                                 consider as a
peculiar kind.    It has been admitted into the new chemistry
under the name of the formicine : it is stronger than the vi
triolic acid *, serves for different combinations, and an ether
may be obtained from                   it.   M. Thouvenel, who                 prepared from
itthe formiate of potash,                    experienced            the same effects from
the volatile acid of ants as                  M. Roux;
                                            for, after having col
lected some of these insects, large vesicles full of serous liquor
were formed at the ends of his fingers. This learned chemist
made many experiments to ascertain the nature                                   of   the acid       of
ants, and they all convinced him that     differs from the mi      it
neral acids as well as from fermented vegetable acid, and that
ithas every chemical relation to the microcosmic acid      &c.                            f,
    M. Cadet junior, and other chemists, found thaf the vola
tile alkali destroys ants and neutralises their acid.   This,
therefore, may afford the means of being preserved from                                            it,
or of checking                its action op the skin.              Olive oil produces the
fame effect.
   Medicine might perhaps derive more advantage than       has                             it
hitherto done from the volatile spirit and oil of ants. A bath
of ants       has been prescribed            in   cases       of   the palsy.        The water
or spirit of magnanimity, and other pharmaceutic composi
tions, are prepared from ants and their products.   They
                                              I in
might certainly be employed                          veficatorjes.
  To the above observations                          shall add the following fact,
recorded  in the Ephemerides of the curious of Nature for the
year 1688      which will prove the efficacy of ants as

however, while collecting ants, his hands were excoriated by

turned.
XIV.     Experiments respecting the Influence which Oxygen
     has on the Germination of Seeds.    By Mr. Saussure
MelOST      philosophers who have examined the nature of
atmospheric air have found, that seeds exposed to water and
pure azotic gas do not germinate ; that, on the other hand,
earbonic acid gas is formed, which                          mixes with the azotic
gas, and increases the atmosphere of the plant. They ob
served also, that when oxygen gas was employed instead of
azot, carbonic acid gas was in the like manner produced,
but that the atmosphere was then lessened and the oxygen
gas absorbed.
  Dr. Rollo t> <n the course of his researches respecting the
germination of barley, remarked, that the formation of sugar
in the grains of barley during the process of germination was
the immediate consequence of the action of oxygen gas on
the grains, and that, in every cafe where this action was sup
pressed, no sugar was formed. From this observation, as well
as from the formation of carbonic acid gas in azotic and oxy
gen gas, he concludes, that oxygen gas is in part absorbed by
the barley, but that it in part forms with the carbon of the
feeds carbonic acid gas.  The sugar which is formed imme
diately after the germination                is,   according to him, produced
 by   the union     of   oxygen gas       with     the slimy vegetable ferment
able matter.
  If the quantity        of the carbonic  acid gas formed in this man
ner be    less   than that of    the oxygen gas which has disappeared,
\t& probable that         a   part   of   the latter   is   absorbed by the grain,

quantity of the carbonic acid gas produced be greater than the
quantity of oxygen gas which has disappeared, we can only
conclude, that the corn is capable of producing from its
own substance,              by the union       of its carbon with              the oxy
gen gas       of the      atmosphere,      a quantity      of carbonic         acid       gas.
If              however, of the oxygen gas which has dis
     the quantity,
appeared be perfectly equal to that which contributes to the
formation of the carbonic acid gas during the progress of the
germination, we may thence conclude that the oxygen gas
is not absorbed by the grain, but only employed in the form
ation of the carbonic acid gas.  As no one has yet examined
which of                                       having been
                  these three cases actually takes place            (it
generally admitted  that the oxvgen gas    absorbed     the  is                       by
grain during the progress of germination, without its being
however proved),    made, towards the end of the year 1798,

                        a                                        together weighed
62 grains.          The sponge was introduced on             a    small stool under
a    receiver      which     contained 13 cubic inches of atmospheric
                                              :
air purified         by   lime-water.  The aperture of the receiver was
closed       by   means     of water, and         the latter rose in      it   to   a   suffi
cient height to prevent the escape of the air during the change
of the atmosphere.
   In eight days these                peas had vegetated      so   much that roots
were thrown out, of from three to four lines                       in     length      ;    the
air in the receiver,               in consequence     of   the change occasioned
 by   the temperature              and pressure,    was lessened    one-thirteenth
part of its original volume.   now occupied 12*55 citbio

                                           of
Lavoisier,     that atmospheric air contains T\^, or t*^ less
Oxygen gas than is shown by the phosphoric eudiometer, the
13 , cubic inches of atmospheric air, which were lost in this
experiment, contained before the peas were introduced 3*64
cubic inches of oxygen gas and 9/86 of azotic gas.                 The
 12 "55 cubic inches which remained after germination con
tained i-255 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas, 1*255 of oxy
gen gas, arid 9/86 of azotic gas.
     If the decrease in the volume of the air during the ger
 mination      arises from  the carbonic acid gas being absorbed
 by the water, which (huts the receiver and promotes the ger
 mination of the feeds, this decrease of volume with the oxy
 gen gas which remains in the atmosphere of the peas, iliows
  the quantity of oxygen gas which has been formed in the
  course of the germination.        If this quantity of carbonic acid
  gas is perfectly equal to that which is formed during the ex
  periment by the union of the oxygen gas, which has disap
  peared, with the carbon of the feeds, it proves, almost incon-
  testably, that the oxygen of the atmosphere is not absorbed by
  the   seeds, but has been employed in the formation of car
  bonic acid gas, a part of which is absorbed by the water
  while the other remains in the atmosphere of the seeds.
      If we   add the decrease of  the volume    of the air during the
  course    of the germination, or 0-95 cubic inches to i'255
   cubic inches, the quantity of the carbonic acid gas which
   remains in the atmosphere of the seeds, we shall have 2'2C>5
   cubic inches for the sum of the carbonic acid gas.          But this
   is almost the fame quantity as that which is obtained by the
   union of the carbon of the feeds with the 2-385 cubic inches
   of oxygen gas which disappeared in the course of the experi
   ment.
      It is very probable, therefore, from this experiment, that
   the decrease in the volume of the atmosphere during the ger.-
   mination depends merely on the water absorbing a part of
   the carbonic acid gas, which is formed by the uniou of the
    oxygen gas with the carboo of the feeds, and that it cannot
.  be ascribed    to the absorption of the oxygen gas by the feeds.
.  To place the truth of this assertion in its full light, I exa
    mined whether the decrease of the atmosphere            of the seeds
                                                                  would

    i 56            On the Influence   <whicb Oxygen      has
   Would take place if I endeavoured to prevent the carbonic
   acid gas from being absorbed by the water.
       If water  be placed in an atmosphere        of pure carbonic acid
   gas, the water never absorbs more         of  such gas than what is
   equal to its volume, provided      the fluid sustains no other pres
   sure than that   of  the weight of the atmosphere.          The quan
   tity absorbed by    the water  is less, the  greater   the  quantity of
  the atmospheric air mixed with the carbonic acid gas. When
  the carbonic acid gas makes only 0*02 of the atmospheric
  air, the portion absorbed is not perceptible. This absorption
  therefore, may be always rendered imperceptible, cither by
  increasing the volume of atmospheric air which is in contact
  with the feeds, or by leaving in the receiver only as much
  water as is absolutely necessary for the purpose of germina-'
  tion.
                             Experiment     II.
      Eighteen peas were placed in 1 1 \ cubic Inches of atmo
 spheric air, purified by lime-water, under a bell closed with
 mercury.       The fluid rose an inch higher than within tha-
 vessel.     Into this receiver I transmitted     ^
                                                     cubic inch of water
 In which the peas were         to germinate     :  they floated   half in
 it on the fnercury. Ten        days after,    the peas had grown so
 much that their roots were from three to four lines in length.
 I examined the air under the bell, and found that its volume
was not sensibly lessened;        Lime-water showed 0.09 of car
bonic acid, and the phosphoric eudiometer, after deducting
the carbonic acid, 0-12 of oxygen gas, and therefore 0-09
less than in atmospheric air.         When nitrous       gas was mixed
in     equal  parts  with this air, there remained         a residuum   of
132 parts.       If we  admit, with Lavoisier, that atmospheric air
contains about 0*27 oxygen gas, or 0.06 less than is indicated
by the phosphoric eudiometer, which in the air of my labo
ratory gives only o*2i oxygen gas, it will be found that the
air under the bell, before the peas were introduced, contained
3- 105 cubic
                 inches oxygen gas arid 8-395 of azotic gas} and
that after the germination the fame volume of arr Contained
1-88 cubic inches of oxygen" gas, 8-395 of azotic gas, and
1-035 of carbonic acid gas ; consequently, 1-225 cubic inches
Of atmospheric oxygen gas were employed to form the bafi%
           8                                                            of

of 1*035 cubic inch of carbonic acid. This result approaches
as near the truth as can be expected in an experiment made
with masses of air so exceedingly small.
                                 Experiment     III.
     I
     introduced into a receiver closed with quicksilver, 40
cubic inches of atmospheric air purified by lime-water.   In'
this air I placed a conical glass with small flints, which                         I
moistened with two cubic inches of water, and deposited on
them four beans. At the end of fourteen days all the beans
had thrown out roots of from four to five lines in length :                        I
then took them out, and tried their atmosphere.      No sen
sible change          in the volume was               observed.       Lime-water
showed o'io          of carbonic acid gas:
                                    the phosphoric eudiome
ter, after this gas was deducted, contained o-i3 oxygen gas,
or 0*08 less than atmospheric air. This mixture with atmo
spheric air gave a residuum equal to 105 parts.  According
to this result, we find, if we add to the quantity of oxy
gen gas indicated by the phosphoric eudiometer cro6,                             that
during the experiment 3*96 cubic inches of oxygen gas dis
appeared, and were employed in the formation of four cubic
inches of carbonic acid gas. The beans appear, therefore,
in    the atmospheric air to have absorbed no oxygen gas.
                                 Experiment       IV.
     I   put 60 grains of barley, with        -j-   cubic inch   of water, into
a    receiver      closed   with quicksilver,       and    which contained 18
inches  of atmospheric air purified                     by   lime-water.         The
greater part of the grains of the barley                  remained      adhering to
the moistened fides of the receiver   the     :           rest   floated half under
water upon the quicksilver.     After the                 feeds had germinated,
their atmosphere was increased, the changes of temperature
and the pressure of quantity imperceptible to the eye being
                             a
taken into consideration.  Lime-water showed t'Vto carbonic
acid gas the phosphoric eudiometer, aster deducting the car
            :
bonic acid gas, O'li of oxygen gas, or crio less than atmo
spheric     air.      A
                hundred parts of nitrous gas, mixed in an
equal portion with this air, left residuum of 138 parts
                                          a             the-                 :
mixture with atmospheric air gave residuum of 105" parts.

621           Influence of Oxygen on the Germination of Seeds.
   From this experiment it appears, according to the calcula
tion more fully given above, that during the process of ger
mination 2' 16 cubic inches of oxygen gas disappeared and
were employed          for   .the basis   of
                                          2-07 cubic inches of carbonic
acid gas,         which     was   found in the atmosphere of the seeds.
This result approaches near               to that given by the composition
of this gas.
  But to obtain this result
                          the seeds must all germinate, and
they must be in immediate contact with the atmospheric air.
When they do not germinate, either because they are placed
too       close   to each    other, are of
                                        quality, or have too
                                               a bad
much water over them, the quantity of the carbonic acid
gas formed will be greater than that produced bv the union
of  the oxygen gas taken from the atmosphere with the car
bon of the seeds.   Besides, the experiment must be finished
before all the oxygen gas contained in the atmosphere of the
seeds                     into carbonic acid gas; for without
           has been converted
this precaution the plants would be injured and decomposed,
and a greater quantity of carbonic acid gas would be found
in their atmosphere than would otherwise be the case.
   The formation of sugar in the seeds by the action of fo
reign oxygen gas is a very singular phenomenon which I
will not venture to explain; I shall only remark, that from
the above experiments the                  following     conclusions may be
drawn :
      The oxygen of the atmosphere is
     1.                                                  ahsorbed during the
process of germination, not by the feeds,                as   hitherto seems to
have been admitted, but is employed merely                     in forming car
bonic acid gas with the carbon of the feeds.
  2. The germinating feeds when in contact with the air
do not form carbonic acid gas from their own substance, but
only furnish a component part of       viz. carbon.it,
                                                     They
yield, however, from their own substance, the oxygen and
carbon of the carbonic acid gas, formed when the feeds an}
in contact with water             and pure azotic gas.
                                                                       NEW

ances the author endeavours      to ascertain from its present
state what must have been the various former changes through
Vvhich       the matter          of this globe          has passed since the æra at
which       it    was made        subject       to those laws of existence under
which       we now behold it.                   The following are the leading
truths and opinions               which        occur in the successive parts of
the work.
     The    Preface mentions the discovery                   of   the    distinction be
tween primary and secondary                     mountains,        by   Lehman,      as one
of    the most         important     events         in the progress of geological
science; exposes the futility                  of   the theory  of Buffon, which
represented all the primary mountains to have originated out
of   a   state    of   igneous    fusion;       names with applause those phi

     The Introduction       states, that, in composing the     following
 system,    the author has been careful          " to attribute no effect
 to any cause     of which the known powers           are inadequate    to
its production,"        as well as    " to alledge no cause whose ex
 istence has not been proved to him by experience or credible
 testimony."
     In  tbe  first Essay he observes that the earth could not
 have assumed the form of a spheroid compressed at the poles,
 if  its superficial    parts  had not originally    been, to a certain
 depth, in     a soft or liquid state ; and that the lower strata       of
 primitive calcareous rocks being, in proportion to their depth,
 continually thinner than those which rest upon them, equally
 evince the whole to have been formerly in a soft state, and
 to have yielded to compression while they were dried and
 hardened. He therefore supposes the superficies of the globe
 to have been universally fluid, its interior composition solid
and cavernous, at the time when the present laws began to
operate upon it.         The superficial fluid he conceives to have
been heated at least to 33° Fahr. Dissolved or suspended in it
were portions of the eight generic earths, of all the known
metallic substances, of all the simple salts, and of all inflam
mable matters solid and liquid. Siliceous earth and iron were
of all the solid materials in the mixture the most copious.
Calcareous earth must            even   then have existed,    for it is a
component part in many primitive rocks. As the fluid mass
was moved ; as its heat passed into new combinations ; as
the elective attractions       of its various materials  began recipro
cally to operate ; the solidisiable materials were precipitated
in   the order of their affinities, somewhat disturbed by the me
chanical agency, which at the same time necessarily affected
them.      In their precipitation they         were universally crystal
lised.   Where     siliceous and argillaceous earths chiefly abound
ed, quartz, feld-fpar, and mica, were confusedly deposited             in
strata   of granite and       gneiss.    One deposition succeeded an
other till    vast  uniform blocks were formed.           Carbon, iron,
and others of the solidisiable materials of the chaotic flood,
were unavoidably involved with the subsiding stony particles.
Where      the materials were intermingled in different propor

SHiceous porphyries, jaspers,          &c. were produced.          la   the
confused    agitation of all parts of the flood, sulphur         and me
tallic substances encountering, formed pyrites ; while pit-coal
was also composed by the association of petrol with carbon.
After   the formation       of combustible compounds         so easily de
composable,       heat sufficient    for their combustion was soon
afforded     from the incessant       solidisication of matters which
had been hitherto fluid.         A decomposition of water,      by means
of heated iron, was one of         the first effects from the rising    in
tensity    of  the general     heat.   The combustible      matters were
generally inflamed,        and many volcanic        fires burst  out from
the bosom       of the abyss. Gas-azot, gas-oxygen, and after
wards    carbonic     acid gas, were, in great quantities, evolved
from the conflagration, and diffused into an atmosphere sur
rounding the earth and waters. The eruptions of the fires
naturally disordered the depositions of the rocky strata, and
pustied up many vertical or inclined elevations through the layers
 which     might otherwise have been, in general, nearly hori
 zontal.      Such was the origin of the loftiest primitive moun
 tains, the Alps, the Andes, and those elevated ranges which
 occupy so extensive a space in the north of Asia. Plains were
 formed by the deposition of stony particles from the chaotic
 flood in the intervals between the mountains, and with a dif
 fusion too loose to admit of their being united in crystals as
 they were deposited.         The volcanic eruptions, by which the
 first mountains      were   elevated, could not but scoop out exca
 vations to receive the subsiding waters of the sea. The ca
 verns of the primitive nucleus of the globe were even laid
 open by those fires ; and, into them, the superficial waters
  shrunk, till a considerable      extent   of dry  and solid surface was
 left bare under the atmosphere.           At a level of between 8,500
  and 9000 feet above that at which it now stands, the ocean
 became for a while stationary.            It  was   soon after furniflied
 with   fishes.     The disintegration of     the primary rocks, the de
  position of animal exuviæ, and the continued precipitation of
  the solid matters suspended in the waters of the sea, then
  composed      those strata  of rocks which, from their containing
  animal remains, are denominated secondary.               The earth was
  about the fame time clothed with vegetation, and made the
                                                                  residence

 residence      of   the    species    of animals.    The matter of       the se
condary rocks was, by the known laws of gravitation and re
sistance, rather fixed in strata upon the primary rocks than
precipitated to the bottom of the great , abyss. The retreat
 of    the sea from         the   surface   to the interior         of the

habitable earth were thus continually enlarged. — Such is the

this account with that of Moses, and fancies that they per

      The Deluge             of the second Essay. From the
                       is the subject
shells found on the heights of the primitive mountains; from
the remains of animals natives of hot climates discovered in
cold ones, which those animals cannot be supposed to have
ever voluntarily inhabited ; from the dispersion of marine
exuviæ on shores far remote                 from the    seas   where we now
meet     with    the       species   of living animals to which they must
have belonged ;            Mr. Kirwan infers, that      the general       deluge
commemorated in the Holy Scriptures must certainly have
taken place as Moses relates. That the axis of the earth was
originally parallel to the ecliptic, producing in every latitude
perpetual spring, is a position of which astronomy has suffi
ciently demonstrated the falsehood.      The nutation of the
poles     is,
          every nine years, retrogressive, and never exceeds
ten degrees     that the equator can never have been,
                ;    so                                                         by
this cause, where the poles arc now.                   The whole       strata   of
this earth are of such nature that they cannot have originally
been, as M. De Buffon supposes, in      state of igneous fusion,
                                                 a
the heat from which might have long kept up        genial warm a
temperature  even in the regions the nearest to                     the   poles.
The phenomena sufficiently evince that the seas                     and conti
nents of the earth cannot have mutually changed                      places,    as
has     been    supposed       bv Mr. Edward King         and      M. De Luc.
Mr. Kirwan, therefore,               supposes the southern ocean to have
•beenin the general deluge driven,              by   some unknown means,
with mighty force towards the poles.                 The character of the
exotic remains found in the northern regions  the immensity

so   many countries bear of having suffered some mighty shock
from the south; and the very figures of the great continents,
sharpened       towards the south, where they are washed by the
southern ocean, are so many grand facts concurring to give
probability to that supposition.              The waters from the central
abysses    of   the globe might burst forth to complete                the cata
strophe.       In their    progress northward,         and   in their   retroces
sion, the waters        of  the deluge must have greatly broken, ra
vaged and transposed the superficial              strata of the earth : many
of the mountains            were    broken down to powder, and other
inconsiderable fragments            :   the beds of the Euxine and Cas
pian    seas  might be then scooped out : basaltic rocks and beds
 of  coal might be formed          : a confusion in the arrangement of
 the exterior strata of secondary and primary rocks would be
 here    and there      produced      :  all terrestrial   animals,    save  such
 as were     preserved by supernatural           means,    must have necessa
 rily perished.        Every rational inference from present appear
 ances entirely coincides with the Mosaic history of the de
 luge. — This is the substance of the second of these Essays.
     In  the third Essay it is stated, that, beside effecting so many
 important and immediate changes on the exterior strata of
 the globe, the deluge,          likewise, became         the remote cause       of
 various great convulsions, which were at subsequent times to
 ensue upon its parts at different places of the surface : that
  the total     separation     of Asia from America, the coarctation
  of  the Baltic,     the opening        of the Thracian Bosphorus, and
  the disruption of the isthmus which once divided the At
 lantic Ocean from the Mediterranean Sea, the entire separa
  tion of Great Britain from the continent, and various other
  similar alterations are to be numbered among those great
  changes posterior to the deluge, for which the deluge had,
  however, prepared the superficial             strata  of  the globe   :  that all
  these changes must have been accomplished chiefly by extra
  ordinary     agitations of the waters            of  the ocean, and at the
  distance   of   at least three thousand        six hundred years from the
  present time.
      The fourth     Essay explains the phenomena               of lapidijication.

the nail of the finger, is called but indurated earth : if its'
cohesion firmly resist the action of the nail, it is to be deno
minated a Jlone.        Stones are hard which cannot be easily
filed,   or cut into pieces.       Those are firm which strongly
Tesist percussion.      Some stones appear to have been formed
by crystallisation arranging all their parts, internal         and ex
ternal, in   a  regular form.     It is effected from either aqueous
or igneous solution. All solidifiable matters are susceptible
of it. Even those siliceous matters, which are now almost
insoluble in water, might be easily soluble in this menstruum
in their original    state of extreme division, and were probably
crystallised   by deposition from water. Nay, in spite of what
ever   Black    and others may have affirmed to the contrary,
numerous facts may be produced to show that, even still,
water may be made to take up a certain proportion of this
earth.     Some stones appear to have been formed by the mere
concretion of particles which in their primary Composition
are probably of different figures, and which therefore display
not in their      cohesion   the uniform      order of crystallisation.
Other stones are formed by the cementation of exceedingly
small nodules, or even of larger ones, by the deposition of
still  particles amongst them, and the cohesion of whole
masses, partly by mechanical force, and in part by the reci
procal chemical attractions of the different parts.           Many of
the smaller nodules, which are found imbedded in rocks not
of the    fame nature with themselves,         have  been   formed by
an infiltration,    in which water or some other fluid carried
their particles through the superficial strata, but deposited
them after penetrating the inierior layers only to a certain
depth. Those stones which we call petrefactions have been
formed by the gradual substitution of stony particles into the
places which were occupied by animal or vegetable matters
that decay while the lapideous deposition takes place.           These
are all the different modes of lapidisieation.           They   are ex
emplified in all the different fragments, columns, and strata
of rock which the earth presents to the observation of men.
     In the fifth Essay, the disintegration, reducing them into
 sands and larger fragments is explained, as having been often
produced by the absorption         of water, and by    it9 congelation

Or rarefaction while it was diffused          within therh. The known
external    causes   of  the entire decomposition         of stony matters
are represented to be only water, carbon, and                carbonic acid
gas, which enter into new combinations with the saline mat
ters, the sulphur, the ferruginous oxyds, the manganese, the
lime, and other constituent parts of the stones with which
they come into contact.
    Mountains       are the subjects     of   the sixth   of  these Essays.
The author describes the primitive mountains as containing
within them no animal nor vegetable remains ; as composing
all the loftiest extremities of the earth ; as never covering hof
leaning upon those which are called secondary ; as existing
sometimes in strata, but oftener in huge rocks ; as variously
composed,       of granite   and granitic compounds,          gneiss,  schis
tose    mica,    siliceous   schistus,    basanite,    jasper, pitchstone,
hornblende,        hornblende slate,       indurated lithomarga, argil-
lite,    trap, serpentine      and    potstone,     porphyry, hornslate,
 schistose    porphyry,     sandstorm,      rubble- stone,   farcilite, gra
nular limestone, marlite,            gypsum,      fluor, topaz-rock.        Of
 each    of  these sorts   of stone he gives, in part,       the mineralo-
 gical geography.          The secondary mountains            are next de
 scribed by him, in the same            essay,   as  being cither marige-
 nous or alluvial     ; as  containing in their structure various re
 mains of animals and vegetables, terrestrial and aquatic ; as
 always incumbent on primary rocks, or investing them ; as
 stratified   or columnar,       unigenous dr polygehous; as vari
 ously composed of limestone, swinestone, oviform limestone,
 porous limestone, marlites, and calcareous sandstones, chalk,
 gypsum, argillite, indurated clay, shale, bituminous shale,
 indurated lithomarga, slate, argillaceous sandstone, porphyry,
 trap, and basalt ; hornblende, argillaceous and calcareous
 breccias,     hornstone,    jasper^   siliceous    breccias and siliceous
 sandstone.       By an ample induction of facts it is proved, that
 all these different forts of stone have been found in circum
 stances    in which Jthey could not be but of secondary forma
 tion.     This is the substance of that which seems to form,
 properly, the sixth Essay,        though the author has not           so  dis
 tinguished it.
     In   the seventh Essay he describes          volcanic mountains as

 being generally    of a conical form, of no    exceedingly   ancient
 origin, burning with no extraordinary intensity of internal
 heat, and not half so numerous as some wildly theoretic
 mineralogists have supposed them to be.
    In that which we should incline to consider        as the  eighth
 Essay,   Mr. Kirwan     endeavours    to explain the internal    ar
 rangement of mountains.         He here relates that their mate
 rials are disposed either in irregular heaps or in beds or strata,
 horizontal, varying from that position by an angle, of from
 5° to 40', or sometimes even almost vertical.            Sometimes
 the strata run in the direction of the declivity of the moun
 tains they compose, and sometimes their course is directly
 opposite to this.    Mountains of primitive limestone are often
 in irregular  piles,  but often, too, horizontally stratified.    Of
 secondary calcareous strata, the structure is commonly hori
zontal.    The strata of secondary mountains, for the most
 part, ascend towards the primary. — These         arc some    of the
leading truths unfolded in this Essay.
    Coal-mines     are the subjects  of  the ninth Essay.    Pit-coal
is  a compound of bitumen with carbon : its specific gravity
is from 1,23 to 1,500. The foils within which beds of coal
usually occur, arc argillaceous, arenilitic, trappose, or calca
reous.    These arc disposed in strata over the coal, or in alter
nation with its strata.     The thickness of the strata, or seams
of coal,  varies from   half  an inch even to 80 feet.     Shale, bi
tuminous (hale, or sandstone, are the stones which generally
form both the roof and floor to seams of pit-coal.            Some
times these seams are in their disposition horizontal.          They
rise at times to angles of from 25° to 45° with the horizon*
It  cannot be true that, as has been supposed by Genfanne,
pit-coal is nothing but argillaceous matter impregnated with
petrol or asphalt ; nor that this coal is entirely ©f vegetable
origin ; nor that it is formed from the fat and unctuosity of
the animals of the ocean. The strata of this mineral seem
rather to have been formed in consequence of the disintegra
tion of many of the primitive mountains by the homoge
neous union of the petrol and carbon which were by that
disintegration liberated     out of the composition into which
they had originally entered.        Goal is therefore to be sought,
                                                                with

     Common Salt and its Mines are the subjects of the tenth
 Essay.      The     sea   is here     represented      as owing its faltness to
  simple    saline    substances       held   in solution in ii ever since tho
 creation.       The mines of rock-salt which have been in differ
 ent places discovered, are said to have all originated from the
 detention and evaporation of sea-water.                       Salt-springs and
 lakes are related to contain and pour forth, from time to
 time, quantities of saline matter, which, when subjected to
 calculation,      cannot         but,   by    their magnitude,          excite   the
 greatest     astonishment.            These     general    facts    are    unfolded
 amid an exceedingly curious and interesting display of par-,
 ticulars.
    The     eleventh      Essay is on the subject            of Metallic Mines.
 It  relates, that all the metals            must    have existed perfect         and
uncontaminated            in the chaotic flood.            Gold is found natu
 rally pure oftener than any of the other metals. Silver is
much more frequently mineralised by sulphur, and alloyed
with copper, antimony, lead, mercury, tin, or bismuth.
Nature presents still less of pure copper than of pure silver :
the ores of copper are scarcely ever free from sulphur.                            Of
pure     native    iron     there    are  sew   or  no  specimens, except        cer
tain   masses    found      in Siberia      and Peru,      whioh     seem    to have
been originally        agglutinated by petrol,            and   left   bare   by the
dissolution of the masses of other matters                      which once fur-
rounded them.            Native       bismuth accompanies the gray and
the bright white ores of cobalt. Native arsenic is found onlv
in the veins of primeval mountains: native rnqrcury occurs
in clay in mountains of                 secondary      formation     s  sulphurated
ores have been formed at                  a  time when sulphur as well as
metals     were     in   a    state of extreme subdivision in which they
were     much more            soluble   jn fluids than      they are at present.
The    crystallisation        of metallic      ores   was the consequence,         in
some instances,,       of    the diminution        of  the watery menstruum,
                                          Z  %                                     in

in others, of    slow precipitation.        The    veins   of  metals  seem
to have been, for the most part, formed by deposition from
water among the rifts and amid the strata of the softer rocks.
It is in oxyds, in mineralisation by sulphur, in mixture with
different earths, and in amalgamation with one another, that
all the metals are the most commonly found. — Such are the
most general      facts staled in this Essay.
    The twelfth Essay is wholly controversial. The late Dr.
Hutton, of Edinburgh, had taught, that, from eternity, this
globe had continued to pass through a series of revolutions,
in which the land was still destroyed by external influences,
and, in its ruins,        propelled into the ocean; while, on the
oiher    hand,     internal sires were constantly elevating new
mountains under the ocean, and conglomerating the mate
rials driven into it ; till, at last, the ocean changed its bed,
that which       had been dry land became sea,            that which      had
 been sea became dry land, and            the destruction       of the   new
 continents,     and the    working of      the volcanic sires under the
new     seas  were    again    renewed.      Mr. Kirwan       soon attacked
this theory    as atheistical     and unphilosophical.          Dr. Hutton
warmly defended         his  own    system.     In  this concluding essay,
 os throughout the preceding parts of the present work, Mr.
 Kirwan, in     reply to   Dr. Hutton's      defence,   demonstrates,    that
igneous fusion cannot have produced those phenomena which
 the Doctor ascribes to it ; affirms that volcanic fires are com
paratively few and weak in their action             ;  and maintains, that
 the   composition of       the  superficial   strata  of our present con
tinents is such as could not possibly be formed at the bottom
of   the sea.
    The   notes are few, and only mention some facts               of which
 the   author was,      perhaps,     not aware     till it was too late to
insert them in the text        of  the Essays.
    This   analysis    has   enumerated       the   leading general     facts
and    positions    of  the   present   work.      But   these are founded
upon     a wonderfully       extensive induction of highly curious
particular facts, for which the reader will do well to examine
the book itself.

Phytologia ; or an EJfay            on the   Principles    of Vegetation, &c.
    By   Erasmus Darwin, M. D.                       410.     Johnson, Saint
    Paul's Church-Yard.
    The Botanic Garden            and Zoonomia,           by Dr. Darwin, are
two noble monuments of fancy, industry, and science.        In
one we have almost the first instance of the happy application
of poetry to illustrate and embellish the physical branches of
philosophy.   The other     to fay the least of
                                    is,              vast col   it,   a
lection of the most curiously interesting facts, physiological
and pathognomical, in the history of human life, as well a»
of many of         the most ingeniously conceived theories                  which
have been proposed            to combine those facts into systems, the
foundations of practical rules.
   In his Phytologia, the fame author, with                   a   flow     of fancy
and sentiment nearly similar to that in his former works, in
the fame ornate, yet clear, easy, and natural style, in the
 same   characteristic method of assembling facts, deducing
 inferences, and suggesting analogies, applies himself to ex
 plain the physiology of vegetables, to trace the chemical re
 lations between vegetating bodies and the surrounding sub
 stances from which they are nourished, and then to deduce
a   system   of   for the improvement of the art of the gar
                   rules
 dener and the practice of the husbandman.
    The  readers of the Botanic Garden may perhaps have sup
 posed, that     the tale of the Loves of the Plants the author
                  in
 intended only to dignify and animate his account of the
 theory of Linnæus             by
                             happy and beautiful poetic fiction.

 But they have mistaken his purpose, and his botanical creed,
 who have         thus  conceivefhpf them. He was never in his
 life more    in   earnest, than in ascribing to vegetables the sensa
 tions, the affections, the passions, and even the designs of
 which we, ordinary mortals, believe animals alone to be
 capable.         In fait,    U   is   one of his favourite opinions, that
                                                                    plants

 plants are truly animals.  This opinion he strenuously la
 bours, throughout the physiological part of this volume, to
 illustrate and to prove.  The feeds of plants he easily shows
 to resemble the ova of animals.      He discovers in the struc
 ture of vegetables umbilical vessels perfectly similar to those
 by which embryon and nascent animals derive nourishment
 from the parent body, or from that store with which the wis
 dom of Nature involves them in the egg.                             He    traces in the
 vegetable       structure,   systems of absorbents,            glands, and blood
 vessels.       He     regards the leaves as lungs.              He discovers the
 organs and           the     exercise,in these beings, of the most ex
 quisite sensibility.           His facts are partly assembled from the
 works of almost            all former writers on the physiology                    of   ve
 getables, and, in part, the results of experiments ingeniously
 contrived and skilfully performed by himself. He suggests
many pleasing and specious analogies, and here and there
exhibits some clear and accurate deductions of new philoso
phical truths.  If we must, with whatever reluctance, own
that he has not presented to our minds sufficient evidence of
that full and perfect similarity which he supposes between
the structure and functions                  of    vegetables   and    those    of ani
mals ; it       is,   however,     at the fame time certain,               that he has
opened several sine             veins     of physiological      research,    and that
some    of his        novel     positions,     though not       by   himself satisfac
torily proved,          are such        that they may postibly            receive   com.
plete proof hereafter.
   In   the second part os his work he examines                        the chemical
relations between the organised matter of vegetables, and the
nutriment from which                         is,   by
                                  the vegetative functions,
                                        it
elaborated.   He follows, with respect, the authorities of
Priestley, Ingenhouz, Kirwan, and other eminent writers
upon the application of chemistry to the subjects of garden
ing and agriculture.    He trusts, however, as we should
 judge, much too implicitly to the facts of Young, Marshals,
 and other authors, whose publications on agricultural sub
jects, however popular, and however, in some respects, use
ful, contain few or no facts of such precision and authenti
city that philosopher can prudently take them for data with
            a

tne nts.  Dr. Darwin is   yet more successful     in explaining the
chemical influences   of foils, airs, water, temperature, and
light, on the growth of plants, than in the establishment of
his new theory of their physiology.       But in this chemical
part  of his work, he is content to repeat the principles and
opinions of others without presuming to propose any import
ant new theory of his own.
    The rules for the practice of the gardener and husband
man, which     he deduces    as the  results   from both his che
mical and his physiological researches, are partly dispersed
through the previous divisions of the work, and partly assem
bled together towards the close. They bespeak ingenuity and
good sense, but do not sufficiently wear the air of a practical
acquaintance with farming, combined with accurate science.
    Throughout the work are scattered some curious disquisi
tions on subjects allied, indeed, to the primary design, bat
not entering directly and unavoidably into it. The whole
will be read with great pleasure by the admirers of Darwin's
former writings.

Nor can we deny that the arrangement is convenient ; that
all the known principles and facts of chemical science are in
this book clearly stated ; that the author has suggested many
new things which the discoveries of the abfejl foreign chemifls
are daily confirming ; nor, that this book will be found, per

ence with which we are acquainted.
   The following are some of the leading new principles con
tained in it :
   That lime is oxygen in a concrete form, and that the fixed
alkalies are peculiar modifications of the fame substance :
   That, contrary to the assumptions of Count Rumford,
caloric is a condensible         or elastic substance ; and that, when
fire is elicited by friction, there is an expansion             of   condensed
caloric into   a state    of extraordinary tenuity      :
   That, when it         has been said that water is a nod-conductor
of caloric, there has been an error, arising from the mistake
of a mechanical for a chemical effect, and from the use of
          expreflive terms :

diluting the matter with water before inoculation be attended
with    essential advantage ; or whether too small a number ot
pustules be not by these means produced, and the body of the
patient rendered liable to new infection ? If it be true that
 rubbing olive-oil into the body be a certain preservative
against the plague, whether the same means might not be
 employed to prevent infection from the small-pox ? And
 what other kind of oil, when olive-oil is not to be had,
might be substituted,       with most advantage, in its stead ?

    In the sitting of January jdj Count Von Beust read art
extract from a treatise* written by his son Frederick Augustus
Leopold,     Count Yon Beust, of       the Academy      of Mines      at
Freyberg,     on the amalgamation       of silver ore as practised at
the Hallbruck and Ultermuld works near that place.               From
 this paper and the annexed tables, it appears that 79785 \ cwt.
of   ore,  which, according      to the common mode        of  amalga
mation,     would have given only 31139 pounds /£            Ounces   of
iilver, produced, by the method employed at Freyberg,
38330 pounds 2 f ounces; consequently, there was a saving
of 1190 pounds 7.J. ounces.
    In this treatise the author observes, that the theory of amaK
gamation is much indebted to the important experiments of
the Spaniard Don Ethovar, who proved, contrary to the opi
nion of several eminent chemists, that the muriatic acid, in
 a concentrated state, dissolves      gold as well   as   silver when
 these metals are reduced     to small particles.

                  FRENCH BOARD OF LONGITUDE.
      The following         paper    has lately been published, signed by
  Delambre the president, and Lalande the secretary,                       of  the
. French Board of Longitude :
      The    tables    of  the moon are        of  equal importance to astro
  nomy and        to navigation       :   the most celebrated      geometricians
  have     exerted     themselves       to illustrate    the theory on which
  these     tables   are     founded.        The     most   assiduous   labour ot
  astronomy is, to observe with care all the movements of this
  planet, without which there would be no real geography,
  and which         furnish the navigator with the most infallible
  means of ascertaining the position of his vessel, of directing
  its course, and of arriving in safety at any determined point
  of   the globe.         In proportion        as   the Newtonian      theory was
  thoroughly examined and understood,                       and as astronomical
  instruments and modes of observation                      were   improved, the
  lunar tables        were      improved also.         Mayer, uniting his own
  observations        to those     of cotemporary geometricians,           and  se
  lecting the most accurate observations,                  was enabled to com
   pose   tables,    which       having    been   since   compared with nearly
   twelve hundred unpublished observations, have been found
   wonderfully accurate. Maron, under the direction of Dr.
   Mafkelyn,       made       a  new improvement in them by adding
   several equations which              had been omitted but pointed out
   by Mayer, and by modifying the co-esticients of all the rest.
       Butj notwithstanding this care, these tables, so valuable
    towards the middle of the century, began                      to lose progref-
                           '                                                 lively

 sively  their correctness.       Theory, to which recourse wa*
 again had, showed      the cause os the error, and the method
by which it might be rectified.             The    papers transmitted as
answers to the questions       proposed by the National Institute
two years ago, and proclaimed in the public sitting of the
 15th of Germinal last, (April 5th,) have thrown great light
On the equations lately invented for the motion              of  the. apo-
geum and node.        But astronomers at that time had not been
invited to turn their attention to all the elements of which
the lunar tables are composed         :  this labour would have been
too much disproportioned to the time proposed for the com
petition.     One success often creates a desire, and -sometimes
furnishes the means of obtaining another.                What    has been
so   happily executed   already, proves        the  possibility of doing
still more, and of procuring to astronomy lunar tables more
correct and more lasting;.          Nothing remains after establisti-
ing the epochs, the secular motion, and their inequalities,
but again to discuss, by comparison with a great number of
accurate observations,       the precise quantity of the different
equations which       enter into the calculation          of the moon's
place*    This   is the question        which    the  French    Board   of
Longitude now proposes to the astronomers of every country.
The conditions to be fulfilled are :
    1st, To  discuss and     establish,   by comparison with a great
number of good observations, the value of the co-efficients
of the inequalities of the moon, and to give for the longi
tude, latitude, and parallax of that planet, formulae still
more correct and complete than those which have served as
the foundation of the tables now in use.
    ad, To construct from these formulae             tables  of sufficient
extent and accuracy for calculation.
    The- prize will be   six thousand     francs (250/.) The Board
of Longitude does not six any period for the competition,
and wilLadjudge the prize to the first person who shall have
fulfilled the above conditions.
    The competitors will address their papers to the Bureau
des Longitudes,    Palais National des Sciences et Arts a Paris.

     The following        is an account                  of   the    labours of the Class
of the Mathematical                  and Physical Sciences during the third
quarter of the year 8, as read by J. B. S. Delambre, secretary:
  Among the memoirs of which we have to give an account,
there are some, and these form the greater number, that can
not be appreciated   but by those who have particularly ap
plied to the   objects on which they treat.     As they would
require all the attention of the most experienced mathema
ticians, they are not very susceptible of abridgement. Such,
in general,         are all     the       memoirs on pure analysis                       and   the
higher parts        of geometry.             We          must       be excused,      therefore,
if we do not take               so    much notice of these works as their
importance would require. We shall content ourselves with
announcing only, by their titles, a memoir of C. Niewport
on the immediate integrability of differential equations to any
number of variable ones ; and two memoirs of Biot contain
ing analytical researches, one on partial differential equa
tions, and the other on vibrating surfaces.
   We shall pay a little more attention to a memoir on me
chanics, by         C. Coulomb,             which contains, besides the ana
lytical part, a series of experiments, of which we can at least
give the results.   The subject    the resistance of fluids when
                                                   is,

be very little.              It   becomes    very difficult to estimate it by the
usual means,               and still more difficult to discover what belongs
to the different terms                 of   the formula.           To accomplish        these
points it would be necessary to have a kind of measure which
might determine, with sufficient accuracy, the smallest forces,
and afford the means of varying the velocity at pleasure, iu
order to render the different terms of the formula prevalent
in turns.
     All    these advantages            C. Coulomb        has found united            in the
machine with which he measures                          the    torsion       of   a wire sus
pended        vertical position. He has already derived great
             in       a
advantages from this instrument in other branches of phy
sics, and he has given in former memoirs theorems respect
ing    the force           of torsion, or the means of estimating it iu
weight.        With this            aid he has demonstrated                  the real law   c»f
resistance where the motion is slow ; a law which had escaped
Newton, Bernoulli,                  and Gravesend.            It   results    from his ex
periments         :
     ist, That where the motion                    is very slow, the resistance is
proportional merely to the velocity, and the term depending
on the square becomes insensible.
     2d,    That          the height   of   the fluid above the body immersed
in   it,   does not sensibly increase the resistance.
   3d, That the resistance arises only from the coherence of
the parts of the fluid with each other, and not frorn, thp/.r
adhesion      to the body immersed                 in   them.
     4th, That the resistance                in limpid qjl          is   seventeen     times
and   a  half greater than in water.
     We sliall omit               several other results            which will       be read
with       pleasure         in  itself, and only add, that the
                                  the memoir
agreement between the different trials          great as must      is   so

of the instrument with which C, Cqulqnih. has enriched
natural philosophy.

that the mind, occupied with its developements and demon
strations, can scarcely comprehend the whole. This inspired
C. Prony with the idea of composing a methodical table of
all the results disengaged from intermediary calculations.
This      is what he calls mechanical philosophy.                     He   composed
this work from the lessons and materials he collected for the
Polytechnic         School; and his object            is to furnish         students
with      the    means   of placinjr together         and arranging;        the    dif-
serent     parts    of instruction thev have          received.        The author
quotes     the sources from which               he derived      his information,
but his work contains                a great  many things which belong to
himself, either           as to    the   matter, or manner in which it is
presented;         such, for example,
                                as everything that concerns
equilibrium;     method of obtaining the fundamental equa
                      a
tions of statics without employing in any manner the theory
of momenta; a general demonstration which shows that the
theorems respecting momenta are only a peculiar enunciation
of the principle of virtual velocity ; new formulae for the equi
librium  and pressure of elastic fluids, taking into considera
tion the variation of dilatibility, and formulæ which may
give to the barometer more generality and more certainty in
practice than has hitherto been the cafe in determining the
height of mountains. The author also makes a very import
ant application of his principles to the calculation of the
forcewith which earth presses against walls. The formulæ
of Pronv      are entirely new, and exceedingly simple.
     In   consequence of two papers on the motion of the moon,
read in the last public sitting            of   the Institute, and which were
deemed worthy             of   a   prize, Laplace has made        a new and very
happy application of the theories published                     in his Mecanique
 Celejie. M. Burg, one of the two authors who gained the prize,
had remarked a periodical equality in the moon'-- motion in
latitude, and had found that the duration of this period was
eighteen        years.      He, however,        assgned    no cause for      it,   nor
gave any law.     On the contrary, he requested both these
from the author, who has explained                    in
                                          complete a- man  so

has                        Laplace, in consequence of M,
           not been deceived.
Burg"s desire, has examined the question, and found that
there exists in the lunar orbit a motion of nutation analo
gous        to that      of
                 the tenestrial equator. The extent of this
nutation depends on the oblate form of the earth, and may
throw new light on that important element, since the in
equality thenre resulting varies from one to two, according
as the flatness is supposed to he r^- or T! t.
   Another equation, depending on the same theory, affects
the moon's longitude, and is of equal importance in enabling
us to ascertain the quantity of the earth's flatness. As long
its the real cause was unknown,    great uncertainty prevailed
in        regard   to    the use which ought to be made                       of this    equa
tion, and astronomers                  omitted it in their calculations.                    The
existence          of it       was proved by observations,               but it was indi
cated by no theory.     Laplace himself, having calculated by
the principle of universal gravity, carried it only to 2'', that is
to fay, to a third of its real value.     But since he has taken
into account the nutation of the lunar orbit, he has found that
it    indicate.?        the flatness to be nearly what it is known to be
from other phenomena.
   lo ascertain it (till better, he made C. Bouvard select from
his paper which                  gained the prize three months ago, those
observations            best     fitted for deciding the question proposed
by        M. Burg.             This    research     was       attended    with complete
success,  and 440 decline observations have          5 as the

  motion,     the small ellipticity         of  the terrestrial    mcidian.      i3i.it
  We must       observe that this elliptirity, which is below ,'c,
  is too little to be perceptible to our senses even if we had an
  opportunity of seeing the whole shadow of the earth.                           We
  know, however, that we see onlv a very inconsiderable part
  of it disfigured by the penumbra and inequalities of the lunar
  disk ; so that it would be impossible for the most accurate eye
  to discover,     in so small     an arc,       the le. st  difference     between
  the circular curve and tbat os an ellipse               so  little flattened.
      The obliquity of        the     ecliptic, which causes the different
  seasons and       the difference       in the length of the days, is one
  of   the   most intereiiing         elements in theoretic and practical
  astronomy. Every year the astronomers examine it with
  care, bv determining the solstitial altitude of the iun.                      Me-
  chain and Delambre,             the one      at the   national and the other
 at his private observatory,            have employed         in   these nice ob
  servations     the    fame    instruments which            they used in mea
 suring the magnitude of the earth.                      Lalamle the nephew,
 and Burckhardt,           have made similar and simultaneous observ
 ations at the College de France with instruments of the like
 kind, but     a  little larger.       These observations, whatever may
 be the cause, do not seem to be susceptible of the same pre
 cision as those which have given the measure of the meridian
 by means of the stars, but by taking the general result of
 more than 600 observations, made at Paris both this year
 and at the summer           solstice of the year 7, there will scarcely
 be   a  second   of uncertainty in regard to the real quantity of
 this essential element which enters into all our calculations.
    Since we have had occasion to mention the measurement
of   the meridian,        we   shall    here add, that the astronomer-            by
whom it was performed are now employed                          in printing thtir
observations, that they may submit, to the examination of
the learned in all countries, the proofs of a labour which has
already received the sanction of the deputies of different na
tions affembled         at  Paris   last year.
    We      have    received    a letter     from Cisear and Pedrayes, the
Spanish      members of the commission of weights and mea

ceived    the  standards of the metre and kilogramme sent to
him    by the Institute; that he has given orders for their
being preserved with such care as may ensure their authen
ticity ; and that he has charged Lenoir and Fortin to make,
with the fame accuracy, four other standards of the metre
and kilogramme;       and that  this order has been successfully
executed.      On this occasion the king of Spain took a plea
sure in making himself acquainted with        the new metric sys
tem, and he declared that he should be glad to see it adopted
throughout all Europe.       To render it more palatable to the
Spanish nation, and to facilitate the comprehension of it to
every one, an elementary memoir has been drawn up on the
subject, of which we have received some copies.       It contains
a complete explanation of the new measures, with a Spinish
nomencl iture, better adapted to the genius of that language,
which M. Cil'car proposes to substitute for the Græco-Latin
nomenclature adopted bv the French republic.
    The following account of the labours of the Class of the
Moral and Political Sciences during the last quarter, was
read by     C. Levesque.
    C. Anquetil continues      to analyse the manuscript and
printed    memoirs   presented to the Academy os Belles Le.ttres
by candidates for the prizes proposed by that Society.         He
has read the analysis of a memoir on the state of the sciences
in France from the death of king Robert to that of Philip the
 Fair.
     G. Gaudin has transmitted to the Class researches on the
 legislation of Solon ad the government of Athens.
     C. Mintelle, in a memoir on the best method of writing
 geographical names, has stiown the advantage of adopting
 the names of places such as they are uled in the different
 countries to which they belong, and, when imperious neces
 sity requires   that they stiould be disfigured in the French
 language, of writing them twice, first as they are pronounced
 in French, and then as they are pronounced by the natives
 of the country.
     C. Buache has read a memoir on New Holland, which,
 be thinks,    was known     more than  a  century before the pe
 riod of the discovery of it by the Dutch.        He supports his

chart of the Indian ocean preserved in the British Museum.
However defective this chart may appear, he is of opinion
that it may furnish information of great utility in regard to
the discoveries that remain to be made in that part of the
globe.
     C. Veron Forbonnais has given an analysis of the principles
of the circulation of provisions, and of the influence which
specie has on that circulation.
     C. Bouchaud, in historical     researches respecting   the edicts
of    the Roman     provincial magistrates,   has neglected   nothing
that could be suggested to him by a subject which belongs to
the science of history as well as to that of legiflation.         Each
province had its own government and laws, ¦and the Roman
republic, after      having   acquired an immense extent by its
conquests,     was never able to form the wife design of attain
 ing to unity.
    CONSTITUENT PRINCIPLES OF FIXED ALKALIES.
     Guyton-Morveau,on the 26th of April, read, in the French
 National Institute, a memoir on the constituent parts of fixed
 alkalies.    He made his experiments with Desormes, pupil of
 the Polytechnic School.         Their conclusion was, ist, That
 potash   is composed    of  lime and hydrogen : 2d, That soda is
  composed of magnesia and hydrogen.             From other experi
  ments they conclude, 3d, That lime is composed of carbon,
  azot, and hydrogen : 4th, That magnesia is composed of
  lime and azot ; and, consequently, of carbon, hydrogen, and
  azot.
          NEW METHOD           OF DESTROYING         INSECTS.

  following    recipe  for destroying earth-fleas, bugs, ants, &c.
  discovered by C. Catin : — Take black soap, of the best kind,
  one pound three quarters, the fame quantity of flowers of
   sulphur, muskrooms two pounds, and sixty measures of river

                     a
in   a    kettle,        and tie up the sulphur in                   a bit of rag or piece of
fine linen,            and suspend from                it   a   sufficient weight in order
that   may fink in the water.
        it                       During the time the water                                          is
kept boiling, which must be at least twenty minutes, stir                                           it
continually with     stick, and press the bag containing the
                                a
sulphur, that the latter may be forced out into the water aud
communicate to                  it   the necessary strength and colour.
     When            the liquor           is   taken    from the fire, pour   directly  it
into the cask,              and stir           it   round for considerable time the
                                                                 a                           :

smell.            Experience has shown that the more fetid the mix
         is is,
ture              its activity the greater.
                                     is     Each time that the mix
ture          stirred,      the cask must                 be stopped immediately after.
When you                 wish    to use         the liquid, nothing             is   necessary but
to sprinkle          a   little of
                         on the plants which you are desirous
                                      it

when you apply the liquid to trees,                             a   syringe with larger holes
must be employed.
  Caterpillars, beetles, earth-fleas, bugs, and the tree-lice
which infest orange-trees, will be destroyed by the first ap
plication of the liquid. Insects which reside below the earth,
such as wasps, hornets, ants, &c. require that the liquid
should be squirted out gently, and without intermission, that
it   may better penetrateto their nests. Ants-nests, according
to their size, require from   two to three measures of liquid,
and in many cafes      must be applied for twenty-four hours.

the mixture and boiled along with the sulphur. This sub
stance,  particularly when you wish to destroy ants, will be
of great service. When the whole of the liquid in the cask
has been used, the                   residuum          must be buried           in   the earth to
prevent domestic                animals from eating                  it.

   The composition, or cement, is composed of the following
materials; viz. tar, pulverised coal (charcoal is esteemed the
best), and fine, well flacked lime; the coal and lime to be
well mixed together, proportioned at about four-fifths coal
and one-fifth lime ; the tar to be heated, and, while hot,
thickened with       the mixture    of  coal  and    lime, until it be
comes    so hard as that it may be easily spread upon the sur
face  of a board, and not run off" when hot. Turpentine or
pitch will answer nearly as well as tar, and plaster of Paris
will answer instead of lime; to be used in the same manner,
and in about the same proportions. The cement must be ap
plied warm, and is found to be         used easiest   with   a  trowel.
               NEW REMEDIES FOR THE ITCH.
   It  has been     observed   that the workmen employed in the
nianganese mines at Macon, in France, are always free from
the itch, and that those even attacked by that disease in the
neighbourhood, are accustomed to work in these mines in.
order to get rid of their malady.          The itching, it is said, in
that case soon ceases, the eruption dries up, and the skin ia
a few days becomes        perfectly clean.
   C. Grille having      remarked   that the clothing      of the labour
ers in these mines, and particularly articles         of linen, became
exceedingly white in the course of a little time, exposed se
veral pieces of coloured cotton cloth to the air disengaged
from the interior       of  these mines,     and  found, that in the
Course  of  a s\.w days they had lost a great deal       of their colour.
This   led him     to conjecture that manganese          itself might be
employed as      a  remedy for the itch.         He therefore took fix
parts  of   pulverised    manganese    and sixteen    of bog's lard and
formed them into an ointment, which he caused several per
sons troubled with the itch to rub over their bodies;               he ad
ministered also at the fame time the usual internal medicines,
ard the patients in a few days were perfectly cured.
   Parmentier, who has made known this observation                        of
C. Grille,    adds, that in the course    of his    researches respect
ing the means of obviating the unpleasant evaporation which
proceeds from common, sewers, he observed that this evapo
                                                                     ration

 ration preserves those who clean them from certain diseases.
 These people assert that they never know any thing of the
 itch     ;   that they are         so secure   from    it,   that they can       sleep
 with itchy   persons without any danger of infection    and                  ;
 that itchv persons who undertake their labour, get cured in
 the course of           a   few days.    When      these people scratch or cut
 their flesh, the wounds heal up      twenty-four hours;
                                                  in                              it   is
 remarked also that they are never troubled with chilblains or
 tetters,         and that they have always         a   found smooth skin.
      These observations             of C. Grille     seem    to confirm what has
 been said in regard to employing vital air for extirpating                        the
 small-pox.

  J. HE      island    of Pulo Pinang, which lies           close to the coast
of Queda,      between       the fifth and       sixth  degree    of northern
latitude, and which now belongs to the                   English East India
company, may serve as a proof how well the English under
stand the art of establishing colonies, and bringing them in a
short time to a flourishing condition.                About the year 1784,
the    Malay king of Queda          made a present       of  the whole island
to   Mr. James Light, the captain of                a country     ship  trading
thither,    and the      latter   sold it to the East         India company,
with the proviso that he mould be appointed                    governor of it;
 which was accordingly done, and he remained in that office
till  the end  of  the year 1795.       The   island was uninhabited, and
 entirely covered with wood.              In order     to erect a few houses
it  was necessary, therefore,         to destroy part    of  the wood,    which
 was effected chiefly by means of sue.
    This island, which was now cal'ed                     Prince     of Wales
 Island,   I  visited,    for the first time, in the year 1793, con
sequently nine years after it had been taken possession of by
 the Englisli. At that period a beautiful town, of a pretty
 considerable      extent, and regularly laid out, had been built.
 A   particular part of it was destined for the Malays and other
 Asiatics, a great number of whom had already established

themselves         in the place. The market was well supplied wish
fruits, sifli, and other necessaries.                A considerable trade had
also begun to be carried Oil.                   Ships from Bengal brought
hither opium, rice, and cotton, which were bartered for
pepper,        tin, betel-nuts,       and gold-dust.           All the company's
 ships    touch here        in their voyage          to  China,       as well as the
 large fleets from Bombay and Madras.                            The arrival of so
 many      vessels    makes     this  place   a staple,      where     buying, sell
 ing and bartering are continually going on. The harbour,
 which      is formed by the coast           of Qucda       and    the east coast    of
 the island, is deep, and secure from every wind.                        Those who
are unacquainted with its geographical                          situation    imagine
 they    are    entering    a   river;   so  short    is  its   distance   from    the
 continent.          When      viewed from the west side, the island ap
 pears to be round, and its mountains may be seen at a con
 siderable distance.           It is about thirty-five or thirty-fix miles
 in circumference.              The     present     inhabitants        have   applied
 chiefly to the cultivation of pepper, which is in a thriving
 condition, and promises to turn out very advantageous.                            As
 the island produces excellent timber for (hip-building, docks
 have been         formed, and a great many                  vessels   have   already
 been launched.
    A   few miles from the towrt is               a forest,     which, rising     gra
 dually, covers         the mountains behind it.                From the summit
of   the      highest    of   these mountains          a large     stream   of water
projects itself more than a hundred feet, with a prodigious
 roaring noise, on the rocks below, where, after being col
lected in various natural basons, it forms a small rivulet, and
then proceeds through the town, with a winding course, so
the sea.         One can hardly conceive how pleasant and refresh
ing   it  is   for  those relaxed by the heat of the climate to bathe
in  one     of   those basons,       as the   water is kept in a continual
state   of   coolness by the shady branches                 of the trees, which
form Over them            a  fort of arches', and defend them from the
rays of      the fun..     The' coolness       of   these groves,       the majestic
soar   of    the    waterfall, and the noise of           a variety of unknown
insects, ttiakc        this  ah   agreeable    retreat to those who have a
taste for the beauties of nature.                 In the year 1796, country-
houses       were     erected    amidst     these fairy       groves,    which, in
                                                                                 .the

   the course of time, may be converted                           into English     gar
   dens.
       In  the year 1789 the king of Queda took it in his head to
  demand        back the ifland from the English ; and, as the latter
   (bowed no inclination              to comply with           his desire, he   assem
  bled    a considerable         army on the coast opposite to the island,
  in order to lay siege to it in form. That he might inspire
  his troops with more courage he gave them an entertain
  ment, at which             opium was not spared.                His Malayan ma-
 jesty    did   not    fail to   get   intoxicated     along     with   his warriors;
  and this being reported to the English by means of their
  spies, they attacked the Malays in their camp, killed their
  king, made          a great slaughter          among them, and thus put an
  end to the war.             A regular stone fort has since been built,
  in which a garrison is constantly maintained of three batta
  lions of sepoys and Europeans.
      At   first,   sliips   that touched here were obliged to fail back
  the fame way they had entered ; which was attended with
  this inconvenience, that those vessels destined to proceed
  further through the Straits of Malacca could not take ad
  vantage of a fair wind, because it blows directly into the
  harbour,        and by these means five or six days were often lost.
  In    the year       1791,     however, captain Popham*                discovered    a-
  passage      round the south-cast               end   of   the island, by     which
  this inconvenience is obviated.
      To fail hence for Malacca there                      are two ways;       one    of
  which, for         large (hips,        lies   between      two dangerous sand-
 banks, where a continual and rapid current, which runs
    jther north-west or south-east, requires all the attention of
     * Captain     Popham      is  the   gentleman who comimnderf        the expedition
of the    English    to Ostcnd.      As far   as  I remerr.ber, lie commanded, in the
year 1791, a (hip named // Tntsco, which had been fitted out at OsicnJ

broke out, he was again employed on board a (hip of war. — H.

the pilot      to pass   in safety.    Nature,    however, seems    as   if
desirous to afford here every possible assistance,        since the  Aru
islands on the west side, which consist of some small un
inhabited rocks, serve the pilot as good marks to steer by.
When       these disappear,   the summit of the mountain Parcelar
is discovered      on the   east  side, which must be kept in a cer
tain direction,        according to the current, in order to pass
without danger. As navigators between these sand-banks
have often to struggle with bad weather and contrary winds,
it is impossible to proceed but by continually heaving the
lead, which        is indeed   attended     with danger. The second
passage     lies along the coast through the small channel of
 Calum, which is scarcely so broad as the Elbe at Dresden.
 Nothing more beautiful          can be conceived    than   this passage,
 where     vessels  sometimes    approach    so near the coast  that the
 bowsprit is often entangled among the branches of the trees.
 Birds of the most shining and variegated colours, unknown
 to  the    Europeans, are seen fluttering around, while others
 delight the ear with their song.              As a sand-bank in the
 middle stints this passage against large ships, it is practicable
 only for those which draw very little water.
    When vessels have reached the northern part, nothing can
 be more pleasant than the navigation.              They proceed along
 the coast, from which           the  wind, when it blows from         the
 land, wafts along with it the most delicious aromatic odours.
 The mouths of        the small channels, the different windings of
 the coast, the bays which they form, and the land rising like
 an amphitheatre, all together form the most enchanting pro
 spect.     Nothing is wanting to complete the picture but haT
 bitations; for, in an extent of twenty or thirty miles, the only
 things of the kind that can be discovered, even with a spying-
 glass, are a few fishermen's huts.
    Al   last, after weathering a headland, vou suddenly discover
 the town      of Malacca, formerly belonging to         the  Dutch.     It
 lies at  the head of a bay, and, though small,         is neat and well
 built.     It is surrounded by beautiful gardens and country-
 seats.     No place in the world produces more valuable fruits.
 The   ananas      here are half   an ell in length and a quarter   of an
 t\\ in diameter.        They have an exceedingly sweet mclleous

                   Observations            on the Straits       of Malacca.                      Toy
taste.  The mangostan, called in India the queen of fruits, i*
found here in great abundance, so that from two to thre$
hundred of them maybe purchased for a dollar. They grow
only in the straits of Malacca, Sunda, Banca, and in thfl;
island of Java. They are found neither at Madras nor Ben
gal, nor in the Philippines or China. The usual fruits of
India thrive here better than any where else. The bay
abounds with well-tasted fish, and excellent oysters, crabs,
cray-fish, &e.   Though this place lies nearly under the line,
the climate is exceedingly healthful, and nothing is known
here of those fevers and diseases to which other Asiatic colo
nies are subject. The temperature of the air is cooled by the
sea and land breezes, which alternately prevail.  The former
begins between eleven and one in the forenoon, and blows
very strongly till towards fix in the evening; at which time,
however strong it may be, the land-breeze afllimes its place,
and continues till about eleven the next day. By these means
an agreeable coolness is always preserved.    At Calcutta, in
Bengal,    the heat is much more intense and insupportable,
 though  it  lies at the distance of twenty-three degrees from
 the line; for it is not uncommon there to see Fahrenheit's1
 thermometer, in the shade, during the months of April and
 May,   at between eighty and ninety degrees.       At the interval
 only  when   both winds cease, the heat is "stifling. The reason
 of the land-breeze here being so cool       that, as Malacca        is,                            is
a   peninsula,            the wind
                        always passes over   portion of sea,                   a
 whereas the land-breeze on the coast of Coromandel passes
 over the burning deserts of Persia.
    The        frequent  exceedingly violent thunder-storms
                                    and-
 which" take place here, contribute also very much to mode
 rate the heat.   They arise mostly in the north-west, and
 bring with them                   such coolness that         I   remember having been
 several       times          so   cold that    I       was obliged to have recourse to
 warmer clothing.                     The body here, indeed,     far more sen  is
         of                                  of cold than    the European cli

  storms       are highly gratifying                    to the navigators bound to the
  Chinese          seas   ;    for,   as    a   south    wind,       except         in   a   very   sew

  regularly, prevails in the straits, they are glad to fee such
  storms, which always begin to be formed in the north-west.
  In the night, however, they cannot be used with so much
  advantage, on account of the many sand-banks, islands, and
  even the coast itself,      which  must be avoided.     It  has been
  remarked, that during these storms the magnetic needle is in
  a continual state of perturbation ; and I have heard the cap
  tain of an English East Iqdiaman declare that he has seen,
  during a violent storm, the north end of the needle point di-,
  rectly south.
     The European productions brought to Malacca for the
  purposes of trade are confined to a very few articles.          Rice,
 opium, white and coloured cottons, form the principal part
 of them. The Malays bring hither pepper, nutmegs, sago,
 rotangs, Spanish reeds, and gold-dust.          The latter article is
 first examined by the officers     of the company, and then made
 up into small packets in Chinese paper, bound round with
a thread and impressed with a seal containing Malay cha
 racters.    Each packet contains a catty, and is worth from
 46010500        piastres.  The Spaniards, who go from the Phi
 lippines to     Madras for the purposes of trade, touch here al
 ways in order to exchange their piastres for gold-dust, which
 they carry with them to the coast of Coromandel, where, ac
 cording to cirqum stances, they gain two per caii. These
 packets,   when sold, are never opened,       but are taken on the
 feller's report ; and no instance is known        of anv fraud ever
having been practised on such occasions.          The small Spanish
 reeds are fold for about eight piastres per hundred,              and
pepper at fifteen piastres per pickel of       ij    Spunisli pounds.
The cotton and opium brought hither are fold mostly to tho
J)ufch, who fell them afterwards, to the Malays. The branch
of trade, however, by which the inhabitants chiefly live, is
supplying the ships which touch here with provisions, fresh
water, salted aud fresti fish, poultry and fruit.       The price of
fowls is generally a piastre for eight or terJ.      Pine-apples are
fold at the rate of from four to fix per piasife. Those who are
acquainted with the number of the sliips which pass through
these straits every year to     China,   the Philippines,  the South

importance of this trade.           The tavern where strangers reside
is generally surrounded by a multitude of Malays having for
sale, apes, parrots, cowries, Spanish reeds, and various other
articles.      Among these people one may see many of their
kings,     who     art distinguished by a turban embroidered with
gold, and who enter the tavern without receiving any parti
cular marks of honour from the Europeans.                 The cafe is the
fame     with all the petty        Indian kings, of whom           too high
ideas are entertained       in Europe, but who in India          are looked
upon as little better than corporals.              It may  be readily un
derstood that       I here speak  of the lesser princes ; for the greater
ones, such        as  the kings of Atcheen, Borneo, Pegu, 8cc< are
in  general     treated with more respect.
    The Dutch government, formerly establislied here, con
sidered it as of great importance to clear the straits from the
numerous Malay pirates by which it is infested.                     For that
purpose     it  maintained    a flotilla  of  cruisers and  flat-bottomed
vessels,  which from time to time sought out the Malays in their
places    of   retreat behind the small islands in shallow water,
where their flat-bottomed vessels were of excellent service.
The Malay prows generally carry              a 24-pounder     in  the bow;
have only one mast,          which can be lowered or raised at plea
sure ;   and are furnished with a rudder.            They never attack a
veflel when there is wind, because in that case it can man
oeuvre and make use of its cannon in every direction ; but,
if  a calm     take place,    and they discover a ship from their re
treats,    they then come out and attack the vessel behind and
before, where they are out of reach of the cannon ; massa
cre, with their poisoned daggers called kris, all the white
men on board ; and carry oft' the blacks as slaves. A Dutch
 captain named Bloem, who commanded one of these cruiser?,
 wrt   a   terror to the Malays.           Being acquainted with their
most private retreats, he often surprised them when they least
expected it. They once imagined they should be able to
overcome him, and advanced against him, during a calm,
 with fourteen of their prows ; but before they got near him
 a small breeze sprung up, so that            he was enabled       to direct
 his  vessel, and to give them such a reception,           that five or fix
 of  the prows were         funk, and others had their rudders shot
             8                                                        away;

away; so that they were obliged, to avoid total destruction,
to throw themselves into the sea, and to save themselves by
swimming.        The  rest   betook    themselves   to flight ; for  the
Dutch     give the Malays no quarter.
   Of   the last instance   of this man's    courage,, which cost him
his life,   I myself was an eye-witness. The French frigate
La Prudente, of thirty-fix guns, on board which I was a
prisoner, being in the straits of Malacca, about two o'clock
on the i 7th of July 1795, the man at the mast-head calling
out Five la Republiquc, announced that he saw a sail which
seemed to be steering towards us.             As there was then little
or no wind, the two vessels approached         each other very slowly,
and  it  was therefore   near sunset before we could perceive that
the strange sail was a vessel with two masts.             About ten at
night, after I had lain down in my hammock, I was roused
by the drum beating to quarters. The officers near whose
birth my hammock            was    flung, immediately      started from
theirs, and desired       the   citoyen prifonnier, meaning me, to
do the fame.       The fore-deck was cleared, and every prepa
ration made for battle.          I  then proceeded to the fore-deck,
and   obtained     permission    to remain there.       The two vessels
by this time were so near that they could speak each other.
Our commandant hailed the strange sail, and asked to what
nation    she belonged. The answer was, that she was a Dutch
{hip of war.. — Strike to the republican frigate La Prudente,
and lower your fails. — Are you really French ? said the
Dutch captain. — Yes : take in your fails and drop your
anchor, or I'll sink you.— I have no anchor on board, re
plied the Dutchman, but plenty of cannon ; and at the mo
ment we received a whole broadside, which we instantly re
turned.      Several of the Dutchmen being killed, they then
called out that they struck. Having taken possession of the
Dutch vessel, and sliifted the prisoners on board the frigate,
we found the former to be the Java, of eighteen 9-pounders,
commanded by the beforementioned captain Bloem, who
had that day sailed front Malacca.            A  shot had carried away
part of his   left breast,  but he ordered that the colours fliould
not be struck till after his death.
   The inhabitants of Malacca            are a motley race, consisting

               Observations      on the Straits  of Malacca.              20 \
os Europeans,         Creoles,    mulattoes, black Christians          (called
commonly Portuguese),             Chinese,  and   Malays.        The   Dutch,
and Germans established here, all have mulatto or creole
wives, for     I  do not know       one whose    wise    is an European.
The wife     even    of the last governor, Abraham Couperus, was
a   mulatto.      The customs, manners, and dress of these ladies,
are all in the Malay taste.            The dress which they use, both
in the house and on public occasions, consists of a silk gown
with wide sleeves, which has a great resemblance to a pow-
dering-gown.          Their hair is twisted together and fastened
on the crown of the head with a silver pin.                    In the house
their favourite female slaves sit at their feet; and when they
go out to walk, or pay visits, they accompany them, bearing a
small silver box divided into different copartments, which con
tain certain articles indispensably necessary for            a  Malay lady.
These articles are, betel, areka-nuts, chalk,                a  pair of small
tongs, and a knife for spreading the chalk on the betel-leaves,
in which they wrap up small bits qf the areka-nut for the
 purpose of chewing them.             The care which they bestow on,
 their domestic       economy consists only in seeing the orders
which they give to their slaves carried into execution. When
 a stranger is invited to dinner, he is first introduced into an
 apartment where he is treated with a pipe of tobacco. FeT
 male slaves then make their appearance, one of whom brinrrs
 him     a silver bason     for warning Uie hands, another a vessel
xontaining water, and a third a towel. The company then,
 fit down to table, and are waited on by the female slaves be
 longing    ^0 th,e  master    of  the house.     They    are attended also
 sometimes      by musical     slave?, who, during the entertainment,
 perform pieces of music.
     Slaves here, both male and female,              a few excepted,        are
 treated with great severity.        The   master os one     of  the taverns,
 a  German, named Kreis, born in Hohenlohe,                   is particularly
 distinguished      in this respect.       I never    entered      his house,
 which [ did above ten times, without                 seeing puniflimcnt
  inflicted on some of his domestics.              If the cook had not
  prepared    the  dinner   according    to  his  taste,   he was immedi
  ately carried into the back court, when two other slaves apT
  peared   with bamboos in their hands, and belaboured                    hin.\

on the posteriors till his master, who walked up and dowrj
with his pipe in his mouth, told them to stop. If the staves
did not execute his orders with sufficient severity, he applied
to their shoulders a bamboo, which he always on these oc
casions   carried    himself.    He always made it a rule when
anv stranger     who happened to be in his house interceded
for his slaves, to punish them doubly.           Females slaves even
were not excepted from this correction,          which was inflicted
in   the most indecent manner.           The Dutch government not,
only authorised      this severity, but even put it in practice it
self.   A poor slave belonging to the same Kreis had conceived
an attachment        to a female    slave who resided  in the neigh
bouring    house,     and  belonged    to one  Adrian Koek. The
lovers could only visit each other in the night-time, and for
this purpose the former was obliged to clamber over the roof
of a penthouse. This nocturnal intercourse being discovered,
Koek complained to the fiscal, and requested that the slave
might be punished. Kreis, therefore, was obliged to give
up his slave, and the sentence was, that he should receive
500 blows with a bamboo, to be inflicted publicly.            A ring
was then put round each of his legs, between which an iron
bar was fixed, so that when he walked he was obliged to
describe an arch with each foot, and in this state was sent
back to his master.
   On    the other hand,      I must observe that it is hardly possi
ble, by the    severest  punishsnent, to restrain the profligacy and
villainy of    these men.       What idea must we entertain of a
man, who, having been severely punished for drunkenness,
will, the very next day, take the key of the cellar from his
master's   closet and get so intoxicated as to be unable to stir
from the spot?         To a circumstance of this kind I have my
self been a witness.        The punishment, indeed, wss cruel ;
for the culprit was made fast by the neck, middle, and
legs, to iron rings fastened in the earth, and belaboured till
the blood gushed from every part of his body. I was a wit
ness also to a more striking instance, which sliows how little
impression    good treatment      makes on these uncivilised people.
An opulent Englishman,          who had resided some time at Ma
lacca, taking    a  fancy to one of Kreis's slaves, purchased hint
                                                                  for

              Tibservaiions   on the    Straits of Malacca.          26J
  for the sum of 300 piastres.         This   slave was treated  by his
  new master like a free man         ;  he received   money from him
  and permission   to go abroad on asking leave, provided he re
  mained to take care of the house in his master's absence. But
  this slave, unaccustomed to freedom, notwithstanding every
  threat and admonition, when he got out of the house, would
  not return in the course of the whole day; and at last, after
  being eight days in his new service, he stole from his master
  a piece of money.       His master endeavoured to make him
  confess the theft, with   a  promise     of forgiveness for this first
 offence,  but without success.         This circumstance being told
 to Kreis, he considered it as a good opportunity of excul
 pating liimsclf from the charge of cruelty brought against
 him by strangers, as he imagined he could now prove that
 inild treatment to such men would be entirely lost. He
 offered also, not only to take back the slave, but to force him
 to confess.   As   the Englishman        well knew that no one but
 his slave could be the thief, he delivered him over to Kreis,
 who tied him to     a ladder, and then caused the usual punisli-
 ment to be inflicted.      When he had received two hundred
 blows', his body waS bent, and in that condition he was
 thrown into a hole till the next morning, when the punisli-
lnent was renewed.        He   still continued to hold out for some
 time, but Kreis having threatened to contiriue the punish
ment till he mould confess, he at length acknowledged the
theft, but would not tell whit he had done with the money,
On     the punishment being once           more applied, he confessed
that he had fold the piece of money for a sixteenth part of
its worth to a Chinese ; who was immediately sent for, and
obliged to give it up. After this he remained in the service
of Kreis, who declared that he had never after any occasion;
of complaint against him.
    By what I have here said,           I  do not mean to justify the
cruelties exercised    in this country, I only thought it neces
sary to sliow, by some examples,          how cautious people ought
to be in forming opinions on this subject.               The profligacy
of these people is "undoubtedly to be ascribed to their masters*
who do not pay the least attention to the formation of their
moral character. They allow them to grow up like eat tie,

without taking care to give them any idea of religion, or of
other knowledge, except what is immediately necessary to'
their masters.
   Those who      possess a    whole family of slaves, never fell any
individual of that family, because there have been numerous
instances    in such cafes of the father's or mother's dying
through grief, of becoming melancholy, or of destroying
themselves.       The    names      given to these slaves are generally
those of the months in which they have been born oV pur
chased.     The commerce by sea with the Malays is an armeJ
commerce.         All ships engaged in this trade carry a consi
derable number of guns, and from ten to twenty sepoys or
black soldiers.       When      a stiip comes  to anchor in any of the
Malay ports,      a beam is     laid across the deck  be-fore  the main
mast to serve as     a barrier between      the buvers and the sellers,
 and strict watch is     ac the fame time kept by the sepoys,         with
 their arms loaded and their bayonets sixed.            Isa Malay     have
 any particular business to transact with the captain that re
quires longer time, he is admitted into the cabin in the
after-part     of  the  sliip,   but he must first suffer himself to be
searched,     to sec whether he has about him a knife or any
kind of   weapons.       Neglect of this precaution has occasioned
the loss of many lives as we-fl as vessels.            The treacherous
Malay can never entertain anv friendship for the Europeans;
even if they slioukl live in habits of intimacy with him for
a dozen or twenty years, when a favourable opportunity
Occurs of promoting his own interest, he will make no cere
mony of doing it by sacrificing his old friend.              I could here
give many instances of this kind, but I am convinced by
what   I have seen     that the Europeans often give occasion kr
this villainy by their own conduct.               Being once on boar      J
a large Bombay stiip, bonnd from Manilla to Madras, we
discovered    in the straits of Malacca five large Malay           vessels,
which,   on discovering us, anchored between           us and the land,
Except two, which were further out at sea.             As it was nearly
calm, and the stiip made little way, the captain, in a lit of
intoxication, sent one of his officers on hoard them to alk
w-hence    they came, and whither they were bound.                  Their
answer was, that they came from Bio, were bound to Ma
                                                                     lacca

                 Observations  on the  Straits of Malacca1.          20,5
lacca, and were laden with rotangS.            This, however, did not
satisfy the captain, and he immediately began to fire among
them.         Being much alarmed at this conduct, they cut their
cables and rowed with all their might towards the land,
where they were in danger of running on shore.                     In the
mean time we passed the other two, which being without us
 Were not able to escape, but, very fortunately,             our captain
 did not observe them on account of his ideas being deranged,
 and because his attention was directed to the other side. AS
 soon as we had palled, all         the Malays on board bent them
 selves three       times  with   their foreheads   towards    the deck,
 which      in all probability     was by way   of returning thanks     (of
 Providence for the danger they had escaped.
      In  the straits there are a great mapy islands which abound
 with     excellent fresli water; but it cannot be at all times
 used, as       the   Malays poison the springs : to such length do
 these men proceed in their hatred towards the Europeans.
 When ships enter the straits, they are generally visited by
 small Malay boats, which bring fish and tortoises for sale.
 The tortoises are of that kind called the green tortoise, which
 is three feet in length, about two in breadth, and weighs
  from two to three hundred pounds. A Spanish dollar, a
  small quantity of rice> and a bottle of brandy, are in general
  the price of a tortoise and a certain number of fisli.             The
  flesli  of   these tortoises  is well tasted and much like that        of
  veal,    but difficult    of digestion.     The  eggs,  on    the other
  hand,     a   hundred of which are      sometimes   found in one ani
  mal, are a great delicacy, and made into soup.            The   greatest
  advantage       to seamen  in purchasing these tortoises is, that they
  live a long time : we kept many of them alive from three to'
  four weeks on the deck without any nourishment, and with
  out any other' care than throwing sea- water over them in the
  morning and evening. The whole straits are a real paradise
   interspersed with a multitude of small islands.            Those who
   visit them cannot help wisliing that they could spend             their
  •whole     lives   on them, but while the Malays exist they must
   be uninhabitable for Europeans.

     the Beta         cicla altissima           of Jacquin, in          order       to   procur'h
     Sugar from it.
     This       beet,  formes, is very common, so ihat
                         like       the
both kinds are used in Thuringia, and other parts of Ger
many, as food for the cattle. It is more juicy than the
former,         and     has an exceedingly sweet taste.                     Those which
I employed far my experiments* grew at Schonberg, near
Berlin, on an estate belonging to M. Noldechen, member of
the privy council.  On close examination, a great difference
was observed in them ; they were all covered on the outside
with a red rind, but in the inside some of them were totally
white; others            consisted        of    red and white rings, and some                 of
them of light             red and dark red rings ; many                    of   them were
very thick and tuberous, and others were almost as thin and
long      as the red beet.                Whether this          arose from their being
of   different     kinds, or from the difference of the foil in which
they grew, I cannot determine. Those which                                      I   employed
for my experiments, had grown in the fame soih
     I
    took 112 of these beets, which weighed 125 pound?,
and, having freed them from the tops and rind, grated them
down, and when      portion of the juice had flowed off spon
                                a
taneously, exposed them to strong pressure. I obtained from
them twenty-four quarts of very sweet violet-coloured juice.
In    consequence         of what I
                        had been taught by repeated expe
rience,     I                       it,
                     without any addition, till
                first boiled                    third part                  a
only remained, and at the same time     great quantity of           a
albumen was separated from it.    When the liquor had
cooled,     it (trained through
                   was             piece of woollen cloth,-

and  being then  mixed  with  twenty-fonr quarts of lime-
water, was boiled for half an hour.    At the end of that
period     it   appeared as         a     clear liquor     of   a   wine-yellow          colour,
                                                                                            and

              Experiments on the Preparation            of Sugar.          20J
»nd a great      quantity of impure matter            had been thrown up
as    scum.      I  again    suffered   it to cool, strained       it through
flannel, and, being inspissated,             I  obtained eight pounds of
fyruP-
     A part of this syrup I poured into a deep evaporating dish,
into which I put some glass rods, and at the end of two
months obtained, adhering to the rods, real sugar, similar to
brown sugar candy. As this syrup was much more pleasarn)
than common syrup, and exceedingly cheap, it might be used
as a substitute for sugar, like that procured from the white
beet.
     In continuing my experiments on               the beet,  I   endeavoured
 to ascertain      the actual     quantity of sugar that might be pro
 cured from a determined quantity               of them.     With that view
 I  weighed     three    pounds     twelve     ounces  of syrup obtained by
 the second experiment, poured it into                  a conical vessel of
 tinned copper, and exposed it to slow                  evaporation     at the
 temperature       of from     65° to 70" of Reaumur.            In the course
 of eight hours there          was formed on the surface a crystalline
 crust of granulated sugar, which at the end of twenty-four
 hours was nearly four lines in thickness : having forced it
 down to the bottom of the syrup, in two days a new crust
 was formed, which             was   also forced down      ; and this opera
  tion  I  continued till a tough uncrystallifed pellicle only ap
  peared on the remainder of the syrup : this induced me to
  conclude that all the crystallisable sugar was now separated
  from the liquid, which was mown also by its being less sweet
  and more slimy.          I  now put all the crystallised sugar, toge
  ther with the fluid syrup, into a small sugar mould, which                   I
  kept for eight days at the temperature of 300 of Reaumur, by
  which means the syrup was entirely drained off, and the
  sugar remained almost in a dry state. The whole of this ope
  ration employed thirty-six days.                The raw sugar I obtained
  was still a   little  moist   in the   inside, but it did not deliquesce
  in the    course     of three    weeks,     during which     I  kept it in an
  ppen    vessel,   and   it weighed two          pounds eight ounces : the
  syrup which        drained from it weighed forty-eight ounces;
  consequently,       from the three pounds twelve ounces of syrup
   employed, twenty ounces of aqueous                  particles had evapo-
                                   8                                      rated.

 rated.    From     this experiment it appears, that a bushel of
these beets, without any peculiar care being employed'in
 the cultivation of them, will give 5' pounds of brown raw
 sugar, and     ij pound    of not ill-tasted   syrup,   which, if not
used as syrup,      might    be used with     advantage for distilling
 spirits. I am now employed in refining my raw sugar, and
in determining how much sine sugar and how much syrup
 will be produced from it.
 10.   Experiments with the red Beet, the Beta rubra,                Beta,
         cicla rubra ofJacquln, to obtain Sugar from it.
    That   it is possible to obtain sugar also from the common
red beets has been already proved bv Margrat.                I subjected
them, therefore,      to the like treatment as tiie preceding kinds,
and obtained from a bushel         of red beets 6 pounds of svrup
of  a  not unpleasant talte, but very inferior to that obtained
from the white beet and the beta vutgaris altijjima.                I did
not try to obtain sugar from it. Margraf, from a pound of
fresh red beets, obtained eight ounces of dry sugar, and from}
thirty-two ounces of dry roots, about two and            a half drams.
      11. Experiments       with Carrots, Daucus     carotta  Linn.
    When     carrots are cut in slices and boiled      with water, you
obtain    a   sweet   liquor, which bv evaporation produces a,             -
sweetish juice, which the country-people either iprcul upon
bread or use to sweeten different articles of food.              Having    ,
freed a bushel     of  carrots from the    thin outer rind,     1  mlped
them and expressed the juice. This liquor was then boiled,
clarified with the white of an egg, and inspissated to the con
sistence  of  syrup.    I obtained  six pounds and a quarter of ;i not
unpleasant     syrup,   much inferior, however, to that obtained
from the white beet and the beta vulgaris allrjjima.             1 found
it impossible to separate real sugar from it : rectified spirit of
wine extracted from it a substance which had a great simi
larity to manna.
12.    Experiments with common Turnips,             Brasfica rapa,      to
                        obtain  Sugar fro?:: them.
    I took twelve turnips and rasped them, after having freed
them from the tops and outer rincL             The rasped matter had
                                                                       an

                   from European                Vegetable Productions.                        309
&n agreeable,               sweet,   and       somewhat sharp taste, and, being
properly expressed, gave a                     colourless sweet juice. After cla
rifying it with the white of an egg, I strained the clear liquor
through a piece of woollen cloth, inspissated it to the proper
consistence, and obtained an agreeable syrup of an inferior
quality to that procured from the white beet, and beta vul-
garis altijjima, but equal to common syrup.      By another
experiment,             I    learned      that   a bushel          containing      125 roots,
weighing 116 pounds, is capable                          of producing eight pounds
of    syrup.       At       the end       of    twelve    weeks I found crystals of
sugar (hot up in it ; but they were exceedingly brown, and
could be separated only with difficulty from the remaining
mass.
      13.      Experiments           with       the Cabbage            Turnip,    Brassica
                                        napobraflica.
  The juicy nature of these turnips, as well as the agreeable
sweet taste of their juice, induced me to try whether I could
obtain from them sugar and syrup.       Having peeled and
rasped sixty of them, which weighed 123 pounds, I obtained
from them, by expression, about twenty-two quarts of co
lourless    jujce, which               was     agreeably       sweet,      but had at the
same time a sharp                radish-like         taste.        I   boiled it twice    ;   by
                                                                                               it it,
which means              a great     deal     of flaky matter separated from
and the liquor became                       perfectly clear.   filteredI  after     it
had cooled, added to                   it   twenty quarts of fresh lime-water,
and boiled         it   slowly.        While boiling,              the sharp radishy mat
ter was evaporated, and    at length obtained ten pounds of
                                       I
transparent brownish -yellow syrup, which had     perfect re                  a
semblance to that obtained from the black birch, but which
had the same foreign taste.                       In order         to procure sugar from
it,
 I  put   portion of
               a        into         it          a   vessel   in which      I    placed   glass
rods, suffered  to evaporate slowly, and at the end of some
                         it
weeks found small crystals of sugar adhering to the rods, but
the quantity   was unable to determine.
                   I                         As this turnip                                    is

       14.  Experiments with the Skirret, Sium Sisarum.
   Margraf obtained from a pound of fresh skirret-roots
eighteen ounces of dry sugar; and half a pound of dry roots
gave him three drams of real sugar.         The object of my ex
periments was to obtain merely a syrup sit for domestic pur
poses ; but, on account of the many farinaceous particles
which these roots contain, the preparation of dry sugar from
them, as Margraf remarks, was attended with many diffi
culties.    As they cannot well be rasped, on account of their
smallness,    a bushel of them, which weighed twenty-fix
pounds, was pounded in a stone mortar with the addition
of a little water, and the juice expressed : the residuum was
washed in cold water, and, being again expressed, I obtained
a turbid sweet liquor.      I suffered it to remain eight days in
a cool place, and found that a great part        of the farinaceous
matter had deposited itself, and that the liquor was become
clear and transparent.       Being clarified with the white of an
egg, and then inspissated, I obtained five pounds of an
agreeable   syrup  of a  bright brown colour.      From this it ap
pears   that these roots are too dear to obtain from them a
cheap syrup.

   The peculiar     sweetness  of this woody root induced me to
subject it to a similar examination, though Margraf had before
observed that little sugar was to be obtained from it.         With
this view I treated, in the fame manner as the preceding,
a bushel of the roots, which weighed twenty-four pounds,
and obtained     5^- pounds of an agreeably       tasted syrup, but
which had not entirely lost its natural taste. Had my other
occupations admitted, I should have endeavoured to ascer
tain the proportional quantities of sugar contained in deter
minate quantities of these substances ; but as this has been
impossible,   I must reserve them for another opportunity.

III.    Account   of a  Series   of Experiments,       undertaken   with  the
    View of      decompojing the      Muriatic Acid.        By Mr.    Wi L-
    liam Henry          *.
M<-ODERN             chemistry, notwithstanding its rapid advance
ment during the few last years, still presents to its cultivators
several interesting objects, both of analytic and synthetic in
quiry.      Among the former, the decomposition of the muri
atic and of certain other acids holds a distinguistied place ;
for our curiosity respecting the nature of these bodies is
strongly excited by the influence which the discovery would
have on the general doctrines of chemical science, as well as
on the explanation of individual facts. The theory of the
formation of acids, for example, one of the most important
parts of the new system of chemistry, must be regarded as
incomplete, and liable to subversion, till the individual acids
now alluded to have been resolved into their constituent
principles.       To the best of my knowledge, however, we are
not in possession of a single fact that gives the smallest insight
into the constitution of the muriatic acid ; and the attempts
 to effect    its analysis    can only therefore be directed by the
 analogy of the decomposition of other bodies, which, from
 similarity of character, are arranged in the fame class.
     One of the first objects in the analysis of a compound body
 should be, its complete separation from all other substances,
 which, by their      presence,      may tend to introduce uncertainty
 into the results      of   the processes that are employed.            But it
 is seldom     that a simplicity so desirable can be obtained in
 the objects of chemical research ; for, agreeably to a known
 law of affinity, the last portions of any substance are sepa
 rated with peculiar difficulty ; the force of attraction appear
 ing   to increase as we recede from the point            of saturation.   In
 a  liquid state, the muriatic acid is a totally unfit subject for
 analytic experiment; for, in the strongest form under which
 it can be procured, it still contains a large proportion of
  water.     This   watery     portion,    besides the complexity which

it introduces into the results of experiments, prevents any
combustible substance that may be applied, from acting on
the truly acid part ; because that class of bodies, having less
difficulty in attracting oxygen from water than from the acid,
will   necessarily     take it from the former source.               The    state of
gas, therefore,        is the only one         in which       the muriatic      acid
can become         a  proper object of analysis.
    In   the series    of experiments on this gas, which                I am now
about to describe,           I employed the electric fluid, as an agent
much preferable to artificial heat. This mode of operating en
ables us to confine accurately the gales submitted to experi
ment;       the phænomcna that occur during the process may be
distinctly observed ; and the comparison of the products, with
the original gases, mav be instituted with great exactness.
The action of           the electric fluid itself, as a decomponent,               is
 extremely powerful          ;  for it is capable      of separating from each
 other, the constituent parts of water, of the nitric and sul
phuric acids, of the volatile alkali, of nitrous gas, and of
several other bodies            whose components are stronglv united.
I began,       therefore,      with examining attentively the effects of
the electric muriatic acid gas without admixture *.

       On the Effects        of Eleclricity      on  Muriatic Acid Gas.
    When strong electrical shocks were passed through a por
 tion of muriatic acid gas, confined in a glass tube over mer
 cury, the following appearances took place.                         The bulk of
 the gas, after 20 or 30 shocks,              was considerably diminished ;
 and   a  white deposit appeared on the inner surface of the tube,
 which considerably            obscured its transparency.             In some in
 stances,      both the contraction           and    deposit were much more
 remarkable than in others.                 The   gas which issued from         mu-
    * The     gases submitted     to the action   of electricity, in the following
 experiments,     were confined in straight glass      tubes of various diameters,
 armed at the sealed end with a        conductor of gold or of piatina, but gene
 rally of  the latter metal.     The   stiocks were    as strong as could be given
 without breaking        the tubes, which,      notwithstanding   every precaution,
 were often mattered by the force of the explosion.             Each  measure  of gas
 is equal to the bulk occupied by a grain of mercury.
                                                                                  mt

          Experiments     to decompose    the  Muriatic Acid.          313
mt of     soda, soon after the affusion of sulphuric acid, and
while the charge was yet warm, exhibited these appearances
in an eminent degree. Of this gas, 307 measures were re
duced, by 20 shocks, to 227, or were contracted nearly one-
fourth.      Gas from the fame materials, after they had con
tinued working for some hours, was diminished, by similar
treatment, only about a twelfth.             These effects, therefore, it
seemed probable, depended           in some measure on the presence
of moisture;      and I accordingly found, that muriatic acid
gas,    after more than a week's exposure to muriat of lime,
brought into contact with it immediately after cooling from
a state of fusion, was scarcely diminished at all ; and that the
deposit, though it still occurred, was less copious           in quantity.
This     deposit  was   not,    like   corrosive   sublimat,    soluble in
 water;     but   had   every     property of the     less  saturated  salt,
calomel.
     The mercury by which the muriatic acid was confined
was therefore evidently oxydated; and to the combination
 of a part of the gas with the oxyd thus produced, the dimi
 nution of bulk was doubtless to be ascribed.              But it was un
 certain from whence this oxygen was derived.                     It might
 either result from the decomposition of the acid gas, or of
 the water chemically combined with it. The following ex
 periments were therefore made to determine this point.
     Experiment I. Through 1457 measures of muriatic acid
 gas 300 electrical shocks were passed.                 There remained,
 after   the admission       of water, 100 measures of permanent
 gas, (or   not  quite  seven    from each hundred of the original
 gas,) which, on trial, appeared to be purely hydrogenous.
      Exper. 2.   Of  the gas dried by muriat        of lime, 176 mea
 sures received    120 shocks.        The   residue  of hydrogenous gas
 amounted to      11 measures,       or rather more than 6 per cent.
      These experiments, and other similar ones, made on com
 parative portions of muriatic acid gas in its recent state, and
  after exposure to muriat of lime, convinced me that it was
  impossible,    by this method, wholly to deprive the muriatic
  gas  of water.    The     recent   gas, however, when electrified        in
  smaller quantity than in experiment 1, gave a larger propor
   tion of hydrogenous gas ; which shows, that soine portion of
                                                                          its

  a 14        Experiments   to decompose the  Muriatic Acid.
 its moisture was removed by exposure to muriat of lime.           In
 order,    if possible, to procure the gas perfectly dry, another
 mode of preparing it was resorted to. Alum and common
 salt were      first well calcined, separately, to expel their water
 of crystallisation, and, being then mixed, were distilled to
 gether in an earthen retort. The gas proceeding from these
 materials was received        over dry mercury   ;  but, though only
 the last portion that came over was reserved for experiment,
 it still, after the usual electrisation, afforded a product of hy
 drogenous gas.
     In   the course    of the  preceding experiments, I observed
 that the diminution       of the muriatic acid gas stopped always
 at a certain point, beyond which it could not be carried          by
 continuing the (hocks.          Gas also, which had been        thus
 treated,     when transferred    to another tube, and again elec
 trified,    did not exhibit any further deposit.       It became in
 teresting, therefore, to know whether the production of hy
 drogenous       gas had a similar limitation; because the decision
 of this   question   would go far towards ascertaining its source.
 If the evolved hydrogenous gas arose from the decomposition
 of the acid, it might be expected to be produced as long as
 any acid remained undecomposed.             But   if water were the
origin of this gas, it would cease        to be evolved,    when the
whole of the water contained in the gas had been resolved             ¦
into its constituent principles.
    Experiments 3 and 4. Into two separate tubes I, passed
known quantities of muriatic acid gas.              Through the one
portion 200 discharges were taken, and through the other
400. On comparing the quantities of hydrogenous gas pro
duced, it proved to bear exactly the fame proportion, in each
tube, to the gas originally submitted to experiment.           Hence
it may be inferred, that the hydrogenous gas, evolved by
electrifying the muriatic acid, has its origin, not from the
acid, but from the water which is intimately attached to it.
The agency of the electric fluid appears also, from the follow
ing experiments, to be exerted, not only in disuniting the
elements of water, but in promoting the union of the evolved
oxygen with muriatic acid.

latter, was rapidly diminished by eleclrical (hocks; 30 of
which reduced the whole to             in    *.    The remainder consisted
of muriatic     acid  and    azot gases, with a small proportion of
oxygenous gas.         The deposit formed on the tube was of the
fame kind as before, but much more abundant.
     Exper. 6. The fame appearances were occasioned, much
more remarkably, by electrifying muriatic acid with oxy
genous gas ; and the contraction continued till the mercury
 rose so as to touch the       extremity of the platina conductor.
At each explosion, a dense white cloud was seen in the tube,
 which soon settled on its inner surface, and was of exactly
 the fame chemical composition as the one                   already described.
 Nitrous    gas and muriatic gas, when electrified together, un
 derwent a similar change.
     In order to ascertain whether the mercury by which the
 gases were confined, in the above experiments, had any in
 fluence on their results, they were repeated in an instrument
 made, purposely for the occasion, by Mr. Cuthbertson, of
 London. It consisted of a glass tube, ground at each end,
 with the view of receiving two stoppers, each perforated with
  platina wirej which projected into the cavity of the tube.
  When the stoppers were in their places, the extremities of
  the wires were at the distance of about half an inch; and,
  by properly disposing the apparatus, electrical shocks might
  be passed, through any gas or mixture of gases, with the
  contact only of glass and platina.
      Exper. 7. In this lube I electrified the muriatic acid gas,
  and then admitted to it an infusion of litmus.                     The sudden
  destruction of its colour evinced the formation of oxygenated
  muriatic acid. Not the smallest deposit appeared on the tube.
      Experiments 8 and 9. The same phænomenon took place
  when an infusion of litmus was brought into contact with a
  mixture of eommon air and muriatic acid, and of oxygenous
      * This experiment suggests     an  additional  re.isnn  to that already givtn
  for the greater diminution of    the  first than of the subsequent     portions of

   much more adulterated,   than the htter, with the atmospherical air of the
   vessels.

   The     above    facts  prove    that the combination         of oxygen
with muriatic acid, in these experiments, is not occasioned
by a pre-disposing affinity in the mercury to combine with
oxygenated muriatic acid ; but that the electric fluid serves
actually as an intermedium in combining the muriatic acid
with oxygen.
   From the relation of these experiments it appears, that not
the smallest progress had been made by them towards the
decomposition of the muriatic acid. I resolved, therefore, to
attempt     its analysis,   in a similar manner, with the aid              of
combustible gases.

   In    a memoir read before the Royal Society,               and  inserted
in their Transactions for            1797,    I have    shown that, when
electrical shocks       are   passed   repeatedly    through a confined
portion of      carbonated     hydrogenous gas, the water held in
solution by the gas is decomposed by the carbon, which
forms a constituent part of it ; that carbonic acid is formed ;
and an addition made,          of hydrogenous      gas.    Hence the bulk
of  the carbonated       hydrogen      gas is considerably enlarged       by
this process, which shows, by iis results, that the affinity of
carbon for oxygen is rendered much more powerful and effi
cient by the electric fluid.           I have since found that other
oxygenated       substances     are decomposed       by electrifying them
with carbonated hydrogen              gas.     Nitrous   gas, for example,
is speedily destroyed by this process,             and carbonic acid and
azotic gases are obtained.
   Every attempt to decompose the muriatic acid must be
founded      on the presumption that it is an oxygenated sub
stance; and those bodies promise to be the most successful
agents,     that  possess   a  strong    affinity for oxygen.      Now, of
all known       bodies, charcoal most strongly attracts oxygen ;
and    I  have,    therefore, repeatedly attempted the destruction
of this acid,     by pasting     it over red-hot charcoal.        But, in   a
                                                                       series

               Experiments       to decompose   the   Muriatic Acid.         21 7
 series   of experiments, which I            made some time since,           with
this view, in conjunction     with Mr. Rupp, we soon found
reason to be dissatisfied with the difficulty and uncertainty of
this process.  An immense production of hydrogenous gas
took place ; but it was not easy to determine whether it had
its origin from real acid or from Water.       Our experiments,
however, though insufficient to furnish decisive proof, induced
us to believethat it had the latter origin.
   It next occurred to me, that the comparative affinities of
the muriatic radical, whatever it maybe, and of charcoal, for
oxygen, would be elegantly and satisfactorily ascertained, by
electrifying         together    the carbonated hydrogen and           muriatic
gases.  If the muriatic acid be capable of decomposition by
carbon, it might be expected to be destroyed by this process;
and the exact quantity of acid decomposed,    and the nature
and quantity          of   the  products, would thus be easily deter
mined.          I   electrified, therefore, the muriatic acid and car
bonated hydrogen gases, with the most scrupulous attention
to the phænomena and results. That the electric fluid might
not be misapplied in decomposing the water of the carbon
ated hydrogen gas, it was kept more than a week, before use,
over quicklime, introduced to it while yet hot.

18.       Of   the added 18, six may be accounted for             by   the de

T,HAT             copper and brass vessels cannot be used with
safety   in  cooking victuals or for holding articles of food, and
particularly those which contain acids, is well known.                      It is
also well known that the          tinning applied in the           usual  man
ner is not durable, being soon worn away by cleaning, and
on that account must be frequently renewed. Some, there
fore, have proposed enamelling for kitchen utensils of cop
per; which, indeed, would answer exceedingly well, and be
much safer for the health than impure tin mixed with lead,
often employed for tinning : but, unfortunately, enamel is
too dear, and readily breaks when the vessel receives the least
blow; which cannot always            be avoided      \.

    +  Articles that would come high when made singly, may be afforded
at a low rate when manufactured on an extensive scale.          Cooking utensils
 lined with a vitrified glazing, are now commonly Ibid in many (hops in
 London, and    at a moderate price.   4t would      be  as  reasonable to object
to the use of earthen-ware     or china,    because    they   may be broken    by
 blows,  ab to make   this an objection  against the use of glazed kettles.—

     The following        process for tinning is attended with no
danger      from    poisonous ingredients, as no lead is used in it ;
the tinning, too, is exceedingly durable, adds strength to the
copper     vessel,  and secures      it from     the  action of acids much
longer than the common tinning                     : —When       the  vessel  has
been prepared        and     cleaned     in  the usual manner, it must be
roughened on the inside by being beat on a rough anvil, in
order that the tinning may hold better, and be more inti
mately connected with the copper. The process of tinning
must then be begun with perfectly pure grained tin, having
 an addition of sal-ammoniac instead of the common colo-
phonium.           Over this tinning, which must cover               the copper
in    an even and uniform manner throughout,                    a second harder
 coat must be applied, as the             first forms only a kind of me
 dium for connecting the second with the copper. For this
 second tinning you employ pure grained tin mixed with
 zinc in the proportion of two to three, which must be ap
 plied also with sal-ammoniac smooth and even, so that the
 lower stratum may be entirely covered with it.
     This coating, which, by            the addition     of the   zinc, becomes
 pretty hard and solid, is then to be hammered with a fmooth-
 ing-hammer,          after it has been properly rubbed and fcow-
 ered with chalk and water, by which means it becomes more
 solid, and acquires       a  smooth compact surface.
      Vessels and utensils may be tinned in this manner on both
 fides.     In this    cafe,    after being exposed to a sufficient heat,
 they must be dipped in the fluid tin, by which means both
  fides will be tinned at the fame time.
      As this tinning is exceedingly durable, and has a beautiful
  colour, wbich it always retains, it may be employed for va
  rious kinds of metal instruments and                vessels which it may be
  necessary to secure from rust.
    Another durable, though somewhat                   expensive.    Method    of
                                       Tinning.
      This tinning,      which consists of more articles and is dearer
  than the former, can be applied to metals and metallic mix
  tures, and, when well prepared,             is exceedingly durable; which
  makes up, in some measure, for the cost. It is as follows : —
                                         F f a                               Take

 220           Process   for Tinning         Copper Vessels.
 Take pure grained tin one pound, good malleable iron one
 ounce and a half, platina one dram, silver twenty-four grains,
 and gold three grains.         These five metals must be well fused
 together in a crucible with one ounce of pounded borax and
 two ounces of pounded glass, and the liquid matter must be
 formed into small ingots.            These ingots are to be again
 heated and reduced     to powder       in    a warm mortar with a hot
 pestle.   This powder       is then to be put        in an iron pan over
the fire, where it must be again fused, stirring it well round :
it  is then to be poured into small flat moulds, where it is
suffered to cool, and     it  is then fit for use.
    This tinning   is to be applied      in the following manner: —.
First tin the vessel with grained tin and sal-ammoniac in the
 common manner; clean and scower this coating; then apply
the composition with sal-ammoniac according to the usual
process, and when it is well diffused suffer the vessel and the
tinning   to cool.    Then      expose    it   every  where to a gentle
heat to render the adhesion stronger,               and immerse it while
hot into cold water to give it that hardness and solidity which
it had lost by being heated. The surface is somewhat rough
and gritty : but you then rub it hard with a scratch-brusti ;
and, in order to make it even, you afterwards smooth it com
pletely with fine sand or any polishing ingredient.
    If one coating does not appear sufficient, a second, and
even a third, may be applied         in  the manner above described.
Two coatings, however,          are fully sufficient for kitchen    uten
sils which   have   been a good deal used; and,            if you wish to
have the surface perfectly smooth and even, you may apply
a thin coating of tin, which will fill up all the cavities and
render it quite even. A coal fire is the best for this tinning ;
for turf coals attack    the    metal, and interrupt the union and
fusion of the coating.

V. Remarks       on   Dr. Girtanner's Memoir                respecting the
     Question,  •whether   Azot    be a   Jimple   or a compound Body.
    By C.    Berthollet *.
D,'R. PRIESTLEY              long ago made experiments which at
first induced him       to believe, that water distilled from lime,
and, above all, from argil, or even without addition in an
earthen retort, or one of rough glass, would be converted
into air; but he afterwards proved that this phenomenon
was fallacious, and that a transmission only of the surround
ing air took      place   on this occasion.         Guyton    added some
further observations      to those    of Priestley  t, and the circum
stance seemed to be sufficiently cleared up.
    Wiegleb, however,       published     a memoir in which he pre
tended to prove, by his own experiments and those                  of  some
others, that the gas obtained by making water pass through
ignited earthen tubes, ought to be ascribed only to the com
bination of the aqueous vapour with the matter of heat,                 and
that this combination gave birth to azotic gas.
    This memoir      gave rife to an "answer published by Deiman,
Van Troostwyk,        and Lauwrenburg.           These learned chemists
examined,      with the greatest care, all the circumstances re
specting    the pretended     production of azotic gas by water ;
and    I should have believed        that no Further doubt could exist
respecting the consequence          they deduced from their experi
ments, viz.     *' that the azotic gas, obtained in some cases by
making     the steam    of water pass through ignited tubes, arose
merely from the exterior air deprived of its oxygen gas by the
fire in which the tubes are placed, and that thus the pre
tended conversion      of water into azotic gas, by its combina
tion with the    matter of heat, vanishes."
    After all these discussions, Girtanner supports the new ideas
which he brings forwards in his memoir J on several facts,
the greater part of them borrowed, and already discussed with
    * From Annaksde Cbimie,     No. 103.       + Encyclop. VoL  I. p. 674.
                        { See this   Memoir, p. 335.
                                                                       care.

222              On the Question, whether Azot     be
care.    Among    those   which he affirms, we ought to consider
the following as his fundamental one : " When water is
boiled in a retort of glass, or any other material, you obtain
azotic gas."      The author prescribes these precautions: —
" To obtain azotic gas in the greatest quantity, the water
must be evaporated only very slowly and by a very gentle
heat, which you must take care not to augment too much."
   " It may be observed in all these experiments, without
exception, that, when the last drop of water is evaporated,
the azotic gas ceases to be produced, though the fire be con
tinued."
   An   assertion so positive induced me to repeat the experi
ment with the precautions prescribed by Girlanner.            It was
made with water recently distilled, and the precipitate from
sulphat of alum by potasti well waslied ; it was made also
with   very white argil furnished by Guyton : but though the
quantity of water was considerable, and these two experi
ments lasted, therefore, a long time, no gas was disengaged,
 and the result was the fame as that of the Dutch chemists.
   It  was on this fact, however,   so easy to be ascertained,   that
 Girtanner   chiefly established the composition of azot ; and
hence   that of the atmosphere, " which (says he) is not, as
hitherto believed, a mixture of oxygen gas and azotic gas,
but rather a mixture of oxygen gas and hydrogen ; a water
in the form   of gas, if I may be allowed the expression. When,
by chemical experiments called improperly eudiomelric, the
oxygen is separated from the hydrogen, this separation can
never be entirely and completely effected; a part of the
oxygen remains united to the hydrogen, and forms that che
mical combination which we call azot, and which we obtain
in  these experiments."
   Thus, when      we make a mixture       of oxygen gas and hy
drogen gas, we form atmospheric        air; and the differences of
specific gravity, of properties found by all the tests, of pro
ducts in combustion, are only trifling circumstances, to which
Girtanner pays little attention.
   C. Bouillon-Lagrange, in      consequence   of Girtanner's    me
 moir, has made experiments more numerous than mine, but
                                                              which

                     a simple Or a compound Body.                        323
which conduct to the          same results.     I  shall here give a short
view of them, which            he was so kind as to communicate            to
me.
    He did not obtain azotic             gas by boiling     distilled water
alone, or with argil or aluminc, in a glass retort, having
adapted to it a glass or porcelain tube.
     He    had  no disengagement          of azotic   gas when he made
the fame experiment with               silex obtained from       the fluoric
acid.
     Having     placed    lime obtained from          white marble in a
similar tube, he caused the steam of water to pass through
the     tube, the other end of which             was    immersed    in lime-
 water.      There was       still  disengaged    a little   carbonic acid,
 which formed carbonat of lime, but there was no azotic gas.
     If, instead of lime, argil be used with the same apparatus,
 there is formed a little carbonat of lime, but there is no dis
 engagement of azotic gas.
     If   water be made        to pass through       a porcelain tube into
 which lead has been put, this metal              passes  partly to the state
 of a yellow oxyd and         becomes vitrified,      but no azotic gas is
 disengaged.
      If, instead   of lead, you put tin into          the tube, that metal
 becomes      oxydated,     and you obtain hydrogen gas.           Zinc  gives
  the fame result.
      To ascertain whether this hydrogen gas contained azotic
  gas, C. Bouillon-Lagrange made it pass over sulphur in a
  state of fusion, and obtained sulphurated hydrogen gas, but
  no azot.      He still subjected it to another trial.
       He mixed the hydrogen gas he had obtained by the means
  of zinc with oxygen gas; and, having inflamed the mixture
   by an electric spark,       water- was    formed,      but there   was no
   azotic gas.
       Girtanner's     opinion is connected with that of Humboldt
   on the absorption of oxygen by the simple earths, and par
   ticularly by aluniin.           There is this difference, however:
   Humboldt       considers     the supposed phenomenon as a simple
   separation    of   the oxygen,      which becomes fixed, from the
   azot which remains in a gaseous state : but, according to
   Girtanner, " the azot obtained by the experiments being
                          7                                             always

  always a product of the operation, and not having existed
  before the experiment under the form of azot in the air exa
 mined    ; Humboldt, who is fond of drawing general conclu
  sions from single facts, seems to have been deceived when he
 advances that earths might be employed to determine the
 quantity of azot contained in atmospheric air: earths do not
 indicate the azot contained in the atmospheric air, they
 change that air into azot."
     Young    Saussure * has formally contradicted the result an
 nounced by Humboldt.           He agrees that the humus, which
 is the result of a mixture of decomposed vegetables with
 others not yet decomposed, absorbs oxygen gas, and is a fact
 well known ; but he attests that " this effect does not take
 place when the earths are pure, and deprived of all vegetable
 substance."       He describes several experiments which he
 made with alumin, calcareous earth, and silex.
     In the Journal     de  Pbjjique for Pluviose the same year,
 there is an answer       of Humboldt, written in a magisterial
 tone, which contains nearly the assertions contained in the
first memoir, with a kind of attestation, because he made his
 observations    in the laboratories of Vauquelin and Fourcroy.
This authority would be imposing, if these two learned che
mists    had co-operated in the observations;            but so far from
this, we    fee by the statement that the only experiments tried
in their   presence would not succeed.
     I have been assured that the celebrated         Fabbroni, of Flo
rence, repeated the experiments of Humboldt at the fame
period without success.
     Champy the son, a very correct observer, repeated them
at Cairo on alumin, on lime, and on the mud of the Nile,
at a temperature      which   varied   from nearly 30 to 36 degrees
of the centigrade thermometer, but he obtained no absorp
tion : it is to be remarked that the mud of the Nile contains-
some remains      of vegetable substances,      so that when distilled
there is extracted    from it a certain quantity of carbonic acid
and carbonated hydrogen gas.
    Chaptal repeated them at Montpellier without              obtaining
an absorption.

     I kept moistened alumine a long time in contact with at
mospheric air and with oxygen gas, without observing the
least absorption.          A chemist having related that the absorp
tion took place by the means of agitation, agitation was em
ployed with much patience, but the result was the fame.
The operation          was repeated         with white clay which had been
sent to me by Guy ton, but still without absorption.                                   This
argil, however, exposed              to   a   strong     heat,    gave     a   little  car
bonic acid and          a small quantity of carbonated hydrogen gas.

and competent judge.                 The principal -improvements may be
found in Gottling's Pocket-book                       f   for Chemists and Apo
thecaries, 1798; but, as far as I know, little or no use has
hitherto been made of them.                        The reason of this may be,
 that the above work comes very seldom into the hands of
those     who      have    most occasion          to make use of it.             Distillers
 by profession        continue,       for    the    most      part,   those     modes      of
 operation which they have been taught in learning their bu
 siness, partly because they have no real opportunity of intro-

     f  According to the       above    pocket-book,       this distilling apparatus was
 first made in Denmark,        where it has been used above fifty times on a large
 scale in one   of the distilleries.    The    person who employed           it got the first
 idea cf it from a Danish journal,         the author      of which had copied it from
 a   German     work entitled      Anferlffine   Sammlung       Oekonomifcber Scbrifiett,
 Dresden    1 790,    The whole apparatus,          the cooler excepted, cost in Den
 mark, where every thing is dearer than in Germany, no more than 17
 or 18 rix-dollars ; whereas a large still would cost from four to five hun
 dred rix-dollars.      An apparatus which can be purchased at so cheap a
 rate, and by which one half is saved in the article of fuel, must no doubt
 be of importance to those who may have occasion to employ it.

trouble to examine the advaitage or disadvantage                                      of    the,
improvements proposed *.
     If I      am not mistaken, this apparatus originated in Den
mark,          where it has been employed with great success                                     :
I have, however, ventured to introduce an improvement,
the advantage of which, I flatter myself, cannot be contested.
That this apparatus is not without defects, and considerable
defects,        I   will readily admit;               and these    I    shall   explain,     aS
well                 : but many of these defects attend tha
         as the advantages
common   apparatus now    employed, and, in all probability,
may be obviated by experience and attention.
  At the fame time I have made an application of this me
thod to the apparatus employed for the first and second rec
tification of spirit of wine. Demachy long ago proposed the
water-bath for the rectification of spirit of wine; but, how
ever convenient the apparatus proposed by him for this pur
pose, it is attended with considerable expense, and the saving
of fuel, which is of so much importance, has not been taken
into consideration.
     Fig. x. (Plate VI.) represents the common apparatus for
distilling.         A
                 is a large wooden vessel bound round with iron,
into which the liquid to be distilled is introduced, and which
may be of any size at pleasure.
  A hole is made in the bottom of the                             vessel    which      occu
pies about a fourth part of its surface.   In this opening,
which  serves as an air-hole, the furnace b is placed. This
furnace may be made with most advantage of strong copper,
as iron would be soon rusted by the surrounding fluid, and
therefore would not last               half     so   long as copper.        This furnace
js in nothing different from                      a common wind-furnace,                   only

therefore requisite that the vessel should be placed on two
blocks, that the air may find     passage under the bottom.

breadth of the                    vessel ;   and        the circumference   of the head, m,
must          be little           inferior        to    that of the vessel.    The vapours
thereby escape more easily ; by which means the distillation
is much promoted. The necessity of the gutter which goes
round the top is evident, and in most apparatuses it is em
ployed *.
       It    is necessary that the tube n should at the upper end be
as wide as possible.                         In    most distilleries it is a common fault
that this tube is too narrow.                                  By this fault        the free escape
of      the vapour is impeded, and                             the distillation       not a little re
tarded ; whereas, when the tube is sufficiently large,                                         half    the
time will be sufficient for the operation.
    As the condensation of the steam, particularly in large di
stillations, is not completely effected by a simple tube pro
ceeding through the cooler, particularly in distilling on a
large scale, where the necessary degree of heat cannot be
always accurately maintained, spiral tubes have hitherto been
employed ; which, indeed, answer the purpose, but, on ac
count of their expense and the difficulty of cleaning them,
cannot always be employed with                                        convenience.             For this
reason,           I    conceived         the idea         of   an apparatus        by which a con
siderable surface is presented to the steam for cooling                                        it,
                                                                                             with
out being attended with the above inconveniences.
  This apparatus consists of copper box, open at both ends,
                                                          a
 from one foot to foot and    half in breadth, and from two to
                                    a                   a
 three inches in height, lying on its flat side.      tinned on                      It   is
 the inside, and to both ends of     are applied close covers,   it
       * There               no need for
                        is                   a    head    upon any still :   it   only tends to promote
a     condensation of the vapour,                       and    its falling back into the body of the
    still.    A       flat cover   it   all that   is   necessary.    The    vapour then,      by   its con
    tinued elastic force, finds its way into the            worm, and    condensed in in
                                                                                     is
    descent.          The     space     between the surface of the liquor and the cover
    should, however,               be   sufficient      to prevent the contents from           boiling up
    inio the worm.           —Edit.

                                          projects ;                    the one, o,
in      upper cover, is destined for receiving the beak of the
      the
still. From the under one the condensed vapour flows into
the lower vessel.   The copper box p passes through the
oblique-lying           cask or vessel q, and projects some inches be
yond both its ends, in order to receive the covers.   The box
may  be' cleaned without any difficulty : the expense of it will
not be one-half that of a worm, and yet it will answer the
purpose of the latter completely.
  When you proceed to distillation,                    the   vessel   may be filled
half a foot above the upper tube                      h, and at the same time
that tube may be connected with the tube i, by slipping their
ends into each other. The sire made in the furnace will then
exercise an equal action on all sides             :   the heat proceeds through
the tube  g into the upper draught tube b ; both tubes, as
well    the furnace, are completely surrounded by the fluid ;
         as
and the advantage of this apparatus in regard to the saving
of fuel may be readily conceived, as that in the furnace can
have no action but on the fluid, and as the heat which passes
 through the tubes is applied to the fame purpose. If we cal-
 cujate, on the other hand, how much fuel is necessary be--
 fore the thick brickwork of common stills can be sufficiently
 heated,      how much heat is lost without being able to
                 and
 exercise any action  on the still itself, the advantage of this
 apparatus will be placed bevond all doubt.
       If so
        much of the distilled liquor has passed over as to con
 vince one that the tube b can no longer be completely sur
 rounded with the liquid, but that it must lie above it ; in that
 case        it will
             be necessary, in order that the ascending vapour
 may  not be  dilated too much by superfluous heat, to remove
 the connecting tube i, by which means. the communication
 between the upper tube and the furnace is intercepted.
       One defect,           which this
                                apparatus has in common with
 the usual still,            is,
                      that the grains and slimy parts burn very
  easily in the distillation of spirits from corn; yet one might
  think that this fault would not take place in this apparatus
  to the fame extent as in the common way of applying the
     fire.  The grains, on account of their gravity, fink to the hot-                   .

    strongest action ; whereas     in this still the bottom   of  the vessel
    is exposed to the least heat, and, consequently, is better se
    cured from burning.          It however cannot be denied, that
    by the heat   of the furnace the burning          sometimes   may   take,
   place, especially when sufficient caution is not observed in
   managing the fire.        Might not this fault be remedied by
    coating the furnace with a slight covering of slightly burnt,
   clay or of plaster or gypsum, which,         as  they can hold a great
   deal of water, would guard against            burning without inter'-
   rupting much the action of the heat on the fluid           ?
          HeSllfication  of Spirit of Wine    by   tit IVater-Batb.
       The  apparatus   destined for this purpose is almost the fame
   in  the principal parts as the above,      only that during distilla
   tion the fire cannot act immediately on the fluid, but the
  fluid receives the heat necessary for its conversion into steam
  through the medium of water brought to a state of ebullition
  by the fire. As, in distilling spirit of wine made from corn
  spirit, the degree of heat cannot be so accurately graduated as
  to prevent the rising of aqueous vapour, which again renders
  the distilled liquor impure, the advantageous employment of
  the water-bath was long ago thought of, by which the highest
  possible    degree of heat short of that of boiling water can be
  obtained. Demachy proposed for this purpose a copper kettle
  filled with water, in which       the still was suspended.         But it
  may be readily seen, that a much larger furnace than com
  mon would be necessary for this purpose, and consequently
 a larger proportion      of fuel ; I shall therefore describe an ap
 paratus destined       chiefly to promote a saving of fuel, and
 which,      I  am persuaded, is in nothing inferior to that pro
 posed by Demachy.
      Fig. a. represents   the apparatus    without the cooling part,
 •which is entirely the fame as that already described          for simple
 distillation.    A   is a wooden vessel      bound round with iron,
 hoops, to the bottom of which is fastened the before-described
 furnace *, with the asti-hole^ and the tube which serves for
introducing the fuel, only that it is not applied to the middle
but to the side of the vessel. The tube gg, destined to af
ford a passage to the air, and to convey off the smoke, does not
                                                                   consist,

             and for the ReSification              of Spirit of Wine.                 831
Consist, as      in    the former apparatus,           of   three pieces, but      of one
whole, which does not pass directly through the fide oppo
site tothat where the fuel is supplied, but extends at most
only to two-thirds of the width of the vessel, where, by-
means of a knee, it turns up, and, by a second knee, is
brought back to the other side.        The whole furnace occu
pies,    in general, only one-half of the bottom of the vessel,
and     is equal in height to only one-fourth of that of the
vessel.
     Over the furnace there is               a copper        box    b,   which occupies
nearly two-thirds of the diameter of the vessel,                         as if in a semi
circle, and completely covers the furnace as well as the tubes.
Its height is about two-sevenths of that of the vessel. Strictly
 speaking, it has only one side ; for the rest are formed by the
.fides of the vessel.  From the upper part of it there proceeds
 a smaller Iongisti box, c, which passes through the fide of the
vessel, and the upper part                 of which         above the vessel is open.
In    the   last place, on that part               of    the       bottom of the     vessel
covered by the box there is a cock, b, which serves for con
veying off  the water.  The remaining parts of the apparatus
arc not different from those of that above described.
     When you           proceed to distillation,             the    box   is completely
filled with water through the part that protrudes beyond the
vessel ; and when the water has been brought to a state of
ebullition by the furnace, it can communicate to the spirit
of wine      the       heat necessary for converting it into vapour.                     If
you are desirous, however, to carry on the operation with as
much accuracy as possible, it will be necessary to introduce a
thermometer into the boxe, which is open without ; for, as the
spirit of wine boils at 165 degrees of Fahrenheit, and water re
quires 212, the heat of the boiling water will be sufficient to
raise the watery particles, though the fluid in the vessel will
not acquire that temperature. It will be- most advantageous
to maintain the heat till the thermometer indicates from 170
to 175 degrees.               If this    degree   of   heat be continued without
suffering        it,   by   carelessness,            the spirit of

this precaution, the last spirit of wine that               passes  over would
be rendered impure by more or less water.
     In common, corn spirit          has an unpleasant smell and taste,
the primary cause of which is careless management of the fire
during the first distillation as well as during the rectification ;
as by these means,          in the first distillation in particular, the
grains readily      become      burnt, and consequently communicate
that taste and smell to the distilled liquor. The decomposition
of the gelatinous matter of the grain seems also to contri
bute to this defect.          The addition of lixivious            salts,   chalk,
©r   charcoal,     during     the rectification,     is the best means           lo
improve spirits which have been hurt in this manner.
     I am however of opinion, that it is possible to preserve
the corn spirit in a perfect state during the first distillation.
The fault generally        lies in the fermentation         of the  wast)   being
too long continued.            In general,    the distillation is not begun
till   the   fermenting liquor throws up no more bubbles, and
stiows itself perfectly transparent under the scum : but it has
been confirmed         by several experiments, that the corn spirit
is obtained strongest, and in the greatest abundance, when
the mixture is subjected to distillation in its highest degree of
fermentation.         If the fermentation be suffered to obtain its
utmost term completelv, a quantity              of vinegar will      be formed,
which not only contributes a great deal to give the liquor an
unpleasant taste, but actually occasions a considerable loss of"
the saccharine      matter necessary for the production of spirit               of

    cation of it to different Kinds of sained Wood-                    By   Nils*
    Nystrom, Apothecary of Norri'iping * .
A,     -S furniture of foreign wood is in general expensive, the
use   of  the indigenous kinds of wood ought not to be neglected,
especiallv     when they are of        a   compact texture, have a fine
grain,     and   are sufficiently hard.         Furniture      made      of  these
   * From the
                 Tratfuel/ons   of the Academy  of Sciences  at Stockholm   for tbe
Tit?    1797.
                                                                            kinds.

                and the application           of it tojla'med Wood.                        333
kinds    of wood,         after it has been well polished, may be stained
of different colours, and then done                        over   with    linseed    oil and
amber varnish.
   As my principal view, however, was to try in what
manner different kinds of wood could be stained so as to re
tain their colour longest, and in what manner mahogany
could be best imitated, I applied such a composition as                                      I
thought would best answer the purpose on the twelve follow
ing kinds of wood ; viz. elm, oak, red and white beech,
maple, pear-tree, wild hawthorn, white beam-tree, ash,
alder, birch,         and
                   pine.  Of these, the maple, birch, alder,
and white beech, when stained with a solution of irpn, had
the greatest resemblance to mahogany.    The appearance of
the other kinds was various, according to the diversity of
their colour and veins, and according as they were more or
less porous, and imbibed a greater or less quantity of the
stain.
   The amber          varnish       in different places is not al
                                    prepared
ways of    equal goodness.       This  is owing to two causes :
1 ft,The careless manner           which the amber
                                         in                melted;             is

boiled, acquires, in      greater or less degree,

of it remains unmelted, it will not             be dissolved by the var
nish    ; and is the operation be performed with a continued
and strong heat, it will be burnt and unfit for use.
     When the amber is kept over a weak fire it will not
melt, but becomes a fort of blackish brown incrustation,
which        also may be employed for varnish             provided it has not
been too much or too little evaporated             :   it  will be  in  the best
condition when you obtain half             a pound from         a  pound.     If
the amber is too little evaporated,          it must be again put into
the pan till it be reduced to the proper weight.                      The fame
 thing     is  to be  observed  when  you  melt   it ;   but  the parts which
 are not fused must be picked out, in order to be afterwards
 also melted.
     I  have found that        a pan with  a  flat bottom is better than
 one with         a  round bottom, because the melting or evapora
 tion is effected sooner in the former than in the latter; for
in    the latter the amber lies thick in the middle, and is               burnt,
at the bottom and           fides before it can be brought           to melt or
evaporate.
     It  is not necessary, for making varnish,             to pick out pure
and transparent         amber, but only the common yellow small
fragments, which may be procured for half the price of that
iii lumps. The earthy part, which is found in amber not of
the clearest kind, sepjrates itself from the warm varnish when
it  is suffered to (land some time before it is decanted.
                Method os preparing Linseed-Oil Varni/b.
    One pound of well pulverised and sifted litharge, four ounces
of finely pounded white vitriol, and one quart of linseed oil.
Put these ingredients into an iron pan of such a size that it
may be only half full; mix them well together, and boil
them till all the moisture is evaporated, which may be known
by    a  pellicle being formed on the surface, or by the barrel
of   a  quill bursting when thrust to the bottom of the boiling
varnish.         Then   take it from the fire   and       pour off the clear
liquid, taking care to keep back the thick part which has
deposited itself at the bottom.             While boiling, it must be
stirred several times round, that the litharge may not fall to the
bottom       }  but you must not stir it constantly,         else superfluous
                                                                       Mar§e

litharge would be dissolved,                      and       the varnish        become too
thick.
   The composition of amber                     varnish         consists   of half   a pound
of melted or                                     half of linseed-
                         roasted amber, one pound and a
bil varnifli,                    of turpentine oil. The amber
                        and two pounds
and linseed-oil varnish are to be mixed together in a deep
cast-iron pan, of such a size as to be only one-third full, and
to be kept over a stow fire till the amber is dissolved, which,
may be known by its swelling up : the operator, therefore,
must have at hand a large copper or iron vessel, that the var
nisti may be held over                 it in   cafe it should          rise above the sides
of    the     pan,        and to prevent       the loss that would                 thereby be
occasioned.  When                  the varnisti       is dissolved, the pan must be
taken from the fire j  and when the mixture has cooled, the
turpentine oil is to be  poured into                        it,
                                       continually stirring it.
Then let    stand some time, that the coarse undissolved par

  piece of linen, put  into bottles for use.
                                  it
  In boiling the varnisti, care must be taken that may not                      it

The best method, therefore,        to cover the vessel in such
                                                  is                                              a

be at hand, such as                a   piece   of wood, plate of iron, or any
thing       else    that may cover the           vessel and          extinguish the flame.

common      aquafortis.   The aquafortis must first be mixed
with sixteen ounces of water in      stone jar, and then
                                                      a     few                          a

iron or wooden spatula.                   This preparation                must be made            in
a'   chimney, because the solution                    is   attended with heat, effer
vescence, and the disengagement of noxious vapours         of                       :   it   is
importance,  also, that  the jar should be of such size as to                  a

day or two, without being corked, over a warm stove ; during
which time       fhake-the bottle frequently.         The bottle being then
suffered to cool, pour into it one pound three quarters              of river
water, stirring it well round, and               leave it at rest for a few
minutes till the undissolved part sinks to the bottom : then
pour the solution into another bottle, and cork it up for use.
     When this preparation          has been carefully made according
to the above       directions,     you obtain      a   yellowifli brown solu
tion, which may           be employed for staining.              In    cafe too
much water, however, has been at first employed, or too
weak aquafortis, the colour becomes dark brown; and there
fore the addition of the aquafortis must be increased in that
proportion       which    the    solution requires, observing         the above
rules.
     This                                 of wood except oak,
              stain may be applied to all kinds
which contains too much astringent matter, and therefore on
the first application becomes almost black. It communicates
to the various kinds of wood different colours, according as it
is applied in greater or less quantity ; such as yellow, yel
lowish brown, and dark brown, with reddish brown stripes
or spots.
   As far  as I have been able to ascertain by experience,
this stain is one of the most durable; it withstands the air
and rays of the fun without changing its colour. I have spe
cimens of it which have been exposed four years continually
to the fun and air, without their colour being altered.
                          2.    Brazil Wood Stain.
     Eight ounces of        real   Brazil wood, four ounces of alum,
and four ounces       of finely pounded          reddle or red ochre.     Pour
over this mixture a proper quantity of water; and, having suf
fered it to remain in that state twenty-four hours, boil it to
a fourth part; then strain it through a piece of linen cloth,
and preserve it in       a glass   bottle for use.
  If one pound           of the    stain   No.   1. be diluted    with three
pounds of water, immerse               some pieces        of wood in    it,   and
                                                                        deposit

deposit      the whole in a warm place             : the wood    will imbibe
the liquid to the depth of a quarter of an inch, and in the
soft parts of the wood it will penetrate still further.
      It  must     however be remarked, that the staining liquor
must be diluted with a greater or less quantity of water, ac
cording        as the  wood is darker or whiter, more or          less astrin
gent. The wood must often be turned, and care must be
taken that it may acquire an uniform and proper colour;
after which it may be taken out and dried.
      The like       process   must be followed when .the stain         No. 2.
 is employed, only that the fame attention is not necessary in,
 regard to obtaining an uniformity of colour.                    This mode,
 however, can be used only on a small scale.
 Method         of flaming Articles of White Waod with              the above
                                    Compounds.
       Rub     the stain  No. I.   over the wood with a piece        of sponge
  five    or six times till it acquire a proper mahopny colour.
  While the liquor is applied, shake it or stir it carefully round,
  that the iron ochre, which has deposited itself at the bottom,
  may be well mixed with the ferruginous solution that 'stands
  over it    ;   and between     each application     of the liquid the wood
  must     be suffered      to become thoroughly         dry.    After this, it
   must be rubbed over once or twice with linked oil, letting it
   dry before the oil is applied the second time. The more the
   wood is soaked with linseed oil, so much the better; as in
   that cafe it does not imbibe so much of the amber varnish,
   which only deposits itself on the surface, and gives it a bright
   appearance.
        When      the wood has been thus rubbed over, and well dried,
    the amber varnish          must be applied in an uniform            manner
    with    a    sponge once or twice, or until it acquires a smooth
    shining surface.         If the wood has been well done over with
    linseed oil, one application of the varnisli or.ly will be neces
    sary ; but on bedsteads, chests of drawers, chairs and other
     furniture which are exposed to more use, it must be applied
     several times, and each time they must be well dried.
         After the application of the varnish,          if any  inequalities or
     lumps appear, they may be removed,               after the article is dry,

                                 carpenter's rush, and        a fresh
applied to the place. For applying the varnish, I have found
it most convenient to use a sponge ; as by these means it cari
be laid on in a much     more uniform manner than by a
painter's brush, which, for the most part, leaves stripes of
loose hairs behind it. The sponge with which the varnish
is laid on, must,                     between   each application,       be well shut up
in                 bottle, that the varnish it has imbibed
         a wide-mouthed
may not be dried by the air, which would render it hardj
and unfit for use.
 The fame process is to be followed with the stain No. 2.
    ,
When applied to knotty birch wood or alder, the wood be
comes undulated, because the liquor extends itself more cross
wise.          The             with fat and knotty pine wood
                          case is the       fame
or fir; for the resinous spots do not so strongly attract the
stain as the other parts.  This, however, makes the appear
ance of the wood not disagreeable.
        The amber      may be applied also over almost all oil
                                varnish
colours except blue, which it would change to green.     It is
attended with this advantage, that it never cracks; as is the1
cafe in general                  with lack varnislies, and those prepared with
spirit of wine.
        I
     have found, also, that this varnish is proper for being ap
plied on real gilding, because it makes no perceptible altera
tion in the colour; especially when laid on thin, and in an
vniform manner.     This object also is obtained, that the
gilding may                 be cleaned          by means      of spirit of wine, or of
soap and            water, without               sustaining     any injury.   For false
gilding, however, it is improper;                        as   it attacks it,and makes
it      rusty and green.
.

Qn this account, it is                very proper for being applied on arti
cles of mahogany.   It                renders the soft kinds   of wood much
harder at the surface.
     This'varnish        used    in this manner would not be expensive,
as   eight ounces         of it    is sufficient for a common card-table.
Should the table be scratched,                the injured part may be easily
repaired by a new coating of varnish ; and if it be new var

they are done over with the varnish.    This pumice stone                        >
must be made flat on one side, and must be free from sand,
so as not to scratch the wood.  As the softer kinds of wood
swell up, for the most part, when the stain is applied, and*
lose their smoothness,  rubbing them in the above manner
with pumice stone is the more necessary.

supporting my own opinions,                   I   shall here give the author's
own words :
      "   In   the year 1756, a very hot dry summer, unhealthful
for men as well           cattle, took place after a very unhealthful
                          as
winter.         The disease which then prevailed continued till the^
harvest,       and extended on one side to Moscow, and on the
other to I^ivonia and through Finland. As soon as the senate

 24°                   Diseases occasioned by InJeEls
ordered  to dispatch physicians and surgeons to those places
where their presence was most necessary.     The chief com
plaint was respecting the mortality among the cattle; but in
some places men and women were seized with the disorder,
and died suddenly.         I    was obliged, therefore, to set out in
all haste on the 26th of              July, accompanied by Chemnitz
                                                  •
the surgeon, for the           village Tschudowo, at the distance of
316 wersts from Petersburgh, where we arrived next day.
On enquiry, we learned from ensign Solopof, who com
manded the post-people in that district, that, since the 17th
of June,   seven persons had died,         in   the course   of from two to
four days,       with boils
                          and tumours, and that two were still
exceedingly       that, on account of the dryness of the land,
                 ill
                   :
several cows, but particularly horses, had died also*  On re
ceiving this intelligence, we caused the road on each fide of
the village to. be barricadoed with planks, established guards
at the barriers, and obliged the post and other travellers to pass
round over the fields to the next station.          We then     entered the
village to visit the fick, and found that one person had died in
the night-time with carbuncles on the neck and legs.             A
woman who had          large carbuncle on her face was still alive.
                       a
In   the course   of about month, four cows and twenty-eight
                               a
horses had died, all   of which had tumours on the neck, breast,
belly, or scrotum.      desired an officer and. twenty soldiers to
                           I
keep  strict watch, in order  to prevent all communication be
tween the village and the neighbourhood         and we then took
                                                    j
up  our  quarters on  the rivulet  called Keretz,  in house be a
longing to field-marshal Albrecht, which was then unoccu-
pied.   In little time several more were attacked
             a                                         the like    by
affections, and died in the course of one or two days.   They
all had tumours on their neck, breast, and head, with black
blisters like real carbuncles but we observed in none of them

bourinc villages,   sent for more soldiers, and the senate dis

to be attacked with the like                 svmptoms, and to drop off, no
time was to be lost; we therefore   ordered -the people and
horses to be removed to the woods, and to be closet v guarded,
Travellers were obliged to proceed, without stopping, to tho
next stage; and in consequence of a representation made                                 l>y
us on the subject, the whole road from Novogorod to Peters-
burgh was afterwards stopped,                 so
                                   that travellers were forced
to pursue the old road to Novogorod bv Krasnoe Selo.      The
preventing of all intercourse with the surrounding country
seemed the more necessary, as in other places, such as Tosna,
Luban,      and from Sosninskoi to Novogorod,                   several horses and
some      men     had already died.           The road also b\7 Isehora and
Novogorod          was stopped;        and    this circumstance occasioned
great alarm at Petersburg!!.             Lieutenant Freyman, at Isehora,
suffered no person from us to approach             that place; and would
not receive our report, till we sent subaltern to represent to.
                                                   a
him the necessity offending off our information; which he
at last did, but not till he had employed        the precautions used
in    regard      to letters    fromplaces where   pestilential diseases
prevail, such       as   fumigating them and drawing them through
vinegar.
     "   As all   the means proposed for checking this disease were
of   no avail,    I   at last    conceived        the   idea   of, laying      aside all
other medicines,           and    confining        myself to cinchona alone.
This     remedy,      indeed,    produced         an evident     change     ;    for the
mortality soon after ceased. The patients acquired    stronger             a
pulse, perspiration aud evacuation       stool          by
                                               were promoted,
and tlicv soon recovered their appetite.   The tumours in the
face disappeared,         and the carbuncles dried up                of   themselves.
I    applied    to them neither salves nor plasters; for                    I    clearly
saw that        these tumours would not he affected                       by    external
means: vesioatories             and    scarification made them only more
difficult to be healed.               At length         the evil ceased   ;     yet care
was taken to keep the diseased                separate from the sound,                 and
to employ all the other precautions usual in                         the time     of   the
plague.
     "   On    closer examination,      I     found that all those attacked
 ' the disease, without exception,

diseased cattle,     or had    proceeded      incautiously    in interring
 them : but all those who had touched the cattle were not
infected ; for a great many horses in all the villages, and even,
jn Petersburgh and on the road to Peterhof, died with the like
 symptoms.       Yet in    some  of  these   places none    of  the people
 were attacked by the disease.        In Tschudow, however, twenty-
 five persons were infected,      of whom       ten recovered.     The dis
 eased   never communicated the infection to any             of  those who
 attended them, or Jived with them          ;    so that the disease could
 be no plague;       nor were      any   buboes      observed   under the
 arm-pits, or in any of the other glandular parts.                    Qf our
 people, who attended the sick and bound up their fores, not
 one was infected.        The  disease   at length began to disappear
 among the people; and about the 20th of July, when a con
 siderable quantity of rain fell, and the air became cooler,
 very few of the cattle were any longer sick : for this reason,
 the senate again opened the roads on the 1st of August, and
 caused the guards to be removed.                  Tschudow, where, the
 disease  had ceased among the people about the ,1 8th of July,
 continued still sliut four weeks longer; but on the 16th of
August we obtained leave to return.
     " In the year 1761, the heat during summer was exceed
ingly intense, and in the districts of Narva, Novogorod, and
Kexhoim, had occasioned a mortality among the cattle like
that which usually takes place during hot summers in the
marshy parts of Finland.          Some of the people also were in
fected with exanthemata, or were attacked with carbuncles,
or rather gangrenous        tumours, and some of them died               sud
denly.      As I  at that   time presided over the medical depart
ment,     I dispatched,    by command       of the senate, doctors Ens
and Dahl, together         with lome surgeons, to the place where
the distemper      was said to prevail;         but about the beginning
of September it entirely ceased.
    " In the month of July 1764,            information      was   brought
to the senate from the district of Jamburg, that             several   cattle
had    died  on   the Schepelow estate        ;   and that  one man had
been attacked      by the disease, and died suddenly.          When this
intelligence was communicated             to the empress,      slie imme
diately gave orders to baroa Tfcherkallol,               president    of the
                         8                                           college

  College   of medicine,       to send me thither,      as  had been     the
  Cafe  before    on similar occasions.         On the 29th of July the
  president    made     me   acquainted    with  this order, and sent for'
  Chemnitz the surgeon.           We set out the same day, with one
 of the medical pupils and a few soldiers, and in the evening
 <>f the  following day arrived at Ugoric, the place of our de
 stination.      I sent notice of our arrival to Kudrawzof, the
 commissary at Jamburg, who had first communicated intel
 ligence of the disease having broken out, and who joined us
 the day following. In consequence of false information giveri
 to him by a peasant, Kudrawzof had first stated, that after
 twenty-four head of cattle had died, a farmer named Iwari
 Petrof had lost his horse* which had dropped down and ex
 pired as he was riding home from ihe fields; that the farmer
 had been infected         with the disease, which showed          itself in
 livid   tumours on his face and breast, arid that he had died
 the third dav after.         We   learned, however, that the cafe was
 somewhat      different.     Petrof had indeed lost      a horse,   which
 he had sent with his son in the beginning             of June  to  Narva,
 where the animal died:            Petrof himself had walked out into
 the fields;    but when he returned his eyes were swelled,             and
 his whole face, breast, and shoulders,             being soon after af
 fected in the like manner, he died           on the fifth day. FrcUrt
 these symptoms        it would appear that his disorder was a ma
 lignant erysipelatous swelling in the head, which became still
 worse because no remedy was applied.                 All these circum
 stances were told        us by his wife and soft, and confirmed by
 the priest   of  the place.     The   disease, therefore,   of which     he
tlied, could not be considered as infectious: three children
 whom he left, together with their mother, were in perfect
 health   ; but we caused them to observe the necessary pre-
vautions for eight days.
    " In regard to the distemper among the cattle, it began
on the 15th of June iii three places.                Twenty-two horses
and two cows had died at Ugorie, three horses at Lctoschezj
and five swine at        Latzi.    The   same symptoms     were observed
On all these animals,        vi%. tumours on the neck, breast,          and
slioulders, or under the belly.            They had all died suddenly,
ind    most of them within twenty-four hours after the disease
                                     I i 2                             had

244                  Diseases occasioned by InscBs
had made its appearance.            Only two of the horses attacked
by the disease escaped.         The peasants had scarified all the
tumours with a red-hot Iron, but without any benefit, though
that process had been serviceable on former occasions.             1 he
diseased cattle were able to walk about till the last moment.
    " On     receiving this information I ordered the liarost to
bring us the diseased cattle; and we resolved, instead of sca
rifying the tumours, that setons should be put into their
breasts,    that they should be driven about till they perspired,
and that they should then be curried and carefully rubbed
down.       This, however, was not attended with           the desired
effect.     On the 7U1 of August one of the horses         died in the
fields with    a   tumour on his breast.       But this was the    last :
the cool wet weather which now took place contributed in a
great measure to put an end to the malady ; and we returned
On the    nth of August.
    "   The   great  heat  of  the  summer in the year 1766 occa
sioned    a  mortality among the cattle in several places, but
chiefly in the neighbourhood of Pelersburgh.              One-half of
the oxen died; all of them were attacked with a kind of glan
ders and fore eyes.      They generally    died in the course  of three
days.     On account of this disease     I was obliged to proceed to
the estate of prince Orlow, at Schunderowfka Muil'a, fourteen
wersts from Krafnoi Zelo, accompanied by a surgeon and
several   soldiers.   This    place  is situated  at  the  distance    of
eight wersts from Goreloi Kabak, on a considerable emi
nence, from which the capital may be seen.             I was informed
by the bailiff on the estate, that twelve horses had died, all
with tumours on the breast and scrotum, in the course of a
few hour?.        Two horses and three cows died during my flay
in   the place.     The preceding winter, the itch had attacked
 a great  many of the horses J all of whom the bailiff, with the
count's consent, had caused to be shot.
    "   On   the 131I1 I was informed by the slarost, that at the
distance    of fix wertls, two cows out of twelve, belonging to a
fanner, had died suddenly without any external symptoms of
disease, and that the farmer's wife had at the fame time tu
 mours on her head.        Though I received this information in
 the evening, I immediately proceeded thither j but did not
                                                                    find

                        in Sweden, Ruffia, and Siberta.                    245
find the woman at home.                  Being brought to me next morn
ing, I      found that slie had actually a black tumour not un
like a carbuncle.              We gave her the necessary medicines ;
and,      as she    found herself considerably better, we made pre
parations next morning to return.
     " When we got back to Goreloi Kabak, we were informed
by the postman, who three days before had driven us through
 Schundcrow, that the fame clay he had been attacked with a
 tumour above the right eye.                 In the middle of it there was
 now     a black ulcer not unlike a carbuncle, but unattended
 with     heat.      I   administered      to him the proper medicines ;
 but     I   received       no further account of him, though I gave
 directions        to the bailiff for that purpose." —Thus far Dr.
 Lerche.
      I  sliall leave     it to intelligent physicians to determine whe
  ther this disease,         so dangerous     in particular to horses, which
  prevails only during dry and hot summers in Ingermannland
  and Finland, be not of the fame kind with that observed in
  Siberia     ; and     whether it be not free from all dangerous con
  sequences       in   regard to infection, and may be cured by the
  common topical means. The use of bark, which Dr. Lerche
  found beneficial,            ought undoubtedly        to  be  employed for
  curing this disease, and preventing the gangrene, which so
   suddenly takes place, from spreading.                 It is to be ascribed,
   in all probability, to a like power of checking gangiene, that

       Eartb      to the State of calcareous Eartb *.               Bj   B. G. Sage,

     X HE        ashes   produced      by burnt bones are white, and com
   posed   of    more than two-thirds            of animal earth, and of a part,
   of   that    fame     earth    combined with phosphoric acid. They
   produce by lixiviation           a pretty     large quantity      of natron, from
   which       the sire,    according to all appearance,                has separated
   the phosphoric acid.
       Bone-ashes ought to be considered as a phosphoric salt
   with    an excess of animal earth.                   These ashes, deprived of
   their natron by lixiviation, are insipid, and insoluble in water j
   but the phosphoric salt becomes soluble if it be disengaged
  from the excess of animal earth with which it is combined,
  and which rtiay be effected by means of the vitriolic acid.
  Fourteen         parts   of this     acid     concentrated are requisite for
  twenty-four of         bone-ashes      :   the    more they are calcined to
  whiteness,        the larger    will   be the quantity of verifiable phos
  phoric acid extracted             from them. It is contained in them
  in   the proportion .of a third.              This    salt, composed      of animal
  earth    and      phosphoric acid, may be decomposed by fixed al
  kali,    which precipitates from it an insoluble calcareous
.phosphorous salt.              This character of insolubility               serves  to
  show that there is          a difference      between      the animal earth and
  the calcareous        earth, since the phosphoric acid salt, with a
  base of animal earth, is soluble in water.                     When vitrified, it
  produces       a  pellucid    mass   of  a  light  blue    tint;   while the phos
  phoric salt with a calcareous base produces by fusion a semi-
 transparent white glass, crystallised at its surface into a kind
 of dendrites.
      Six ounces       of verifiable phosphoric acid salt, dried into a
 soft paste,       required four ounces of fixed alkali of tartar to be
     '* Calcareous     earth differs   froir. that of bones in being composed of
 acitlum pingue and an excels of animal earth.                Calcination reduces it to
 lime : b-jt this is nnt the cafe with the earth of bones, which is a phos
 phoric   salt  with  excess   of animal earth.      The    name of piyjpbat   of time,
 £ivcn to the earth of bones, is consequently improper.

  The leys, when evaporated, produced three ounces five
drams of phosphoric tartar. This salt, when exposed to heat
in a crucible, liquefies, swells up, and becomes fused. If it
be poured on a plate                     of iron, it      has the transparency                     of glass

loses    by   fusion three-eighths      of its water of crystallisation.
   Ip  the decomposition of the verifiable phosphoric acid salt
by  fixed alkali, more than half of the alkali is decomposed;
fince there are obtained no more than three ounces fivedramj

small.       This acidum pingue combines with the animal earth,
and constitutes               calcareous         earth, which

¦wards,   in the examination of other minerals, that our ope*
rations should be multiplied.         As this occasions a great con>.
sumption of time, it may at length happen that the chemist,
in the whole course of his life, especially as human life is so
short in general,      would not be able to examine, with the re
quisite accuracy and patience, but a very small number of
minerals. The worst consequence of this would undoubtedly
be, that our progress in the study of nature would be much
 retarded.
    This inconvenievee, however, might          be remedied,     if che
mists in their researches would endeavour          to shorten and sim
plify   their operations     as  much   as possible ;  and, when they
discover easier and sliorter processes, if they would make them
known in a chemical journal, which might be entitled, Col
lections towards facilitating Chemical Decompositions. After
this short digression, I shall now proceed to the main object
of this paper, which, I hope, will be considered a contribu
tion towards     a  work of the above kind, not unimportant, and
 which may be thought worthy of some attention.
    It is well known that most fossils, particularly those of the
earthy or siliceous kind, to he rendered soluble by acids, and
 consequently     fit for being analysed,      require a preparation
with fixed alkalies ; an operation which is called resolution.
    It has hitherto been believed that       this resolution could be
 effected   only by reducing the fossil to an exceedingly fine
powder, mixing it with alkaline salts, and then keeping it
 for several hours in a (late of ignition.        Formerly, the alka
line carbonats were made choice of for this purpose, till pro
 testor Kiaproth, some years ago, showed that the pure or
 c&ustic alkalies were preferable.        This meritorious chemist,
 who has contributed lo much to the improvement of our
 chemical knowledge, recommends that the fossil, finely
 p. miided, should be first boiled to dryness with caustic alkali,
 aud   that   the dry mass should then be kept at a red heat for
 several hours in a      silver crucible,  taking care, however, not
 to melt the crucible.         This method has hitherto been con
 sidered,   both   by   myself and by other chemists,        as the best,
 and on that account has been followed.
                                                                     Tor

               Process   for resolving Minerals ly Alkalies.                      249
     For some time past, however, this method of keeping the
mass    in a state of ignition has appeared to me objectionable;
and for the following         reasons    :
     ist, It
           happens not unfrequently that the mass itself is
really fused, by which means the softening it afterwards by
water is rendered much more difficu't.
  2d, By the least accident in regard to the proper manage
ment of the fire, there will be great danger of the crucible
itself being fused.
   3d, If the chemist, by pursuing the above process, dis
covers in any fossil a new earth or metal, it is often objected
to him by other chemists, that the Abject of his supposed dis
covery may be, nothing  else than a product of some peculiar
modifications of the component parts of the fossil subjected to
examination, effected by the action of caloric.
  4th, As it is an acknowledged truth, established from a
comparative view, that the wet way deserves, in many re
spects,    to be preferred      to the dry way, it must                   be    highly
unpleasant on all occasions, especially in the commencement
of the analysis of a mineral body, to be obliged to proceed
in   the dry way.
     On this account,       therefore,       I   resolved to make some expe
riments on the resolution          of    fossils in the wet way            j   and the
result    exceededmy expectation                 ; as   I   was    able   to perform
this operation (which hitherto, on account of the strong sire
requisite for the purpose, was obliged to be performed  in a
laboratory, or, at least, under a chimney,) not only by the
help of the weak flame of a very simple spirit-of-wine lamp,
but alfo in a more convenient, more perfect, and much more
certain manner than ever was effected in the dry way.
   My whole apparatus for this purpose, and which may be
carried in the pocket, is as follows :
   ist, A small cylindric furnace for placing the lamp in,
four inches high and three in diameter, made of tin-plate,
furnished with a door, and with draught-holes at the upper
edge.   The cover, which fits closely to    has  round hole  it,      a
in                    of admitting the crucible. This hole,
     the middle capable
loprevent      crucible
                 the     from falling through, must have                              a
small rim bent inwards.

250              Process     for resolving Minerals               by Alkalies.
     ad,     A   small lamp capable                 of containing       one    ounce      and a
half of spirit of wine, furnished with                         a cover,    a pair       of small
tongs, and cotton to serve as wicks.
   3d, A crucible capable of containing from two and a half
to three ounces of fluid, together with a small spatula for stir
ring round the matter, both of the finest silver.
   The process of resolution is performed in the following
manner : — Put the fossil, reduced to a very fine powder, into
the crucible, and mix it with the usual quantity of caustic
alkali dissolved in distilled water; then light the lamp and
boil the whole, taking care to stir it often round. As soon a3
the mass is dry, pour hot [distilled] water over it; then boil
it   to dryness again            ;    and repeat       this process, mould the re
fractory nature of the fossil                      require    for two or three times
                                                            it,
more, still adding    like quantity of warm water.
                                 a
   If large tough bubbles arise during the process of boiling,
it   is   in
        general   sign that the operation will be attended with
                            a
a    good result.
 I   found the experiment succeed in this manner with                                         se
veral of the hardest kind of fossils such, for example, as the

Siberian beryl, quartz, feld-fpar, the topaz, and even the
sapphire: the last, however, was the most refractory but                             ;         it
was equally       the dry way, of which
                       so   in              have had an op          I
portunity of being fully convinced.
   Argillaceous earth, and also the metallic oxyds, for ex
ample those of titanium, tin, iron, &.c. (which, as        well                          is
Tcnown, lose their property of being dissolved in acids, either
by too strong drying, or     too high    degree of oxydation),
                                             by               a
by this        easy    treatment,           in   the wet way, with            caustic    alkali,
may be rendered                  again soluble,          in   the     course    of   five mi
nutes, merely               by       once    boiling    them      to dryness     ;   an essect
which,         it    was formerly believed,              could not be produced                but
 by   bringing them to                a   sta'.c   of ignition with alkalies.
     The chief         advantages           of this new method of          resolving      fossils
in    the wet way, ave briefly as follow                      :
      1st,     The whole operation may                        be performed           with the
greatest cafe and convenience on                        a     table   in   any apartment,
even while reading                   a   book.

ticular which relate to the frequent change of colour, may be
observed with the utmost, accuracy.
    3d, The operator       has it perfectly in his power, when the
fossil operated upon is highly refractory, to promote the pro
cess  by the immediate addition of more caustic ley or water,
without the least interruption, but which cannot be done in
the dry way without great loss of time.
    4th, By this method the operator, if he finds a new earth
or metal, obviates entirely the suspicion of its arising merely
from some modification, or unmasking of component parts
already known, effected by the strong heat.
   ,5th, In   the dry way,     the operation often     requires   three,
and even four hours ; but by the proposed wet way               it may
be effected, with much more certainty than before,               in one
hour and    a  half  at most.
    6th, The disagreeable circumstance, attended with many
difficulties, of the solution of the fossil subjected to the opera
tion forming     a  kind of jelly with the acid, is entirely obvi
ated by my method ; at least, as I have hitherto experienced
in all my trials,                                                         ,
    7th, The silver crucible besides, being free from the danger
of melting,    as was   formerly to be apprehended,       sustains very
little damage by being used,

by the help of heat, from which                                          it    is   precipitated       by   acids;

    5th, Magnejia.          It unites with all the acids, and forms
with them salts exceedingly soluble and bitter : it is not pre
cipitated from its solutions by carbonat of potash completely
saturated with carbonic acid, and ammonia precipitates it
onlv in part    : it is not at all soluble        in caustic alkalies, and
it has a great affinity for alumine. When pure it is of a white
colour, is exceedingly light, has no taste, and is insoluble in
water.
    6th, Lime.      It combines with         acids, and forms     with them
salts sometimes      soluble     and sometimes       insoluble  : it does not
dissolve in alkalies      :  it dissolves in water     : its solution is ren
dered turbid by the carbonic acid, but not at all              so by the sul
phuric    acid.    It   is not     precipitated     from its solutions      by
ammonia,      and    it  precipitates    all the preceding earths.          In
its state of purity it has an acrid caustic taste, becomes hot
with water, and a solution of it in that fluid does not crys
tallise.
    7th, Strontian.         It readily combines with acids, and with
the sulphuric acid forms a salt very little soluble : it dissolves
very abundantly in warm water, and its solution crystallises
on cooling in very beautiful crystals, which form groupes al
most like those of sal-ammoniac.               The sulphat of lime pro
 duces a precipitate        in  a solution   of it :  its combination    with
 the muriatic acid dissolved in alcohol burns with a purplish
 flame. This earth has an acrid taste, and with water be
 comes strongly heated.
     8th, Barytes. This earth has many properties common with
 strontian, from which it cannot easily be distinguished but by
its being more soluble in cold water and by its combination
 with the muriatic acid, being only a little soluble in alcohol,
 to the flame of which it does not communicate a purplisti
 colour: it   crystallises     from its solution on cooling.            It has
 an   acrid taste, becomes         hot with water, forms an insoluble
 salt with the sulphuric acid, and decomposes                the alkaline sul-
 phats and carbonats as strontian does, but with phenomena
 which to those not much habituated to chemical labours
 jhffer by imperceptible shades.

    We      have therefore    seven mineral        substances from  which
fixed alkalies have been extracted,           viz.
    1st,    The alummite of Tolsa, according               to Monnet and
Bergmann, contains potash.
    2d, The siliceous deposits of Geyser contain soda, according
to Black.
    3d, The leucite, according to Klaproth, contains potash.
   4th, The lepidolite, according to Vauquelin and Klap
roth, contains potash.
    5th, Green feld-spar, according to Vauquelin, contains
potasli   .
    6th, Pumice stone contains potash, according to Kennedy.
    7 th, Lava and basaltcs contain soda, according to Ken
nedy •.
    It   has    been   proposed,    therefore, to make of the stones
which contain alkalies,         a  genus under the name of the       alia-
liferous.

   Poiret has made known           a   kind of fossil wood, which he
found near    Laon.       The inside of this wood was covered with
a stony substance     exceedingly hard, siliceous, and deposited in
laminae   ;  but the external strata, those which appear to have
belonged to the /iW,and even to the aubier, appeared in long,
capillary, brittle filaments, which, when struck by the contact
of the air, assumed the form of woolly flakes.                       They were
interwoven     in the fame reticulated form               as  that which they
affect in the living timber.         In   the last place, the part which
constituted    the   epidermis had become             a very sine     black car
bonaceous powder, which stained the singers, and had all the
charadters of charcoal.
   Pontier has sent to the school              of mines       at Paris,    a new
mineral substance        found a la Bajlide de la Carrade, near
Caffin, in the department of the Var.                  It is of a dark brown
colour almost like that of brown blend, and has metallic
splendour:     its specific    gravity is 4-0326.              It is difficult lo
be fused by the blowpipe.           The glass it produces is of a dirty
greenish    colour.     Tassaert    has analysed this substance, an$l

258                     Cursory   View of some os        the
   Lelievrc has described         a  mine of uranite discovered in the
department of Saone and Loire.
   The perljhhi of Werner (pearl-stone)                is found in alternate
strata with argillaceous porphyry,             resting     on   trapp, on the
road between         Tokai    and    Kerestour.      This     is what    Fichtel
calls volcanic zeolite.        This    substance    is  of   a tarnistied   blue
colour, has       a   resinous    fracture and      a    pearl v appearance.
The interior of it is formed by the union of several small
grains of black obsidian stone inclining to blue, each fur-'
rounded by a pearlv pellicle of that substance.                     It is trans-
lucid, fragile, aud pretty light.              Its gravity, according to
Haiiy, is 2-540.
   Launoi has brought from Carboneira, in Spain, a sub
stance analogous to the above, which, in imitation of the
Germans, he calls lucbs-sapbir.
   Werner is of opinion that this stone is not volcanic;                      he
places it between         the quartz and the hornstein : the horn-
stein  is   a  kind of substance which the French, in imitation
of  the Swedes,      call fetro-siiex.
   Humbohlt is of opinion that the pumice                       stone found on
the peak of Teneriffe is only obsidian stone                   decomposed     by
fire.    According        to  this naturalist,      its   origin    cannot be
ascribed    to feld-spar.      He    collected  a great many fragments,
which     were     half obsidian and half fibrous pumice stone :
they were of a black olive colour,              lie saw specimens of the
like kind in the cabinets of Madrid.
   Fortis     savs  that the Venetian ships biing from the island
of Candin,       as   ballast, a kind of stones among which are
observed large blocks         of black glass, or obsidian, exceedingly
pure, without any         mixture of foreign bodies, which are vi
sibly changed into white pumice stone by a gradual transi
tion, so that there are some fragments part of which is ob
sidian and part pumice stone.
   The    fame thing is observed in the pure obsidian                osLipari,
and the island of Procida near Naples.

    6th, The Dutch red precipitate or red oxyd of mercury
gave him nearly a third of minium or red oxyd of lead.
    7th, He considers calcareous earth as a combination of
 lime with acidum phiguc, as Meyer had asserted before. The
alkali, rendered caustic by lime, contains, according to him,
a sixth part of acidum pingue.                A hundred grains of this
 acid, saturated with the phlogiston of charcoal, produce T20
 cubic inches of inflammable              air.     Schecle also extracted
 inflammable air from caustic alkali.
    8th, He has examined           a  kind of argil near Mans, which

    9th, In examining what took              place   when the Odeon was
 burnt,    he has sliown, that in all conflagrations there is dis
 engaged     a  great deal of inflammable air which         sills the build
 ing on sire. This air does not inflame as long as it is kept
 from coming into contact with the external air, but as soon
 as the l.-.tter penetrates   to the interior      of the building    the in
 flammation becomes general ;             which     makes people     errone
 ously conclude that the building has caught fire in different
 places.      lie found on this occasion a great deal of lulphur,
 which he considers as a product of the decomposition ot the
 plaster.

    Horses may be employed to knead Paste         for   baking Bread.
  X    HIS     machine     might be useful in armies and in the
hospitals of Jarge cities, as it would produce a great saving in
regard to the number of hands employed.                    Two horses,
going round in a circle, give' motion to a kind of pestles,
which, by their action, continually knead the paste.
    Fig. i. (Plate VII.) represents a plan of the tub which
cpntains the paste. This tub, which is six feet in diameter
in the inside, consists of thirty-eight staves, and rests on a
wooden frame in the form of a cross, the extremities of
which     are seen   at   A,B, C,D. (Fig. i.)       The bottom of the
tub is formed of strong planks, the        structure of which will be
seen in the next figure.
     Fig. a. represents a transverse section        of  the tub passing
 through     the centre ;   E,  the edge  of  the staves thicker at the
 bottom than the top, and funk into the lower cross, F.
 G, G, G, shows three iron hoops for binding together the
 staves.     The bottom, H, supports the wooden cylinder, I,
 which is in the centre of the tub, fixed in its place by three
 iron bolts similar to that marked       K,   and separated from each
 other   as   expressed by the points    L, Fig.   3.
     M,   an iron    arbor of the form of an inverted cone, the
 lower point of which       rests  on the brass bed, N, and is kept
 perpendicular by a        brass collar funk into the upper end of
 the wooden cylinder,         having the form indicated in Fig. 3,
 with its three ears, made fast by the screws P, P,P.
     This brass collar is covered with a thin plate of iron
 marked Q, which receives the heads of the large bolts, K,
  which    also pass through a similar plate, R, in the bottom of
  the tub, H : the bottom plate receives the nuts of the bolts.
     S, Fig. 2, is the upper cross, which turns, fixed to the
  iron arbor, M, and to which are suspended the four wooden
  pestles, two of which are visible in this section at T and V,
  and of which the relative positions are indicated by       X, X, X, X,

   Z, two arms,       each twelve feet in length,      to the extremity
of which      are suspended the apparatus      to which     the   harness
for the horses is attached.

from which        the   parts  were  detached    in the explanation of
Fig.  2, is drawn on a      scale double to that of the other figures
to render it more distinct.

seen, by the punctured circular segments,            the path described
by the      kneaders   in their revolution,     the external    angles   of
which      are covered by each other about eight lines, in order
that, succeeding each other in their circular progress, they
may each take up a small portion of the paste which the pre
ceding has kneaded.

scenes    of   the   most  remarkable events        of antient history*
brings     us to    a  knowledge    of  many    circumstances  of those
events which we should not have been otherwise              able to dis
cover.      Facts the most important in the physical history of
the globe are to be learned by a comparison, which without
some skill     in antient geography would be impossible, of the
antient with the modern appearance of all that is most
striking on its surface.         Dates of time are not to be under
stood unless they be connected with those of place, which
it is the object of geography to ascertain.            Astronomy, na
tural history, natural philosophy, geometry, navigation, and
all the principal arts of civil life, are, in truth, intimately
related to the science of geography, either as supplying its
facts and principles,       or  as  deriving their best lights from it.
 A certain discovery of the scenes of ancient history may even
seem, to a keen and perspicacious mind, to annihilate the ages
 that have intervened, and to give us all the privileges of con
 temporaries of those earlier races of men whose progress in
 civility  we delight to contemplate.         But for   a  knowledge of
 their geography, more         than half the information which we
 find in the writings of the autients would be lost to us.
     Yet there is nothing more difficult in science or erudition
 than to acquire a thorough knowledge of the facts of antient,
 in clear satisfactory comparison with those of modem, geo
 graphy.       The notions of the antient* respecting the figure of
 the earth, and its relations to the heavenly bodies,          were not,
 even    after  the   time of Hipparchus, such as to afford that
 accuracy in the divisions of latitude and longitude without
 which local distances can never be very distinctly recorded.
 Their    measures     of distance   were   various and unfixed;     and
 they trusted often, without actual measurement,            to uncertain
 computation.         The names which they apply to places vary
 or agree in different writings, with a very troublesome irre
 gularity.      And the changes which have taken place on the
 face  of  the globe since our favourite antients wrote, have been
  so very   considerable, that these, above every thing else, render
  all the parts    of antient geography in the utmost degree diffi
 cult   and obscure.
     We     have   accustomed     ourselves,  therefore, to respect the
                                                                 labour*

as  highly beneficial alike to learning and to science.               We
have been pleased with the researches of Saint Croix and of
Vincent.      We    are grateful for the      instruction     which   Mr.
Rennell has already given concerning the antient geography
of India. And we open, with eager curiosity and respect,
this new volume, in which he attempts to illustrate the geo
graphy of the father of profane history.
   This, it seems, is but a part of a great work on antient
geography, upon which         Mr. Rennell's      leisure   has been     for
several years employed.        We doubt not but the favourable
reception of the present       volume will encourage him to give
the remainder of his labours on this plan, with            as little delay-
as possible, to the public.
   He begins with some prefatory matter on the general cha
racter of Herodotus as a geographer and historian : that
Herodotus meant to produce in his work an universal his
tory : that he visited in person as wide a range as possible of
the inhabited world, and, in regard to what he could not per
sonally visit, used the utmost diligence of inquiry : that his
work faithfully represents the best truth of history which
could in that age be known : that it was the ignorance alone
of  the  Romans which        led them to impeach           his veracity :
that modern investigations have tended continually to vindi
cate, even in minute particulars, the truth of his narrative;
are the chief facts which Mr. Rennell here states.
   The length of     the Grecian stadium, and especially           of that
of Herodotus, next engages the researches of Mr. Rennell.
He ascertains the length of the stadium employed by Hero
dotus in his statements of distance, to have been the 7Tr part
of a geographical degree; that of Xenophon, j\b; that of
Eratosthenes, Tg-0 ; that of Strabo, the fame; that of Pliny,
7i7 ; that of Nearchus, 7~vand }; the mean stadium of the
antients, T4F, or 505^- English feet.          The pace, in the mea
surements   of the   antients,  he justly states   at live feet.
   Herodotus's geography of luirope is next examined in the
progress of this work.       The Mediterranean Sea, and its Eu
ropean   coast?,   were   evidently well known to this historian.
He knew      a little, and but a little, of the western stiores of
                                                                  Europe.

Europe.      With the extent and subdivisions of the southern
countries on the Danube, he appears to have been well ac
quainted. His Scythia is the Western Sarmatia of some later
writers among the antients, the Ukraine of modern geo
graphy.     But his notion of the form of this country was in
correct,   as he supposed it to be one-half less than it really
"was.   Mr. Rennell pursues his examination further, through
the countries which Herodotus has described as bordering on
Western Scythia ; remarks, after Gibbon, that the Genoese
constructed those fortifications of the Crimea, whose origin
has been by some referred to earlier times ; traces the course
of the famous expedition     of Darius into Western     Scythia ;
attends Herodotus into the countries beyond      the Euxine sea;
describes    the Hyperboreans of the Romans as being the
fame with the Gog and Magog of the Scriptures, the Juje
Majuje of the present Orientals; and takes occasion to men
tion Herodotus,     Pythagoras, Anacharsis, Peter Alexiowitz,
and Sir Joseph Banks, as the only men who have splendidly
distinguished themselves by dangerous, ardent, and successful
travels  in pursuit of knowledge.
   The Asia of Herodotus comes next under Mr. Rennell's
examination.      Its west and south-west boundaries were the
shores of the Arabian gulph, and of the Mediterranean and
Euxine seas : its eastern limits were the country of the Oi-
gurs, the desert of Kobi, and India taken inclusively: on
the south, its only boundary known to Herodotus was the
Erythrean sea. The north of Asia was to him unknown. He
had little knowledge of India.     And the length of Asia east
ward was less known to Herodotus than to some later geo
graphers among the antients. With the bounds and extent
of the Caspian sea he was better acquainted than the fol
lowers of Alexander.      He knew it    to be a lake ; they sup
posed it to     communicate with the     great  northern ocean.
China, Chinese      and  Western Tartary,   Thibet, the penin
sula beyond the Ganges, and the greater part of Siberia,
were entirely unknown to Herodotus.            To him and the
other Greeks of his time Eastern Scythia was little known.
The Massagetæ, the Sacæ, and the Dahœ, were the great
Scythian tribes.     He has described the geography

Persian empire as divided into twenty governments. Mr.
Rennell examines, in minute detail, his account of each of
these.     The maritime strength of the Phœnicians under the
Persian power is well marked by the fact which Mr. Ren
nell notices, that they furnished to the fleet of Xerxes 450
triremes, of which 150 were derived from their establish
ment in the island of Cyprus.         Of the Ganges it appears-
that Herodotus had never even heard.          The public  revenue
of   the   Persian  empire was, according to his account, about
3f   millions sterling.    The site of antient Babylon, as Mr.
Rennell informs us upon good authority, is still sufficiently
accessible, and is covered with ruins which it might be
highly interesting to examine.
    Africa was best known to Herodotus where it is adjacent
to the middle and the eastern limits of the Mediterranean
sea.     Of its great rivers, he knew only the Niger and the
Nile.     He knew those oases, or insulated fertile spots in the
sandy desert, which have been lately re-discovered by Brown.
He knew that Africa had been circumnavigated. The voy
age was performed        at the rate of thirty-two geographical
miles a day, and finished in the space of two years.           The
whole tract of the earth known to Herodotus might        be   mea
sured by a radius of 1000 British miles, moving from the
centre of Halicarnassus.      The Seewa of Brown the traveller
 is the Oasis of Ammon of Herodotus.           Of the lotos there
were two species ; the one an aquatic plant, the other a dry
shrub. The aquatic lotos was the fame as the colocjjia, and
is still abundant in Egypt.      After finishing his discussion of
 the geography of Herodotus, Mr. Rennell enters into an in
 teresting illustration of the memoir of the voyage of Hanno.
 His work is accompanied with excellent maps, constructed
 upon those principles and views which he explains in it.
 Under every leading head of his work, Mr. Rennell descends
 into much minuteness and accuracy of detail. It is inter
 spersed with various pleasing digressions ; and many curious
 articles of collateral information are incidentally thrown out
 in it.
     Such are in general the plan, the execution, and the lead
 ing facts of this work.     It were easy to dispute some of its

   -L H E Royal Academy of Sciences         at Berlin  has proposed
the following prize questions for 1800,      1801, and 1802.
    The Mathematical     Class has continued for the year 1802,
with   a double prize, the following question :
    "  Since, notwithstanding the labours of the ablest astro
nomers, there still remain several points respecting the va
riation of the obliquity of the ecliptic to be cleared up, the
Academy invites the learned to occupy themselves again on
this important object, and will adjudge a prize to that memoir
which (hall contain    the  most   interesting researches and the
best illustrations respecting  this important point."
    The Class of Speculative Philosophy proposed the follow
ing   question for the year 1799 :

agitated    at all times, has been discussed at present           with more
interest   than ever.       It   is certainly   of great importance; and
it  is much to be wished            that the proofs on both sides were
carried to such      a degree      of perfection,    and rendered     so satis
factory, as to enable          philosophers to form a decisive opinion
on this point without falling into            syncretism, which, by sub
stituting   indifference      for  interest, is  highly detrimental to the
progress of philosophy.              The Academy does not enter into
the ideas of those who consider it            as demonstrated     by mathe
matical evidence,        that a part of our knowledge has its origin
merely in     the nature      of our understanding : on the contrary,
it  is persuaded     that to this opinion essential objections may
be made ; objections which hitherto have not been answered
in a satisfactory manner; especially as it is convinced that
there    are very     strong proofs in favour        of  the opinion which
deduces      all our knowledge from experience, though these
proofs, perhaps, have not yet been displayed in their full light.
The Academy, being desirous to contribute as much as pos
sible to the solution        of this problem, proposes as the subject
for which the      Class of Philosophy ought to adjudge a prize :
     "  To  demonstrate,        in an incontestable manner, the origin
of all our knowledge; either by presenting arguments never
before employed, or arguments already employed, but exhi
bited with more clearness,             and with such force as to obviate
every objection."
     But  as none      of  the memoirs transmitted          to the Academy
have     been    thought       satisfactory,    the  Academy      finds   itself
obliged to defer the adjudication of the prize till the public
fitting of the month of August 1801.                 It repeats at the fame
time its invitation to philosophers to contribute as much as
in   th#ir power towards fixing the important point               of the ori
gin of human knowledge, by going back                   to the evidence,     in
order that the result may be, either that the science of meta
physics is a chimera, or that its principles are so determined
that we cannot refuse to them universality, and such a com
parative force of evidence, that there can no longer be room
for disputing respecting principles ; and that all deviations
must be considered merely as logical errors, of too little con
sequence to promote a rage for systems and the spirit                of party.
                                                                           The

    The Physical        Class    has proposed    for the year   i8ci   tho
following question        :
    "  Has electricity any action on matters which ferment?
And in that cafe, What is its action ? Is it favourable to fer
mentation, or docs it prevent it ? What advantages may be
derived from an illustration of this point, iu regard to im
proving the art of making wines, of brewing, and oi distilling
spirits?"
    The learned of all countries, the ordinary members of the
Academy excepted,             are invited to exert their talents on these
questions.        The prizes      are, a gold medal, equal in weight to
fifty ducats,       for  the    philosophical question ; two medals for
 the mathematical, and a hundred crowns for the question in
 physics.      The papers, written in a legible hand, must be
 transmitted, with the usual formalities, to the perpetual se
 cretary of the Academy, before the first of May of the years
 above mentioned.

    On    the    24th of May last this Society held their annual
 meeting, which the director opened by giving an account of
 the answers transmitted to the prize questions to be answered
 before    the   first  of November 1799;         the result of which  was
 as follows    :
     On  the question       respecting   the utility  and  manner of em
 ploying ventilators in ships, two papers were transmitted,
 written in Dutch, one of which obtained a golden medal.
 The    successful      candidate was      L.  Bicker,  M. D. director of
 the Society      of Experimental Philosophy at Rotterdam.
     On   the    other   questions, respecting the improvement of
 downs, or sandy and dry land, two papers were received with*
 out any devices.          It  was resolved,   therefore, that no further
 notice stiould be taken of them j and that the questions should
 jiot  be repealed.
     The    three    remaining questions       to which no answers     had
  been sent, havebeen again proposed in the following             manner;
     " I. What is the present state of our knowledge in. regard
  to the motion       of the sap in trees and plants ? In what man
  ner pan a more complete knowledge be obtained of what is

quences useful for the cultivation of trees and plants be de
duced from what has been already confirmed on this subject
by decisive experiments ?
   " II. As it is probable, if more attention were paid to
those physical causes which force back smoke into chimneys,
that means           might        be devised    to prevent apartments from

   " III.         What indigenous plants, hitherto not                 used, are ca
pable, according to well-attested experiments, of producing
good dye stuffs, and might be employed with advantage for
that purpose      and, What foreign plants might be reared in
                    ?
the least fruitful and little cultivated parts of the republic, in
order to procure dyes from them ?"
   The       answers       to these three questions         must be transmitted
to the Society before the first               of November      1801.
   For      the present year, the Society has proposed                  the follow
ing     questions    :
   "    I.   What         can we consider           as proved, or as    highly   prp-r
babie, according to the latest astronomical observations, par
ticularly those of Herschel and Schroter, in regard to the
extent      of    the universe,       and    the order    in which   the heavenly
bodies stand         ?"
   In the         answers    to this question,          the Society requires that
the authors will give      short  a           and
                                     comprehensive   view of the
present state of astronomy in regard to this point     and show        ;
how improbable     or ill founded some of the hypotheses formed
on this subject are.

provements in the physiology of plants, in what manner the
different kinds of earth promote the vegetation of plants                            ?

and, What consequences can be deduced from our knowledge
on this subject in regard to the choice of manure, and the

     "
     III. Is the study of natural history of                       so   much import
ance to youth that it deserves to be considered                          as an essential
part of a well regulated education ? And if this be the cafe,
what part of this science deserves the preference ? and what
is the properest method of exciting young persons to study                               it,
and of making             it   as useful to   them     as possible      ?
     " IV.      As   it   appears, from the experiments                 of Dr. Chladni,
that, when           a    plate   of metal or         glass has been strewed over
with light          sand or dust,      ifa violin bow be rubbed against                   it
so   as to     produce     a   tone, the sand assumes various figures the           ;

tones."
     The     answers to the three first questions must be transmitted
to the    Society before the first of November 1801                             ;   that to
 the last, before the first of November 180a.
   The following questions proposed last year, to be answered
before the first of November 1800, remain to be answered                                 :
   " What light has been thrown
         I.                               the new chemistryby
on the physiology of the human body                       ?
   " II. How far has the light thrown      the new chemistry  by
on the physiology of the human body contributed to make
us better acquainted with the nature and causes of certain
diseases   and, What useful consequences, more or less con
               ?
 firmed        by   experience,      can be thence deduced for the practice
 of medicine         ?
     " III.         How far     has the new chemistry served to give us
 more accurate              ideas of the efficacy of external or internal
 medicines long used or recently recommended and of what                    ?
 advantage may    more accurate knowledge in this subject be
                           a
 in the treatment of certain diseases ?"
                                                                                         As

Vj%                  Batavian   Society at Haarlem.
     As                    in applying the principles of the
          most philosophers,
new chemistry to the physiology of the human body, to pa
thology, and therapeutics, have introduced hypotheses built
on too weak a foundation ; and as this               is,
                                                no doubt, preju
dicial to the progress of these sciences, to which the new che
mistry promises      much improvement;
                      so                             if,
                                               according to the
Tule of Lavoisier, we admit in chemistry, or in the applica
tion of its principle, those things only which are supported by
decisive experiments; the Society wishes that those inclined
to answer these questions        will accurately distinguish what             is
actually known, from what            is
                                    merely hypothetical   and that,
                                                                ;
in   regard to hypotheses,      they do confine themselves merely
to pointing them out, and to showing, in   brief manner, the
                                                     a
weakness of the grounds on which they rest   as the principal
                                                       ;
object of these questions   to procure to the physicians and
                                is
surgeons of the Batavian republic, who have not sufficiently
attended to the application of the principles of this science,
already well confirmed, to physiology, pathology, and thera
peutics, appropriate treatises, from which they may easily be
enabled to know what Hght the modern chemistry has really
diffused on this branch of knowledge     and what
                                                ;      too ill      is
founded, too hastily adopted, or too doubtful to be depended
on.       The   papers on these questions     will   be examined sepa
rately.  Those inclined to answer more than one of them are
requested to write distinct papers on each question.
  The following questions, first proposed in 1794, and after
wards repeated in 1796, are also still to be answered               :
  " IV. A proper plan, founded on facts, and capable of
being carried into execution, for improving and cultivating
the waste lands, whether sands, morasses, or heaths, within
the republic, and particularly in the districts of Guelderland,
Overyffel, Drenthe, and Dutch Brabant.
   " V. What arc the different breeds of sheep in the United
Provinces, and the different methods of- breeding them                        ?
The Society       wishes   also to be informed       of    their size, their
usual weight, the measure and weight of their different limbs,
the length and fineness of the wool, the number of lambs
which they annually produce               : whether the several joints,
which Daubenton observed in               some breeds, arc to be con
                                                                         sidered

                       Batavian    Society at Haarlem.                    373
   sidered as peculiar to one breed,      or merely   as a lupus  natura ;
   and whether, among all these breeds, there is one which ori
   ginally belongs to Holland ?"
      The following question, first proposed in 1796, and repeated
   in 1799, is extended to the first of November 1802 :
      " A natural history and physical description of the whale,
   which may      serve  to explain and point out the best means for
   discovering the      places  where these animals are to be found,
   as well as the easiest and surest means either known and used,
  or  that   can be employed, for immediately         killing them,      and
   of getting     possession   of them in      the  speediest   and    safest
   manner?'*
      The following questions,       the  first proposed    in 1790, the
  second in 1794,       the third and    fourth in 1795,     are still con
  tinued for an unlimited period :
      " I. What have the latest chemical discoveries taught con
  cerning the nature of fermentation ? and what advantage can
  be derived from this knowledge in regard to certain manu
  factures in which fermenting substances are employed ?
      " II.   What have we been taught by experience in regard
  to the   utility of certain animals, particularly in the Nether
  lands, which,      according to appearance,      are destructive   ?  and
  •what means      must be employed to extirpate      them    ?
     " III.    What indigenous plants, the virtues of which              are
 as yet very little known,        might be used with advantage in
 our materia media, and be substituted for foreign plants ?"
     The papers which the Society expects on this question,
 must contain proofs of the virtue and advantages of these in
 digenous plants, not merely from the testimony of foreigners,
 but from experiments and observations made originally in
 these provinces.
     " IV. What      indigenous plants, not yet used, might be em
 ployed    as good and      wholesome nourishment ? and what nu
 tritive foreign plants might be cultivated in the United Pro
 vinces ?"
    The Society requests that the competitors will compress
their papers as much as possible, and omit every thing that
Joes not essentially relate to the question. All the members
    Vol. VII.                         Nb                                 «f

of   the Society are at liberty to be candidates,                         on condition
that their papers are distinguished                  by some device, and marked
with the letter L.
  The papers may be written either in Dutch, French,
Latin, dr German, and must be accompanied with a sealed
note containing the name and address of the author. They
must all be transmitted to Van Marum, secretary to the
Society.
     The prize for        the best answer to any              of   the above questions
is a gold medal, with the usual impression of the Society,
containing on the edge the name of the author, and the year
in which he obtained the prize                   ; or, in lieu     of   it,   at the option
of the author, thirty ducats.                        Those, however, who obtain
the prize, or an acessit, shall not, without the express per
mission of the Society, publish their papers, either whole or
in part, in the Transactions of the Society, nor in any other
work, or separately            by
                         themselves.
    The Society takes this opportunity of repeating, that they
resolved, in their sitting of 1798, to examine, in every annual
fitting, whether, among the papers communicated in the
course of the year, and not answers to questions proposed,
there are any respecting  natural history or natural philosophy
which             particular reward; and, when this
            deserve    a                                     the                     is

                            ACADEMY              OF LYONS.
     C. Verniac, the prefect of the department of the Rhone,
and    C. Noel, commissioner-general of the police at Lyons,
in conjunction with some members of the antient Academy
of Lyons, have revived that valuable institution under the
title of the Atheneum.   The number of the members of
which      it   is   to consist     has been          fixed
                                                    among     at forty-five      ;
 whom are comprehended those who made      part of the old          a
 academy, and who now are reduced to sixteen.   The Athe
neum       will      have    also     fifteen    associates,        and an unlimited
number of correspondents.                       It   is   divided into two classes         ;
                                                                                          one

 lettres and fine arts.         The first public sitting was held on the
 8th of August.
    The Atheneum has already proposed the following ques
 tions as the subjects of a prize :
    " I. To point out those indigenous mineral and vegetable
 substances which may be capable of producing a colouring
 principle       applicable to silk, cotton, linen,          hemp, woollen,
 and paper,
    " II.      To explain the processes for extracting, fixing, and
 brightening the colours which may be furnished by simple
indigenous substances not yet known in the art of dyeing."
    The prize will be adjudged in the public fitting of Mes-
 sidor   S4th, year 9. (July 14th, 1800.)                 It consists of two
 medals     of the value of 300 francs each. The ordinary mem
 bers   of  the Atheneum         are excluded      from the competition.
           MISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES.
 HUM     BO    LOT'S TRAVELS THROUGH SPANISH AMERICA.
    The following         letter from     this enterprising philosopher to
 Fourcroy        has lately     been    published in one of the French
journals      :
                                                 "  Guyara, January 15, 1800.
     " As     the yellow fever,      which     desolates this part   of South
 America,        obliges us to make our stay here as short as pos
 sible,   I  snatch this opportunity         of sending you a few lines,
 and repeating, from the middle of the torrid zone, how much
my thoughts are occupied with you and your illustrious col
 leagues,      among whom         I met with such      a flattering reception
 during my last stay at Paris.             Since our departure from Saint
 Croix in Tenerifte, where            I  descended into the crater of the
volcano, the atmospheric air being there at o*8 of R. and
at 0-19 of oxygen, I have written to you twice.                   I have sent
 to  Delambre         and    Lalande     an   extract   of  my   astronomical
 labours    ;   the longitude     of some important places ; an obser
 vation of      the eclipse   on  the   28th of October last; immersions

light of    the austral stars, measured          by means of diaphragms.
I have   addressed to the Institute a chemical                 memoir on the
phosphorescence         of the sea ;   observations on a particular gas
furnished by the fruit of the coffea arabica when exposed to
the sun; on a snow white feld-spar, which, when moistened,
absorbs all the moisture         of  the atmosphere;           experiments on
the milk of the cecropia peltata and the euphorbia curajfa-
vica, which will form a supplement to your excellent memoir
on the cahoutrchouc, and to that of our friend Chaptal ; and
on the air which circulates in vegetables.
   " The cruisers which cover the seas here make me ap
prehend that a part of my letters may not have reached you ;
though     I  sent them sometimes           by way of Guadaloupe, and
sometimes       by that of Spain.        These few lines I have sent by
an American        vessel, which will      sail in a few days for Boston ;
and, though they cannot reach you but through Hamburgh,
they will, perhaps, be less liable to miscarry.                     People here
arc accustomed to make four or five duplicates of their letters.
But how       can   I find time,     when      I   have    so  many things to
observe, arrange, and calculate           ?
   " I    shall   confine myself, therefore, to letting you once
more know         that I still enjoy the best health possible, and
that  I am treated with the utmost kindness by the inhabit
ants  of  these countries      :  that the passports and letters of re
commendation from             the Spanisti government procure me
every facility for making          researches       useful    to the   sciences  :
that none of my instruments, even the most delicate, such as
barometers, thermometers, hygrometers, Bordas' dipping
needle, &c. are deranged : and that, at the extremity of the
missionary establishments           among the Chayma Indians, iri
the mountains of Toumiriquiri,                    I have my laboratory
mounted       as  if  I  were  in  the  Hotel      Boston, in the Rue du
Colombier.         My fellow-traveller, Bonpland,               educated   in the
Jurdin   des    Plantes,   becomes     every day more valuable to me.
To an   extensive knowledge          of botany       and comparative ana
tomy he unites indefatigable            zeal.      I hope one day to re
store him to his country, worthy of attracting public atten-:
tioq.    Never did any foreigner enjoy such permission as that
                                                                         grauted.

         Humboldt's Travels through Sfani/h America.              iff
granted to me by the king of Spain.            This idea alone is ca
pable of exciting us to redouble our activity.            During the
seven months we have been in this beautiful continent, we
have dried (with duplicates) nearly 4000 plants, written
more than 800 descriptions of new species or species little
known, particularly new genera of palms, cryptogamia, bifaria,
melastoma    ;   collected insects     and  shells, and  made   many
drawings respecting the anatomy of marine worms; with,
observations on magnetism, electricity, humidity, the tempe
rature of the atmosphere, and the quantity of oxygen it con
tains.    We    have   measured   that immense and high chain of
mountains extending to the coast of Paria, and examined
their volcanoes, which vomit forth kindled inflammable
air, sulphur, and hydro-sulphurous water.              We have also
collected many feeds, which we shall send off in three or
four weeks     for Europe, addressed to the Jardin des Plantes.
We     have spent five months in the interior of New Anda
lusia and on the coasts      of Paria, where we experienced very
violent earthquakes in the end of last year. One part of these
countries is still inhabited by the savage Indians, and others
have begun to be cultivated only within five or fix years.          In
what words shall      I describe  to you the majesty     of the vege
tation here;      the forests of Ceiba, Hura, Hymenea, which
the rays of the fun never penetrate ; the variety of the ani
mals ; the superb plumage of the birds ; the apes, the tigers j
the hideous aspect of the crocodiles [caimans) which swarm
in the rivers, and of which some are thirty feet in length ?
From Cumana         we proceeded     to Caraccas, where we remain
ed during     the month of November and part of December :
A   charming capital situated in a valley which has 426 toiscs
of elevation;      and, though      in latitude 10° 31', enjoys the
coolness, and      I might fay     the   cold, of Paris ! From this
place we ascended to the summit of the famous Silla de Ca
 raccas, or Sierra de Avila, where, at the height of 13 16
 toifes, we discovered beautiful crystals of titanium.        I found
filso dendrites   similar to  those   of manganese,   which  are oxyd
of titanium.
    We shall    proceed hence for      Varina  and  the snow-covered
 mountains of Merjda, the cataracts           of Rio Nigro,   and the

and Mexico.
    "   We   shall take care to transmit      the seeds we have col
lected for the    Jardin  des Plantes at Paris, the Museum,        and
Sir Joseph Banks, as we agreed with Juffieu - - - -.
    " How much I lament the fate of Dolomieu, detained a
 prisoner in Sicily ! If he should return, communicate to him
the following fact : — It is more than three years since I an
nounced to Lametherie, that, in the primitive mountains of
Italy, France, Swisserland, Poland, and I can now add Spain,
there exists a parallelism of diredion between the strata of
foliaceous granites, slate, micaceous schists, corneous schists :
that these strata incline (sink down) towards the north-west,
and that their direction makes with the axis of the globe an
angle of 45° 57': that this inclination and direction in no
manner depend on the form and direction of the mountains :
that it is not any way affected by the valleys, but that it
announces a cause much greater, and more general : that it
depends on a phenomenon          of attraction which has acted at
the time of the consolidation of the globe. Having travelled
over the greater part of Europe on foot, and with sextants
and compasses, I have a very extensive collection of observa
tions on that subject. My manuscript on the identity of
strata in the construction of the globe, is in the hands of my
brother.      I was employed on it since 1791, but it will not
appear till I have seen more of the globe.           To my great asto
nishment,      I  have observed   in  the   Cordillera  of Paria, New
Andalusia, New Barcelona, and Venzuela, that in the new
world, near the equator,      the strata follow     the same laws and
the fame parallelism.
    *' You remember the last ingenious observations of Cou
lomb on the air which issues with explosion from the trunks
of   trees  when they are pierced. I have made experiments
on the clujea rosca, in which (in the interior of the pneumato-*
chimifer vessels of Hedwig, the vnfa coebleata of Malpighi,)
there circulates an immense quantity of air. This air con
tains   as far as  Tys of oxygen. The leaves of the fame tree,
when exposed to the sun under water, do not give a cubk
                                                            mellimetrc

                              Vaccine     Inoculation.                      %jg
tnellimelre     of air. This air, which circulates, certainly
serves, as in the    animal body, to coagulate the fibrous part
by absorption of oxygen. The clusea is a milky plant, and
clastic gluten is formed in it.
   " Though   the purity of the atmospheric air amounts here,
particularly in the night, to 0*305 of oxygen, I have found
that the air contained in the pods and capsules of equinoctial
plants, for instance the paullinia, is more azotous than our
atmospheric air.    It does not exceed o,34 or 0-25 of oxygen.
The air in the culmi geniculati              here, has only   C15 of oxygen.
All this       proves    that the air which circulates is purer, and
that the air which          is in a state of rest, deposited in the cap
sules or utriculi,   is less pure than atmospheric air. The
 former is recently produced by the organs which decompose
 the water : it proceeds to those parts where it ought to serve,
 by its abundance of oxygen, to precipitate the fibrous prin

                  been informed  by the public journals of the
 trials made in England with regard to the vaccine inoculation,
 the success of which has, in a great measure, been owing to
 your enlightened zeal. Some friends of humanity, and of
 that science which you cultivate in so distinguished a man
 ner, have formed a plan for introducing into France a prac
  tice which seems to promise               advantages   of   so   much magni
  tude.       For this       purpose     they have proposed        a subscription,
  which is now nearly filled up. You will find annexed a

 able to obtain any positive result; the principal cause of
 which, no doubt,            has been, the difficulty      of procuring matter
 sufficiently recent.            Our veterinary doctors            do not seem to
•be
      acquaintedwith this disease among cows. One instance
 onlyhas occurred  where they thought they observed this disease
 among these animals ; and we embraced that opportunity of
 collecting the virus, which was employed, together with mat
 ter received from Geneva and England, but hitherto without
 any certain success.              We find    ourselves,    therefore,         deprived
of    the   chief    means necessary for commencing our                     trials;   and
we address ourselves to you to assist us in procuring them.
      "
    We request, but only in cafe you think these precau
tions necessary, to receive scabs or pustules taken from cows
or from persons who have been inoculated, and threads or
small bits of sponge, impregnated with matter taken from
either;      also,            of
                       these scabs or pustules quite fresh,

local affection of the part inoculated. The different kinds                            of
matter or substances ought to be particularly marked.                                  If
your method of preserving threads in azotic or hydrogen gas
seems to be attended with any advantage,    we expect from
your zeal that you will employ it. In conjunction with our

     The
       above letter, as appears, was addressed to Dr. Pearson,
who,  however, in place of returning an answer in his own
name, presented it to the Vaccine Institution, where it was
determined that the commission should be executed by the
medical establishment.              Accordingly,     a packet           containing
vaccine matter on glass, on lancets, and on thread, inclosed
in a bottle silled with hydrogen gas, and a letter of instruc
tions signed by all the members of the medical establish

permission  of Lord Grenville, through the hands of the

          FRUCTIFICATION OF THE FUCUS NATANS.
     A   small   treatise   has lately been    published at Madrid by
  Hippolitus Ruiz, member of the Royal Medical Society of
  that city and botanist on the expedition to Peru, under the
 title of De vera Fuci natantis fruclificalione comment arius.
  As this work is scarce, the following extract from it may
                                                                              not

   not be unacceptable to our botanical readers               : — The author,
   wbo is well known by his voyage to Peru for the- improve
  ment of botany, having found in the Atlantic, on his voy
   age back     to Europe      in the year 1788, a great quantity of
   floating sea-grafs, Fucus natans Linn., he carefully examined
   the bladders of this marine production, which Linnæus er
   roneously considered as its fruit, but observed nothing in
   them that could induce him to accede to the opinion of that
   eminent naturalist. In the night of the first os August, when
   in the 24th degree of north latitude, the captain sent him
  some    of  these fuci, which        had   been    found adhering to one
  of  the ropes,    and which,        as  soon   as   agitated in the water,
  exhibited blueilh luminous phosphoric points. One of these
  he put into a vessel silled        with sea-water,       and observed that,
  when the plant was moved, a phosphoric light ran along it,
  from the one end to the other, in a serpentine direction. In
  the day-time he found white threads adhering to it along its
  whole length, having at their extremities small cups and
  ears, which he immediately conjectured to be the parts of
  fructification long sought for without success, but which
  were exceedingly       different from those which             Linnæus     and
 other botanills       thought thev observed in this species of
 plants.      The fucus was kept four days in water; and always,
 when shaken in        a  dark place,      it emitted     a  phosphoric light
 which     had    a perfect     resemblance     to that produced       by mer
 cury when agitated in vacuo.               After   the above      period   this
 phenomenon entirely ceased ; but the author was able to
 exhibit it at pleasure by obtaining fresh plants. The parts
 which produced the luminous appearance were the white
 threads,    before mentioned, adhering to the fucus, which ter
 minated either in small cups or ears,                   or ears with small
knobs.       He, however, did not find all              these three forms     of
the supposed flowers          on    the fame plant,      but in different   in
dividuals.       He found        also that these      bodies   could not be
easily separated from the piant, even though the incrustaT
tions with which the fucus was 'abundantly covered could be
separated with little difficulty.           From this he concluded that
the single      cups  were     the male flowers, the ears the herma
phrodite, and the ears with knobs the female.

284               FntElification         of the Fucus Natans.
    A writer in one of the foreign journals, who mentions this
work,    makes the following observations on the subject : —
"   By the kindness of one of my friends I have obtained from
Spain a specimen of the supposed flowers of the fucus natans,
and I must confess that the above description of the parts does
not appear to me satisfactory.     Mr. Ruiz is certainly right
when he        savs   that   the    bladders      in all   the kinds    of the fuci
contain nothing that can serve for fructification ; and the
experiment he made by carefully stripping a fuais natans of
all its bladders, in consequence of which it funk in the water,
clearly proves, what the German botanists have long ago ob
served, that the bladders of all the fuel serve to raise them
like balloons, and to keep them floating in the water, as is
the cafe with the utrlcularia              found in our ditches.          The   real
parts     of fructification in this plant          have been clearly pointed
out in various kinds of            it,   by    Roth and Stackhouse. What
the author considers  as flowers are small polypes, of that kind
which Blumenbach calls Bracbionus. Their white colour,
the threads with which they were connected, and their phos
phoric light, (for he found nothing of the sort in plains de
stitute of these appendages,)   ought to have led him to the
idea, that these bodies do not naturally belong to the plant,
and are merely adventitious.   Polypes have already often de
ceived botanists, who have considered                  them as the flowers        of
zoophytes without suspecting                    that they might be the inha
bitants of them.
     "The account given                  by
                              the author of the manner in
which this plant grows      curious.is  The fucus natans has
no roots, but excrescences by which      adheres to the bottom
                                                     it
of the sea. As soon as         full grown
                                    it    is  becomes covered   it
with bladders, which render     lighter than the water, and
                                           it                                     it
then rises to the surface. In this state                   it   floats on the waves
from the month of July to September;    but after this period
it    no longer to be seen between the 24th and the 36th
     is
decree of north latitude.  It sometimes covers very extensive
partsof the ocean, which,                 by   these means, have the appear

  The               Brugnatelli has lately published at Pavia,
             celebrated
in the Annali di Cbimica, the following observations on
light : — Light is either chemically united with bodies, or
merely accumulated and mixed in them in a mechanical
manner but invisible, or it is accumulated in bodies in a
visible state.
   Light chemically united with bodies, separates itself from
them in consequence of its affinity for caloric. A red heat,
however, is not necessary to disengage light when in this state.

thrown upon a verv hot, but. not ignited, plate of iron. The
cafe is the fame with the muriat of mercury (corrosive sub-
limat),      gray   calx of mercury, gray calx of antimony, all
calcareous       salts, &c. Fine sugar and sugar of milk, when
very dry and         pounded, sliine with great vivacity on           a plate
of iron which has been merely heated, but they                    do not ex
hibit the fame phenomenon on iron brought lo                      a red heat.
Feathers, cotton, and wool, sliine when drawn lightly over a
piece of hot iron ; and the spots of a playing card, under the
fame circumstances, emit a faint light.                Camphor and choco
late thrown upon a piece          of iron of this kind form luminou*
vapours. Several fluids, under the fame circumstances, pro
duce the like effects.  Oil of turpentine poured on hot iron
 gives a very perceptible        and the cafe is the fame with
                                light;
 fat, oils, sweat, wax, tallow, &c.   Atmospheric air has not
 the least influence in regard to the luminous appearance of
 these substances ; as they shine also in vacuo, in carbonic
 acid gas, in hydrogen gas, &c.     Nay, several bodies suffer
 their light to be disengaged when they are immersed in sul
 phurous acid or in boiling oil. Different bodies, under such
 circumstances, give different quantities of light.
    In regard to bodies in which light is merely accumu
 lated mechanically,         nothing is necessary to render it free but
 an approximation          of their parts. In this manner the light
  is,

 head belongs the luminous appearance of certain plants.

light magnets, which, when                              they      have been           exposed       for a

comrades       in the boat heard his cries, and went immediately
to his assistance, but too late, an immense snake having
crushed him to death.           These people knowing that this kind
of    snake never diverts its attention       from the prey which it
has once       seized until   it is devoured,    went boldly up to the
monster and cut its head off, carrying it and the body of the
deceased on board their boat.            The gentleman to whom we
are indebted        for this account, saw both the next morning;
 and found, on examining the latter, that the snake had seized
 the unhappy man by the right wrist, where the marks             of the
 animal's      fangs were very     distinct; and the mangled corpse
 bore evident signs       of having been crustied, by the snake twist
 ing    itself round   the  head, neck, breast, and thigh.    Our cor
 respondent extended the jaws of the snake, stiff as they were,
 wide enough to admit a body the size of a man's head ; and
  the whole length of the animal is described to have been from
  about 28 to 30 feet, and equal in circumference to a mode
  rate sized man.         By the account of the survivors, this kind of
  snake swallows men and bullocks, after having crushed them,
  as   in this instance; which our friend, judging from the ca
  pacity of the jaws in the state in which he saw them, found
  no difficulty in believing: and this furnishes a proof that
   similar facts, stated by certain naturalists, to which many
   have refused their belief, are entitled to more deference than
   they generally meet with."

       The heat of the present summer has been very great, and
   much more uniform and uninterrupted than for many pre
   ceding years.         During the afternoon of several days this
   month,       the  thermometer in the neighbourhood of London,
    exposed in a northerly aspect, was as high as 86° of Fahr.
    In London it was higher, owing to the heat reflected from
    the surrounding buildings.

     On  the 17th   of June, at Berlin, J. Abrahamfon, the ce
 lebrated   dye-sinker.    He was born in 1722, in the duchy of
 Mecklenburgh-Strelitz, and learned, from a very indifferent
 artist of Lissa, the art of engraving coats of arms, and of en
 graving on gems ; but, being possessed of an excellent genius,
 he was able, by his own       talents, combined with reflection,
 diligence, and close application, to raise himself to that de
 gree of celebrity to which he was so justly entitled.       With
 out being able to draw or to model, he displayed in all his
 works great ability and readiness.         Among his principal
 productions may be reckoned his medals on the victories of
 Frederick   II.   during the seven years war, and particularly
that on the battle of Torgau, after Ramler's idea and a
drawing by Meils.        He entered into the service of his Prussian
majesty    in 1750.
    On   the  20th of June, at Gottingen, that respectable ve
teran among the German mathematicians, Abraham Gotthelf
Kastner, in the eighty-first year of his age.      He was a coun
sellor of stale to his Britannic majesty, professor of mathe
matics and natural philosophy in the university of Gottin

of the Agricultural Society of Brunswick Lunenburgh, of
the Academies        of Stockholm    and Berlin, of   the Electoral
Academy of       the Useful Sciences at  Erfurt, of  the Academy
of Sciences     at Bologna,   &c. &c.     Besides  possessing great
mathematical knowledge,        he was well   acquainted with lite

his prose writings and his epigrams.

  I have the pleasure of communicating to you, and through
  you to the Royal Society, some striking results I have ob
  tained in pursuing my experiments on electricity excited by
  the mere mutual contact of different kinds of metal, and
  even by that of other conductors, also different from each
  other, either liquid or containing some liquid, to which they
  are properly indebted for their conducting power. The prin
  cipal of these results, which comprehends nearly all the rest,
 is the construction of an apparatus having a resemblance in
   ts effects (that is to fay, in the shock it is capable of making
 the arms,      &c.  experience)     to the Leydcn flask,      or, rather, to
 an electric battery       weakly charged acting incessantly, which,
 should charge        itself after each explosion ; and, in a word,
 which should have an inexhaustible charge, a perpetual ac
 tion or impulse on the electric fluid ; but which differs from
it   essentially both by this continual action,           which is peculiar

ductors, and therefore the most remote,                           as has      hitherto been
believed, from the electric nature.                         The    apparatus         to   which
I allude, and which will, no doubt, astonish you,   only the                     is
assemblage of   number of good conductors of different kinds

conductors, are all that                 isnecessary for constituting my new
instrument,    which, as           I     have said, imitates the effects of the
Leydcn flask, or   of electric batteries,                    by
                                               communicating the

the activity of these batteries when highly charged, either in

distance at which the discharge may be effected, &c. as                                        it

I have described, and which    still too small for great effects,

in water,      that the skin, which otherwise

the sixth, and the red in succession                   till I come to                the last,
which forms the head of the column, it is curious to observe
how the mocks gradually increase in force. But this force
is such, that I receive from a column formed of twenty pairs
of pieces (not more) (hocks which affect the whole singer with
considerable        pain    if   it be immersed          alone     in   the water      of the
bason ; which          extend        (without pain)          as far as the        wrist, and
even to the elbow,             if   the whole hand, or the greater part        of
it,   be immersed      j       and are felt also        in the wrist of the other
hand.
 I     still suppose that all the necessary attention has been                           em-
ployed         in the construction of the column,              and that each pair

of salt    water rather than common water, or                       by  a   piece   of paste
board, skin, or any thing of the same kind well impregnated
with this salt water. The disk must not be too small, and
its surface must adhere closely to those of the metallic plates
between which         placed. This exact and extensive appli

   All this shows that, the contact of the metals with each
                                     if
other in some points only be sufficient (as they are excellent
conductors) to give                 a   free passage to        amoderately strong
current of electricity,              the cafe     is   not the fame with liquids,
or bodies impregnated with moisture, which are conductors
much less perfect  and which, consequently, have need of
                           ;
more ample contact with metallic conductors, and still more
with       each other,      in order that the electric fluid may easily
pass, and that        it   may not be too much retarded in its course;
especially when        it   is      moved       with   very little force, as           in the
present case.
      In   a   word, the effects of my apparatus, that   to fay, the         is
shocks felt, are        considerably more sensible in proportion as
                                                                 the

the temperature of the ambient air, or that of the water or
moistened disks which enter into the composition of the co
lumn, and that of the water even in the bason, is warmer,
as heat renders the water a better conductor.                           But almost all
the salts, and particularly common salt,                          will render it a still
better. This is one of the reasons, if not the only one, why
it is so advantageous that the water of the bason, and, above
all, that     interposed          pair of metallic plates, as
                            between       each
well as the water with which the circular pieces of pasteboard
are impregnated, &c. should be salt water, as already ob
served.
  But all        these means        and    all these attentions have only a
limited            and will never occasion your receiving
             advantage,
very strong (hocks as long as the apparatus consists but of
one column, formed only of twenty pair of plates, even
though they may consist of the two metals properest for
these experiments, viz. silver and zinc ; for if they were
silver and lead, or tin, or copper and tin, the half of the
effect would not be produced, unless the weaker effect of
each pair were supplied    by a much greater number.     What
Teally increases the electric power of this apparatus, and to
such a degree as to make it equal or surpass that of the tor
pedo or electric eel, is the number of plates arranged in such
a manner, and with the attention before mentioned.     If to
the twenty pairs above described twenty or thirty others be
added       disposed in the same order,               the   shocks which may be
communicated          by    a   column lengthened in this manner will
be much         stronger,       and extend to both arms as far as the
shoulder; and especially of that, the hand of which has been
immersed in the water : this hand, with the whole arm, will
remain   more or less benumbed, if by frequently renewing
the touches these shocks be made to succeed each other ra
pidly, and without intermission.     This will be the cafe if
the  whole hand,  or the greater part of                    it,

forty or fifty couples of metals, which gives shocks more than
moderate to both the arms of one person, is capable of giving
sensible shocks also to several persons,                     holding each other by
the hands (sufficiently moist)                  so as    to form an uninterrupted
chain.
      I   shall now       return to the mechanical construction of my
apparatus,          which      is susceptible of several variations, and de
scribe not all those which I have invented or made, either on
 a   small or      a large     scale, but only a few,          which   are either cu
 rious or useful, which exhibit some real advantage, as being
 easier or sooner constructed, and which are certain in their
 effects, or can be longer preserved in good order.
      I   shall begin by one          which, uniting nearly all          these advan
 tages, differs most in its figure                 from the columnar apparatus
 above described,             but which        is attended      with the inconveni
 ence       of being much more voluminous.                         This new appara
  tus,      which    I   (hall  call  a  couronne      de  tajses (a chain of cups),
  is represented Plate           VIII.     fig. 1.
        I  dispose, therefore,         a row    of several basons or cups of any
  matter whatever, except metal, such as wood, shell, earth,
  or rather glass (small tumblers or drinking glasses are the
  most convenient),              half filled with pure water, or rather             salt
   water or ley        :   they are made        all to communicate by forming
   them into a sort of chain, by means of so many metallic arcs,
   one arm of which, Sa, or only the extremity S, immersed
   in    one   of   the tumblers,         is of copper or brass, or rather of
   copper plated          with    silver; and the other, Za, immersed into
   the next tumbler, is of tin, or rather of zinc.                         I shall here
   observe,        that ley and other alkaline liquors are preferable
   when one of the metals to be immersed is tin : salt water is
    preferable       when it is zinc.           The two       metals   of which each
    arc is composed,           are soldered       together in any part above that
    which       is immersed          in the liquor, and which must touch it
    with a      surface sufficiently Jarge           :  it is necessary therefore   that
    this part should            be a plate       of    an inch square, or very     little
    less ; the rest        of the     arc    may be as much narrower as you
     choose,      and even a simple metallic wire.                  It may also consist
     of   a  third metal different from the two immersed into the
     tumblers, since the action on the electric fluid which results
                                                                                   from

    2^6                 On  the  EleSricity   excited by the
   from all the contacts of several metals that immediately suc
   ceed each other, or the force with which this fluid i3 at last
   impelled, is absolutely the same, or nearly so, as that which
   it would have received by the immediate contact of the first
   metal with the last without any intermediate metals, as                  I
   have ascertained      by direct experiments, of which        I (hall have
   occasion    to speak hereafter.
       A  series of 30, 40, or 60 of these tumblers connected with
  each     other in this manner, and ranged either in a straight
  or curved line, or bent in every manner possible, forms the
  whole of this new apparatus, which at bottom and in sub
  stance is the fame as the other columnar one above described;
  as the essential part, which consists in the immediate commu
  nication of the different metals which form each couple, and
  themediate communication of one couple with the other,
  viz. by    the intervention      of   a humid conductor,     exist  in the
  one as well     as  the other.
      In  regard to the manner        of trying these tumblers, and the
  different   experiments      for which   they may be employed, there
 is no need of saying a great deal after the ample explanation
 I   have already given respecting the columnar apparatus.                It
 may be readily comprehended, that to obtain a shock it will
 be sufficient to immerse one hand into one of the tumblers,
 and a singer of the other hand into another of the tumblers
 at a considerable        distance    from the former:     that this shock
 will   be stronger the further these glasses are from each          other;
 that is to fay, in proportion to the number of the interme
diate ^hsses, and consequently, that the strongest shock will
be received        when you touch the first and last end of the
chain.       It  will be readily comprehended also, how and why
the experiments will succeed much better by grasping and
ho'ding fast in one hand, well moilveneel, a pretiy large
plate    of   metal    (in order    that the communication         may be
more perfect, and formed in a great number os point?), and
touching with this p'ate the water in the tumbler, or rather
the metallic arc, while the other is immersed in the other
distant tumbler, or touches with a puie, grasped in the like
manner,       the arc    of   the latter.    In  a word, one may com
prehend and even foresee the success of a great variety of
                     7                                       experiments

  experiments which may be made with this apparatus or chain
 of cups much more easily, and in a manner more evident,
 and which, if I may be allowed the expression, speak more
 to the eyes than those with the columnar apparatus.            1 shall
 therefore forbear from describing a great number of these ex
 periments, which may be easily guessed, and shall relate only
 a few which are no less instructive than amusing.
     Let  three twenties   of these tumblers be ranged,     and con
 nected with each other by metallic arcs, but in such a man
 ner, that, for the first twenty, these arcs shall be turned in
 the same direction ; for example, the arm of silver turned to
 the lest, and the arm of zinc to the right j and for the second
 twenty in a contrary direction, that is to fay, the zinc to the
 left, and the silver to the right : in the last place, for the third
 twenty, the silver to the left, as is the cafe in regard to the
 first.    When   every   thing is thus arranged, immerse one
 finger in the water of the first tumbler, and, with the plate
 grasped in the other hand, as above directed, touch the first
 metallic arc (that which joins the first tumbler to the
 second), then the other arc which joins the second and third
 tumbler, and so on, in succession, till you have touched them
all. If the water be very salt and luke-warm, and the skin
of    the  hands well moistened     and softened,   you will already
 begin    to feel a slight stiock   in   the finger when you      have
 touched the fourth or fifth arc      (I  have experienced   it some
times very distinctly by touching the third),         and by succes-
iiveiy proceeding to the sixth and the seventh, &c. the sliocks
will gradually increase in force to the twentieth arc, that is
to fay, to the last of those turned in the. same direction ; but
by proceeding onwards to the 31st, 2ad, 23d, or 1st, 2d, 3d,
of the second twenty, in which they are all turned in a con
trary direction, the shocks will each time become weaker, so
that at the 36th or 37 th, they will be imperceptible, and be
entirely null at the 40th, beyond which (and beginning the
third twenty, opposed to the second and analogous to the
first,) the shocks will be imperceptible to the 44th or 45th
arc ; but they will begin to become sensible, and to increase
gradually, in proportion as you advance to the 60th, where
    Ye*. YII.                     Q   q                          they

298                  On the Eletlricity excited   by the
they will have attained the same force as that of the 20th
arc.
    If the twenty arcs in the middle were all turned in the
fame     direction     as  the preceding twenty and the       following
twenty, that is to fay, if the whole 60 conspired to impel the
electric fluid in the same direction, it may readily be com
prehended       how much greater the effect will be at the end,
and    how much stronger the shock ; and it mav be compre
hended, in general, to what point it must be weakened in all
cases where a greater or smaller number of these forces act
contrary to each other by an inverted position of metals.
    If  the chain be in any part interrupted, either by one of
the tumblers being empty of water, or one of the metallic
arcs being removed or divided into two pieces, you will re
ceive no shock when you immerse your finger into the water
of the first and another into that of the last vessel ; but you
will have it strong or weak, according to circumstances
 (leaving these singers immersed), at the moment when the
interrupted communication is restored ; at the moment when
another person stiall immerse into the two tumblers, where
the arc is wanting, two of his finders (which will also receive
a slight shock), or rather, when he            shall  immerse  the same
arc which       has    been taken     away, or any other;    and in the
cafe   of  the arc separated into two pieces, at the moment when
these pieces are again brought into mutual contact (in which
cafe the shock will be stronger than in any other); and,
lastly, in the     case   of the empty tumbler, at the moment when
water poured         into it mall rise to the two metallic arms im
mersed in this cup which before were dry.
    When the chain of cups is of sufficient length, and ca
 pable of giving a strong shock, you will experience                one,
though much weaker, even though you keep immersed two
 fingers, or the two hands, in one bason of water of pretty
large size, in which the first and last metallic arcs are made
to terminate      :  provided    that either of these hands thus im
mersed,      or rather both of them, be kept respectively in con
tact, or nearly in contact, with these arcs, you will, I fay,
experience      a   (hock at the momen         when (the chain being
                                                            interrupted

the circle completed in any of the ways before mentioned.
One might be surprised that in this circle the electric cur

                     a free passage
Water,      that which fills the bason, should quit this good con
ductor to throw itself and pursue its course through the body
of the person who holds his hands immersed in the same
water, and thus to take              longer passage.

will   cease     if    we reflect, that living and warm animal sub
stances,      and above all, their humours, are, in general, better
conductors than water.      As the body, then, of the person
who immerses his hands     in the water, affords an easier pas
sage    than this water does to the electric current, the latter
must           it though a little longer.
            prefer                           In a word, the
electric fluid, when it must traverse imperfect conductors in
a    large quantity,       and     particularly moist conductors, has a
propensity to extend             itself in a larger stream, or to divide
itself into several, and even to pursue a winding course, as it
thereby finds less resistance than by following one single chan
nel, though shorter; in the present case it is only a part of the
electric current, which, leaving the water, pursues this new
route through the body of the person, and traverses it from
the one arm to the other              :       a greater or less part passes through
the    water in the         vessel.           This is the reason why the shock
experienced   is much weaker than when the electric current
is not divided when the person alone forms the communica
tion between one arc and another, &c.
   From these experiments one might believe, that when the
torpedo willies to communicate a shock to the arms of a man
or to animals which touch                         it,
                                or which approach its body
under the water (which shock          much weaker than what
                                                        is
the sifli can give out of the water),   has nothing to do butit
to bring together some of the parts of its electric organ in
that place, where,            by
                       some interval, the communication                          is
interrupted, to remove the interruptions from between the
columns of which the said organ    formed, or from between
                                                        is
its membranes in the form of thin disks, which lie one above
the other from the            bottom to the summit of each column:
it   has,   I   fay,    nothing       to do        but to remove these interrup-

300                      On   the   Eleclricitj   excited by the
tions in         one or more places, and to produce there the
requisite       contact, either by compressing these columns, or by
making          some moisture to flow in between the pellicles or
diaphragms which have been separated, &c. This is what may
be, and what I really conclude to be, the task of the torpedo
when it gives a fliock; for all the rest, the impulse and move
ment communicated to the electric fluid, is only a necessary
essect of its singular organ, formed, as is seen, of a very nu
merous series of conductors, which                         I   have every reason to
believe sufficiently different from each other to be exciters
of the electric fluid by their mutual contacts ; and to suppose
them ranged in a manner proper for impelling that fluid
with      a sufficient        force   from top        to bottom,             or from the
bottom         to the top,      and for determining             a    current capable of
producing the fliock, &c. as soon and as                            often as all the ne
cessary contacts and communications take place.
   But let us now leave the torpedo, and its natural eleclric
organ, and return to the artificial eleElric organ of my in
vention, and particularly to my first columnar apparatus, that
which imitates the first even in its form (for that composed
of tumblers           is different in that respect).            I    might     say   some
thing     also in rearard to the construction                  of    the said apparatus
with tumblers or         of glasses ; for example, that the first
                           a chain
and last tumbler stiould be of such a size that, when neces
sary, the whole hand might be immersed in         &c. but, to          it,     ;
enter into all these details, would require too much time.
  In regard to the columnar apparatus, endeavoured to dis  I
cover the means  of lengthening      great deal
                                             it   amultiplying           by
the metallic plates in such    manner as not to tumble down
                                        a                                               ;
and  Idiscovered,   besides others, the following,  which are
represented in the annexed figures. (Plate VIII. fig. 2,3,4.)
   In Fig. 2, mmmm are rods, three, four, or more in num
ber, which rife from the bottom of the column, and confine,
as   in   a   cage,    the plates or disks, placed each above the other
in such number and to such      height as you choose, and
                                             a
which thus prevent them from falling.  The rods may be of
                     only that, in the last cafe, you must
glass, wood, or metal,
prevent them from coming into immediate contact with the
plates  which may be done either
          ;                                           by
                                    covering each of them
                          9                                                           with

with a glass tube, or interposing between them and the co
lumn a few stripes of wax cloth, oiled paper, or even plain
paper,  and, in a word, any other body that may either be a
cobibent or a bad conductor : wood or paper will be suffici
ently    for our purpose, provided only that they are not very
          so
damp or moist.
   But the best expedient, when you wish to form an appa
ratus to consist of a great number of plates, above 60, 80,
or ioo for example,       to divide the column into two or
                                      is,
more,      as    seen   Fig.     3    and 4, (Plate           VIII.)    where, the pieces
all have their respective positions and communication as                                 if
there were only one column.     Fig. 4, as well as Fig. 3, may
indeed be considered as   bent column.  a
     In   all these figures the different metallic plates are denoted
by    the letters      S
                        (which are the initials of silver and
                           and   Z
zinc); and the moijlencd dijks (of pasteboard, skin, &c. in
terposed between each pair of metals), are represented                                by a
black stratum.  The plates of metal may either be laid simply
upon each other and         brought into union in an indefi
                                        so
nite number of points, or they may be soldered together.
It    altogether indifferent whichever of these methods be
     is
followed,   cc, cc, cc, are the metallic plates which form
a    communication               between,         each        column,    or section of     a
column,          and    another;            and bb,      bb,    bb, are the basons       of
water in communication                        with the lower part or extremities
of   these columns.
    An apparatus thus prepared        exceedingly convenient
                                                         is
without being bulky      ami  might be rendered portable, with
                                 ;           it
still more ease and safety,       means of circular cafes or
                                                  by
tubes, in which each column might be inclosed and preserved.
It    only to be regretted that
     is                           does not long continue in
                                                  it                                       a
good state      :   the moistened             disks become         dry    in   one or two
days to such     degree that thev must be again moistened
                       a                                                                   ;
which, however, may be done without taking to pieces the
whole apparatus,                 by
                       immersing the columns, completely
formed, in water, and             wiping them, when taken out some
time after, with        a   cloth, or in any other manner.
     The       best method           of making         an instrument as durable as
*an be wished,          would be, to inclose and confine the water
                                                                                interposed

  303                 On the EleiJricity excited      by the
  interposed    between     each pair    of metals,   and   to fix these me
  tallic plates in their places by enveloping the whole column
 with wax or pitch : but this would be somewhat difficult in
 the execution, and would require a great deal of patience.
 I have, however, succeeded ; and have formed in this man
 ner two cylinders consilling of twenty pair of metals, which
 can still be employed though made several weeks, and whichj
 I  hope,   will   be serviceable for months.
     These cylinders         are  attended     with this    advantage,    that
 they may be employed for experiments either in an erect,
 inclined, or lying position, according as you choose, or even
 immersed in water, provided the top of it be above the surface
of the fluid : they might also give a shock when entirely im
mersed      if  they   contained     a   greater   number of plates,      or if
several    of   these cylinders were joined together, and             if there
 were any interruption that could be removed                at pleasure,  &c.
 by which means          these  cylinders would have a pretty good re
 semblance to the electric eel ; and, to have a better resem
 blance to it even externally, they might be joined together
bv pliable metallic wires or screw-springs, and then covered
with a skin terminated by a head and tail properly formed, 8cc.
     The effects sensible to our organs produced by an appa
ratus formed of 40 or 50 pair of plates (and even by a smaller,
if one of the      metals    be silver or copper and the other         zinc,)
are reduced merely to shocks           :  the current  of the electric fluid,
impelled and excited by such a number and variety of dif
ferent conductors, silver, zinc, and water, disposed alternately
in   the manner above described,            excites not only contractions
and spasms        in the muscles, convulsions more or less violent
in the limbs through which it passes in its course ; but it
irritates also the organs of taste, sight, hearing, and feeling,
properly so called, and produces in them sensations peculiar
to each.
     And   first,   in regard to the fense       of feeling :  If, by means
of    an ample contact         of the hand (well moistened) with 2
plate   of  metal,    or  rather,   by immersing the hand to a con
siderable depth in the water of the bason, I establish on one
side a good communication with one of the extremities of my
eleilro-motivt apparatus, (we must give new names to instru
                                                                       ments

or the principle on which they depend); and on the other I
apply the forehead, eye-lid, tip of the nose, also well moist
ened, or any other part of the body where the skin is very
delicate : if I apply, I fay, with a little pressure, any one of
these delicate        parts, well moistened,                   to the point          of      a me
tallic wire, communicating properly with the other extremity
of the said apparatus, I experience, at the moment that the
conducting circle is completed, at the place of the (kin
touched, and a little beyond       blow and       it,
                                               prick, which
                                                        a                    a

                              is                                                                       is
interrupted and restored               ;     so   that,   if   these   alternations be fre
quent, they occasion    very disagreeable quivering and prick
                                  a

                 these communications    continue without these
alternations,         without          the    least interruption             of    the circle,     I
feel nothing for some moments;                            afterwards,            however, there
begins at the part                applied         to the end           of   the wire, another
sensation, which   sharp pain (without (hock), limited pre
                         is   a

that in     a    little time       it   becomes           insupportable, and does not

      What proof more evident of                        the continuation            of   the elec

 hands. Another evident proof may be drawn from this cir
 cumstance, that in such experiments you often experience,
 at the moment             when the circle                    is   suddenly       interrupted,         a

 with this only difference, that these sensations, occasioned by
a  kind of reflux of the electric fluid, or      the shock which        by
 arises from the sudden suspension of its current, are of less
 strength. But   have no need, and this

                              a
 which, by being of a different kind, perform, by their mu
 tual contact, the office of exciters or movers : this proposi
 tion, which I advanced                      in my         first researches and discoveries
 on the subject            of galvanism,               and always maintained by sup
 porting them with new facts and experiments, will,                                     I hope,
 meet with no opposers.
    Recurring to the sensation of pain which is felt in the ex
 periments above described, I must add, that if this pain be
 very strong and pricking in the parts covered by the skin, it
 is much more so in those where the skin has been taken off —
 in recent wuunds for example. If by chance there stiould be
 a small incision or bit of the skin rubbed off in the singer
which           I   immerse       in the water tbat communicates with one
ef    the             the ele£lro-motive apparatus, I experience
             extremities of
there   pain so acute, when, by establishing the proper com
            a
munication with the other extremity, I complete the circle,
that I must soon desist from the experiment; that is to say,
must withdraw               my finger, or interrupt the circle in some
other manner.               I will say more; that I cannot even endure
itabove a few seconds when the part of the apparatus which.
I put in play, or the whole apparatus, contains only twenty
pair of plates, or about that number.
   One thing, which I must still remark,     that all these             is,
sensations of pricking and pain are stronger and sharper,
every thing else being equal, when the part of the body
which      to feel them

 the experiments,   equally and still more demonstrative                              and
 striking, with which  I am at present employed.
     In    regard to the sense            of   taste,   I   had before discovered,    and
published in these first memoirs, where I found myself obliged
to combat the pretended animal electricity of Galvani, and to
declare it an external electricity moved by the mutual contact
of   metalsof different kinds, — I had discovered, I say, in con
sequence of this power which I ascribed to metals, that two
pieces of these different metals, and particularly one of silver
and one of zinc, applied in a proper manner, excited at the
tip of the tongue very sensible sensations of taste; that the
taste was decidedly acid,     the tip of the tongue being turned
                                         if,
towards the zinc, the electric current proceeded against                               it,
and entered       and that another talle, less strong but more
                      it   ;
disagreeable, acrid, and inclining to alkaline, was felt,  (the
                                                                                 if
position of the metals being reversed) the electric current
issuedfrom the tip of the 'tongue that these sensations con
                                                        ;
tinued and received even an increase for several seconds,
the mutual contact              of   the two metals was maintained, and
                                                                                       if if
the conducting    circle was nowhere interrupted. But when
I    have said here, that exactly the same phenomena take
place when you try, instead of one pair of these metallic
pieces, an assemblage of several of them ranged in the proper
manner;           and that the said sensations                  of   taste, whether acid
or alkaline,           increase     but    a    little with the number of these
pairs,           have said the whole.             It  only remains for me to add
that,     if I   the apparatus          put in play for these experiments ou
the tongue be formed                 of   a sufficiently large number of me
tallic pairs of this kind, for example,     contain 30, 40,     if   it
or more, the tongue experiences not only the sensation of
taste already mentioned, but, besides that,  blow which                                it
                                                                     is a
receives at the moment when the circle      completed, aud
which occasions in       pricking more or less painful, but
                               it    a
fleeting, followed some moments   after      durable sensation  by   a
of taste. This blow produces even       convulsion or agitation

of   a   part or      of   the whole      of   the tongue, when the apparatus,
formed of         a   still greater number         of pairs of the said metals,
is   more active, and             if,     by   means of good communicating

   I must often recur to, and infill on,                          thrs last condition,
because it is essential in all experiments when                          you    wish    to
ohtain sensible effects on the bodv, or commotions in the
limbs, or sensations in the organs of the fenses.  It is neces
sary, therefore, that the non-metal lie condnctors which  enter
Into the circle should be as good conductors as possible, well
moistened (if they are not themselves liquid) with water, or
tvith any other liquid that may be a better conductor than
pure water; and it is necessary, besides, that the welf moist.*
ened surfaces, by which they communicate with the metallic
conductor, (hould be sufficiently large. The communication
ought to be confined or reduced to a /mall number of points
of contact only in           whefe vou wish to concentrate

the electric action on one of the most sensible parts of the
body, on any of the sensitive nerves, 8tc. as I have already
remarked in speaking of the experiments on feeling, viz,
fhose by which acute pains are excited in different parts.
The best method which I have found for producing on the
tongue all the sensations above described, to apply the tip       is,
of    to the pointed extremity (which, however, must not be
     it
too much fb) of     metallic tod, which
                          a                 make to commu   I
nicate properly, as in the other experiments, with one of the
extremities of my apparatus, and to establisti good commu           a
nication between the hand, or, what                    is   better, both the hands
together,       and   the other extremity.                 This application of          the
tip of the tongue to the end of the metallic rod, may either
exist already, when you are going to make the other commu
nication to complete the circle (when you are going to im
merse   your hand into the water of the bason), or be made
after the establishment of this communication, while the hand
is   immersed    ;    and      in   the latter cafe   I     think   I   feel tire prick-*
ing     and (hock     in    the tongue,       a   very stiort      time before actual
contact.        Yes   ;   it   always    appears to me, particularly            if  I   ad
vance the tip         of my         tongue gradually, that, when               it   has ar
rived     within      a   very small distance         of   the metal, the electric
fluid     (I   would almost           say   spark), overcoming this interval*
durts forwards to strike it*
                                                                                        l»

     In   regard     to the sense  of   sight,   which   I also found might
be affected by the weak Current              of the electric fluid, arising
from the mutual contact of two different metals in general,
and in particular, of a piece of silver and one of zinc, it was
natural to expect that the sensation of Hght, excited by my
new apparatus, would be stronger in proportion as it con
tained a greater number of pieces of theft metals; each pair
of which,          arranged   in the proper manner, adds a degree          of
force to the laid electric current, as all the other experiments
show, and particularly those with the electrometer assisted
by the condenser, which I have only mentioned, and whi':li
I (hall describe on another occasion.                  But I was surprised
to find that, with 10, 20, 30 pairs, and more, the flash pro
duced neither appeared longer and more extended, nor much
brighter than with one pair.                 It is true, however, that this
sensation        of weak    aud transient light, is excited hy such an
apparatus          much   easier and in different ways.          To succeed,
 indeed, with one pair, the following arc almost the only
 methods ; viz. that one of the metallic pieces should be ap
 plied to the ball of the eye, or the eye-lid well moistened,
 and that it mould be made to touch the other metal applied
 to the other eve, or held in the mouth, which produces a
 a    flaili    much more      beautiful ; or, that this second metallic
 piece should be held in the moillened hand and then brought
 into contact with the former; or, in the last place, that these
 two plates should he applied to certain parts of the inside of
 the mouth, making them communicate with each other. But
 with an apparatus of 20 or 30 pairs, &.c, the fame flash will
 be produced          hy applying   the    end  of a metallic plate or rod,
 placed       in communication with one of the extremities of the
 apparatus,        to the eye, while with one hand yog forrn. a proper
 communication with the other extremis) ; hy bringing, I
 fev, this plate into contact not only with the eye or ajiv part
 or' the mouth, but even the forehead, the nose, the cheeks,
 Ji.jS, chin, and even the throat;               in  a word, every   prt  and
 point of       the viiage, which must only be well moistened before
 they     are applied to the metallic plate.            The form as well as
 the force of this transient light which is perceived varies a
 little,     if  the places   of  the face     to which     the action of thi

electric current is applied, be varied: if it be on the fore
head, for example, this light is moderately bright, and ap
pears like a luminous circle, under which figure it presents
itself also in several other experiments.
   But tha most curious of all these experiments    to hold                     is,
the metallic platebetween the lips, and in contact with the
tip of the tongue  since, when you afterwards complete the

current sufficiently strong and in good order,     sensation of             a
light in the eyes,    convulsion in the lips, and even in the
                              a
tongue, and         a    painful prick at the tip of                  it,   followed      by   a

posed     of 30 or 40         pairs   of   these metals.        I    introduced,      a   con
siderable way into both ears,                     two probes          or metallic rods
with their ends rounded, and                    I     made them to communicate
immediately with both extremities of the apparatus.    At the
moment when the circle was thus completed           received                I                  a
shock   the head, and some moments after (the communi-

j>aste or tenacious matter had been boiling. This noise con
tinued incessantly, and without increasing, all the time that
the circle was complete, &c.                     The    disagreeable        sensation, and
which    I     apprehended          might be dangerous,              of   the sliock in the
 brain, prevented me from repeating this experiment.
    There still remains the fense of smelling, which                               I      have
 hitherto tried   vain with my apparatus.

these senses,as I have found, produces in the interior of
the nose only a pricking more or less painful, and commo
tions more or less extensive, according as the said current
is weaker or stronger.    And whence comes      then, that            it,
        not excite any sensation of smell,
                                                                                           it it

stimulates the nerves of that fense                     ?    It cannot be said that
the electric fluid of itself             is   not proper for producing odorous
sensations,        since, when         it                             in the

electric machines,    conveys to the nose

resembling that of phosphorus. Taking similitude into con
sideration, and reasoning from its analogy with other odo
riferous matters,   will fay, that
                          I         must completely diffuse
                                                     it
itself throughout the air to excite smell  that  has need,        ;         it
like other effluvia, of the vehicle of the air to affect that
fense     in   such   a   manner as to excite               the sensations         of smell.
But     in     the experiments          of which    I   speak,    that     is    to fay, of
an electric current incircle of conductors, all contiguous,

take place.

is maintained during the whole time that this current can
follow the chain not interrupted in its communications;         in
a word, an action the effects of which vary according to the
different degrees of excitability in the parts, as has been seen                            ;

f  bores or condensers, is indeed very ingenious, and       per                          is,
haps, the best theory that has been devised to explain the
phenomena of the torpedo, adhering to the hitherto known
principles and laws of electricity. For, besides that the me

              which, every time that the fifli intended to give
a shock, the respective separation of the plates of the whole
or    a   great number       of   these electrophores or condensers ought
to he effected all          &\   once, and ought to establish on the one
hand      a   communication            between     themselves            of all     the plates
electrified po/itively% and on the other   communication be   a
tween all those electrified negatively, as Mr. Nicholpui sup
poses—besides,      that this very complex mechanism appears
too difficult, and little agreeable to nature — and besides, that ;
the supposition of an electric charge originally impressed, and
so durable in these pellicles performing the office of electro
phores,       is   altogether gratuitous, — rsuch             a     hypothesis falls en
tirely, since these pellicles of the organ of the torpedo are
not, and cannot be,        any manner insulating or susceptible
                                  in

   IT    is sometimes      of great   use  in natural philosophy to doubt
   of things that are commonly taken for granted ; especially as
   the means of resolving any doubt, when once it is enter
   tained, are often within our reach.                 We    may therefore     fay
   that any experiment which leads us to investigate                    the truth
          * from    'tranJaGioxi of the Royal Society  of Lent/ut /or 1800.
                                                                                 of

  Jlft           On the Powers     of the prismatic       Colours
  of what was before admitted upon trust may become of great
 utility to natural knowledge. Thus, for instance, when we
 fee the effect of the condensation of the sun's rays in the
 focus of a burning lens, it seems to be natural to suppose
 that every one of the united rays contributes its proportional
 (hare to the intensity of the heat which is produced ; and we
 should probably think it high'y absurd, if it were asserted
 that many of them had but little concern in the combastion
 or vitrification which follows, when an object is put into that
 focus.     It will therefore not be amiss to mention what gave
 rife to  a surmise,   that the power of heating and illuminating
objects might not be equally distributed among the variously
 coloured rays.
    In  a variety  of experiments which I have occasionally made,
 relating    t6 the   method of viewing the fun with large tele
 scopes to the best advantage,           I   used  various combinations
of differently-coloured darkening             glasses.      What    appeared
remarkable was, that when          I used some    of them I felt      a sensa
tion   of heat, thdilgh I     had but little light     ;   while others gave
me much light, with scarce any sensation of heat.                        Now,
as in these different combinations the fun's image was also
differently coloured,       it occurred     to me, that the        prismatic
rays might have the power of heating bodies very unequally
distributed among them ; and, as I judged it right in this
respect    to entertain a doubt,        it  appeared      equally proper to
admit the same with regard to light.                     If certain colours
should be more apt to occasion heat, others might, on the
contrary, be more fit for vision, by possessing a superior illu
minating power.          At   all events, it would be proper to recur
                                             *
to experiments for      a  decision.
       Experiments on the beating Power           of coloured Rays.
    I fixed   a piece  of pasteboard,     AB, (Plate IX.) in        a  frame,
mounted upon        a stand,   CD,   and moveable upon two centres.
In   the pasteboard     I cut an opening,        mn, a little larger than
the ball   of   a thermometer,      and    of  a sufficient length to let
the whole extent of one of the prismatic colours pass through.
I then placed three thermometers upon small inclined planes,

*EF ; their balls were blacked with japan ink. That of No.                   I
was rather too large for great sensibility. No. 3 and 3 were
two excellent thermometers, which my highly esteemed friend
Dr. Wilson,    late professor of astronomy at Glasgow, had
lent me for the purpose : their balls being very small, made
theni of exquisite sensibility. The scales of all were properly
disengaged from the balls.
  I  now placed the stand, with the framed pasteboard and
the thermometers, upon a small plain board, GH, that                          I
might be at liberty to move the whole apparatus together,
without deranging the relative situation of the different parts.
   This being done, I set a prism, moveable on                   its axis, into
the upper part of an open window, at right                       angles to the
solar ray, and turned it about           till its refracted coloured spec
trum became   stationary upon a table              placed at a proper dis
tance from the window.
  The. board containing            the apparatus    was now put on the
table, and  set in such            a manner as to let the rays          of one
colour  pass through the opening in the pasteboard.                       The
moveable frame was then adjusted to be perpendicular tn the
rays coming from the prism ; and the inclined planes carry
ing the three thermometers, with their balls arranged in a
line, were    set    so   near     the opening,    that any one of them
might     easily be advanced          far enough to receive the irradi
ation of  the colour which passed through the opening,
while the rest remained close by, under the shade of the
pasteboard.
   By    repeated    trials,   I   found that Dr. Wilson's        No.   2, and
mine, always agreed in showing the temperature of the place
where I examined them, when the change was not very sud
den; but   that mine would require ten minutes to take a
change,   which  the other would show in five.    No. 3 never
differed much from No. a.
   ijl Experiment. Having arranged the three thermometers
in the place prepared for the experiment,      waited till they
                                                             I
were stationary.          Then, advancing No.           1.   to the   red ravs,
and leaving the other two close by,    the shade,  in              I    marked
down what they showed at different times.

     From      these experiments we are authorised to draw the fol
  lowing     results:    in the red rays my thermometer gave 6\
  degrees in the 1st, and 7 degrees in thead, for the rising of
  the quicksilver: a mean of both is 6 \. In the 3d experiment
 \ve had 3 \ degrees, for the rising occasioned by the green
  rays; from which we obtain the proportion of 55 to a5,
  for the power of heating in red to that in green.                        The 4th
  experiment gave 3 degrees                 for  the  violet  rays;  and  therefore
  we have the rising of the quicksilver in red to that in violet,
  as 55 to 16.
     A sufficient    proof of the accuracy os this determination we
 have in the result of the four last experiments. The rising
 for red rays in the 5th, is                  i\ ; and in the 6th, 4 degrees :
 amtan'of both         is 3 J.           In the 7th experiment we have          if,
 and in the 8th a degrees, for the rising in the green                          s a
 mean     of  these is  1   \ .   Therefore,       we  have  the proportion  of the
 rising in red to that in green, as 37 to it, or as 55 to 32,4.
    We may take a mean of the result of both thermometers,
which will       be 55 to 34,2, or more than 2^ to 1,                    ih  red to
green;      and about 3! to 1,             in red to violet.
    It  appears remarkable, that the most sensible thermometer
ftould     give   the least alteration, from the exposure to the co
loured rays.        But    since, in these circumstances, there are two
causes constantly acting different ways:                   the one to raise the
                                           S s a                    thermometer,

3 16                On the Powers     of   the prismatic Colours
thermometer, the other to bring it down to the temperature
of the room, I suppose that, on account of the smallness of
the ball in Dr. Wilson's No. i, which rs but little more than.
   of an inch, the cooling causes must have a stronger effect
•|th
on the mercury which it contains than they can have on
mine, the ball of which is half an inch.
   More accuracy may hereafter be obtained by attending to
the circumstances of blacking the balls of the thermometers,
and their exposure to a more steady and powerful light of the
sun, at greater altitudes than it can be had at present; but
the experiments which have been related are quite sufficient
for my present purpose; which only goes to prove that the,
heating power of the prismatic colours is very far from being
equally divided, and that the red rays are chiefly eminent in
that respect.
     Experiments         on the   illuminating Power of coloured Rays.
     In   the following examination           of   the illuminating        power   of
differently coloured rays, I had two ends in view. The first
was with regard to the illumination itself, and the next with
respect to the aptness of the rays for giving distinct vision;
and, though there did not seem to be any particular reason
why these two should not go together, I judged it right to at
tend to both.
   The microscope offered itself as the most convenient instru
ment for this investigation; and I thought it expedient to
view only opaque objects, as these would give me an oppor
tunity to use a direct prismatic ray, without running the
risk of any bias that might be given to                it,
                                               in its transmission
through   the colouring particles of transparent objects.

the window,             so
                  as to make the coloured    image of the fun
stationary upon the table where the microscope was placed,                         I
caused the differently coloured rays to fall successively on the
object         by
          advancing the microscope                    into their light.        The
magnifying power was 27 times.
     In changing         the illumination,     by   admitting    a   different co
lour,     it always becomes necessary to re-adjust the instrument.

    will   sensibly affect the focal length          of object- glasses; but in
    compound vision, such              as in a microscope, where a very small
    lens is made to cast             a lengthened secondary focus, this dif
    ference becomes             still more considerable.
       By      an attentive      and repeated       inspection, I found that my
  object was very well               seen    in   red, betterin orange, and still
„ better in yellow; full              as    well in green; but to less advantage
    in blue     ; -indifferently well         in indigo,    and with more imper
    fection in violet.
      The trial -was made upon one of the microscopic objects
    which are generally prepared for transparent vision 5 but as                      I
    used it in the opaque way, I thought that others might be
    chosen which would answer the purpose better; and,                         in order
    to give some variety to my experiments,                     and to fee the effect
    which differently coloured substances might have on the rays
    of light, I provided the following materials to be viewed:- — red
    paper, green paper, a piece of brass, a nail, a guinea, black
    paper.        Having        also found that a higher power might be
    used, with sufficient convenience for the rays                  of light   to come
    from the prism to the objects                 I   made the microscope      magnify
    43 times.
        The appearance of the nail in the microscope is so beau
     tiful, that it deserves to be noticed; and the more so, as it is
     accompanied with circumstances that are very favourable for
     an investigation, such as that which is under our present con
     sideration.       I    had chosen         it on account of      its   solidity and
     blackness,       as    being most likely to give an impartial result             of
     the modifications arising from an illumination by differently
     coloured rays ; but, on viewing       was struck with the fight

     nating colour,    but differed considerably in brightness; some
•    of the points being dim and faint, while others were lumi
     nous and brilliant. The brightest of them also admitted of
     a little variation in their colour, or rather in the intensity of
     the same colour; for in the centre of some of the most brilliant
     of these lucid appearances, their light had more vivacity, and
     seemed to deviate from the illuminating tint towards white
                                                                                   ness,

      An object; so well livided by nature into very minute an3
   differently arranged points, on which the attention might be
  fixed, in order to ascertain whether they would be equally
  distinct in all colours, and whether their number would be
  increased or diminished by different degrees              of illumination,
  was exactly what I wanted ; nor could I think it less re
  markable, that all, the other objects I had fixed upon, besides
 many more which have been examined, such as copper, tin,
 silver, &c. presented themselves nearly with the fame ap
 pearance.         In  the brass,     which  had been    turned in a lathe,
 the luminous          points were arranged in furrows;              and  in tin
 they were       remarkably beautiful.          The result of      the exami
 nation of my objects was as follows :

 which serves me as a mark; and I notice the space between the
 point and the spot        ;   it contains   several saint    points: In the
 orange rays I fee better ; the bright point I                now perceive is

    From these observations, which               agree  uncommonly well
with    respect to the illuminating          power assigned to each co
lour,    we may conclude          that the red-making rays are very
far from having it in any eminent degree.                  The orange pos
sess more of it than the red; and the yellow rays illuminate
objects still more perfectly. The maximum of illumination
lies in the brightest yellow, or palest green. The green itself
is nearly equally bright with the yellow; but, from the full
 deep green, the         illuminating     power decreases very sensibly.
That of the blue is nearly upon a par with that of the red ;
the indigo has much less than the blue ; and the violet is
very deficient.
    With      regard to the principle       of distinctness,  there appears
to be no deficiency in any one of the colours.                 In the violet
rays, for instance, some of the experiments mention that I
saw badly;       but this is to be understood only with respect to
the number of small objects that could be perceived; for,
although I saw fewer of the points, those which remained
visible were always as distinct as, in so feeble an illumination,
could he expected.            It must   indeed    be evident that, by re
moving the great obstacle to distinct vision, which is the dif
ferent refrangibility of the rays of light, a microscope will be
capable of a much higher degree of distinctness than it can
 be under the usual circumstances.                   A celebrated optical
 writer has formerly remarked              that a fly, illuminated by red-
 rays, appeared uncommonly              distinct,  and that all its minute
 parts might be seen in great perfection ; and, from the ex
 periments which have been related, it appears £hat every,
other colour is                  of the  fame advantage,
                                                                      Iw

      I
      am well aware that the results I have drawn from the
 foregoing experiments, both with regard to the heating and
illuminating powers of differently coloured rays, must be af
fected by some little inaccuracies.    The prism, under the
circumftances in which I have used         could not effect   it,                        a
complete separation of the colours, on account of the ap
parent diameter of the fun, and the considerable breadth
of     the      prism        itself,    through which         the   rays   were    trans
mitted.
   Perhaps an arrangement like that in Fig. 16. of the New
tonian experiments might be employed,          instruments of       if
sufficient sensibility, such as air thermometers, can be pro
cured, that may be affected     the enfeebled illumination of
                                                   by
rays that have undergone four transmissions and eight refrac
tions      ;   and especially         when their incipient quantity has been
 sogreatly reduced                  in their limited passage through    small     a
hole at the first incidence.
      But      it   appeared most expedient              for me, at present, to neg
lect all further refinements, which may be attempted here
after at leisure.    may even be presumed that, had there
                              It
not been some small admixture of the red rays in the other
colours, the result would have been still more decisive with
regard to the power of heating vested in .the red rays. And
it   likewise evident, that at least the red light of the pris
      is
matic spectrum was much less adulterated than any of the
other colours their refractions tending all to throw them
                       ;
from the red.      That the fame rays which occasion the
greatest        heat,        have      not the power of illumination              in any
strong degree, stands on as good foundation. For, since here
                                                     a
also they have undergone the fairest trial, as being most free
from other colours,      equally proved that they illuminate
                                       it   is
objects but imperfectly.  There      some probability that
                                                         is                              a
ray, purified   the Newtonian
                        in      manner   above quoted, espe
cially in       a     well darkened              room, may remain bright enough
to serve        the purpose             of microscopic illumination,         in which
case       more precision can easily be obtained.
     The     greatest cause for mixture of colours, however, which
                                            a

    The phænomena of                      the differently       coloured points being
now completely resulved, since they were plainly owing to
the former admixture of colours, and the illuminating power,
remaining ascertained as before, I attempted also to repeat
the experiments upon the thermometer, with the prism co
vered in the same manner; 'but I found the effect of t^ie
coloured rays too much enfeebled to give a decisive result.
    I might         now proceed            to my next subject;  but it may be
pardonable             if I
                 digress for a                   moment, and remark that the
foregoing researches ought to lead us on to others.                                       May
not the chemical properties of the prismatic colours                                      be   as,

quantity of radiant heat contained in         fun-beam,       this   a                  if

formly on      space equal to the area of the prism; and,

radiant heat were not refrangible at all,       would fall upon          it
an equal        space      in    the place where the shadow       of the prism,
when         covered,       may be seen.            But neither of these events

laws of refraction, and also to those of the different refran
gibility of light.                 May not this        lead us tp surmise              that ra
diant heat consists              of particles of light of                 a certain range of
momenta, and which range may extend                                   a   little further, on
each side of refrangibility, than that    light? We have             of

  334     .       Oh the Powers       of  the prismatic Colours
  of  heat, which lies at the other extreme.              By several experts
  merits, which time will not allow me now to report, it appears
  that the maximum of illumination has little more than half
  the heat      of the full red rays      ; and, from other experiments,
  I likewise conclude         that the full red falls still short of the
  maximum of heat; which perhaps lies even a little beyond
  visible   refraction.      In this     cafe,  radiant heat will at least
  partly,   if  not chiefly, consist, if I may be permitted the ex
  pression,    of invisible light   ; that is to fay, of rays coming from
  the fun, that have such a momentum as to be unfit for vision.
  And admitting,         as   is highly probable, that the organs of
  fight are only adapted to receive impressions from particles
  of a certain momentum, it explains why the maximum of
 illumination       should be in the middle         of the refrangible rays ;
  as those which         have    greater    or less momenta are likely to
  become equally unfit for impressions              of fight. ' Whereas in
  radiant heat, there may be no such limitation                 to the mo
  mentum of its particles. From the powerful effects of a
  burning lens, however, we gather the information, that the
  momentum of terrestrial radiant heat is not likely to exceed
 that of the fun ; and that, consequently, the refrangibility of
  calorific rays cannot extend much beyond that of colourtfic
  light.     Hence we may also infer that the invisible heat of
  red-hot iron, gradually cooled till it ceases to stiine, has the
  momentum of the invisible rays which, in the solar spectrum
  viewed by dav-light, go to the confines of red ; and this will
  afford    an   easy  solution of the reflection of invisible heat by
  concave mirrors.

   Application of the Result of the foregoing Observations to the
      Method of viewing the Sun advantageously, with Tele
     scopes of large Apertures and high Magnifying Powers.
      Some time before          the late transit     of Mercury     over the
  disk of the sun,     I  prepared my 7-feet telescope, in order to see
  it to the best advantage. As I wished to keep the whole aper
  ture   of the miror open, I soon cracked everv one of the
  darkened flips of wedged glasses, which are generally used
  with achromatic telescopes : none of them could withstand
  the accumulated heat in the focus of pencils, where these
                                                                      glasses

                   to Heat and Illuminate ObjeBs.                  325
glasses are generally placed.      Being thus left without resource,
I  made use   of red   glasses; but  was by no means satisfied with
their performance. My not being better prepared, as it hap
pened, was of no consequence;            the weather proving totally
unfavourable for viewing the sun at the time of the transit.
However,     as  I  was fully aware     of  the necessity of providing
an apparatus     for this purpose,     since  no method that was     in
use  could be applied to my telescopes, I took the first oppor
tunity of beginning my trials.
   The instrument I wished to adapt for solar inspection, was a
Newtonian reflector, with 9 inches- aperture ; and my aim
was to   use the    whole of it open.
   I  began  with    a red glass;   and, not finding it to stop light
enough, took two of them together. These intercepted full
as much light as was necessary; but I soon found that the
eye   could not bear the irritation from a sensation of heat,
which it appeared these glasses did not stop.
    I now took two green glasses : but found that they did not
intercept light enough. I therefore smoked one of them; and
it appeared that,     notwithstanding they now still transmitted
considerably    more     light than the red glasses, they remedied
the former inconvenience of an irritation arising from heat.
Repeating these trials several times, I constantly found the
fame result ; and, the sun       in the first case being of a deep red
colour,   I  surmised      that the red-making rays, transmitted
through red glasses, were more efficacious in raising a sensa
tion of heat than those which passed through green, and
which caused the sun to look greenifli.            In consequence of
this surmise, I undertook the investigations which have been
delivered   under the two first heads.
   As   soon as    T was. convinced that the red light of the fun
ought to be intercepted on account of the heat it occasions,
and that it might also be safely set aside, since it was now
proved that pale green light excels in illumination, the method
which ought     to be pursued       in  the construction   of a  dark
ening apparatus       was sufficiently pointed out ;      and nothing
remained but to find such materials as would give us the
colour of the fun, viewed in a telescope, of a pale green light,
sufficiently tempered for the eye to bear its lustre,
                                                                    To

 3&6             On    lie Powers os         the prismatic Colours
    To deteffnine what glasses would most effectually stop the
 ted rays, I proteased some of all colours, and tried them m
 the following manner :^— I placed a prism in the upper past
 of * window, and received its coloured spectrum upon a
 sheet  6f white       paper.        Then I     intercepted     the   colours, juft
before they came to the paper,                     successively,    by the glasses,
and found the1 result as follows:                 a deep red glass      intercepted
a4) the rays ; a paler          red did the fame.
    From this       we ought not to conclude, that red glasses will
stop   the  red   rays ; but rather, that none of the sum's light, after
Jt* dispersion by the prism, remains intense enough to pass
through red glasses in sufficient quantity to be perceptiWe.
#hert it comes to the paper.                   By looking through them di
rectly    as  the-   fun,    or    even    at  day objects, it is sufficiently
evident that they transmit chiefly red rays.
    An orange- glass transmitted nearly all the red, the orange,
and the yellow. If intercepted some of the green, much of the
blue, arid very little of the indigo and violet.— A yellow glass
mtercepted       hardly any light of any one of the colours.— A
dark greeh glass intercepted nearly all the red, and partly also
the orarigeand yellow.                It transmitted the green, intercepted
much      of the blue, but none of the indigo                      arid violet. — A
darker" gteCti        glass intercepted          nearly all the red, much of

green, stopped         some of the blue, but transmitted the indigo
and violet.—A Blue glass intercepted much of the red and
orange; someof the yellow, hardly any of the green, done
of the' Wue> indigo, or violet.—A purple glass transmitted
some of trie-red;             a very- little of the orahge and yellow.
It  also transmitted a little-          of the     green- and blue, but more
Of the indigo and          violet ¦

must      not     be   touched     ;   then, with

moved the slider to the second, and then to the third.          This
kept  the  glasses sufficiently  cool : but  the disturbance   of the
alterations proved  hurtful to vision, which requires repose ;

endangered         the eye.

    No. 23. The heat near the small speculum being still too>
powerful for the glasses, I had a blueifh dark green glass made
of a proper diameter to be inclosed between the two eye
glasses of a double eye-piece.           All glass T knew would stop
some heat;       and was therefore     in hopes that the interposition
of this eye-glass would temper the rays, so as in some measure
to protest the coloured glass. In the usual place near the eve,
\   put two White glasses, with a thin coat of pitch between
therh.      These glasses, when looked through by the natural
eye, give the fun of a red colour; I therefore entertained no
great hopes of their application to the telescope.                 They
darkened the fun not sufficiently ; and when the pitch was
 thickened distinctness      was wanting.
    No.    24.   The fame glass between the eye-glasses, and a

coloured glass receives them on a large surface, and stops light
and heat in the proportion of the squares of its diameter now
used, to that on which the rays would have fallen had it
been placed in the focus                   of pencils       ;   and for the fame rea

upon the former, with the smoked side towards the eye, that
the smoke might likewise be protected against heat by a pas*
(age of the rays through two surfaces of coloured glass.
     This     position        had moreover           the advantage        of leaving the
telescope, with its mirrors and glasses, completely to perform
its operation before the application of the darkening appa
ratus ; and thus to prevent the injury which must be occa
sioned       by the interposition of the heterogeneous                           colouring
matter of the glasl^s and of the smoke.

whiter colour than with the farmer composition. There was
no disagreeable sensation of heat, though     little warmth           a
might be felt.

Jlere there was no occasion for smoke; but the sun ap
peared of  bright scarlet colour, and .an intolerable sensation
               a
of    heat took place immediately.                     I    rather suspect that these
fire very deep red glasses, though their outward appearance                                is

telescopes that have so much light                 as mv io-fect reflector;

earlier in the morning and later in the afternoon ; for the
light, intercepted by the atmosphere in lower altitudes, will
reduce      its   brilliancy    much      more uniformly      than we can
soften     it by laying on more smoke upon our darkening
glasses.      Now, as few instruments in common use are so
Ijrge as that to which this method of darkening has been
adapted, we may hope that it will be of general utility in
solar observations.

 III.   Account os a Series         of Experiments,    undertaken  with   the
    View of        decomposing tht      Muriatic Acid.      By Air.   WlL-
    j-iam Henry.
 A
                          [Concluded from Page 218.]
         GREAT          variety  of similar experiments convinced me,
that, by electrifying together the carbonated hydrogenous and
 muriatic gases, not the smallest progress was made towards
 the decomposition of the latter.                All that was thus effected
               in  the decomposition of the water of the two gases
 consisted
 by   the carbon       of   the combustible gas ; and, when this was
 completely accomplished, no further effect ensued from con
 tinuing the electrisation. The generation of carbonic acid
 was proved by the following experiment:
    Exper. 14. To a mixture of carbonated hydrogen and mu
 riatic gases, after having received above 100 shocks, a drop
 of water was admitted, which absorbed the muriatic acid.
 The liquid was            then   taken    up by blotting-paper; and the
 residuary       gas,    being     transferred    into another tube, was
  brought      into    contact    with a solution of pure barytic earth.
  The precipitation of this solution evinced the presence of car
 bonic acid.
     It  was desirable,       however, that the effects should be ascer
                                                                      tained,

              Experiments     to decompose   the Muriatic Acid.          33J
 tamed,      of electrifying    together pure muriatic acid and pure
 carbonated       hydrogenous gas, both' perfectly free from water.
 Now, from         the experiments related         in  the first section,   it
  appears highlv probable that a complete purification from
 moisture is produced, in both gases, by the action of the
  electric fluid ; all the water they before contained being thus
  decomposed.         In   the following     experiments, therefore,      the
  two     gases   were   separately electrified    before  they   were   sub
  mitted to this process conjointly.
      Exper. 15. To a portion of muriatic acid, diminished by
  the action of electricity from 144 to 131 measures, 37 mea
  sures of carbonated          hydrogenous gas, expanded as far as
  possible, were added, and 200 shocks passed through the               mixr
  ture.      The addition of permanent         gas amounted      to 14 mea
  sures; 10 of which may be traced              to the muriatic acid, and
  were     evolved   by its separate electrisation.         The remaining
  four measures,       which remain to be accounted for, are too
   small a quantity to be ascribed         to the decomposition        of the
   acid.
       Exper. 16. To a quantity of carbonated hydrogenous gas,
   which had received 40c shocks, and occupied the space of
   312 measures, I added 233 of muriatic acid, through which
   200 shocks had previously been passed.               The electrisation of
   the mixture was next continued till 800 discharges had taken
   place.      On examining the mixture of gases during this ope
   ration,     no change whatever took place ; and, after its close,
   no more muriatic acid had disappeared than would have been
   deficient after the first electrisation ; nor was there any fur
   ther production of permanent gas.
       Exper. 17. The fame result was obtained by electrifying
   together 280 measures of carbonated hydrogenous gas, pre
   viously expanded by 600 (hocks, and 114 of muriatic acid,
    after   400 shocks.        The additional discharge, through this
    mixture, of 1000 shocks, did not evince the smallest progress
    towards the decomposition of the muriatic acid.
       Exper. 18. In the naturally moist state of              these gases,   it
    follows,    from the      14th experiment, that carbonic acid is
    produced by electrifying them in conjunction.                 It appeared
    to  me    of  some   importance    to ascertain   whether,    after a pre-
*                                                                        vioua

  J34        Experiments   to decompose   the Muriatic Acid.
  viou$ decomposition      of their moisture, carbonic     acid would
  continue to be generated.       But the electrified carbonated hy
 drogenous gas itself contains carbonic acid, which, unless
 removed, would render the result of the experiment unde
 cisive.    This    wag accomplished     by passing up, to a portion
 of electrified   gas, a bubble or two       of dry ammoniacal gas,
 which, uniting with the carbonic acid, would condense any
 portion of it that might be present.            The remainder was
 transferred     into another tube ; and to this carbonated hy
 drogenous gas, perfectly deprived both of moisture and car
 bonic acid, muriatic acid gas, previoufly electrified, was
 added, and electrical shocks were pasted through the mix
 ture. A drop of water wae then admitted ; and the residu
 ary gas, after having been dried, was transferred       into another
 tube.    On    pasting up barytic water, not the smallest trace   of
 carbonic acid could be discovered.
     From the preceding experiments, the following conclusions
 may be deduced :
     1. The muriatic acid gas, in the driest state in which it
 can be procured, still contains a portion of water. From a
 calculation founded on the experiments described in the first
 section, the grounds of which are too obvious to require
 being stated, it follows that ioo cubical inches of muriatic
gas, after exposure to muriat of lime, still hold in combina
 tion i .4 grain of water.
     2. When electrical shocks are passed through this gas, the
watery portion i* decomposed.           The hydrogen of the water!
uniting with the electric matter, constitutes hydrogenous gas,
and the oxvgen unites with the muriatic acid ; which lass,
acting on the mercury, composes muriat of mercury.
     3. The electric fluid serves as an intermedium in com
bining oxvgen with murhlic acid.
    4. The really ae'd portion of muriatic gas does (tot sustain
any decompositioa by the action of electricity.
    5. When electric (hocks are passed through a mixture of
carbonated hydrogen and muriatic acid gases, tbe water held
in solution by these gases is decomposed by the carbon of the
compound inflammable gas; and carbonic acid arid hydro
genous    gases   are U*e result.
                                                            fi.Whcfc

           Experiments   to decompose  the Muriatic Acid*            335
    6. When all the water of the two        gases has been      decom-
posedj no effect ensues from continuing the electrisation          ;  or,
if  the water of each gas has been previously     destroyed by elec
trifying them separately,     no further effect ensues from eleo
trifying them conjointly.
    7. Since, therefore, carbon, though placed under the most
favourable circumstances for abstracting from the muriatic
acid, and combining with its oxygen, evinces no such tend
ency, it may be inferred, that, if the muriatic acid be an oxy
genated substance, its radical has a stronger affinity for oxygen
than charcoal    possesses.
    Though the 'first impressions excited in my mind by the
total failure of the above experiments, in accomplishing one
of the greatest objects of modern chemistry, have induced me
for some time to withhold them from the society, I am sa
tisfied, by reflection, that this communication is not without
expediency.      The   means    employed   in attempting       the ana
lysis  of the muriatic acid, were such as, after mature delibe
ration, appeared to me most to promise success ; and the ex
periments were attended with a degree of labour, which can
only be estimated by those who have been engaged in similar
pursuits;    not one third of those which         were    really  made
having been described in the foregoing account          of them. It
may spare, therefore, to others, a fruitless     application' of time
and trouble, to be made acquainted with what            I  have done ;
and the collateral facts,    which have presented themselves in
 the inquiry, are perhaps not without curiosity or value.
     From the result of these experiments, I apprehend, all hope
must be relinquished of effecting the decomposition of the
 muriatic acid in the way of single elective affinity.             They
 fumisli also a strong probability that the basis of the muriatic
 acid is some unknown body;         for no combustible substance
 with which    we are acquainted    can retain oxygen, when sub
 mitted in contact with charcoal, to the action of electricity,
 or of  a high temperature.      The analysis of this acid must, in
 future, be attempted     with the aid of complicated affinities.
 Thus, in    the masterly    experiment of    Mr. Tennant,        phos
 phorus, which attracts oxygen less strongly than charcoal,
•by the intermediation of lime, decomposes the carbonic acid.
                     7                                               Yet,

33^            Experiments           to decompose    tie Muriatic Acid.
Yet,     led by the analogy            of this fact,   its discoverer found that
a similar artifice did not succeed in decomposing the muriatic
acid.      "
          As vital air," he observes,                  "
                                          is attracted by a com
pound of phosphorus and calcareous earth more powerfully
than by charcoal, I was desirous of trying their efficacy upon
those acids  which may from analogy be supposed to contain
vital air, but which are not affected by the application of
charcoal.   With this intention, I made phosphorus pass
through a compound of marine acid and calcareous earth,
and also of fluor acid and calcareous earth,                      but without pro
ducing in either of them any alteration.                           Since the strong
attraction which these acids have for calcareous earth tends
to prevent their decomposition, it might be thought, that in
this manner they were not more disposed to part with vital
air than by the attraction of charcoal : but this, however,
does not appear to be the fact.   I have found that phos
phorus cannot be obtained by pasting marine acid through
a compound  of bones and charcoal when red-hot. The at
traction, therefore,            of phosphorus and lime for vital air ex
ceeds the attraction             of charcoal by a greater force than that
arising from the            attraction of marine acid for lime *."
    By means similar to those employed in attempting the ana

acid.     When electrified alone, in                  a glass tube coated inter
nally with wax, it              sustained a diminution        of bulk,         and there
remained       a   portion of hydrogenous             gas.    But neither in this
mode, nor by submitting                  it,
                               mixed with carbonated hydro
genous gas, to the   action   of  electricity, was any progress
made towards its analysis.       These experiments, however,
render  probable,
          it       that  the fluoric  acid, like the muriatic,                           is
susceptible        of   still   further oxygenation,         in   which    state   it   be
comes     capable          of acting on mercury.              The carbonic acid,
on the contrary, appears not to admit of two different degrees
of oxygenation. When the electric shock has been repeat

  JLn      the   fourth     volume of the        Philosophical Magazine,
 p. t59, 163, and 306, we laid before our reader's M. Volta's
 account of the progress he had then made in Galvanism ; and
 in our number for May last we Hated that Mr. Car
 lisle. had been making some experiments which, were likely
 to lead     to some important .discovery, in, Galvanic electricity.
 We     should have then mentioned, but, .we .knew not the fact,
 that he made           them     in conjunction       with Ms. Nicholson,
 editor of a well conducted and well known philosophical
 journal.      When we learnt the circumstance, mptives of de
licacy, which our readers must apprpve, forbade pur, attempt
 ing- to give any further particulars tilj Mr. Nicholson him
 self, who had the best right, mould first lay them before the
 public.
     Since that time Mr. Nicholson has published several cu
 rious and important papers on this subject, from which we
 shall now select a few particulars for the information of our
 readers; referring those who may with for a fuller account,
 to   Mr. Nicholson's journal.

338              Experiments in Galvanic Eh&ricity.
Mr. Anthony Carlisle, having           been favoured    with a perusal
of this    paper by the very respectable      President of the Royal
Society, the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart, soon after,
in conjunction with Mr. Nicholson, began to repeat the ex
periments of M. Volta, and obtained similar results.             Very
early in this course, the contacts being made sure by placing
a drop of water upon the upper plate of the pile, Mr. Car
lisle observed a disengagement of gas round the conducting
wire.      This   gas, though minute in quantity, seemed to Mr.
Nicholson       to have the smell of hydrogen when the wire of
communication was steel.           This, with some other facts, led
him    to propose     to break the circuit by the substitution of a
tube of water between two wires.           Accordingly,   a brass wire
through each        of two corks  was inserted at the opposite    ends
of a   glass tube about half an inch in diameter, silled between
the corks with water       : the distance between the points of the
wires in the water, was about an inch and three quarters.
    " This compound discharger was applied so that the external
ends   of   its wire were in contact with the two extreme plates
of   a  pile   of thirty-six half crowns with       the correspondent
pieces    of zinc   and pasteboard.    A fine  stream  of minute bub
bles immediately began to flow from the point of the lower
wire in the tube, which communicated with the silver, and
the opposite point of the upper wire became tarnished, first
deep orange, and then black.            On reversing the tube, the
gas came from the other point, which was now lowest, while
the upper, in its turn, became tarnished and black.                Re
versing the tube again, the phenomena again changed their
order. In this state the whole was left for two hours and
a half.       The upper wire gradually emitted whitish filmy
clouds, which, towards the end of the process, became of a
pea-green colour, and hung in perpendicular threads from
the extreme half inch of the wire, the water being rendered
semi-opaque by what fell off, and in a great part lay, of a
pale green, on the lower surface of the tube, which, in this
disposition    of  the apparatus,   was inclined about forty degrees
to the horizon.        The lower wire,    three quarters  of  an  inch
lone, constantly emitted gas, except when another circuit, or
complete wire, was applied to the apparatus ; during which
                                                                  time

                 Experiments in Galvanic Eleclricity.                 339
time the emission of gas was suspended.                  When this last
mentioned wire was removed, the gas reappeared as before,
not instantly, but after the lapse of four beats of a half second
clock standing in the room. The product of gas, during the
whole two hours and a half, was two- thirtieths of a cubic
inch.       It was then mixed with an equal quantity         of common
air,and exploded by the application of a lighted waxed thread."
     To have reversed the tube would have answered the same
purpose, but they chose to do this,
                                               "  and found that, when
 the zinc was at the bottom, its effects were reversed ; that is
 to fay,    the gas still came from the wire communicating            with
 the silver,"    &c.
     Messrs.' Carlisle and Nicholson were " led, by reason
 ing on the. first appearance of hydrogen, to expect a decom-
 position of water; but it was with no little surprise that they
 found the hydrogen extricated at the contact with one wire,
 while the oxygen fixed itself in combination with the other
 wire at the distance of almost two inches. As the distance
 between the wires formed a striking feature in this result, it
 became desirable       to ascertain    whether it would take place to
 greater distances.       When     a   tube   three quarters  of an   inch
  in diameter, and thirty-fix inches long, was made use of, the
  effect failed, though the very same wires, inserted intoafliorter
  tube, operated very      briskly."
     The experiment being          tried with tincture os litmus in
  place   of. water, and the oxydating wire, namely, from the
  zinc side, being lowest in the tube, it changed the tincture
  red in about ten min.utes as high as the upper extremity of
  the wire. The other portion remained blue. Hence it seems
  either an acid was formed, or that a portion of the oxygen
  combined with the litmus, so as to produce the effect -ofan
  acid.
      "  It  may be here offered       as  a general    remark, that the
  electric pile with card, or with woollen cloth, continues in
  order for about two days, or scarcely three; that, from a series
  of glasses   set up by. Mr. Carlisle,     as  well as  from the pile it
  self, it appears that the fame process of decomposition of
  water is carried on between each pair of plates, the zinc
  being oxyded on the wet face, and hydrogen given out              ;  that
                                     X   x 3                            the

 the common salt is decomposed, and exhibits an efflorescence
 of soda round the edges of the pile, extruded, most probably,
 by the hydrogen : and that, on account of the corrosion of
 the faces of the zinc, it is necessary to renew them previously
 to each     construction of the pile.           This may     be done by
 scraping or grinding."
    By several accurate      and well conducted experiments,          Mr.
Nicholson ascertained          that   the   electricity of  the zinc   was
 plus, and that of the silver minus, which ever of them were
at the top    of the pile. The electric spark was even rendered
visible;    so that there can be      no doubt of the identity of the
electric and Galvanic fluid.
    The decomposition of water,              and  oxydation of metallic
wire, suggested other experiments.              Two small wires of pla-
 lina were inserted, as before, in            a short  tube.    When   the
connection       with    the  pile was formed, the wire from the
silver gave a plentiful stream        of gas, and that from the zinc a
smaller one.        In four hours, neither turbidness, oxydation,
nor tarnilh appeared.         The larger stream was naturally sup
posed to be hydrogen, the smaller oxvgen.
    With thick gold leaf        instead   of platina,   the result was the
fame,    only the extremity of the slip connected            with the zinc
acquired a coppery or purplisli tinge.
    A  brass wire was substituted         for one of the flips of gold.
When       the   former was joined to the silver end, the two
streams were extricated as before; but when joined to the
zinc, it became oxyded, as when both the wires were of
brass.
    The   simple decomposition        of water by platina wires, with
out oxydation, offered a means of obtaining the gases sepa
rate from each other.          This was tried with a pile of sixty-
eight sets.      A wire from each end of the pile passed under
separate    phials   full of water inverted in a saucer of water.
" A    cloud of gas arose from each wire, but most from the
silver or minus. side.       Bubbles were extricated from all parts
of the    water,    and   adhered    to the whole internal surface of
the  vessels.    The process was continued for thirteen hours,
after which     the  wires were disengaged, and the gases decanted
into separate bottles. On measuring the quantities, which
                                                                       was

                  Experiments in Galvanic Eleclricity.             341
  was done by weighing the bottles, 'it was found that the
 quantities of witer displaced by the gases were, respectively,
  73 grains by the gas from the zinc fide, and i4» grains by
 the gas from the silverside; so that the whole volume of gas
 was r.17 cubic inches, or near an inch and a quarter. These
  are nearly the proportions in bulk of what are stated to be
 the component parts of Water.           The gas from the zinc fide
 being tried with one measure of nitrons gas, contracted to
 T.25, and did not contract more by the addition of another
 measure; the gas 'from the silver fide, by the fame treatment,
 contracted to 1.6. The air of the room, on trial, contracted
 to   i.i8.    From    the smallness   of the quantity, no    attempt
 was made lo detonate        the air from the  zinc side; but- a por
 tion of that from the' silver fide,    being mixed with one-third
 of atmospheric air, gave a loud detonation.
     " Upon the above it may be remarked, that it            doeS  not
 seem probable that oxygen was afforded by both wires, but that
 they were mixed by the circumstances of the experiment."
    Mr. Cruickfhank, of Woolwich^ also made some interest
 ing experiments on this subject.            He employed plates of
 zinc    and silver about 1.6 inches square;      and the number     of
each varied from 40 to too, according to the power required.
 He used silver wire both from the zinc and silver plate in his
first experiments ; but to distinguish the ends      of the pile, that
wire only is called the silver wire, which was connected with
the silver plates the other wire'he calls (to save circumlocu
tion) the zinc wire. These wires were passed through cork3
fitted into   a  glass tube filled with water, and one of the corks
made perfectly tight by means of cement.             " The tube was
then placed upright in a cup containing water, with the un-
cemented end downwards.            As soon as the conrirfunication
was made between the extremities of ;the pile by the wires,
a quantity     of  small air bubbles began to ascend from the end
of  the wire connected with the silver, as observed by Messrs.
Nicholson and Carlifle; but a white cloud at the same time
made its appearance at the one proceeding from the Zinc, or
the zinc wire. This cloud gradually increased, and assumed
a darker colour, and at last it became purple, or even black.
A    very few air bubbles were         likewise collected upon and
    ,                                                       ascended

34-3          Experiments in Galvanic EleQricitj.
ascended from this    wire; but when       the machine was          in full
force, a considerable    stream could be observed.
   " The gas   was collected, and found to be         a  mixture of hy
drogen and oxygen,      in   the  proportion of three        parts of the
former to one of the latter. No great dependence, however,
was placed upon this in point of accuracy. The zinc wire
was found to be much corroded, and looked as                isa  consider
able portion of it had been dissolved.            As the cloud which
was formed around this wire became purple on exposure to
the light, Mr. Cruickfliank suspected it might be luna cor
nea, or muriat of silver proceeding from the silver, which
had been somehow dissolved, and afterwards precipitated in
this state, by the muriatic salts in the common water."
   Distilled water, to which a little tincture of litmus was
added, was next employed in the tube.           Gas arose from both
wires, but in greatest quantity from the silver wire.                  In a
short time, the whole fluid below the point of the zinc wire
became red, and the fluid above the silver wire looked of a
deeper blue than before,       the flight tinge   of purple being       de
stroyed.
   Distilled water, tinged with Brazil wood, soon became of
as deep a   purple as could be produced by ammonia, while
the portion of the fluid round the zinc wire became very
pale.    From   these experiments it appears            to   Mr. Cruick
stiank, that an acid, probably the nitrous,         is produced at the
wire connected    with the zinc, and an alkali, probably am
monia, at that connected with the silver, end of the pile.
   When lime-water        was    employed, the wire was likewise
acted upon, but in a     less degree.     The cloud at first had an
olive colour, exactly resembling the precipitate of silver by
lime water.
    In these experiments the quantity          of  silver dissolved was
considerable, and, where water was employed, a portion of
it remained in solution, which was proved by adding muri
atic acid.   More would probably have been suspended, but
that an evident precipitation near the upper extremity of the
zinc wire, was occasioned by the alkali generated by the
process.

reduces metallic oxyds,        Mr. Cruickfhank filled         the glass tube
with a solution of       acetite   of  lead   to separate the hydrogen
from      the    oxygen, and thus obtain the latter pure.                 An
excess of acid was added to the acetite to take up the alkali :
in a minute or two after the communication was made, some
fine metallic needles, which afterwards assumed the form of a
feather,      or rather that of the crystals of ammonia, were per
ceivable      at the  end of the silver wire.         The lead was in its
 metallic stale.
     Solutions of sulphat       of  copper    and   nitrat of silver, were
 tried   in  the same way, and       with similar    results.    The  metals
 were revived.
     When       pure water, mixed with distilled vinegar or with a
 very   little   sulphuric acid, were employed in the tube, metallic
 silver was precipitated       by the silver wire, the acid employed
 preventing the alkali from precipitating the silver dissolved by
 the generated acid ; in consequence of which, when a suffi
 cient quantity of the metal was taken up, it was again thrown
  down by the silver wire in its metallic form.
     Muriat of ammonia in solution being tried, a little gas
  was disengaged from the silver wire : an incrustation of luna
  cornea was formed round the zinc wire.                    The liquor     re
  maining after the experiment, smelled strongly of ammonia.
  Common salt- was decomposed also.                Indeed, when a solu
  tion of muriat of soda or of ammonia is employed to moisten
  the papers in the pile, the salt is always decomposed.
      Nitrat of magnesia      was decomposed       by the same means.
      In some after experiments gold wires were tried, and the
  quantity of oxygen gas obtained was much greater than when
  silver wires were employed.
      Two gold wires       were    passed   through a cork loosely intro
  duced into the mouth of a three-ounce phial filled with lime
  water: the phial being inverted over pure prater, the exterior
  ends    of   the wires were connected with the pile in the usual
  way.       In four hours the phial      was filled with gas extricated
  from the wires, especially the one connected with the silver.
   One measure of the gas mixed with two of nitrous gas, a
   diminution       of one measure took place: the residuum con
   tained nitrous gas mixed with hydrogen.                    Four measures
                                                                     exploded

 exploded    by the electric spark over mercury, disappeared, ex
  cept about t't °f a measure, which appeared to be azot.
    Two- gold wire* were passed through corks, secured by
 cement in the ends of a glass tube, about 10 inches long,
 bent into the form of the letter V ; they reached to within
 an inch of each other, at the angle, in which there was a
 hole about one-tenth of an inch in diameter. The tube was
 then filled with distilled water, and the opening at the angle
 being shut with the finger to keep in the water, it was thus
 placed in a cup of water with the angle downwards.              The
 extremities of the wires being then joined to those of the
 pile, gas was disengaged from both, but most from that
 connected with the silver;         the gases were thus kept dis
tinct.    One measure of the gas from the silver end, mixed
 with , one of nitrous gas, gave red fumes, a diminution of
one-third of a measure,       and a residuum consisting of nitrous
and hydrogen gas. Two measures with one of oxygen being
exploded over mercury disappeared, except about one-fifth
of a measure, which by the nitrous test appeared to be
 chiefly oxygen. A dense white vapour was perceived over
the mercury for some time after the explosion. One mea
sure of the gas from the zinc end, being mixed with two of
nitrous gas, the whole nearly disappeared : another measure
of the latter being added, the total diminution was nearly
three measures.
    With platina wires Mr. Cruickfhank            obtained almost
similar results.     The one connected with the zinc end be
came    tarnistied ; the fame thing happened      when gold wires
were used.
    A  solution    of crystallized muriat of lime,    inclosed  in a
tube   in  the common manner, and gold wires being. em
ployed,   the   one from the silver gave little gas, but that from
the zinc a considerable quantity, and the fluid surrounding
k assumed a fine yellow colour, a solution of the gold having
been effected.      After a time some gas came from the first
wire, but there was no precipitation of .lime.          When the
tube was opened, the fluid -fmelled of aqua regia, or the
oxy-muriatie acid. When platina wires were employed in
place  of gold,   the smell of   nitro-muriatic acid was soon    ob-
                                 7                        . servable

    Mr. Cruickshank from              these experiments       draws the fol
lowing conclusions         :
    "  1.   That hydrogen gas, mixed with a very small pro
portion of oxygen and ammonia, is somehow disengaged at
the wire connected with the silver extremity of the machine;
and that this effect is equally produced, whatever the nature
of the metallic wire may be, provided the fluid operated upon
be pure water.
    "   a.  That where metallic solutions             are employed        instead
of   water,     the   fame wire which          separates the hydrogen re
vives     the metallic calx,       and deposits it at the extremity of
the wire in its pure metallic state;              in this cafe no hydrogen
gas is disengaged.           The wire employed for this purpose may
be   of  any metal.
    "  3. That of the earthy solutions, those of magnesia and
argill only are decomposed by the silver wire ; a circumstance
which strongly favours the production of ammonia.
    "   4. That when the wire connected with the zinc extre
mity of the pile consists either of gold or platina, a quantity
of oxygen gas, mixed with a little azot and nitrous acid, ia
disengaged ; and the quantity              of  gas thus obtained is a little
better than one-third           of  the hydrogen gas separated by the
silver wire at the same time.
    "  5. That when.the wire connected with the zinc is silver,
or any of the imperfect metals, a small portion of the oxy
genous gas is likewise given out, but the wire itself is either
oxydated or dissolved, or partly oxydated and partly dissolved :
indeed, the effect in this cafe, produced upon the metal, is very
similar to that of the concentrated nitrous acid, where a great
deal of the metal is oxydated, and but a small quantity held
in solution*.
   • The    great difference  in the effect produced bv this influence on gold
and   silver, which have      always   been   considered as equally   difficult   to
oxydatc, can only be explained on the supposition, that nitrous acid is ge
nerated ; for this acid, it is well known, acts powerfully on silver, but has
bo action whatever on gold.        The   fame obfci vation applies to platina.

   "   6. That when the gases, obtained by gold or platiu*
wires, are collected together and exploded over mercury,
the whole nearly disappears and forms water, with pro
bably a little nitrous acid, for there was always a thick
white vapour      perceived     for some time after the explosion.
The residuary gas in this cafe appeared to be azot."
   Acid solutions of metals having been decomposed,                     Mr.
Cruickfhank     tried their solution in alkalies.        Pure ammonia
was added to a dilute solution of nitrat of silver, till the mixture
fmelled strongly of the former. "Being put into a tube in the
usual way, with silver wires, and the communication                made, a
rapid production of gas took place from the silver end, but
hardly any from the zinc.            Grayim flashes of metallic silver
were separated from the silver wire,           and   on the zinc wire a
dark gray substance was deposited, which, on afterwards
endeavouring to scrape it off with the singer, exploded,
though still moist.        The wire was corroded and full of holes.
The fulminating        silver  of Berthollet    had in fact    been    pro
duced in this experiment.
   When      pure    ammonia       was   introduced      into    the   tube
in   place  of  the    solution of the       nitrat   of silver,   the re
sult   was  the   fame— the       silver  wire from the zinc          being
corroded,    Sec.   was    taken   up by the     alkali, and afterward*
deposited in its metallic form by the other wire.             To    the lirst
adhered    some    of   the fulminating    silver,  and   a  portion was
also deposited from the fluid, after standing some time.
   From pure ammonia, with copper wires, a quantity of
very pure metal       was precipitated   — from     an ammoniacal so
lution of copper the same pure metallic precipitate. From
these experiments Mr. Cruickfliank remarks, that it appears
that the Galvanic influence might be employed with success
in  the analysis   of minerals.
   Pure ammonia being introduced into a bottle, and in
verted over the fame fluid, with a cork and two wires, as
before described, (the wire connected with the zinc being
piatina and the other silver), a rapid decomposition of the
alkali was effected.        Two ounce measures of gas being col
lected   and   examined, was found          to consist   of 15 parts of
hydrogen gas,      13  of azotic,   and two nearly     of o.wgcn gas.
                                                                        The

                  Experiments       in  Galvanic Eleclricity,                  347
   The nitrous       acid seemed to he little or not at all acted upon
by the Galvanic influence, from which Mr. Cruickfhank in
fers that it is so perfect a conductor of the fluid as to transmit
it like  metals, without experiencing any change ; and this
he thinks may possibly be owing to the great proportion pf
oxygen, which enters into its composition, having before re
marked that all fluids, containing little or no oxygen, are
non-conductors, or nearly so.
    The corroded matter generated at the wire connected with
the zinc       are not,     Mr. Cruickfliauk         observes,    pureoxydes;
and it follows that an acid, as before mentioned, and probably
the nitrous,      is produced;        for all the green oxyds of copper
contain an acid           of some kind or other, the pure oxyds of
that metal being either dark red or deep brown.
    Mr. Nicholson's Journal also contains some interesting ex
periments on this subject made by Mr. Davy, of Bristol, which
gave results that almost all admit of the fame inferences that
have been made by Messrs. Nicholson,                    Carlisle, and Cruick
fhank.         He  made      an    ingenious      diversity in the circuit.
Tubes      silled with     distilled    water,    and    furnished with       gold
wires     connected with the pile, were inverted in different
glasses, and the communication between them formed by
muscular fibre       ;   the gases     were given off in great quantity,
and from several experiments                 pure oxygen and pure hydro
gen were separately obtained, nearly                in    the   proportions re
quired to form water.
    Some ingenious experiments                have also been made        by    Mr.
Henry, of Manchester, and* by Lieut. Col. Henry Haldanc;

34^            Experiments in Galvanic Eletlricily.    ,
 now fulfil my promise of writing to youj and having nothing
 better at present to communicate, request your acceptance of
 the following facts, results of some experiments, which, with
 the aid of Mr, Nicol, I have lately made in my leisure hours.
    ist, When     72 square pieces of copper, 73 of zinc, and 71
of moistened    pasteboard, each containing four square inches,
 and   not exceeding in thickness i-i6th of an inch, were
formed into    a column by being applied to each other in the
 Galvanic scries, viz. zinc, copper, pasteboard — sine, copper,
pasteboard, &c. &c, the column, though entirely composed
of oxydable materials, discovered a strong Galvanic power.
When      the  bottom of the column was touched with one
hand, and the top at the fame time with the other, both
hands being wet with brine, a stiock was felt fully as strong
as that which was given by an electrical jar having 80
square inches of coated surface.     Hence it appears that silver,
or a non-oxj dable metal, is by 110 means essential to the
excitation of the Galvanic power ; and indeed I apprehend
that a Galvanic column, consisting of copper, zinc, and
pasteboard,   will be found    as  powerful  as  an equal column
consisting qf silver, zinc, and pasteboard. The above column,
consisting of copper, zinc, and pasteboard, retained its power
with little diminution during a period of 36 hours.
    and, When pieces of copper, zinc, and moistened alumine
were formed into a column by being applied to each other in
the Galvanic series, viz. zinc, copper, alumine, &c. the
column gave     stio^ks  remarkably stronger than those it would
have given had pasteboard been used.           Hence a series of
curious experiments spontaneously present themselves, de
manding to be trr.d.       Hence a probability that the Galvanic
power may sometimes occur among the strata of the earth;
and hence a new theory of earthquakes will in all probability
ere long appear.
    3rd,  When      the  alumine in the Galvanic     column    was
moistened     with brine, instead of water, the surface of the
coliui n became,     in the course of three or four davs,  covered
with   a copious white esiloitscence, which when collected and
examined proved to-be loda nearly saturated with carbonic
jicid.   A like efflorescence was found in a column, in the
                                                      construction

                  Experiments in Galvanic      Eleilricitj:          349
construction of which         no alumine      was used.     The column
consisted     of copper and zinc, stratified with paper moistened
with brine, and furnished, you perceive, a pleasing proba
bility that the Qalvaiuc action of the metallic substances may
one day conduce to the arts of. utility; it being capable of
furnishing,       when duly employed, genuine soda from the salt
of    the sea.
     4th, When the Galvanic influence was transmitted, by
means of two brass wires, through an aqueous solution of the
carbonat of potafl), both were corroded where they touched
 the solution,      and both produced     or extricated gas.   The wire,
 however, which came from the copper, was manifestly less
 corroded than the other, though it yielded the largest pro
 portion of gas ; and the phænomena were not perceptibly
 changed by substituting linie in place of the alkali.
      Both the wires also gave gas when they were properly im
 mersed in some other fluids 5 but when inserted in the legs
 of an    inverted glass syphon, which had been previously filled
 with    distilled water, the mode of their action was seemingly
 changed : one was corroded without giving gas, whilst the
  other gavp gas without being corroded ; and these phæno
  mena were not interrupted by filling the bend of the syphon
  with mercury. One of the wires was constantly corroded
  without giving gas, and the other gave gas without being
  corroded, whether the interval between their extremities was
  filled with pure water alone, or partly with water and partly
  with mercury. The mercury however must have wholly
  precluded      the transmission   of   oxygen from wire to wire.       It
  seems impossible for oxygen,        in  any condition, first to descend
  and then to ascend through a colurnn of a fluid full ten thou
  sand times heavier than the air at the level of the ocean.
  Nothing,        except  the Galvanic influence, appears to have
  passed    from     wire  to wire either without or w'thin the sy
  phon ;     and, if this be admitted, it will scarcely be affirmed
  that the corrosion of the wire was a simple oxydation.
       The Galvanic action of varjous fluids, upon the whole or
  most    of   the oxydable metals, has lately opened a field       of  re
   search,     which    seems  well    entitled tp persisting attention.
   I  have already projected      a set qf experiments, which      I  trust
                                                                       will

 will  afford it some degree    of light. You shall     have the results
 as soon as      they are obtained,      provided   they shall seem de
 serving your notice ;      and  I   shall now conclude with briefly
subjoining, that when a metallic communication was formed
in the dark between the ends of 3 powerful Galvanic column,
an appearance of light resembling a small electric spark was
distinctly perceived at the moment of contact : that the
copper and zinc, when applied to each other, discover a
strong Galvanic power;           yet plates of brass had no such
power, even when piled with moistened alumine : that alu-
mine appeared to be more Galvanic when moistened with
brine, than when moistened            with   water   ;  that pasteboard
was decidedly more Galvanic when moistened with weak
sulphuric acid, than when moistened cither with water or
brine;     and   that by inclosing a powerful Galvanic column
in a box, armed in the manner of a magnet, I have con
structed a kind of Galvanic machine, which is easily carried
from place to place, which is extremely           convenient in manv
experiments,       and which has enabled           me   to explain   the
powers of the torpedo more clearly, I believe, than                 has
hitherto been done.
          I have the honour to be, with great esteem,

VI. AProjeclfor       extending the Breed     of Fine-lVoolled Spani/b
   Sheep, now in the Possession of His Majejiy, into all Parts
   *f Great Britain, where the Growth offine Clothing Wools,
   is found    to be profitable.
A,.FTER         experiments had been tried for several years, by
the   King's   command,     with Spanifli stieep of the true Merino
breed, imported from various parts of Spain, all of which
concurred in proving, that the valuable wool of those animals
did not degenerate in any degree in this climate, and tha£
the cross of a Merino ram uniformly increased the quantity
                                                                    and

and meliorated the quality of thewool of every kind of sbort-
woolled sheep on which it was tried, and more particularly
so in the case, of the South Down, Hereford, and Devonshire
breeds ;       His Majesty              was   pleased     to command            that some
Merino        slieep should be procured from a flock, the character
»f which for          a fine       pile of wool was well established.
   Application           was accordingly made to                  Lord Auckland, who
had lately returned                from an embassy             to Spain ; and in con
sequence        of his Lordsliip's                 letters,       the     Marchioness       del
Campo di Alange was induced to present to his Majesty five
rams and thirty-five ewes from her own flock, known by the
name of Negretti, the reputation of which, for purity of
blood and fineness of wool, is as high as any in Spain. For
this present his Majesty was pleased to send to the Mar
chioness in return eight sine English coach horses.
   These stieep, which were imported in the year 1793, have
formed the basis      flock, now kept in the park of His
                              of    a
Royal Highness the Duko of York at Oatlands, the breed
of which has been preserved wuh the utmost care and at
tention.
   The wool of this flock,            that of the sheep pro
                                              as   well   as
cured before from Spain, was acknowledged     by the manu
facturers who saw    to be to all appearance of the very first
                               it,
quality  yet none of them chose to offer
         ;                                price for                  a               it   at all
equal to what they themselves gave for good Spanish                                      wool,
lest,    as   they said,           it   should     not prove in manufacture                   so
valuable       as    its appearance           promised        :    it   became necessary,
therefore,      that     it   should be manufactured at the                    King's       ex
pense,  in order that absolute proof might be given of its
actual fitness for the fabric of superfine broad cloth and                           ;
this was done year after year in various manners, the cloth
always proving excellent    yet the persons to whom the wool
                                         :
was offered for sale still continued to undervalue       being                   it,
prepossessed with an opinion, that though     might not at first     it
degenerate,         it   certainly sooner or later would alter its quality
much for the worse.
   In    1796    was resolved to sell the wool at the price that
                it
should     be offered  for              it,
                               in order that the manufacturers
themselves          might make trial of its quality,                      although   a    price

   It is necessary to account for these extraordinary prices                   by
stating,  that  in  the  year 1799,      when      both   sales   were  effected,
Spanish wool was dearer than it ever before was known
to be ; but it is also proper to add, that 5*. GJ. was then the
price of the best Spanish piles ; and that none were sold
higher; except,    as  it is said, a very small quantity for $s . gd.

due time, with judicious management, carcases covered with
superfine Spanish wool may be brought into any fliape,

    On    the 24th     of May    last, an advertisement        appeared     in  the
Moniteur,        giving notice of a       sale   of two hundred      and twenty
ewes and         rams    of  the finest woolled Spanish breed, part of
the flock kept on the national farm of Rambouillet ; also two
thousand       pounds of superfine wool, being the present year's
clip of this national flock ; and one thousand three hundred
pounds of wool, the produce of the mixed breeds of sheep kept
at the Menagerie at Versailles.
    This    advertisement,       which is official, is accompanied by
a   notice from Lu'cien Bonaparte, Minister of the Interior,
as follows     :
     "  The   Spanish      breed  of  sheep that produce the finest wool,
introduced into France thirty years ago, has not manifested
the smallest symptom of degeneration : samples of the wool
of this    valuable     flock, which was brought from Spain in the
year 1786,         are still preserved,     and bear testimony that it has
not in the least declined from its original excellence, although
the district where these sheep have been kept is not of the
best quality for sheep-farming; the draughts from this flock,
that have been annually fold by auction, have always ex
ceeded      in    value   the  expectation of the purchasers in every
country      to    which they       have been carried, that is not too
damp for flieep.
     "  The weight of their fleeces            is from six * to twelve pounds
 each, and those of the rams are               sometimes     heavier.
     "   Sheep      of the ordinary coarse-woolled               breeds,      when
 crossed by a Spanish ram, produce fleeces double                      in weight,
 and far more valuable, than those                of their  dams   5   and   if this
cross is carefully continued,            by supplying rams of the pure
Spanish      blood,     the  Wool   of  the   third or fourth generation is
 scarce distinguishable from the original Spanish wool.
    '  This  must mean fleeces unwarned,        or in the yoke, as it is technically
termed.
                                                                          « These

and so considerable, to those who embark in   as that of the           it,

of   the true Spanish         race, among the flocks                 of France, whe
ther the sheep are purchased                  at Rambouillet,             or elsewhere   ;

                                    the greatest importance to
                                       it   is
secure the     Spanish breed unmixed, and the utmost precau
tion on that head should be used, as the avarice of proprietors
may tempt them to substitute the crossed- breeds instead of
the pure one, to the great disappointment of the purchaser.
     "   The amelioration of wool                   at Rambouillet           has made so
great    progress, that in
         a                 circle from twenty-four to thirty-

             in
thousand pounds of wool, improved                          by
                                         two, three, or four
crosses.     Those who wish to' accelerate                        the amelioration       of
their flocks       by   introducing into them ewes of this improved
sort, may find abundance to be purchased          in that neighbour
hood at reasonable rates."

and extent of their influence seems, however, not to have been
well understood until the epoch of the sublime discoveries of
Newton.
     Whether the             first professors        of   astrology,         a science      which
we find to have been   so antiently cultivated in the East, en

successors in later times, we may not now be able to deter
mine.        With         respect to the pretensions                    of   the latter,     it isr
however, certain, that the mass of absurd notions, the pro
duct of credulity and imagination, under which is buried
everything true or valuable in their writings, has given oc
casion to their falling into general contempt, more especially
in   the present advanced                 state    of astronomy. The more mys

of sufficiently frequent proofs of this want of special foresight,
they succeed often enough to keep up      sort of credit with   a
their wondering readers.  In the mean time,        any credit                is   it
to those who have long had in their hands correct registers of
the weather, aud other means of forming an accurate judg
ment of such matters, that they either suffer these deceptions
to pass unnoticed, or content themselves with substituting
ridicule for inquiry              ?

sphere promises at length to obtain due consideration      (by
some passages   in foreign journals, as the Theory given                                        by

I am inclined to bring forward some observations, which first
occurred in keeping the register of the barometer for 1798
    * In                                byToaldo, in the Journal des Sciences utilis,
         particular      a     paper
translated    in   the Philosophical        Magazine, Vol. III. p. m, with which
the reader   is    requested     to   compare these observations (which were writttn
previous     to the author's knowledge               of\Toaldo's Theory),          as they mu
tually   support each other.
                                                                                       annexed,

annexed,       and which have been           amply confirmed in extend
ing the inquiry to other registers.
     The dotted line, which, in the barometric chart* (PI. IX.)
represents the course of the barometer, was traced by dairy
observations         (with an excellent barometer made by Haas)
on a set     of blank charts,        each   of which     serves for a month        ;
being ruled horizontally with red lines, dividing the space
into inches and tenths, and serving for a scale, and perpen
dicularly with others, two-tenths distant, one of which is al-
Jotted to each day         f.
      My   register was kept at Plaistow          in Essex, about five miles
 east    of London,        except     three  spaces distinguished          by full
 dots at each extremity,            which were noted in London at an
 elevation not much more than twenty feet greater, and for
 most part of which lam indebted to the observations of a
 friend.      As   the barometer rarely changes             its direSlion during
 the night, it is evident that, by an enlarged scale and frequent
 observations, a very accurate account of its variations might
 be kept in this way ; and               none can give .a more pleasing
 synoptical idea        of  these, with the       corresponding changes of
 weather, for the past month or year.
      As the moon's phases had been inserted in the explana
  tory plate of Dr. Buxton, by a character affixed to the day,
  I continued this practice, and after some time began to sus
  pect a coincidence between these and the course of the baro
  meter, which at length became very evident, and gave oc
  casion to further inquiry.              This coincidence consists in the
  depression      of  the barometrical        line on the approach of the
  new and" full moon, and its elevation               on that of the quarters.
   hi   above thirty out of the fifty lunar weeks in this year, the
   barometer will be found to have changed its general diredion
  once in each week, in such manner as to be either rising or
      •  The  accompanying     plate is engraved on a scale of half an inch to an
   inch.
      +  The   blank   charts are  sold by  Edward Nairne,       Camhill,   and wera
   published by    Dr.  Buxton in 1794,     who has   obliged    me with  the inspec
   tion of his register from that time to the present.    There are columns added,
   for wind, rain, &c. which it was not           necessary    to introduce   on this
   occasion.
                                                                                    at

  358                    On   the Influence     of the Sun
  at its maximum       for the week preceding and following, about
  the time of either quarter; and to be either falling or at its
  minimum for the two weeks, about the new and fuH. It is
 remarkable, that the point of greatest depression during the
 year, viz. to 28,67, is found about twelve hours after the
  new moon on the 8th of the eleventh month ; and that of
 its greatest and extraordinary elevation to 30,89 on the 7 th
 of the second month at the time of the last quarter. More
 over, this coincidence appeared to obtain the most regularly
 in fair  and     moderate      weather ; and, in general, when the
 barometer fell during the interval between the new or full
 moon and the quarters, an evident perturbation in the atmo
 sphere accompanied ;           of which may be instanced II. 15 to
 23,   when   the   barometer,      aster an uncommon rise, continued
 to fall rapidly after the new moon, with severe cold, which
 ended suddenly        in  stormy    and wet weather ; again,          VI.  14
 to 20, when two weeks of fair weather ended in a thunder
 storm.     In  the greater      part of      XII.   the usual    coincidence
disappears,     and     the    converse      takes   place,   the   barometer
being low at the quarter and high at the full, amidst con
 tinued alternations of rain, frost, and snow; and, for part
of   the  time, high winds.             The remarkable depression be
 tween the 24th and 28th                was   attended with intense cold,
the thermometer being noted on four successive days at 150.
 140. 90. 130. respectively.           On the two days preceding the
last quarter, the barometer rose rapidly, and rain followed 1
    In  the seventh month, which was wet and windy through
out nearly, there is the least of this coincidence to be seen.
Instances may be observed in which the tendency to rise or
fall at the times pointed out, after being interrupted by an oc
casional cause,      is resumed.         On    the whole    I   thought there
appeared sufficient       ground, on the evidence of the year 1798,
to suppose       that    the   gravity of our atmosphere,            as indi
cated by the barometer, may be subject to certain periodical
changes, effected by a cause more steady and regular than
either change of temperature, currents, or solution and pre
cipitation    of water,      to which      I  believe the whole variation
has been heretofore attributed.               To  discover these periodical

took the following method : Passing regularly through the

tion,    I    extracted        one observation          for each lunar             week, as
near    as possible to          the time       os'   the change, which           I    ranged
under its proper title, cither new moon or full, &c. Having
gone through the year,        took the mean of the whole of

                        it

elevations at the quarters, or that they fell out nearer to the

 360                  On   the Influence   of the Sun
 time.    I   was quite satisfied,   in pafling through this register,
 that  if I   had allowed myself to choose the higher notations
  about the quarters, and the lower about the new and full,
 with   a latitude of 24 or 36 hours, it would have made the
 results as much more favourable to my conclusions as in her
former cafe.
    Now,     to omit the consideration of other proofs for the
present,    it appears to me evident, that the atmosphere is sub
ject to a periodical change of gravity, whereby the barometer,
 on a mean often years, is depressed at least one-tenth of an
inch while the moon is passing from the quarters to the full
and new ; and elevated,         in the   fame prqportion,     during the
return to the quarter.       To what     causes shall we attribute this
periodical change, other than the attraction of the fun and
moon for the matter composing the atmosphere ?
    The atmosphere is a gravitating fluid, differing, in a phy
sical fense, from the water, chiefly in possessing less gravity j
 and it is demonstrable      a priori on   the principles  of  the New
tonian philosophy, that it ought to have its tides as well
the ocean, although in a degree as much less perceptible as
is its gravity.
    I suppose, therefore, that the joint attractions of the fun
and moon at the new moon, and the attraction of the moon
predominating over the fun's weaker attraction at the full,
tend to depress the barometer, by taking off from the gravity
of the atmosphere, as they produce a high tide in the waters,
by taking off from their grayity : and again, that the attrac
tion of the moon being diminished by that of the sun at her
quarters, this diminution tends to make a high barometer,
together with a low tide, by permitting each fluid to press
with additional gravity upon the earth.
    I am aware that several circumstances attending the facts
I have brought forward prevent them from making a cafe
fairly parallel with the tides ; on which I shall make such re
marks    as   occur in this early   stage  of the inquiry.
    In  the first place,  the waters     have daily tides correspond
 ing with the motions of        the earth and moon ; and there is
 additional elevation and depression about the phases of the
 moon, amounting, suppose, to a fourth part of the whole.
                                                                      In

                        and Moon on the Atmosphere.                            36J
 in the      atmosphere      we have at present no             proof of diurnal
 tides, which ought to be the most apparent                    *.
       The   elevations and depressions       of   the barometer, which Ap
pear     to be periodical, are sometimes         more, sometimes less, con
 siderable ; but      in most   cafes,   when they are regular, greatly
 exceed the proportion which              they ought to bear to the ex
 tremes      of the   scale,   on the supposition of their being due to
 the relative positions of the fun and moon only. They arrive
 at their extent sometimes before, sometimes after, the time of
 the moon's phases, and their direction is even- sometimes
 contrary to the theory proposed, for many days together ; in
 all which particulars they disagree with the tides of the ocean.
      Now in order       to a proper consideration        of these differences,
 it   is necessary to keep in view the different constitution of
 the two fluids, which are the subjects of the comparison.
      The ocean is a dense fluid, incumbent on the solid earth,
pretty much alike in temperature and composition through
out, subject indeed to certain currents which are found to be
pretty constant and appreciable.                  It does not appear to vary
in quantity.        It has a well-defined        surface,    by which we can
measure the alterations           of level it  is subject to :
      The    atmosphere      is a much rarer and an elastic            fluid, in
cumbent partly on tracts of land, of various qualities, partly
on the moveable surface of seas, partly on snow and ice. It
differs, at different times, in quantity, and varies much in
density, temperature, and composition j is moveable through
its whole extent by different and opposite currents, for the
most part uncertain and changeable ; and we know nothing
about its surface.          These circumstances being considered, we
(hall not expect,         even in theory, the fame regularity in the
tides    of the atmosphere        as in those    of  the ocean.
     The want of facts           to prove the existence         of diurnal   tides
appears indeed at'siribview an insuperable difficulty; since,, if
these did take place, the barometer aught to indicate them,
    ,* The means of ascertaining these were not so obvious in the time of
Newton; and it is accordingly said, in B. II. chap. 6, of Pembci ton's
Newton, that " the gravitation of these fluids (water and air) in the
earth     towards  the momi produces no sensible       eftect,  except in the sea,
where it cau'es the tides.

tioned to the supposed weekly tide.            But perhaps even this
difference     may be found to result from" the different consti
tution of the two fluids.         The water, being of more uniform
density and possessing so much greater gravity, is elevated
and subsides with proportionate steadiness.           The air, falling
greatly short of the water in gravity, and its density conti
nually decreasing upwards, mqst needs be very differently
affected.       If we take notice also of the greater ease with
                                                                         v
which      the latter is thrown into currents, and lastly    of  its re-
markable property of dissolving mere water as it increases in
density and temperature, and letting it fall as it decreases hi
either, it will not seem impossible, that the daily flux and
 reflux, which is so manifest in the waters, should be lost and
 counteracted in the atmosphere; while, on the other hand,
 the progressive      increase os either, through the lunar week,
 should, by the very same causes, be sometimes promoted and
 rendered more conspicuous.
     It will, however,      be soon .enough  to enter upon the theory
 of   the atmospherical tides,       when the preceding facts (hall
 have been examined, and the influence           of the fun and moon
 on the gravity of the atmosphere established, by more exten
 sive observation.        It is for this purpose that the subject is
 now brought forward, and the cooperation of meteorological
 observer?, in this or other countries, into whose hands this
 may come, is requested.           The coincidence, so far as hitherto
 observed, is an important fact, and should it be found to ob
 tain generally, it will necessarily lead to several important
 consequences; and, in the first place, to a new and more sa
 tisfactory theory of the barometer; in consequence of which
 that instrument may be more successfully applied to foretell
 the    changes     of  the weather.     The true reason likewise of
 the weather       so  frequently coinciding, in the time of its va>
 rious alterations, with the changes of the mejon (a coincir
 dence which has long served to direct the predictions of the
  almanac-makers),          will be apparent, and the? diligent meteo
  rologist    will avail himself os it in forming probable conjec
  tures on the changes likely to ensue for a certain time, not
  exceeding that which limits the operation of the known
 pause   or causes,

atmosphere   has not been hitherto generally admitted, may
be in part owing to the want of frequent observations upon
instruments with               a sufficient    range of scale.            It   is,   howeverj
more probable, that the lunar weekly flux or reflux, as either
prevails, may have the greatest (hare in preventing the de

1     HE        attention of the amateurs              of the fine arts having
been lately         excited         by   the sale of Lord Cawdor's noble col
lection of arttiques, and                 particularly of the celebrated Bac
chanalian  vase, formerly an object universally admired in the
I.anti Palace at Rome, the following brief account os may                              it
not be unacceptable to your readers.
   The forms of all antique vases, whether bcll-fliaped or the
tazza, are supposed to have been first taken from the calyx
of the lotns the latter representing the plant in
                    ;                                flatter                         a
form,     as   it   appears when fully blown,                    and the former in the
more early stage              of   inflorescence.
    The   lotus     is   a    celebrated water-plant, well known                     in   Upper
Asia,     which, from its structure,                    and its reputed quality                 of

being generated by heat and moisture, was selected by the
antients as the symbol of the generation and procreation of
the human species ; it was therefore deified and held sacred,
and became the model from which, as it is thought, they
copied the form of their principal vises.
   The grand Bacchanalian vase in question (fee a geometrical
elevation of          it,
                Plate X.)     of the lotus form, bell-shaped,
                                              is
and was most   probably consecrated to the god Bacchus, as
may be concluded from     the finely-sculptured Bacchanalian
masks, and other features that accompany         must there              it :    it
fore have been used either as                      a   laver or symbol only                   of th»
part   of   the heathen mythology,                       and for no other use               j   for   it
iscertain that no wine was ever poured into it.
  This superb monument of antique decoration was dag up,
some centuries ago, among the ruins of Adrian's villa, to
gether with the fragments of three other vases of nearly
similar dimensions; all of which appeared,    the situation                     by
in which they were found, to have occupied the fame parti
cular spot of that once extensive and magnificent emporium
of art.     was then removed to the villa Lanti, near Rome,
            It
where for many years   attracted the notice and excited the
                                       it
admiration of both the traveller and the artist. This, and
one at Warwick castle, which                           is        more decorated,
                                                            somewhat
are the only complete                  vases,   of the sanle dimensions, extant                       ;
and are unquestionably the most magnificent and nobly-sculp
tured specimens              of antique decoration of this kind                             ever dis
covered.
     The Lanti          vase      was brought from Rome about twelve
years ago,       at   a     considerable  risk and expense, the Right                by
Hon. Lord Cawdor,                      on whose classical               taste    anil judgment
it   must ever confer the                   highest credit.             The     removal  of this
grand work of art from that city, caused great jealousy among
the superintendants of the Vatican Museum, then forming
under the auspices                 of       the reigning                -

 A HE     author of this essay has carefully repeated those
experiments by which Sir Isaac Newton effected his analysis
of light. The experiments have produced to his observation,
.phenomena materially different from those which appeared to
 Newton.  He seems to have observed the phenomena with
Very accurate        attention.        He concludes from the whole, that
Newton        has erred        In believing every ray of common light to
be composed          of    seven differently coloured,              primigenial, ele
mentary rays.             On     the contrary,            this author infers from his
observations,        that   all light is originally of one uniform while
eofaiir; that -to diversity         of colours, in inflexion, is occasioned
by the bertdings,         separations, and other changes of its pasts in
faffing through a              transparent      medium,       or undir attraction        Ipr

consequence,  the  Newtonian   Theory of light and colours                               is
not fundamentally true.

 O,"N      the 4th of July last, the following account of the la
 bours of the Mathematical and Physical Class during the
 preceding three months, was read by C. Cuvier, secretary :
    The antients admitted only four elements, by the com
 bination of which they supposed all other terrestrial substances
 to be formed.      Modern chemistry has rejected this vulgar
 opinion,    and  has given the name      of elementary to all sub
 stances which    it is not able to decompose,    hut it at the same
 time endeavours to diminish the number of them         ; and  when
ever it is able to prove that a substance, which appears to be
simple, results from the combination of two others, it obtains
the double advantage of simplifying the theory of the science,
and of being able to reproduce, at pleasure, that substance,
with the analysis of which it is acquainted.
    It appears at present (hat it is on the eve of a discovery of
¦this  kind in regard to two substances, very interesting on ac
count of the part which they act throughout nature, and of
the   use to which they are applied in the arts. I here allude,
to the acid of sea-salt, called by the modem chemists the
muriatic acid\ and the two fixed alkalies, soda and fotajb.
    It has lately been discovered, that almost all the acids are
obtained from the combustion of certain substances j the sub
stance which must be burned to obtain an acid is called the
radical   of that acid, that    is to fay, according to the pneu
matic theory, which must be combined with oxygen to pro
duce that acid.      The marine mid was one of those the ra
                                                                dical

  wical of  *hich  was not known ; and    it is this radical which
  Berthollet has been endeavouring to discover.
      This chemist thinks himself authorised to believe that the
  muriatic acid is a triple compound of azot and a small quan
  tity of hydrogen and oxygen. It would be tedious to give art
  account of the various and accurate experiments which con
  ducted him to this result.    It will be sufficient to say in ge
  neral, that he always saw muriatic acid formed, when to the
  presence of the nitric acid there was joined any circumstanoe
  which forced the Water to be decomposed.          But the radical
  of the nilric acid is known to be azot, and water can add
  only hydrogen to the principles of that acid.        It was to an
  induction nearly of the fame kind, that Berthollet was in
  debted some years ago, for his discovery of the composition
   of volatile alkali or ammonia,   which he found to     be formed
(
   oft hydrogen and azot.
       Chemists then employed themselves in endeavouring to
  discover the composition of the two fixed alkalies.         It was
   natural to think that one at least of the two principles of the"
   volatile alkali would be common to them and deserve the
  name of alcaligen,     as depblogijlicated air has been      called
   •xygen   because it is the common principle of all the acids.
   But on one hand they were ignorant whether the azot or
   the hydrogen was the common principle of the alkalies, and
  tan the other, they did not know with what substances it
   ought to be Combined to produce them.
       Guyton has presented some experiments made by De-
   formes, which he has in part repeated, and which tend to
  "prove that folajh, or fixed vegetable alkali, is a compound of
   hydrogen and lime.    These chemists haye seen lime produced
   \inder circumstances  when, in every instance of all the bodies
  brought into contact, none but the potajb could contain it.
   They have seen also that this production of lime was pre
  ceded by the combustion and disappearance       of the hydrogen.
       Soda or fixed mineral alkali having given magnesia under
   similar circumstances, they think that this alkali is a com
   bination of hydrogen with that earth. Desormes goes much
   further, for he is of opinion that alumine, magnesia, and
   lime, are only the fame earth combined with more or less

 azot.     Were his      ideas    confirmed, we should           not only ap
 proach near       to the doctrine         of  the antients respecting the
 elements, but have an             easy explanation of a multitude of
 phenomena        difficult   to   be accounted for in -the history of
 nature; as, the saltness of the water of the sea; the forma
 tion os nitre and marine salt in inhabited places ; that of
 potash in vegetables,        of   soda   in animals;        the conversion    of
 some   of   the earths into each other,            &c.     All these facts,   so
 mysterious     in appearance, and which have exercised the in
 genuity    of the   philosophers for so manv ages, would be con
 sequences easy to be deduced from these principles.                    Unfor
 tunately,    however,      these    chemists     have    not  confirmed   their
'analyses by synthesis; that is to fay,              they have not yet re
 made potash by combining              directly    lime   and hydrogen.
     The labour of Bcrthbllet on the muriatic acid had been
  preceded    and    occasioned       bv another on an object no             less
 important — cudiometrv.            This    is the name given to the art
 *tf analysing atmospheric         air, and      in particular of ascertain
 ing how many parts of pure vital air or oxygen the atmo
 sphere of any place contains. The health of mankind as well
 .is  philosophy is interested in the perfection of this art.
 The combustion of phosphorus has been long employed for
 this analysis, because this combustion absorbs the oxvgen in
 a concrete    acid, and it is then         easy to measure      what remains
  under  a gaseous form,       vy hi eh is azot.
     Mr. Humboldt,          a learned     German        philosopher,   thought
 he found .this method defective,               because,     according to his
 account, there always remained oxvgen                     not fixed, and be
 cause a portion of azot mixed itself with the acid.                    He en
 tertained    the like    opinion       os liver     of sulphur, or alkaline
  hydrogenated       sulphuret,      which     some     employ also for the
 same use, aud        prefers    the means        pointed out by Fontana,
 or nitrous gas, which is an aeriform combination of azot,
 with less oxygen than is necessary to form nitric acid. When
  this gas is mixed with new oxygen, it absorbs it more
 exactly, according to Mr: Humboldt,                     than the above sub
  stances ; but as it may contain a variable quantity of azot,
 this   mean     is not unattended            with    inconveniences.       Mr.
  Humboldt      thinks that this might be remedied by examining
                     9                                                     each

each    time the gas to be used, by washing it with a solution
of  copperas,      or sulphat of iron; which, according to his
opinion, will absorb all the nitrous gas, but leave the azot,
which is mixed with it.
   It  is    this action of the sulphat         of iron, or nitrous gas,
with which fierthollet         has been occupied         ; and it was on it
indeed that the solution        of  the   problem depended.         He has
found that under this circumstance, as well as under a mul
titude of others, the nitrous gas is not only absorbed, but
decomposed,        and that it abandons a part of its azot to con
vert itself into nitrous acid, lie is of opinion that the nitrous
gas   may differ in the proportions of its two principles,
oxygen and azot; but that it does not contain azot in simple
mixture.
   These      interesting results are the consequences of the au
thor's     ideas on chemical        affinities, communicated to the
public above six months ago.               He    has made a new appli
cation of them by comparing                 the action of the metallic
oxyds on substances, such as acids, the composition of
which     is invariable; and he has proved that the action of
these oxyds is modified by their state of oxydation ; that
the more they        are oxydated, for example, the less affinity
they have for the nitric and sulphuric acids, while a contrary
effect takes place with regard          to the muriatic acid.       Besides,
the combinations of these oxyds with other substances depend
also, whatever may be the state of their oxydation, on the
proportion in which they enter into these combinations.
All the phenomena            therefore     depend     on the proportions,
and not on the constant affinity peculiar to each metal              v
   Three memoirs have been presented on natural history;
one of these, by Lacepede, contains some observations on
the ant-eater, an American animal, which lives only on
ants.     The author       has   rectified,   the    description given by
Buffon of the second        species  of this animal,      called tamandua,
and described      a blackish   variety hitherto undescribed.
   The      second   memoir is on the ibis of the antients, by
Cuvier.       The author has discovered from mummies, mo
numents, and the descriptions of Homer and Plutarch, that
this bird was not the fame as that which modern naturalists

have    considered    as the ibis,   bul another    species  which    he
describes.
    The third memoir is by Haiiy on a variety of martial
pyrites, or sulphat of iron, to which the author gives the
name of triacontaedra, because its crystals have thirty faces,
fix  of which   are rhombs and twenty-four trapezoids.            Haiiy
has explained the laws of drecrement from which these
crystals result, and demonstrate         some curious properties of
this solid, to which geometricians hitherto have paid little
attention.
    The   structure    of the earth,    and  the respective position
of  the materials of which it is composed; are among those
curious points of natural history still involved in consider-,
able obscurity. We can study only the outer crust of the
globe, and even this crust is attended with many difficulties.
Happily for our curiosity, the nucleus in the high chains
of mountains        seems,   by swelling    up, to have       burst  the
matter by which it is enveloped, and to have shown itself
uncovered.       The labours of a Saussure, a Deluc, a Pallas,
and a Dolomieu,         have   confirmed that     the greater    part of
the large chains are composed of small             parallel chains, of
which that in      the middle, commonly the highest, consists of
granite, the two collateral ones consist of schist and stones
of   an analogous kind,      and   the outer ones   of calcareous   sub
stances.     This   general  rule,   which throws the greatest light
on the theory of the earth, did not seem to be applicable
to the Pyrennees ; there every thing seemed to be without
order. The highest summits of Mount Perdu and le Mar-
bore are certainly calcareous,         and, as   some assert,   contain
petrified fliells.     C. Ramond,     by laborious journeys and in
genious deductions, has discovered the source of this embar
rassment.      It arises from the small chains being in an
oblique direction, and from the schistous and calcareous
hands situated towards Spain, being not only higher than
those of the same nature towards France, but surpassing
even the granitic band,       which forms      the axis  of the chain   j
so that the ridge     which determines the fall of the streams is
diflerent   from   the  geological ridge.

objects of great importance for the public prosperity: the
introduction into France of a new kind of domestic animal;
and the means   of making sugar from indigenous plants.
  The buffalo, originally a native of the warm and marshy
countries of Asia and Africa, was introduced into Italy about
the fourth century.        Though smaller than the ox, it is more
vigorous;   t.he    milk of the female is more abundant than that
of the cow,       and yields more butter and cheese.              Every part
of its body may be employed in the arts or for the purposes
of life; and it possesses this advantage, that it can live in
bogs, and feed on aquatic plants, which oxen and horses re
fuse.   Its introduction,                         will enable
                                  therefore, into France,
the farmers to turn to advantage a great number of marshes,
which at present are entirely useless for want of animals ca
pable of living in them. The possession of this animal is one
of   the benefits for which France         is indebted to its first con
quest   of Italy.      A of the buffaloes brought to France
                           part
has been killed by  the peasants, and another was neglected
by those to whom they were intrusted ; but the remainder
are in good condition, and in full increase, at the rural esta
 blishment of Rambouillet,           where they have been examined
 by Tessiex,  Huzzard, and Buniva.
    The art of extracting sugar from European plants is a fo
 reign discovery.    M. Achard, of the Academy of Berlin,
 seems to have carried it very near to perfection.     The Na
 tional Institute is anxious to ascertain the reality of   and        it,

        SIR,
 OINCE I           troubled you with a paper on the subject of
 Venetian colouring*, T have paid particular attention to
such pictures of that school as have occasionally come under
iny notice, and, in my inquiry,              I  have been much aided by
those in the Orleans collection ; but, from all the observations
I   have    been    able  to make,      I  cannot help concluding that
they never      thought of the absorbent ground, on which                I
made some remarks in my last, and that the dark red ground
never formed a part of the picture.               Those conclusions I feel
authorised in making from the general tendency in the ab
sorbent     grounds to produce a hardness, a thing never oc
curring in the pictures of the Venet'ans ; and that the ground
never entered into part of their pictures is evident from their
being painted solid throughout, and the shadows glazed on a
body of colour.       I (hall, with a view further to illustrate the       ¦
subject, introduce (occasionally           as  quotations) such remarks
on colouring as I made in my catalogue immediately on
my viewing the pictures in the collection above alluded to.

  4                      Thoughts     on Colouring.
  On looking into the Venetian pictures (particularly those of
  Titian and Paul Veronese), I found that they had all been
  prepared with colder colours than the finishing ones, and that
  there was one general colour which prevailed throughout the
  shadows ; this observation       induced me to make the following
  remark    :
               "  the Venetians appear to have         prepared their pic
  tures  in   the flesh, and its shadow       and   draperies,    in a colder
  state, and glazed or scumbled         them with wanner colours."
     One of the greatest considerations with the artist is to ac
  quire the true tone of the shadow and its dinsy shadow; to
  do this he must use such colours as will most readily sympa
  thise with each other in mixing : to this end it will be found
  that ivory black, Indian red, and white, will form the best
  general    shadow colour, which may in the flesh be improved
  with vermilion in the reflections. The ivory black, and
  white, improved with lake, produces a most beautiful pearly
  demi-tint for delicate flesh, and at the same time one of the
  truest  and    most clean that can be acquired.               Ivory black
  with Indian       red, or lake, glazes finely, and may be highly
  improved, when dry, with /brown pink, or asphaltum, used
  with drying oil. This is very like the method I formerly
  mentioned *,      as practised  by that great man       Sir Joshua Rey
  nolds, to acquire his shadows,        and whose      method      of colour-
. ing   was    truly Venetian,    accompanied with a chiaro /euro
  they were strangers to, and a taste          in his portraits unexam
  pled.    Those who choose to try, will find their advantage in
  making the shadow colour of ivory black, vermilion, and
  white (as mentioned in Vol. IV.), which will work cleaner
  than any other combination ; and which colours, with the
  addition of burnt ochre in dark complexions, and yellow
  ochre in the lights, will be quite sufficient for all the pur
  poses in flesh for first and     second colouring, or      till  the draw
  ing is fixed   ;  the whole being afterwards finished by glazing,
  to give depth to the fliadows, and enrich and improve the
  colouring.       Tintoret appears to have forwarded his pictures
  to nearly their full effect, with a pearly colour         of black, red,
  and white,      and to have acquired      all his tints by glazing with
  a pure transparent     colour, invariably leaving the lights white

to give them brilliancy : Titian, on the contrary, dead-co-
toured at near nature as pojjible, only enriching his colours
by glazing, and keeping the shadows as near of a tone as
possible.          The                        of
                                 dark grounds must be ob
                            absurdity              using
vious to every one who has had the least practice, from the
tendency in the white, and all the lighter tints, to sink into
the ground ; which accounts for the darkness of many of
the old pictures, and more especially those that have been
painted thin.   However desirable it may be to have one's
pictures well coloured, its presence will by no means com-
pensate for the loss                 of dignity of composition, accuracy of
drawing                : he that is content to please by the
                  or breadths
illusion of colour, or that -flatters the eye by an ipdustrious
display of tints, must not expect to rank high in the art;
            "     Mind,    mind atone, (bear witness Earth and Heav'n!)
            " The       living fountains in itself contains

     I   have often been led to                    think     that the exquisite clearness
observable in some of the pictures of Rubens, arises at this
time (in a great degree) from his having painted them on
white, or, at any rate, light grounds ; the advantage of which
will be obvious to any one that chooses to try the following
experiment: that               is,   to spread           any light colour            (as   a   flesh
colour for instance)                on    a    ground prepared                 half white and
half dark; in             the course           of two or        three- days, that on the
white ground will appear clear, while the latter will have
funk many degrees into the under dark colour.           Another
advantage attending     light grounda    that the picture      is,
                                                             not                           is
so liable to be injured     cleaning, notbyto mention  its wear
ing      better   :    two of the finest pictures,                   by   Titian,   in   the    Or
leans collection (Diana and Acteon, and Diana and Calisto),
bear strong testimony to the truth of the above observation;
the former being in fine preservation, owing to its having
been painted with     great body of colour
                                a           while the latter               ;
having          only    a    thin    coat,         the   ,   dark    red       ground appears
through the flesh,«*o its irreparable injury.                                  This evil would
in   a   great measure have been avoided,                            had    the ground been

light;       and it is evident that the ground was not intended                             M
make the least part of the effect in the picture originally, as
the thinness in the colour above alluded to, looks as if owing
to accident, and the haste                        of    a man who could fell all the
pictures he painted.
      I   have   already      mentioned that the best general                          shadow
colour is ivory black, &c. which, if the lights and middle
tints are coloured as near nature as possible, may be enriched
by glazing; or the glazing may be done on the middle tints,
and       the lights    of    one general hue laid on them, which ap*
pears at times to have been the practice                   of Titian. The fol
lowing        remark on the                 picture of Diana and Calisto, may
serve as a further illustration                   :   — " There       appears to be yellow
in all      the lights, even the blue ;                      I   therefore   infer, that they
considered       the light as giving a colour, or                        of changing, in     a
small degree, the local colour of the objects, and that theif
principle of colouring was thus : the lights on the objetls par-
taok of the colour of the light, the middle tints gave the local
colour, and the shadows warm, and pretty much of one hue.''
A picture painted            on the above plan, will have                     a   harmonious
and pleasant effect.
      I   wish the artists     of     any- eminence would communicate the
resultof their practice ; much good would arise from it.
Fine writing is not a necessary requisite; for, in matters in
tended to instruct, clearness will more than compensate for
want of elegance : such a conduct would contribute to re
move many of the practical difficulties the student labours
under ; an inconvenience I myself have greatly felt.
   It is very rarely that you fee a distinct or whole colour in
the Venetian pictures ; as their blues seldom go beyond a
violet, and the reds,             a                          "
                                      In all the pictures in the

low, yellows with red, and     on. He appears to have been
                                                  so
particularly careful not to introduce blue or cold colours,
and, when they do occur,                     it   is   only in small quantities."

                                      Thoughts           on     Colouring.                                    J
of our      professional evils is looking too much to art for its rules;
but    I   believe a great source                       of    the pleasure derived                from the
fight of the Venetian pictures, is their comfortable warm
masses : great caution however will be required to distinguish
between a glowing and a glaring colour ; as we are apt to ad
mire what is showy, before we can distinguish what is beau
tiful.       I   have frequently had occasion to remark the satisfac
tion     expressed          by the spectators on viewing a warmly coloured
picture, and the degree of comfort it has appeared to impart :
this has frequently led me to reflect on the application of
colour to medical purposes, as in the ague or fever, or how
much the mind might be tranquilised by the room being of
a particular colour; every one is sensible of the effect of that
beautiful amber-coloured light that at times prevails on our
summer's evenings, and which is                                    so   highly congenial to health
and life*. ,.
     In all      cases           the good fense               of    the artist must be used, for
the colouring that suits one subject will not agree with an
other; most of the Venetian pictures that I have seen, have
been of the pleasing or ornamental cast, which require more
decoration of colour than the higher walks of history, but                                                    I
have never been able to prevail on myself to believe the most
sublime subject would be hurt by grouping the colours. It
would be worth inquiring how far the painter might be be
nefited (as the poet certainly      considering colours as    is)       by
indicative of the passions, and applying them accordingly                                                    :
the fiery reds convey the idea of anger, and in this fense are
often used       :

  I   judge they were particularly careful to group the warm
  colours ; to avoid the use of blue and cold ones ; never to
suffer them to interrupt the principal mass of lights which
  with them is always composed of warm colours ; that the cold
  colours were sparingly introduced for the purpose of support
  ing the blue in the iky or distance, as in No. 123, 340, 249 %
  and never. on the principal object. In many of their pictures
 there is a total exclusion of the cold colours, as in 169 and
  181; in others, where the colours of the objects are all
 warm, the skies are broken either with warm purple clouds,
 or      the blue   of  the element reduced to gray, as              in 49, 2il>

    the Sun.        By   William Herschel, LL.D.F.R.S.%
 J.N that section of my formes paper which treats of radiant
heat, it was hinted, though from imperfect experiments;                              ¦
 that the range of its refrangibility is proBably more extensive
than that of the prismatic colours ; but, having lately had
some favourable sunshine* and obtained a sufficient confirm
 ation of the same, it will be proper td add the following ex
 periments to those which have Been given :¦— ¦
      t provided      a small stand,        with four short legs, and coveted
it with white papers.                  On this I drew five lines, parallel to
 one end of the stand,                at   half an inch distance from each
 other, but       so  that the first      of the lines 'might only be of an|

10                  Experiments on the Refrangibilify             of
inch from the edge. These lines I intersected at right angles
with three others ; the second and third whereof were, re
spectively, at 2' and at 4 inches from the first.
  The fame thermometers that have before been marked
No. 1, 2, and 3, mounted upon their small inclined planes,
were then placed so as to have the centres of the shadow of
their balls thrown on the intersection of these lines. Now,
setting my little stand upon a table, I caused the prismatic
spectrum to fall with its extreme colour upon the edge of
the paper, so that none might advance beyond the first line.
In  this arrangement, all the spectrum, except the vanishing
last quarter of an inch, which served as a direction, passed
down by the edge of the stand, and could not interfere with
the experiments.  I had also now used the precaution of
darkening the window   in which the prism was placed, by
fixing up a thick dark green curtain,                       to keep out as much
light as convenient.
     The       thermometers           being perfectly settled at the tempera-*
lure of the room,                 I   placed the stand so that part of the red
colour, refracted by the prism, fell on the edge of the paper,
before the thermometer No. 1, and about half way, or 1                         i
inch, towards   the second : it consequently did not come be
fore that, or the third thermometer, both which were to be
my standards.    During the experiment, I kept the last ter
mination of visible red carefully to the first line, as a limit
assigned to        it,   by
                    gently moving the stand when required                      ;
and found the thermometers, which were all placed on the
second line, affected as follows                  :
No.       j.       No.       3.        No.   3.  Here the thermometer No.    I
     45              45                  44        rose 6

     In order      to have        a   confirmation of this fact,  I    cooled the
thermometer No. 1, and placed No.      in the room of it:

  I left it exposed longer, on purpose to be perfectly assured
 of   the result.    Its showing but %\ degrees advance, when
 No.    1 showed 6'if has also been accounted           for before.
     It  being new evident that there was a refraction of rays
 coming from the fun, which, though not fit for vision, were
 yet highly invested with a power of occasioning heat, I pro
 ceeded to examine \ts extent as follows :
    The thermometers       were arranged on the third line instead
 of  the second ; and the stand was, as before; immersed up to
 the first, in the coloured margin of the vanifliing red               rays-.
 The result was thus :
                No.          No.   3.-* Here the thermometer No. r,

    5»J           47          4*i     J     rays.
    I  placed now the thermometers on the fourth line instead
 of  the third  5 and, proceeding      as before, "I had the following
 result  :
 No.    1.     No.    2.     No. 3. -j Therefore, the thermometer
    48I           48 l                 V   No. 1, rose 3^ degree in

    I  might now have gone to the fifth line          ; but  so fine a  day,
with    regard to clearness of sky and perfect calmness, was not
to be expected often at this time of the year ; I therefore
hastened to make a trial      of  the other extreme       of the prismatic
spectrum.       This was attended with sonic difficulty, as the
illumination of the violet rays is so feeble, that a precise ter
mination of it cannot be perceived.               However, as well as
could be judged, I placed the thermometers one inch be
yond the reach of the violet ravs, and found the result as
follows:
                                    Cj                                  No.

may be seen by inspection, no ground for ascribing any of
 their sma)| changes to other causes than the accidental dtf1-
 turbance which will arise from the motion of the air in a
 room where some employment is carried on.
    I  exposed the thermometer now to the             line of the    very first
  erceptible violet light, but so that No. \ and 2 might again
   0 in the illumination, while No.
                                                 3 remained a standard.

    From     these last experiments,        I was    now sufficiently per
suaded,      that no rays which          might    fall beyond the violet,
coujd have ai>y perceptible power either of illuminating or
of heating; and that both these powers continued together
throughout the prismatic spectrum,                 and    ended    where the
faintest violet vanishes.
    A    very   material point remained still to be determined,
which was, the situation of the maximum pf the heating
power.
    As    I knew already that it did not lie on the violet side of
the red,     I began at the full red colour, and exposed my \|ier-
mpuictcrs, arranged on         a  line, so as to have the hall of No. 1
in   the midst    of its rays,  while the other two remained at the

observations  the better together, I did not bring back the
thermometer No. 1, to the temperature of the room, being
already well acquainted with its rate of showing, compared
to that as No. 2, but went on to the next experiment, by
withdrawing the stand, till the whole ball of No. 1 was
completely out of the. fun's visible rays, yet so as to bring
the termination of the line of the red colour as near the out-

visible illumination, to which no part of it was exposed.
   It would not have been proper to compare these last observ
ations with those taken at an earlier period this morning, in
order to obtain a true maximum, as the fun was now more
powerful than it had been at that time; for which reason I
caused  the line of termination of visible light, now to fall

 J4                       Experiments on       the   Refrangibility
    It   will nowbe easy to draw the result of these observation*
 into a very narrow compass.
    The first four experiments prove that there are rays coming
 from the fun which are less refrangible than any of those that
 affect the sight.  They are invested with a high power of
 heating bodies, but with none of illuminating objects; and
 this explains the reason why they have hitherto escaped, un
 noticed.
    My    present intention    not to assign the angle of the least
                                         is,
 refrangibility belonging to these rays, for which purpose
 snore accurate; repeated, and extended experiments are re
 quired.    But, at the distance of 53 inches from the prism,
 there    was     still    a    considerable
                               heating power exerted     our                  by
 invisible rays, one inch and   half beyond the red ones,
                                               a
 measured upon their projection on     horizontal plane.a                          I
 haveno doubt but that their efficacy                         may be traced        still
 somewhat further.
   The fifth        and        sixth   experiments show that the power of
heating     is   extended           to the utmostlimits of the visible violet
rays, but not beyond them and that         ;            it   is   gradually impaired
as the rays grow more refrangible.
   The four  last experiments prove that the maximum 'of the
heating power     vested among the invisible rays, and
                          is                             pro<-
                                                                              is
bably not less than half an inch beyond the last visible ones
 when projected in the manner before mentioned. The fame
  experiments also sliow, that the sun's invisible' rays, in their
-less refrangible state, and considerably beyond the maximum,
still exert  heating power fully equal to that of red-coloured
              a
light ;   and that, consequently,   we may infer the quantity
                                               if
of the efficient from the effect produced, the invisible rays of
th,c fun probably far exceed the visible ones in number.
   To conclude,     we call light, those ravs which illuminate
                           if
objects^ and
              rjdiant beat, those which heat bodies,         may             it
be inquired, Whether light      be essentially different from ra
diant heat    In answer to which
              ?                         would suggest, that we
                                                   I
arc not allowed,     the. rules of philosophising, to admit two
                               by
different causes to explain certain effects,  they may be ac  if
counted for         by
                  one.  A  beam   of radiant heat, emanating
                                                        from

                      os   the   invisible Rays of the Sun.                           15
from the sun, consists of rays that are differently refrangible.
The range of their extent, when dispersed by a prism, begins
at violet-coloured light, where they are most refracted^and
have the least efficacy.  We have traced these calorific rays
throughout the whole extent of the prismatic spectrum, and
found their power increasing, while their refrangibility was
lessened, as far as to the confines of red-coloured light. But
their diminishing refrangibility, and increasing power, did not
stop here ; for we have pursued them a considerable way be
yond the prismatic spectrum, into an invisible state, still ex
erting their increasing energy, with a decrease of refrangi
bility, up     to the       maximum            of their power;           and have also
traced  them to that state where, though still less refracted,
their energy, on account, we may suppose, of their now fail
ing density, decreased pretty fast; after which, the invisible
thermometrical        spectrum,      if I   may so call        it,   soon vanished.
   If this   be   a   true account        of     solar heat, for the support          of
which I      appeal to my experiments,   remains only for us to
                                                         it
admit, that such of the rays of the fun as have the refrangi
bility of those which are contained in the prismatic spectrum,
 by the construction of the organs of sight, are admitted under
the appearance of light and colours and that the rest, being
                                                     ;

    HE word heal, in its most common acceptation, denotes
a certain sensation, which is welj known to every person;
The cause of this sensation, to avoid ambiguity, ought to
have been distinguished by a name different from that which
is   used                        Various authors, indeed, who
             to point out its effect.
have treated on the subject of heat, *have occasionally added
certain terms to distinguish their conceptidns, such as, latent,
absolute,  specific, sensible heat; while others have adopted
the new expressions of caloric, and the matter of heat. None
of these descriptive appellations, however, would have com
pletely answered my purpose.  I might, as in the preceding
papers, have used ,the name radiant heat, Which has been,
introduced by a celebrated author, and Which certainly is
not    very different from the expressions                            I   have now adopted ;
but,    by calling the subject                 of my             researches,          the rays that
occasion      heat,    I   cannot be misunderstood                        as meaning that
these rays themselves              are heat ; nor do              I   in any respect engage
myself to show in what manner they produce heat.
   From what has been said, it follows thai any objections
that may be alleged from the supposed agency of heat in
other circumstances than in its                         state      of radiance, or heat-
rtiakihg rays, canrlbl be admitted against my experiments.
For, notwithstanding I may be inclined      believe that all              to"
phænomena in which heat      concerned, stich as the expand
                                              is
fion of bodies, fluidity, congelation, fermentation, friction,
&c. as well as heat, in its various states of being latent, spe
cific, absolute, or sensible, may be explained on the principle
of heat-making             rays,    and vibrations occasioned                           by    them    in

 the parts of bodies ; yet this is not intended, at present,               to
  be any part of what I shall endeavour to establish.
     I must also remark that, in using the word rays, I do not
  mean to oppose, much less to countenance, the qpinion of
  those philosophers who still believe that light itself comes to
 us from the fun, not by rays, but by the supposed vibrations
 of  an elastic ether, every where diffused             throughout space ;   I
 only    claim     the same   privilege   for  the  rays that occasion heat,
 which they are willing to allow to those that illuminate
 objects.       For, in what manner         soever this radiance      may be
 effected,     it will be fully proved        hereafter that the evidence
 either for rays, or for vibrations which occasion heat, stands
 on the fame foundation on which the radiance of the illu
 minating principle, light, is built.
     In order to enter on our subject               with some regularity, it
 will   be necessary to distinguish heat           into fix different kinds,
 three whereof are solar, and three terrestrial ; but, as the di
 visions of terrestrial heat strictly resemble those of solar, it will
 not be necessary to treat of them separately; our subject, there
 fore, may be reduced to the three following general heads :
    We shall begin with the heat of luminous bodies in ge
 neral, such as, in the first place, we have it directly from
 the   fun; and as, in the second, we may obtain it from
 terrestrial     flames,    such   as   torches,     candles,  lamps,  blue-
 lights, &c.
    Our next division comprehends the heat of coloured ra
diants. This we obtain, in the first place, from the fun, by
separating its rays in a prism ; and, in the second, by having
recourse to culinary fires openly exposed.
    The third division         relates to heat obtained from radiants,
where neither light          nor colour in the rays can be perceived.
This,    as  I  have mown, is to be had, in the first place, di
rectly from the fun, by means of a prism applied to its rays ;
and, in the second, we may have it from sires inclosed in
stoves, and from red-hot iron cooled till it can no longer be
seen in the dark.
    Besides the arrangement           in the order of my experiments
which would arise from this division, we have another subject
to consider.         For, since the chief design    "
                                                         of this paper is to

18             Experiments on   the  Solar, and on    the
give a comparative     view of the operations that may be per
formed    on the rays that occasion       heat, and of those which
we already know to have been effected on the rays that oc
casion light, it will be necessary to take a short review of the
latter.    I shall merely select such facts as not only are per
fectly well known, but especially such as will answer the in
tention of my comparative view, and arrange them in the
following order.
    i.  Light, both    solar and  terrestrial,   is a sensation occa
sioned by rays emanating from luminous bodies, which have
a power of illuminating objects; and, according to circum
stances,   of making    them appear    of various colours.
   2. These rays are subject to the laws        of reflection.
   3. They are likewise subject      to the laws of refraction.
   4. They are of different refrangibility.
   5. They are liable to be stopped, in certain proportions,
when transmitted through diaphanous bodies.
   6. They are liable to be scattered on rough surfaces.
   7. They have hitherto been supposed to have a power of
heating bodies j but this remains to be examined.
   The similar propositions relating to         heat,  which are in
tended to be proved in this paper, will        stand as follows:
   1. Heat, both solar      and  terrestrial,   is  a sensation  occa
sioned by rays emanating from candent substances,               which
have a power      of heating bodies.            1
   2. These rays are subject to the laws        of reflection.
   3. They are likewise subject to the laws of refraction.
   4. They are of different refrangibility.
   5. They are liable to be stopped, in certain proportions,
when transmitted      through diaphanous bodies.
   6. They arc liable to be scattered on rough surfaces.
   7. They may be supposed, when in a certain state of
energy, to have a power of illuminating objects; but this
remains to be examined.
    Before I can go on, I have to mention that the number
of experiments which will      be required to make good all these
points, exceeds the usual length of my papers ; on which
account, I shall divide the present one into two parts.           Pro
 ceeding, therefore, now to an investigation of the three first

    exposed the thermometer, which in a former paper has
been denoted by No. 3, to the eye-end of a ten-feet New
tonian telescope, which carried a Camera eye-piece* ', but no
eye-glass.   When, by proper adjustment, the focus came to
the ball of the thermometer, it rose from 52 degrees to no;
so that rays which came from the fun, underwent three re
gular reflections; one on a concave mirror, and the other two
on two plain ones.     Now these rays, whether they were
those         of light or not, for that our experiment cannot                                     ascer
tain, had a power of occasioning heat, which was manifested
in raising the thermometer 58 degrees.

 might not be the rays        of light, for that our experiment doeu
 not determine, were evidently invested with a power of heat

 $d Experiment.        Reflection    of  the Heat that accompanies the
                        Solar prismatic Colours.
    In  the spectrum     of  the sun, given by a prism,            I placed my
 small   steel  mirror,   with a thermometer in its focus % It
 was   covered    by a piece of pasteboard,              which,      through a
proper opening, admitted           all the visible colours to fall on it*
polished surface, but excluded            every other      ray    of   heat that
might be either op the violet or on the red fide, beyond the
spectrum.       Then, placing       the apparatus        so as     to have the
thermometer in the red rays, but keeping the mirror covered
iip till the thermometer became settled, I found it stationary
at 580.      Uncovering the mirror, I had as follows:
          No. a.-> Here, in two minutes, the thermometer                      rose

2            93    J    the mirror again, and, in a few minutes,
the   thermometer exposed to the direct prismatic red came
•lawn- to 580 again.        And thus the prismatic colours, if they
*re not themselves the heat-making rays, are at least accom
panied by such as have a power             of occasioning       heat,    and are
liable to be regularly reflected.

hot poker, set with its heated end upwards, in a perpendi
cular position, and so elevated as to throw its rays on the
mirrors,       The thermometer No. a,              was    placed      in  its  se
condary focus, and had a small pasteboard screen, to guard
its ball from the direct heat of the poker.

  IV.    Account of some interesting 'Experiments, performed al
     the   London Philosophical Society, respecting the Effects of
     Meat, excited by a Stream of Oxygen Gas thrown upon
     ignited Charcoal, on a number of Gems and other refrac
     tory Substances submitted to its             Atlion    ; with a Description
     of   the  Apparatus employed          *.     ¦
  I  T  is well known         that no methods with which we are yet
                 are capable of exciting a degree of heat which is
 acquainted,
 at all to be compared            with that produced by the agents em
 ployed in the operations about to be described.                    The striking
experiment       of the    deflagration        of  iron-wire    in oxygen gas is
 frequently accompanied with phænomena, Tiot hitherto at
 tended to as they deserve to be,               which furnish strong proofs
in   support    of this   assertion.
     A   receiver, or bell-glass, that           will hold    about two quarts,
with an aperture at the top of about one inch in diameter
 (such as is now usually denominated
                                                      "   a deflagrating glass"),
is charged with oxygen gas, in the usual manner, on the shelf
of   a pneumatic tub, the aperture being stopped with                     a cork,
or, which is better, covered with a piece of slate, or other
suitable substance, ground flat so as to lie closely on its edges.
If the vessel be then removed from the shelf into an earthen^
plate, with       a sufficient      quantity of water in it to cover the-
edge      of  the receiver, and prevent the escape of the gas from

       From the unpublished minutes of the Society.               We arc promised,
from the same quarter, several other interesting communications.
                                                                           below,

below, the phænomena will be the better observed.          The
wire beingprepared by coiling it up into a spiral, like a cork
screw,                         extremity into a cork or cover,
           inserting its superior
adapted to the superior aperture  of the receiver, and winding
a little cotton round its lower extremity; the cotton is to be
very (lightly dipped in the melted tallow of a candle, and then
set   on fire.         This        gives such a degree               of   temperature       to the
wire     as occasions          when introduced into the gas,
                                 it to take           sire                                              ,
which is done by removing the cork or cover from the re
ceiver and substituting that containing the wire at the mo
ment of its ignition.
 The wire then begins        to deflagrate, and little globules                                    of
melted      iron are formed at its extremity ; each falling off                                    in
succession  when it acquires a weight sufficient to detach it
from the remainder of the burning metal. One circum
stance, which cannot fail to impress the mind strongly with
the intensity of the heat produced in this experiment, is, that
manv of           globules, though they must necessarily first
                    these
pass through  the  water in the plate, are always found, even
when the water is two inches or upwards in depth within
the receiver, to have fused the vitreous glazing completely
through, and to be so strongly united with   that they can                  it,
not be afterwards separated without detaching the glazings
together with the semi-vitr<.sied and flag-like globule whicl\
adheres to it.
      Another         effect,            which may be produced                at pleasure,       fur
nishes,    if       possible,            a   still   more     convincing proof of the            in
tensity    of   the heat.                 The drops          of liquid iron generally            ac
quire the size            of     a       small       pea before they detach themselves.
If    the experimenter, watching    the moment, give                                    a    quick
jerk     to the wire, and make the globule strike the side                                  of    the
glass,    it   will    often             be found to melt its             way through        in   an
instant, leaving               a    hole in          the. glass,     whose edges are as well
defined        as had been drilled.

it must necessarily be immersed in water, neither its coldness
or humidity hinders the passage of the globule, which seems
to make its way through with as much ease as it would
through a piece of writing paper.             When the jerk is left
 powerful, the ball of iron will sometimes not go quite,
 through, but lodge itself in the substance of the glass, which
it in that cafe generally softens so as to raise a protuberance
 on the outside.
      The contemplation of such powerful      effects of heat  as these,
 induced     the   Society, on the suggestion of a very worthy
 member, and zealous cultivator of the sciences, Mr. Francil-
 lon, to enter upon the present experiments, which were per
 formed upon the different species of gems hereafter enume
 rated; for all of which       the Society was indebted      to the po
  liteness of the gentleman who first proposed the subject, and
  from whose very valuable cabinet they were accordingly sup
  plied.
      The experiments     were made    in the presence   of the Society
  at different meetings, from 24th September to 36th Novem
  ber 1798, in the order in which they are here mentioned ;
  the present account being compiled from the original mi
   nutes taken by    Mr. Turton, their secretary, with that degree
   of accuracy   which   usually characterises them, and which have
   again been compared with the gems in their present state.
      The apparatus employed will be described at the end of
   the present communication.
                                Diamonds.
       I. The  first stone subjected to experiment was a rose dia
   mond of the weight of ffths of a carat.          It was put upon a
   piece  of compact    charcoal  in  which   a  small  excavation had
   been previously    made, and the flame of a lamp, urged by a
   common blow-pipe, then thrown into the cavity. When
    the charcoal was ignited it was presented to another blow-
    pipe, supplied by the gasometer with an uninterrupted streaai
    of oxygen   gas.
       The diamond,     at the end  of  one minute and fifty seconds,
    was found to weigh only ^ths, having lost -f,ths of its ori«
                                                                    ginaj

 ginal weight.                It    had lost its transparency,                     figure, and po-
 liture.
    Bergman observes, that the diamond, urged by a very in
 tense heat,  contracts a fort of foot upon its surface : no ap
 pearance of this kind was observed on the present occasion.
    The unconfirmed portion of  the diamond, which was re-
 cut after the experiment, now exhibits exactly the fame spe
 cies of lustre as before.  It originally " drew colour," as
jewellers term it ; that          had             is,

deserves to be mentioned.                          It   seems that there are some dia
monds which, although in themselves colourless, contain
"   fouls" or " specks," as they are called, which are cavities
filled with red, yellow, or brown earths     and these colours,            ;
being reflected through the transparent substance of the stone
when cut, give      the appearance of being itself coloured.

that      is,   which        are themselves tinged, undergo no change                               by
being heated.

       This stone remains still in the state in which the experi
  ment left it. Its figure and polish are quite gone, and it is
  studded     all over with carbonaceous matter of a somewhat
  metallic brilliancy, which, on examination with a magni
  fier, appears to be plumbago, in union with the surface of
  the diamond.

       III.  An   amethyst,     weighing iT*7    carat>   in 40" broke into
  several pieces.       At    the end    of  1' 55" the fragments were
  withdrawn       and again weighed, as there was reason to supect
  that some of them had flown off. Some of them, weighing
  ¦|4ths of a carat, were then taken and exposed to she heat for
   l' 15", when they became fused into one mass, which, on
  cooling, again broke into several pieces.
       The colour of the stone is gone; the fragments are semi-
   transparent, and very much resemble fragments of crystals of
  a pure white      salt ; such,   for instance, as purified nitre. The
  fused mass might perhaps have been preserved entire, if the
  precaution of cooling it slowly, by placing it under a muffle,
 or in a crucible, in a furnace, and suffering the fire to die
  away gradually, had been taken ; but this was not attempted.
       IV. Another amethyst, weighing half a carat, exposed to
 the heat for 5', was fused into a globule which is nearly
 spheroidal      and   pretty smooth,       but full- of small bubbles and
 cracks,      similar to those in glass which "is thrown, when
  heated,    into water. The whole is colourless arid transparent
  like flint glass, except a portion on one fide, which, having
  probably been least heated, looks like white enamel.                 The
 stone lost    Tj  part   of its weight.

  heat was applied with caution, by exposing it first to the
 action of a lamp urged by a common blow-pipe, broke into
  three pieces, but seemed to have undergone no other change

 upon the charcoal for z' 6". Two of the pieces became co
 lourless  and    have some     resemblance     to alum ; the third re
 tains, in some measure,         its original colour.       Their present
 weight is ^tbs of a carat.          They    have   all  of  them lost a
 considerable portion of their transparency,            but have a rough
 polish, and retain their facets.
     VI. Another sapphire, in the form of a parallelopipedon,
 weighing ^Jths of a carat, being exposed to the strong heat
 for 2' 53", had its angles rounded off, so that it became re
 duced to the form of a tamarind-stone, and loft its trans
 parency.      It is now a semi-transparent whitish mass, but
 still retaining some traces of its original colour. It is in part
  covered and interspersed with a kind of brown scorite very
 hkfe copper bronze.        The weight is the fame as at first.
      VII.  Seven sapphires,    weighing together ||ths of a carat,
 heated for 9' 55'', lost 110 weight, but became agglutinated
 together j the fused coat in which they are enveloped having
 the appearance of a whitish semi-transparent vitreous cement,
  through which the remainder of the stones are seen still re
  taining somewhat of their colour.           One portion or face of
  the mass, containing two of them joined as already men
  tioned, Was afterwards subjected to the lapidary's wheel : it
  took a good polish, and proved as hard as at first. The ap
  pearance    of  the  different parts of the polished         face, is the
  fame as that    of other similar   parts- of the mass.

  double blow-pipe of a new construction, suggested arid exe
  cuted   by  Mr. Varley,     and    which    wiH be described,      along
  with Ihe other parts of the apparatus, in its proper place.
  The stone entirely lost its eolotfr, and now resembles a piece
  of borax. The fusion, if there was any, was extremely superfi
  cial^ being only just sufficient to destroy the polish, the form
  and facets still remaining, with the angles a little obtunded.

haw       lost none       of their weight.              Being heated a second time
for 4' 30", they melted into a globule, which broke in cool
ing.   The principal portion is roundish, and the fusion has
evidently been. complete.: it has a brownish appearance on
the    fused surface,          but' is dearer in the fradlure;                         the whole
being somewhat              like   a    piece of dirty camphor.                       The weight

        One weighing |-Jths of       carat,             a               heated          for   a   '9",
seems slightly and superficially fused                        s   it   is   cracked,       but the
pieces have not separated.                        The weight       and          colour are the
fame as before.             It   is    well known that rubies, when exposed
to    acommon lamp and blow-pipe, become colourless, but
recover their colour suddenly and instantly on cooling, when
a little below  red heat. This ruby, after its exposure to the
                       a
intense heat excited               by   the decomposition              of the         oxygen      gas,
resumed           its colour as         it   would have done           if       it   had been ex
posed       to   a   lower heat.
     XIII.
         Five rubies, weighing together half    carat, were                      a
exposed to the  heat  for  without losing any weight.
                                          4'           The
whole became agglutinated into a shapeless mass, in which
the remains of the original stones now appear interspersed in
a  white vitreous cement.   The colour of the smaller stones
was changed             whitish,       but one larger portion was but little
altered         in this   respect.

                                        carat, heated for 5' 8',
  lost no weight : they were agglutinated, like the former, into
'
  a shapeless mass (which afterwards broke in two), with the
fame appearance  of a whitish vitreous matter interposed.                         One.
small portion of the surface still retained a fine polish.                        An
other part of it was afterwards                 polished by the lapidary      :    the.
stone was found to, be as hard              as before.
      XV. To        prove    whether   a longer exposure would not pro
duce a more perfect fusion, seven              more, which weighed to
gether half a carat,            were subjected to the heat for 9' 2", but
without undergoing any other change than that of being suf
ficiently fused to be firmly agglutinated together by a white
vitreous cement : the colour of the stones themselves remains,
in   certain degree, unaltered.

   XVI. Nine rubies, weighing £*ths of a carat, were in
tended to be exposed for a still longer portion of time, but,
aster 6' 10", were observed to be in fusion.  They were then
withdrawn, and the mass weighed, but no loss of weight was
perceptible. They now compose an opake, dirty-looking,
whitish mass, somewhat like melted camphor, and which,
has evidently been              perfectly fused.  A few small portions
still      retain   somewhat      of their original colour; but would
probably, also, have become while or gray, hy                       a   longer con
tinuance of the heat.
      It    is,   perhaps, worthy of observation, that
                                               happy acci           a
dental arrangement of the substances employed, will some
times produce instantaneously more powerful effects than                            a
longer exposure             under other circumstances.              This   was the
cafe       in   the present instance   ;   for the      weight of   the rubies used
 in   the last experiment, was to that of those employed in the
preceding one, as     to 2, and yet, though the beat was ap
                            3
plied for little more than 2-3ds of the time, the effects were
much more striking.
   Some remark may perhaps also be applicable with regard
to the white vitreous substance into which the surfaces of the
 stones become changed.    Is   probable that the alkali of the
                                           it
 charcoal contributed to destrov the colour of the stones   or,              ?
 Would     carbonaceous substance, containing no alkali, have
                a
exhibited with them the same phænomena in all respects?
                                                                              This,

at least possible, however, that the results might be different
if   fusion     could be effected under circumstances                  which should
preclude the possibility of extraneous admixture.   It   per                  is,
haps, not altogether absurd to suppose that the mass might in
that cafe entirely retain its original colour and that at some;
future, and perhaps not very distant period, small stones and
                                  a
fragments may be fused into larger masses possessing all the
properties of the natural gems with as much certainty as
metals are now cast into ingots.

V. An         Essay on the Declivities      of Mountains.'             By   Richard

A,tMONG      the various causes to whose activity the planet
we  inhabit owes its present wonderfully diversified appear
ance, some undoubtedly exerted their influence from its very
origin,       and    others    at subsequent       periods    ;   of   these last, one
at least, namely, the Noachian deluge, was universal in its
operation, while the effects of many more were partial and
local, suxh as those resulting from earthquakes, volcanos,
particular inundations, &c.
     In   a   general survey     of   the globe   it   only to general causes
                                                       is
whose operation was universal               that    our attention can be            di
rected,       the effects     of partial causes being the proper objects
of     the geological history         of those countries that were parti
cularly affected        by
                    them.
   But to distinguish causes of the former class from those
whose operation was more confined,      necessary to discover
                                                    it   is
some character          by    which    their effects may unequivocally be
discerned.
     Now,      a   general uniformity, or agreement in some particular
circumstance, in every part of the globe, seems to be   sure                   a
test of the operation of some general cause. The discovery

  in geological      researches.       In the present essay I shall confine
  myself to the investigation         of one instance of this fort, namely,
 the inequality of declivity which the sides or flanks of moun
 tains exhibit, in every part of the globe hitherto examined,
 according to the points of the compass to which they face,
  and arc exposed.
      That one part of almost every high mountain or hill is
  steeper than       another, could not have escaped the notice of
  any person who had traversed such mountains; but that Na
  ture, in the formation of such declivities, had any regard to
  different aspects or points of .the compass? seems to. have -been
  first remarked      by the celebrated Swedish geologist Mr. Tilae,
  in the 22d Vol. of the Memoires of Stockholm for 1760 *.
 Neither Varenius, Lulolph, nor Buffon in his Natural His
 tory published in 1748, have noticed this remarkable cir
 cumstance.
      The    observation    of Tilas, however, relates only to the ex
 treme ends, and         not to the flanks of mountains : with respect
 to the former,       be remarked that the Jteepejt declivity always
 faces that part of the country where the land lies lowest, and
the genttejl that part of the country where the land lies-
highest ; and that, in the southern and eastern parts of Swe
 den, they consequently           slice   the east and south-cast, and       in
the northern the weft.            The     essential part  of this observation
extends       therefore only to the general          elevation or depression
 of the country, and not to the bearings of these declivities.
      The discovery that the different declivities of the flanks
©f mountains bear an invariabse                   relation to their different
 aspects, seems to have been             first published   by Mr. Bergman
 in his Physical Description of the Earth, of which the second
 edition appeared in 1773.                  He there remarked, that, in
mountains that extend from north to south, the western flank
.k ihejkepeji and the eastern the gentf<-Jl c and that, in moun
tains which run          east  and    west, the southern declivity is      the
 steepest, and the northern the gentlest.                Vol. II. § 187.
      This assertion he grounds on the observations related                  in
his    first  Vol. §   32., namely, That       1 lily, in Scandinavia, hi  the*

     3dly, That in America the Cordelieres are steeper on the
 western      fide, which faces the Pacific Ocean, than on the
eastern    :   but he does not notice           a few exceptions      to this rule
 in particular       cafes, which      will   hereafter   be mentioned.
      Buffon, in the first Volume of his Epochs of Nature, pub
 lished in 1778, p. j 85, is the next who notices the general
 prevalence of this phenomenon, as far as relates to the eastern
 and western fides of the mountains that extend from north to
  south,    but he is silent       with respect to the north and south
  fides of the mountains that run from cast to west; nay,
  he does not seem to have a just comprehension of this phe
  nomenon, for he considers it conjointly with the general
  dip of the regions in which these mountains exist.                       Thus he
  tolls us, Vol. I. p. 185, that in all continents the general de
  clivity, taking it from the summit of mountains, is always
   more rapid on the western than on the eastern fide ; thus the
   summit of the chain of the Cordelieres is much nearer to
   the western        shores    than to the eastern         :  the chain which
   divides the whole length of Africa, fr6m the Cape of Good
   Hope to the Mountains of the Moon, is nearer, he fays, to
   the western than to ths eastern seas : of this, hoWever, he
   must have been ignorant,              as  that tract of country is still un
   known.
       The mountains which rtni from Cape Comorln through
   the peninsula of India, aTe, he says, much nearer to the sea
   on the east than on the west : he probably meant the con
   trary,   as the fact is      evidently so; and        so he    states   it in the
    second Volume,          p. 295   :  the same,     he tells   us, may be ob
    served   in islands and peninsulas, and in mountains.
       This remarkable circumstance of mountains Was, notwith
    standing, so little noticed, that in 1792, the author of an ex
    cellent account of the territory of Carlsbad in Bohemia, tells
      * The    verticality  of the sides is inversely as the length  of the descent.

   us he bad made an observation,                   which he had never met
   with in any physical description of the earth, namely, that
  the southern declivity of all mountains was much steeper than!
  the northern, which he proves by instancing the Erzgebirgc
  of Saxony,         the Pyrenees,       the mountains of Switzerland,
  Savoy, Carinthia, Tyrole^ Moravia, the Carpathian, and
  Mount Hæmus in Turkey,                    a Bergrcu Jour. 1792, p. 385,
  in  the note.
     Herman         in his Geology, published in 1797, p. 90, has at
  least partially mentioned this circumstance, for he fays that
 the eastern declivities of all mountains              are.  much gentler and
 more thickly covered with secondary strata, and to a greater
 height, than the western flanks, which he instances in the
 Swedish        and Norwegian          mountains,      the  Alps,   the Cauca
 sian,    the Appennine           and the Ouralian       mountains     ;  but the
 declivities,      bearing a southern        or northern aspect,         he does
 hot mention.
     La Metherie,          in the fourth Volume          of his Theory of the
 Earth, of which             the second edition appeared in 1797, a
 work      which      abounds in excellent observations),               p. 381 *,
 produces numerous instances of the inequality of the eastern
 and western declivities, but scarce any of the northern and
 southern,      whose difference       he does not seem to have noticed j
but he makes a remark, which I have not seen elsewhere,
that the coasts of different countries present similar declivities.
     With      regard to eastern and western aspects, he thinks that
a different law has obtained in Africa from that which has
been observed           in other countries     ;   for in that   vast  peninsula
he imagines the eastern declivities of mountains are the.
steepest, and the western the gentlest.                 Of this, however, he
adduces no other proof but that the greatest rivers are found
on the western         side :   this proof seems   insufficient, as,   if moun
tains be situated far inland, great rivers may flow indiscrimi
nately from any fide of them, and sometimes few rivers flow
even from the fide whose descent is most moderate, for in
stance, from the eastern side of the mountains of Syria : the
Elbe     and the Oder, two           of the greatest rjvers      in Germany,
take     their     course     from the western        fides,  the first of the
       •  It is to be regretted that he scarce   ever quotes his authorities.
                                                                      Bohemian

 Bohemian and the other of the Moravian mountains, which yet
 are the steepest; many originate from lakes, as the Shannon
 with us ; many take such a winding course, that, from a bare
 knowledge of the place of their disemboguement, it is im
 possible to judge from what side of a mountain they issue, if
 from any ; their course at most discovers the depression of the
 general    level  of  the country.
    In   1798,     the   celebrated     traveller and circumnavigator,
 John Keinhold          Foster,   published a geological tract, which,
 merits   so  much more attention as all the facts were either
 observed by himself, or related to him by the immediate ob
 servers.     In this    he states, as a fact universally     observed, that
 the south and south-east          fides    of  almost  every mountain arc
 steep,   but that the north and north-west sides are gently co
 vered, and connected, with secondary strata in which organic,
 remains abound, which he illustrates by various instances,
 some   of which       have    been    already,    and others will presently
 be, mentioned.
    At   present     this fact attracts the greatest attention, being
 obviously     connected      with the original structure of the globe,
 and clearly proving that mountains are not mere fortuitous
 eruptions, unconnected with transactions on the surface of
 the earth,     as has   of  late been confidently advanced.
    I  shall now state the principal observations            relative to this
 object that have'bcen made in different parts of the world.

    In Guiana there is a chain of mountains that run from
east to west; their southern flanks are steep, their northern
gentle.      Voyages de Condamine, p. 140.
    To   assign the causes of this almost universal allotment of
unequal     declivities to opposite    points, and why the greatest
are directed     to the west and south,     and the gentlest, on the
contrary, to the east and north, it is necessary to consider,
    i° That all mountains were formed while covered with
water.
    2° That the earth was universally covered with water at
two different æras, that of the Creation, and that of the
Noachian deluge.
   30   That in    the first æra we must distinguish      two different
periods, that which preceded the appearance              of dry land,
and that which succeeded the creation          of fish, but before the
sea   had   been reduced nearly to its present level      : during the
former, the primæval         mountains    were   formed, and during
the last,   most    of the secondary    mountains and strata were
formed.
   40    That all mountains      extend either from east to west, or
from north       to south,   or in some intermediate direction be
tween these     cardinal points, which need not be particularly
mentioned here, as the fame species of reasoning must be
applied to them, as to those to whose aspect they approach
most.
   These preliminary circumstances being noticed, we are
next to observe that, during the first æra, this vast mass of
                                  Fa                             water

36                 On  the  Declivities of Mountains,
water -moved in two general directions, at right angles with
each other; the one from east to west, which needs not to
be proved, being the course of tides which still continue,
but were in that ocean necessarily stronger and higher than
at present ; the other from north to south ; the water tending
to those vast abysses then formed in the vicinity of the South
Pole,   as  fliown in my former           essays.   Before either motion
could be propagated, a considerable time must have elapsed.
    Now the primæval mountains formed at the commence
ment of the first     sera,   and before this double direction       of the
waters    took place,    must have opposed a considerable          obstacle
to the motion of that fluid in the sense that crossed that of
the direction of these mountains.              Thus, the mountains that
 stretch from north to south must have opposed the motion                 of
the waters from east to west ; this opposition, diminishing the
motion of that fluid, disposed it to suffer the earthy particles,
with which in those early periods it must have been impreg
nated, to crystallise or be deposited            on these eastern flanks,
 and particularly on those of the highest mountains, for over
 the lower it could easily pass : these depositions, being inces
 santly repeated     at heights gradually diminishing as the level
 of   the  waters    gradually lowered, must have rendered the
 eastern declivities, or descent, gentle, gradual, and moderate ;
 while the western sjdes, receiving no such accessions from
 depositions, must have remained steep and craggy.
    Again, the primæval mountains that run from east to west,
 oy opposing a similar resistance to the course of the .waters
 from north to south, must have occasioned similar depositions
 on the northern sides of these mountains, against which these
 waters impiuged, and thus smoothed them.
     Where mountains            intersect  each   other in an oblique di
 rection, the north-east side         of one range being contiguous lo
 the south-west flanks of another range, there the afflux of
 adventitious particles on the north-east side of the one must
 have frequently extended to the south-west side             of  the other,
 particularly    if that    afflux were strong and copious      : thus the
 Erzgebirge of Saxony, which               run from west to east, have
 their north-east     sides   contiguous to the south-west side of the
 Riesengebirge     that separate Silesia from Bohemia         j and hence
                          7                                            these

                  On the Declivities of Mountains.                  37
these latter are cdvered     with the same beds of gneiss, &c. as
the northern      sides of the Saxon, and thereby are rendered
smooth and gentle comparatively to die opposite side, which,
being sheltered,      remains   steep   and abrupt   ; which explains
the seventh observation.
     The  causes here assigned explain why the covering         of  ad
ventitious strata on the highest mountains is generally           thin
nest at the greatest height, and thickest towards the foot, of
the mountain ; for the bulk of the water that contained the
adventitious particles being proportioned to its depth, aud
the mass of earthy particles with which it was charged being
 proportioned to the bulk of-water that contained them, it is
 plain, that    as the height of water gradually decreased, the
 depositions    from it on the higher parts of the mountains
 must have been less copious than on the lower, where they
 must have been oftener repeated.
      Hence, 2°, granitic mountains, generally the most antient,
 frequently have their northern or eastern fides covered with
 strata of gneiss or- micaceous schistus, and this often with
 argillite,   or primæval     sandstone    or limestone, these being
 either   of somewhat    later  formation,     or longer suspendible in
 water.
      Hence, 30, different species of stone are often found at dif
  ferent heights of the fame flank of a mountain, according as
  the water which conveyed these species happened to be dif
  ferently impregnated at different heights : during the first æra
  its depositions formed the primitive stony masses ; but after
  the creation of sisti, limestone, sandstone, farcilites, and se
  condary argillites, in which piscine remains are found, were
  deposited.    But, during the second cera, viz. that of the Noa-
   chian deluge, by reason of the violence and irregularity of its
   aggression, the depositions^were more miscellaneous,         and are
   found at the greatest heights; yet, in general, they may well
   be distinguiflied by the remains of land animals or of vege
   tables, or of both, which they present in their strata (or at
   least by the impressions      of   vegetables which they bear), as
   these must have been conveyed         after  the earth had been in
   habited.    But mountains regularly stratified bearing such re
                                                                 mains,

   38                  On the Declivities     of Mountains,
   mains, for instance        the carboniferous,         cannot be deemed t»
   have    been formed      in  a period    so  tumultuous.        During this
   deluge the waters also held a different course, proceeding at
   first from south to 'north, and afterwards in both opposite di
   rections in our western          hemisphere,      as  fliown in treating    of
   that catastrophe     in my    second essay.
       Hence,     and from various contingent local causes, as par
   tial inundations, earthquakes,         volcanoes,     the erosion  of  rivers,
  the elapsion       of strata, disintegration, the disruption of the
  lofty    mounds     by which many lakes were antiently hemmed
  in, several changes were produced in particular countries that
  may at first sight appear, though in reality they are not, ex
  ceptions to the operation of the general causes already stated.
      Thus    the mountains      of Kamlkatka       had their eastern flanks
 torn and rendered abrupt by the irruption of the general de
  luge, probably accompanied by earthquakes.                     And thus the
 Meissener        had its east and       north flanks undermined by the
 river Warra,        as  Werner      has shown     :   thus    the eighth and
 sixteenth      observations   are accounted      for,   as is the  thirteenth,
 by the     vast  inundations     so  frequent in this country, 1 Pallas,
 p. 172, which undermined or corroded its east fide, while
 the western were smoothed by the calcareous depositions
 from the numerous rivers in its vicinity.
      Hence, 40, we fee why on different sides             of lofty mountains
 different species of stones are found, as Pallas and Sauflure
 have observed, 2 Sauss. § 981 ; a circumstance which Sauf-
 fure imagined almost inexplicable,             but which Dolomieu has
 since happily explained, by showing that the current which
 conveyed       the calcareous     substances to the northern,          eastern,
 and north-eastern fides         of  the  Alps, for    instance,   was stopped
 by the height of these mountains, and thus prevented from
 conveying them to the southern fides ; and thus the north
eastern      fides were    rendered      more gentle than the opposite.
3 New Roz. p. 425, conformably to the theory here given.
      Hence, 50, where several lofty ridges run parallel to each
other it must frequently happen that the external should in
tercept the depositions that do not surmount them, and thus
leave the internal ridges steep on both sides.
                                                                        Hence,

                   On    the  Declivities of Mountains.                  39
    Hence, 6°, low granitic or other primitive hills are fre
 quently uncovered by adventitious strata on all sides, as at
 Phanet in the county of Donegal, or are covered on all sides;
 the impregnated waters either easily pasting over them, or
 stagnating    upon them, according to the greater or lesser ra
 pidity of its course, and the obstacles it met with.
    The two-fold motion of the antient ocean is noticed both
 by Busson and Bergman, but neither of them has deduced
 from it the true explanation of the phænomena of which we
 here   treat.    Busson      attributes   the formation     of  secondary
 mountains to deposition          or sediments from the       sea after the
existence    offish,   1  Epoques, p. 143, in 8vo., which, he fays,
invested the bases of mountains, without noticing any distinc
tion of fides, p. 144 and 170.              He thinks these sediments
were equally conveyed from both poles towards the equator;
 for it is in the equatorial regions that, he thinks, those mighty
caverns opened, towards which the primitive                ocean was im
 petuously     borne, and in which it was ingulphed ; p. 181,
 182, and 183.        If  so, similar declivities sliould be formed on
the southern as on the northern fides of mountains ; which is
contrary to the observed facts. His explanation of the eastern
and western declivities is defective and erroneous ; for he at
tributes the abruptness          of  the western fides to the erosion    of
the coasts on that side          (an erosion that exists only in fancy),
and    the smoothness         of  the eastern, to the gradual desertion
and retreat     of the sea on that fide, p. 184 and 185 ; a retreat
equally fictitious,       as De Luc has well shown.              Whereas,
since the     general     motion of the      sea is  from  east to west,  if
the erosion      were    of either side, it sliould rather be on the
eastern than on the western           ; besides, if the gentle declivities
of the eastern      sides    of mountains arose from the gradual re
treat of the sea,     the petrifactions of the secondary mountains
thus formed should consist of such sliell-fisli as inhabit slial-
low seas or shores, whereas they consist chiefly of those called
felagica, which inhabit the greatest depths*.
    With    -respect   to the eastern and western declivities,         Mr.
Bergman's account of the origin of their inequality agrees
exactly with mine, 2 Bergm. Erdeklotct, § 183 and 187;

would render the depositions equal on both sides ; which is

    Pyfoligneous yields ; and tbe Necessity of not considering
    them any longer as distinct Acids. ' By C. Fourcroy
    and VAUaOELlN *.
 w
           I.  On  tbe Multiplicity of tbe  Vegetable Acids.
          HEN       Bergman and Scheele had discovered several
vegetable     and animal acids before unknown, and had de
stroyed   the    pretended  identity admitted in regard to those
bodies, all the chemists employed themselves with great zeal
in subjecting various vegetable acid substances to a new exa»
m'm.uion.       The number of compounds, which till then             had  .
been reduced       to two kinds,    increased    so much, that it was
supposed it would far exceed that of the acids which had been
discovered among the fossils, and that it would be impossible
to set bounds to the multiplicity       of these natural productions
of  organised bodies.
   The four liquors, extracted         by distillation   from mucous
bodies, wood, and tartar, though owing             to  an artificial de
composition, have been comprehended in the class of the
vegetable acids, well characterised         as possessing a peculiar
nature  :  some analogies    founded    on their origin, their brown
colour, and their burnt odour, have caused them to be re
ferred to a special genus, under the name of the empyreu-
matic acids.       If we collect the facts which seem to prove
that they are different in nature not only from the other
acids, but from each other, they will easily sliow that these
acids have not been sufficiently examined to be well known              }
that chemists       had only very imperfect ideas respecting        their
nature ; and that it was       for want of accurate        analysis that
                 * From the Annalcs  <U Cbimie, No. 104.
                                                                    they

  they were thought to be different from each other, and dif
  ferent in their whole nature from any other vegetable acid.
            II.   Cbaraflers given    to the Pyromucous    Add.
     Lemery, Boerhaave, Neumann, Cartheuser, Macquer, and
  Bucquet, were the first who insisted on the specific characters
  of that acid which has been called the pyromucous in the
  Methodical Nomenclature,          and which had long been distin
 guished    by the name     of spirit os   honey,  of sugar, of manna,
  of gum, &c. M. Schrikel, in giving a detailed history of the
 analysis of sugar and of this acid in 1776, greatly enlarged
 and confirmed the ideas before conceived             respecting  the pe
 culiar nature of the pyromucous acid, and all chemists have
  since adopted that opinion.        It was characterised by its dark
 red colour when impure, and its golden yellow colour after
 being rectified ; by its odour of caramel, its very pungent
 taste, its volatility,   nearly similar to that of water; by its
 action on the skin, which it tinges red, and on the glass of
 retorts, which it seems to attack.          It was believed to be en
 tirely contained in mucous matters, and to be only developed
 by sire; it was said to be susceptibje of decomposition by
 heat, and of being converted          into gaseous bodies.      But,  be
 sides that its supposed action on glass depended only on the
adherence and penetration of the charcoal of the sugar ; be
 sides the proof, already well established, of its non-existence
in saccharine      and gummy matters, and of its entire produc
 tion by fire, it must be allowed that, in examining what has
 been done in regard to saline compounds and the attractions
of    the pyromucous acid, no result           had  been   obtained but
vague and undetermined notions, which seemed to excite
doubt and uncertainty in regard to the particular nature of
this acid. The reader will be enabled to judge of the truth
of this    assertion by perusing,   in particular, the details given
under the article Syrupy Add of the Di3ionnaire de Cbimie
Encydopedique, where our learned colleague Guyton has col
lected every thing then known respecting            this empyreumatic
acid   : when drawing up, therefore, the article in my System
of   Chemical Knowledge, written and printed several months
before    the discovery   now submitted to the Institute,          I was
    Vol. VIII.                        G                               not

42                  On the Identity           of the       Pyromucous,
not able to obtain the real distinguishing characters of the
pyromucous acid.
        III.    Char after s ascribed             to the   Pjrotartareous Acid.
     We     are indebted to Lemery and Neumann                                    for our first
knowledge of this acid,                  furnished    by distilled tartar, and dif
ferent from, the tartareous acid.                     They found that tartar, by
distillation, gave the fourth of its weight of acid phlegm.
According to the prescription of Neumann, it was to be rec
tified at      a gentlebut C. Guyton was not able to per
                          heat      ;
form that operation with success, and the retort was always-
broken by the explosion, which took place. The empyreu-
majic odour and taste of this acid are the two most striking
characters which    made it be admitted by chemists as a pe
culiar acid. It is difficult to conceive why Venel should take
this acid product of distilled' tartar to be nitric acid-, which
he thought might be extracted                        alone,    and      in    a    state     of pa
rity.      It   is no   less astonistiing          to hear     C. Monnet maintain,
in   consequence          of   experiments            made     at some length,                 that
distilled acid of tartar is muriatic acid, though he really found
in   it,according to his own acknowledgement, only approxi
mative characters.               The academicians of Dijon                        and    C. Bcr-
thollet, after repealing alt the experiments of Monnet-, were
convinced that there        no real analogy between the acid
                                        is
product of distilled' tartar and the muriatic acid. Scheele, in
proving that there       alwaysis little real muriatic acid in the
                                              a
alkali of tartar, insisted on the differences between this acid
and that of tartar. M. Fontana proved that the acid distilled
from tartar can be entirely resolved into carbonic acid gas
and' carbonated           hydrogen gas;               so   that,   by   bringing         it   nearer
to all the other vegetable acids, he removed further- every idea
of confounding            it   with the mineral acids.                   In   the last place,
Guyton, in the             first part        of   the first volume           of    the   Diclion-
naire      df   Ch'nnie Encyclcptdiquc,               published         in   1786,       after de
tailing all the different           opinions as well as the principal facts
known respecting               this acid, concluded that     would be ne it
cessary to constder            peculiar acid;
                               it   as   a       product of tartar a
altered        by
           heat, distinguished     from the latter         its being              by
incapable, of'crystallisation,  and       the soluble  by
                                                      salt  which                                 it
                               9                               forms                     -

               Pyrotartareous, and Pyroligneous Acids.              r    43
forms with lime        ; and he    called it the tartareous       empyren-
malic acid.        These ideas,     adopted in 1787 by the authors of
the Methodical        Nomenclature, induced them to distinguish
this acid by the name of the pyrotartareous acid. Since that
period, chemists have continued to consider this acid as a dis
tinct species, and no one has subjected it to a new examina
tion.
          IV.    CldraSlers given      to the  Pyroligneous Acid,
     Boerhaave first made known, under the name of acid spirit
of wood, the product distilled from woody bodies; and he
even compared           it to   a kind of vinegar. M. Goetliag has
given a particular history of it in Crell's Chemical Journal
for the year T779. Guyton made it known afterwards, under
the name        of the ligneous acid, in the first part of the Dic-
 tionnaire Encyclopidique, published in 1786.                   He collected
 all the information then acquired respecting this acid, ac
 cording to the experiments made by the Academy of Dijon.
 Every kind of wood examined has hitherto furnished by dis
 tillation the same acid ; the difference in regard to colour,
 savour, acrid odour, and particularly that of saline com
 pounds, formed by the liquid distilled from wood, have made
 it  to be distinguished from every other acid: in the Methodical
 Nomenclature         it has been called the pyroligneous acid, and
 in my     System    of Chemistry I      classed   it with the pyromneous
 and pyrotartareous         acids, as forming        with them a kind of
 acids    composed       of  species analogous to each other in the
 ratio of their identic origin,        and    of  some comparative pro
 perties     manifestly depending on          their empyreumatic state.
 The    characters     adopted to distinguish the pyro-ligneous acid
  were,    its smoky smell,        its reddish    colour,   its  property of
 giving    a  lasting stain to wood, the salts which it formed with
  alkaline bases, and the elective           attractions which it obeyed.
  In giving     a systematic explanation         of the properties of this
  acid,   as   well  as   in  regard to those     of the pyromucous      and
  pyrotartareous      acid,    the want     of more     accurate knowledge
  was always      felt; characters sufficiently striking and well de
  fined, proper to distinguish these three acids from each other,
  could not be found ; and even after they had been classed
  together into a distinct genus, on account of their empyreu-
                                       G  3                            malic

chemists wished to explain what were the peculiarities of
each species, they were obliged to acknowledge that the exa
mination of these productions of fire had not been carried to
a sufficient      length, and that their properties                          had not been so
thoroughly studied            as to enable               them      to assign characters
sufficiently striking, and to give               a       correct history of them.
  V. First View of the              Acetous Nature              of    the Empjyreumatic
                                            Acids,
     Such was the uncertain             state   of       the science in regard to the
three acids extracted from vegetable matters  by sire, when a
circumstance, presented, as it were; accidentally, gave us an
opportunity of discovering a new fact respecting their nature.
In   the course     of    those researches in which                    C. Vauquelin and
myself have been              so   long engaged               respecting       the chemical
analysis     of vegetable substances, and of she experiments
which      we made on the solid or ligneous parts of plants, we
were     employed some months in the examination of cork.
This epidermal covering of                   a species        of     oak had appeared to
me, for several years, lo be of a nature so very distinct from
other vegetable tissues as to deserve a particular research:
several experiments   on the epidermis of other trees had in
clined me to think that in their characters they approached
 near to cork, and I thought it my duty to present it as one
 of the immediate materials of plants under the name of
fuber.   Being desirous of carrying my first essays still further,
and     of giving more             extent    to these first ideas,              we began to
employ ourselves this summer                     on       a   more exact analysis of
cork.      Having     subjected a pretty large quantity                        of   it,   o'6tlb.
(three hectogrammes), to distillation wjth  naked sire, we               a
obtained from    fourth of its weight of very light and vo
                     it   a                                        a
latile oil, and almost the fame quantity of reddisli empyreu-        a
matic liquid, which exhibited all the apparent characters of
the pyroligneous acid.    But this acid liquor, when examined
with more care,           rectified        with alkalies, and
                                        and combined
disengaged from its bases               by
                              weak sulphuric acid, soon exhi
bited properties of real acetous acid, and, after having sepa
rated   it   by   flow distillation from the portion of coloured oil
                                                              which,

            Pyrotartdreous, and Pyroligneous Acids.                                45
which     it held in solution, it                  evidently appeared to be that
acid.
  When this           fact    was      once ascertained,         it was not difficult
for us to presume that the pyrol igneous acid, from whatever
wood extracted, could only be, acetous acid : we had even
reason to suspect that the two other cmpyrcumatic acids
were of the fame nature ; but as a conjecture, however well
founded, has no real value in physics,                       we called    in the   aid
of experiment         to enable        us to discover the truth, or to reject
our opinion      as   an error.
VI.     Neit) Examination               of   the    Pyromucous,     Pyrotartanous,
                             and Pyroligneous           Acids.
  I.    Having distilled, withgreat caution, sixteen parts of
pure sugar, which  furnished us with ten parts and a half of
water charged with reddish pyromucous acid, a little more
than four parts and a half of light charcoal, and half a part
of gas,   we combined this acid                    liquor with lime; the liqnor
was then evaporated to dryness,                       and afterwards treated in a
retort with weak sulphuric acid.      We thus obtained a pretty
thick, clear, orvery  little coloured liquid, having a very sen
sible acetous smell, and which, when combined with potash,
gave a very evident acetite              of   potash.      This    salt, indeed,   had
a dirty gray colour; but, by filtering a warm solution of it
through pounded charcoal, it lost the oil which coloured                            it,
and became quite clear.
  The     acid product, obtained                   from the first calcareous salt
by the sulphuric acid, was already much less coloured than
the pyromucous acid     now retained only very faintly the
                               ;   it
smell   of caramel (pan            sugar), which characterises           the acetous
acid.
  When      disengaged    second time from alkaline salt by the
                               a
sulphuric    acid,    was still purer, had nothing of its first
                       it
origin, and now exhaled only      pure acetous odour.
                                                   a   We
had reason, therefore, to conclude, from these experiments,
that the pyromucous acid was nothing else than acetous acid
united to an empyreumatic oil arising from the decomposi
tion of the sugar        by    fire.
  The     samp    result       took place with acid liquors extracted
                                                                 from

vegetable substances which are known to yield pyromucous
acid by distillation.
   3. Wbiie and purified tartar gave by the retort nearly a
half    less of acid liquor, than sugar furnished of pyromucons
acid.       This tartarcous acid product, obtained by a well re
gulated heat,         was almost transparent,                  and       had    not the red
dish-brown    colour of the empyreumatic acids extracted by
means of a strong heat.     It however had an acrid empy
reumatic odour, a heavy and highly coloured oil floated over
it,and, notwithstanding its pungent nature,      would have                    it
been difficult to ascertain   to be acetous acid
                                           it     this single                   by
experiment        :   but did not long deceive us. Having satu
                            it
rated      it   with potash immediately, on account of it* little
colour and impurity, we distilled                        it,
                                         after being evaporated
to dryness, with diluted sulphuric acid, and   furnished acetous     it
acid,      to be distinguished as such, without any mixture of
           easy
empyreuma.
   We found that                 by
                         distilling pyrotartareous acid, even not
rectified and in   red state, from off pounded charcoal, previ-
                        a
ousty      well lixiviated       and carefully dried,           it    lost      by   this simple
operation its empyreumatic nature      we are even persuaded
                                                          :
that mere filtration of this acid warm, through charcoal,                                     se
veral times repeated, would be sufficient to separate from                                    it
the oil, and to bring to the state of acetous acid almost pure.
                              it
  No doubt, therefore, can remain, that the pyrotarlareous
acid       is   acetous acid       rendered impure             by
                                                            portion of empy
                                                                     a
reumatic oil produced                 by   the decomposition of the tartareous
acid       by
        caloric.
     The pyro-ligneous acid obtained from (havings of beech
      3.
wood, distilled with care, formed with lime  brown salt not               a
crystaJlitible.   This salt, when treated with very weak sul
phuric   acid,  gave acetous acid, known     its smell, the de   by
liquescent acetite    formed with potash, or the crysialliJable
                            it
acetite obtained from              it   with soda.
   Another portion of the same primitive pyrolrgneoos ackl,
when immediately united to potasti, and filtered in its solu
tion through powdered charcoal, gave an acetite of potash
almost colourless,           from which weak sulphuric acid disengaged,

reumatic odour or fumes.                          \
    It  must here be observed     that the pyroligneous acid, that
of   the three acids obtained by fire which has the most striking
empyreuroatic odour and character, is also one of the three,
most difficult to be purified, and to be carried to the state of
very pure vinegar.        It does not, therefore, assume the nature
of the last, as the tarrareous acid does, by filtration alone,
nor even by two successive distillations from off powdered
charcoal.        By employing even the aid of ebullition and
strong agitation with charcoal, it cannot ,be deprived of its
oil, while both of these processes succeed with certainty and
 ease   in purifying the pyromucous acid, which, indeed, gives
 up with most ease its oil ; and even in purifying the pyrotar-
 tareous acid, though it be a little more difficult to separate its
 oil than that of the pyromucous acid.
      But though it is more refractory in opposing purification,
 and that kind of analysis of which I here speak, it is no left
 proved, that the pyroligneous acid, like the two preceding, is
  only acetous acid impregnated with empyreumatic oil, pro
 duced from wood altered by heat.
  VII.    Artificial Conversion   of the
                                         sure Acetous Acid into the
        Pyromucous,    Pyrotartareous, and Pyroligneous Acids.
      The preceding experiments might        be sufficient to make us
  acquainted with the identic and real acetous nature of the
  three empyreumatic acids, which have been hitherto consi*-
  dered as forming three distinct acids, and belonging to a
  genus well characterised.       But to these experiments a supple
  ment was still wanting ; it was necessary to inquire whether
  it was not possible to imitate these acids with that of vinegar,
   by adding what seemed to be added to it in each of these acids
   produced    by sire.
       It  was before fully proved that each of these products of
   distillation differed   from the other two by an empyreumatic
   oil united to it by the effect of its distillation alone. It was
   very easy, therefore, to try to distil vinegar from off oils dis
   tilled from a mucilage, tartar, and wood. This trial was
   attended with all toe success that could be- expected.         Acid

 of vinegar,            heated      in    a retort    with each of these three       oits>
 furnished          a    coloured          and   odorous        product exactly of the
 fame nature as primitive pyromucous, pyrotartareous, and
 pyroligneous acids: the odour and smell of these acids were
 very perceptible 5 only these factitious empyreumatic acids
 were a little stronger and sourer than those arising from dis
 tillation,but nothing more was necessary to Carry them to
 the fame state of weakness than to add to them a little water.
    By repeated trial we obtained a manner of forming with
 the acid of vinegar the three empyreumatic acids much
speedier,        and in a more simple manner, than by distillation.
We found that it                   was sufficient       to throw some drops     of   the
empyreumatic oil of mucilages, of tartar, or of wood, into the
acetous acid, to suffer them to remain some time together, or
to fliake them strongly, to imitate these acids made by sire.
The oil         almost immediately unites with the acid, dissolves                    in
it,     gives   it   a    red or brown colour, and communicates to                     it,
at the fame time, the acrid odour and bitter pungent taste
known in the pyromucous, pyrotartareous, and pyroligneous
acids.
    The       acetous acid           is   then   a   real solvent   of empyreumatic
oils, and in that cafe                    it   assumes the      characters of the acid
liquors or odorous                 spirits, as they were        formerly called, which
issue     from vegetable                  matters     treated   by fire.  To separate
these oils dissolved               in    the acetous acid, and to bring back the
latter to its purity and to its primitive simplicity, -the fame
means must be employed as for freeing the acetous acid from
the empyreumatic acids united to        when obtained      itdis               by
tillation,viz. filtration, agitation, ebullition with charcoal,,
union with lime and alkalies, and the disengagement of these
combinations              by   weak sulphuric acid.
    It to this solubility of oils in the acetous acid, that the
         is
odour which this acid                     so
                           easily acquires and retains seems to
be owing        :   it   is   to   it    that we must ascribe the distinction of
agreat number of empyreumatic acids, which several che
mists have been induced to make, and which they could not
avoid     doing, while continuing to consider, in the acid pro
ducts of distilled vegetable matters, the odour, colour, and
favour, as characters proper,                    if   not for positively ascertaining,
                                                                                    at

other ; and especially by comparing these characters in acid
products furnished by kinds of wood very different in their
properties,         and consequently               in their products.

   After having                  that mucilages, saccharine bodies,

each      of          by a portion of oil, having a peculiar
               these bodies
odour, smell, and colour, and that, consequently, we ought
to deduct from the number of the vegetable acids these three
empyreumatic acids, we thought it might be useful to science
to give some observations here on the production of the
acetous acid. The knowledge which the chemical art pos
sesses at present respecting this production,                                    though much
more extensive than formerly, has never yet                                     been collected
into any work ; it may, however, be of great                                    importance in
vegetable analysis : such is the motive which                                   induced us to
present a short view of                      it,
                               without, however, entering into
all the details which the subject might require in  systematic                    a
work.
     The formation of                the acetous acid, which has always been
believed        to be necessarily               produced         by   a   fermentation pecu
liar to vinous liquors,                 is   so    frequent       in      the processes of art
and the operations               of    nature,       that   it   is    indispensably       neces
sary to make            it   a       general       phenomenon, and to study this
phenomenon under the name of acetification, as proper -to
throw light on the chemical properties of organised bodies.
We may consider    cither  regard to substances, susceptible

of acetification, or in                regard        to circumstances            which favour
transformation into acetous acid.
     Under the first point of view, besides vinous liquors, which
were, first found,              and long thought to be, the only ones ca
pable of acetification, we have found     multitude of bodies     a
susceptible of  experiencing this change.  There      Icarcely                        is

                        It   is
    that milk in becoming four gives acetous acid; we have
    found that bouilli                   and animal           jelly form this            acid also     :    in   a
    word, we have said in other memoirs that                                        the urine          of    the
    mammiferæ, and that of man in particular,                                             had     the pro
    perty     of becoming             acetous,          and gave         a   great quantity            of   very
    strong acid           by   distillation.
         Thus       the number                of   the substances susceptible                   of     acetisi-
    cation     is   very considerable: extractive matter, mucilage, sac
    charine-bodies,                fæcula, and starch
                                                   ligneous bodies,    ;   even
    tan, the greater part of the primitive vegetable acids, the ge
    latin of animals, the caseous matter, and even uree, that body
    peculiar to urine, and which characterises        by its remark                 it
    able properties,all these products of vegetable and animal
    organisation and life are equally susceptible of acetification.
       It  true, that the circumstances
              is                           under which we have
    presented           their conversion                into acetous acid,               seem    all to be
    long to fermentation, and that
                   a                                                it might be thought that
    they follow a formation more or                                 less striking or fugitive of
    vinous matter, but                   it   remains for us to show that these mat
    ters may be acetified                     by phenomena or causes different from
    fermentation          ;    and this fact                 is   already       proved      by   the        acid
    productions of the distillation, which form                                     the principal sub

Jedge       of the chemical phenomena exhibited by vegetable
substances       in regard to their acidification in general, enables
us to observe and distinguish  four circumstances which pro
mote their acetificatiou or conversion into acetous acid.
     The     first    is,   the decomposing           action of the       sire     in distilla
tion.   Without here entering into more extensive details on
this subject, which, when we consider the object of this me
moir, are less necessary, we shall content ourselves with ob
serving, that this action of caloric,     disuniting the con by
stituent principles           of    vegetable     matters, combines                a   part   of
them       in   such   a    manner               birth to acetous acid; and
                                         as to give
that this conversion                is   accompanied with the formation of
water, the formation and disengagement of gaseous carbonic
acid, and the precipitation of carbon in the state of charcoal.
     The             of acetification of vegetable compounds
            second mode
is                              of powerful acids, and parti
     that arising from the action
cularly of the sulphuric, the nitric, and the oxygenated mu-
                                                                                                   •
riatic on these compounds.       This kind of production takes
place in gums, sugar, extracts,                   and gelatin, when treated by
acids   ;    the greater part        of the other       vegetable acids, and even
alcohol itself, often experience such   change     the decom
                                                        a                 by
posing influence   of the acids above mentioned.    While this
kind of acetification takes place, there are formed also water
and carbonic acid            ;   sometimes        carbon likewise             is   deposited.
We        must       here add, that this acetification              is   the last term        of
vegetable acidification in general, since in treating acetous
acid by the fame decomposing action of the mineral acids,
you destroy its acetous nature, and make      pass to the state   it
of water        and carbonic acid, as             is   the cafe in every vegetable
decomposition carried               to its maximum.
   The third mode of acetification     the oldest known of the
                                                       is
whole, and the only one formerly admitted           the acetou3    :    it   is
fermentation that converts all the different kinds of wine into
flnegar: in this there   neither  precipitation of carbon, nor
                                    is            a
disengagement   of carbonic acid.         well known that
                                                        It   is                               it
takes place in consequence of an absorption of the oxygen of
the       atmosphere,         and     that   it   supposes        the    preexistence         of
vinous liquors.
     In    the last place,         we consider as the fourth and last mode
                                             Hi                                               of

of acetification,a kind of peculiar fermentation, which does'
not require the presence of wine, which takes place in mat
ters foreign to the nature of vinous liquors, and which has
some relation to putrid decomposition.     It is that observed
in animal liquors abandoned to themselves, and particularly
in urine.
   Each of these modes of acetisication, though equally giving
birth to acetous acid, and supposing the same composition
from which that acid arises, since it is the fame in every cafe                                      .
when it has been purified, admits, however, a difference in
the products which accompany it. Each of the acetous acids
arising from         it,
               presents indeed specific character proper for
                                                   a
making      known and for indicating

VII.    Account of a fatal Accident which happened to a Tra
    veller on   the Glacier of Buet ; with some Cautions to those
    who through Curiosity may visit the Mountains of Swiffer-
    land, and particularly the Glaciers.            By M. A. PlCTET,
    Professor   of Philosophy   *.
A:Sentiment
      ,                   of curiosity, exceedingly natural, induces
travellers from all parts of Europe to visit Mont Blanc, the
highest point of the old world, and to examine Jhe surround
ing glaciers. Since the memorable ascension of the learned
historian of the Alps, these places have acquired a new de
gree of interest: the geologue,            the mineralogist, and the
mere amateur repair thither with             avidity  ;  and even women
are amply indemnified for the fatigue             of  the journey by the
pleasure    arising from the view of objects entirely new to
them, and by the amiable and friendly reception they meet
With frdm the inhabitants.              Every thing unites to make
this excursion,     which is attended with no real dangers, the
usual object of all curious travellers who visit Geneva and its
environs.
    The more this journey presents attractions, the more it is
of importance to make known the dangers to which travel
lers who undertake        it may   be exposed    merely by imprudence
or inattention.       Our principal view        is utility,    and without
doubt it is of utility to make known, in all places where this
journal may circulate, dangers which are indeed great to
those ignorant of them or who forgot them, but of little
importance to those who are forewarned or cautioned to
avoid them.        Had we treated this subject some years ago,
the. fatal accident which lately took place, and to which we
 were   almost    witnesses,  would not, perhaps, have happened.
 This reflection will not allow us to hesitate any longer. The
 experience   I have acquired by travelling among the mountains,
 either when accompanying my illustrious friend Saussure, or
 in ten journeys undertaken to the glaciers of Chamouni
 in particular, will      perhaps    entitle me to some confidence
 from those whom        I am desirous    of   saving from uneasiness or

 54                 Fatal Accident which    happened to
danger   :  I   shall, however, refer to the end of this article the
cautions in this respect which have been suggested to me hf
experience, and shall proceed to an account of that event
which induced me to take up my pen on the present subject.
    C. d'Eymar,         prefect of Leman, an enlightened lover of
the arts,    and a    passionate admirer of the beauties of nature,
having lately proposed to visit the glaciers of Chamo'uni, a
canton which at present forms the eastern boundaries of the
department       under his administration, invited me to accom
pany him      ;  and I readily embraced his obliging offer:      We
set  out on the 7th of August, and slept the first night at Sal-
lenches, as travellers do in general.
    Next morning, during our first hour's march, we met a
young man on foot, accompanied by a peasant who was
carrying    a valise.     We   were struck with the melancholy and
dejected     air of this peasant.      When we arrived at Servoz,
three   leagues      from Sallenches, we learned from Deville, a
very intelligent and experienced guide who attended us, that
the morning of the day before, a stranger, the companion of
the. young man we had met, being with his friend and a
guide on the glacier of Buet, had suddenly disappeared, at the
distance of some paces before them, in a crevice of the gla
cier covered with snow, which had given way under his feet.
When      they reached the mouth of the crevice, the bottom of
which they could not perceive, the two survivors called out
a great number of times, but in vain, to their unfortunate
companion swallowed           up in the abyss ; and they did not quit
the place     till they had lost all hope  of his safety. M. Zimpf-
fen, the young man whom we met, when he arrived at Ser
voz, had given Deville a commission in writing, to endeavour,
if possible,    to discover the body   of M. Eschen, his friend, and
to cause it to be interred.
    As scarcely twenty-four hours had elapsed since the events
 the sensible mind of d'Eymar was struck with a ray of hope,
and he immediately and officially enjoined Deville (for he
 hesitated, and not without reason) to furnisli himself with the
 necessary means, to set out in the utmost haste, accompanied
 by such    a   number of men       as  he presumed might be neces
 sary, and to give him an account of whatever should be the
                                                               result,

result.      It   was at least a journey                 of nine hours from Servoz
to the glacier in question ; and as this glacier did not form
any part of those we intended to visit, it was impossible for
us to be informed              of the    issue      of    the proposed search till we
passed     Servoz on our return from Chamouni,                                 to which we
continued our route not without dejection.
  It is with regret that I am obliged to omit the details of
the   stay we made in this interesting valley ; they have a cha
racter which. will always be imprinted in my remembrance,
but they would be foreign to the present object.       However,
while      the     brave      Deville     and his companions are engaged
with their enterprise, I shall                     venture    to suspend           the impa
tience of my readers for a   few moments in order to make
them acquainted with the glacier of Buet, and the motives
which might induce travellers to visit it.
     It   is to Messrs. De Luc, the two brothers, that philoso
phers      and naturalists are indebted for discovering the possi
bility of reaching this summit                     covered with eternal snow.                     It
is an insulated mountain situated in front of the central chain
to   which Mont Blancand its glaciers belong, and separated
from them by   lower chain that runs in a parallel direction.
                          a
This glacier may be seen from Geneva immediately on the
left of the M61e.               It   appears under the form                   of   a   ridge not
very salient,        and which seems to be easy                        of   access.        Messrs.
De Luc            were,       however, deceived       in "this respect, and the
account of three attempts                     they made to reach      the last ofit,
which alone, on the 20th of September                               1777,        was attended

                                         it   is
 induced them to visit this mountain, and to brave, three dif
 ferent times, difficulties and dangers of various kinds to
 which they          were       exposed in attempting to reach                         a   summit
 that may be considered                  as     boundary of
                                               the       utmost    possible
 philosophical observation.   Honour to that science which
 inspires courage so persevering, and which produces     in                                  it

 pected      that, seventeen years after this expedition, Saussure

   would repeat their experiment on Mont Blanc itself, that is
   to fay, about 850 toises higher than they were able to ascend
   after great danger and fatigue.
       Some years ago, a much easier route for arriving at the
  summit of Buet or La Mortine (for it is known by that name
  also) than that followed by Messrs. De Luc was discovered,
  and by this route             I  ascended it twice without experiencing
  any difficulty.           You first sleep at Chalets de Villy, the last
  place    of    pasture     of the valley which begins at Servoz and
  terminates        at  the glacjer of Buet.         From Villy you proceed
  to the Col de Salenton by a path practicable for mules ; you
  then encounter the mountain on its eastern and southern
  sides,    and, passing alternate declivities of snow and slate,
  reach the summit at the end of two hours and a half.                          The
 mean of two observations of the barometer which I made
 there, and which were very little different in their results,
 gave me 1594 toises for its height above the level of the sea.
      The mountain itself presents nothing very interesting in a
 lithologic point of view ; it consists of slate intermixed with
 veins of rotten quartz, or quartz similar to stalactites; but as
 a belvidere,         nothing in my opinion exists that can be com
 pared     to   it.    You here embrace at one view the whole space
 comprehended between Jura on the west, as far as the
 mouths of the Rhone on the east, and, on account of this
 circumstance alone, I considered this mountain as exceedingly
 proper for receiving signals in an intended measurement of
 a degree       of latitude      and two degrees of longitude in the pa
 rallel of Geneva          ; a  plan which may be found detailed in a
 memoir published              in the Philosophical Transactions of the
 Royal Society of London for the year 1791 *.
                                                                                  In
     *  I cannot convey a better idea of the sitivition      of this spot than by
quoting the words of         M.   De Luc :— " It is difficult to give a description,
 in words       when    they do not awaken sensations    which   have been   felt ; I
 do not, therefore, flatter myself with the       hope of exciting   in the minds
 of my readers      those  which   I then experienced. The most profound silence
prevailed     in these    regions ; we perceived that they were not made for
living beings;       they were as little   known to our guides     as to us.    The
Chamois goats never approach them, aud consequently no hunter had ever
ascended     so  far,
                                                                           «'  This

         In my        second journey          to mount Buet,             I  was under the
    disagreeable           necessity       of being constantly                enveloped      by
                                                                                        clouds
        " This      sensation   of profound solitude was one of        those   which we could
    most easily     explain,    but it does   doc    explain   our  situation.     We were on
   an immense extent           of snow, the whiteness of which nothing altered. The
   rays of the       fun,   reflected   in a straight line from the snow towards           that
   luminary, (bowed us how smooth it was; and this smoothness the imagina
   tion extended to every thinj; around.               We saw nothing hut this snow, and
   fie heavens, towards which it was terminated in various folds, delicately
   rounded       like   those beautiful    argentine clouds      which     are  sometimes  seen
   floating majestically in the pure atmosphere. This                was exactly what pro
  duced the extraordinary sensation which we then experienced.                       We actu
  ally thought ourselves suspended in Hie air on one of these clouds. — And
  what kind of air ? Never had we before seen it of such a colour. It was
  blue,      daik. and bright at the lame time, which produced an inexpres
   sible   foliation of immensity.
       " It was near noon when we arrived ; and, on raising our heads above
  the veil wh'ch so long concealed from us the eastern part of the horizon,
   « - ttiiUcnly discovered the immense chain of the Alps in an extent of
  more tiian fifty leagues.            On whatever side we turned our eyes, the whole
  horizon was covered with mountains.                  Its boundary on the weft was no
  thing but the thickness of the air; for we overlooked the chain of Jura,
  distant about thirteen or fourteen leagues, so much that we could have seen
  the plains of Franchc-Coroui            and Bui gundy, if the air had been sufficiently
  tianspirent.         On the south-west our view extended as far as Mount Ccnis,
  and on the north -e.,st probably as far as Saint Gothard.                       We were far
  raised above all the defiles of the Alps, and only a few of their peaks
  were elevated above us,
      "   In ail this     vast   space,  where    mountains were accumulated on each
 nther,      we could discover 00 plain          but jn a small corner to the west, the
 middle of which was occupied ny Geneva ; and on the porth-east we saw,
 almost from one end to the other, the large valley through which the
  Rhone flows, from the place where                 it sal!* from the mountains, as far as
 S1011, the capital       of the Yalais, distant from the place where we were nine
 or   ten leagues.        All the rest was tilled with mountains.
      " The      details as well as the cnjcmblc vvou'd have excited the attention
of    the most indifferent        ueholder.     A single view of the immense quantity
of     ice    and   snow    which     covers   the    Alps will be sufficient to satisfy
 the spectator respecting the duration of the Rhone, the Rhine, the Po, and
 th: Danube.           It inspires us with an idea that this is their common re
servoir, and thit it is sufficient to supply them with water duiing several
years of drought.             We compared, without having need of calculation,
their streams        with their sources.       These sources     appeared to us qnly small

58                         Fatal Accident           -which happened, ta
clouds during the fix hours I remained on it.                                      I    was ex
ceedingly cold, and, in order to warm ourselves,    I and my
guides were obliged to construct a hut on the ridge of
rocks nearest the summit.  We had at hand large pieces of
slate, and our building was lo solid that it still exists, and
has sheltered more than one curious traveller from the se
verity of the weather.
   The glacier, which covers this summit, differs from the
greater part of those accumulations of ice known under that
name in this respect, that the latter generally occupy the
valleys, or the defiles in which the ice has not been ori
ginally formed, but to which it has funk down by its own,
weight, and the pressure of the ice above it; whereas the ice
of Buet has been formed in the place where it exists j and
at     that       height     in our parallel the snow never melts                                 in,
summer.               This mountain, therefore, may serve to determine
with some             precision the lowest boundary of the snow    our,                     in
climates.
     Thus, for example,                    by   observing        from Geneva, through             a
telescope, furniflied                 with      a   micrometer,       the vertical angle
comprehended between                         the summit           of   the glacier and the
lowest boundary                 of   the snow,      I14', which,
                                                        found    it   to be 16'
taking the distance of Buet  from Geneva at 29820 toises, cor
responds to 141 toises, the distanced ijiis boundary below the
summit, which places     at 1453 toises above the level of the sea.
                                      it
     It   may here be asked, what                       is   the mean annual tempera
ture at this height in our latitude                          ?    We       have -pointed         out
somewhere                in our Journal             a   very      simple     formula, which
Saussure deduced from     great number of observations,

of Reaumur                 per toise     of perpendicular             elevation.        This     for

                       a Traveller             on the         Glacier ofBuet.                                 59
mula,        therefore,          applied to the mean temperature at the
level   of    the sea,         in the parallel of 46° (the latitude of Buet),
as established in Dr. Kirwan's Work on the Temperature
Of the Globe, viz. 56-4° of Fahrenheit, or io°,8 of Reau
mur, will give for 1453 toifes 14*53 degrees to be deducted;
which makes the mean annual temperature of the lower
boundary of the snow,                      in that parallel, to be 3*63 degrees
below zero*.
   It    is not surprising, therefore,                             that this mountain should
be crowned with a glacier,                           since the         snow which falls there
during the cold season, never entirely melts in the summer.
The water produced by the partial melting of the surface of
the snow filters through the porous snow beneath        and;                                         it,
freezing in its interstices gradually converts into ice. In                           it
this manner        formed an accumulation, the thickness of

    But I learned, not without surprise mised with horror,
by the event, of which I 3ni goin^r, to give an account,
that this glacier, so often vilited bv travellers, and which I
twice traversed      myself with perfect securitv, contains some
of those fissures, covered with snow, which renders others
dangerous when the proper precautions are uot employed.
    During     our stay     at Chamouni, C. d'Eymar having
 heard    that   the guide,     who accompanied the unfortunate
Elchen, resided somewhere           in the valley, sent for him, lo
learn    the   particulars   cf  the accident.    When he arrived,
despair was still painted      in his looks and whole countenance       ;
but we learned        nothing     from him that    we did not before
know-.     He   was a guide, selected by chance, who seemed to be
little acquainted with the mountains, and who, however, as
he told tis,    had requested      M. Eschcn, when     they arrived   at
the glacier, not to separate from his two companions.             Hur
ried    on, however, by that undcscribable sensation which
people sometimes experience when they reach high summits,
and    observing     at the   top   of  the glacier, a little distance
before him, two chamov hunters, who were resting them
selves, he hurried forwards lo join them ; aud it was then
that he disappeared.
    We sliall now return to our narrative.             As    we  passed
Scrvoa on the morning of the third day, the body of the un
fortunate Eschen was conveyed thither.            We viewed it with
the liveliest emotion ; and by minute inspection we were
convinced that he had not survived his fall         a single  moment.
We were fully confirmed in this opinion by the details
which were given to us, and by observing that three of the
real ribs on each fide were broken, and that there was a
great   depreflion of the sternum ; symptoms which indicate
that the unfortunate young man had experienced the most
hidden and most violent compreflion.              The body was no
ways disfigured, and his features, in perfect harmony, excited
no idea of his having suffered pain. We learned by the
passport found in his pockets,         along with other articles, that
his name was Frederick Augustus Eseheu ; that he was born
                                                                     in

 VIII.    Memoir      on   tbc   Ibis of     the Antient Egyptians.             By
                                C. CuvrEii*.
 EiiVERY        one has      heard   of the Ibis,        a  bird to which the
antient Egyptians paid divine honours ; images of which
 they placed in their temples ; which they suffered to wander
 about unmolested in their cities ; which they embalmed with
¦as much      care as they did their relations ; to which they
ascribed virginal purity, and an inviolable attachment to
 a country    of which it was           the emblem,         and     the figure   of
 which the     gods would have assumed, had they been forced to
 adopt one mortal.
    No animal ought to have been so easy to be distinguished,
for there is none of which they have left so many excellent
descriptions,      correct coloured figures, and even the birds
themselves carefully preserved with their feathers, under the
triple covering of that strong preserver bitumen, thick and
close bandages,        and of strong vases well covered with mastic.
Yet among all the modern authors who                      have spoken      of the
ibis, there     is none but Bruce,            a traveller celebrated by his
courage      and    his knowledge of natural history, who has
avoided error in regard to the real species of this bird; and
 yet his ideas,      however correct, have not been adopted                     by
naturalists.
    After   several changes       of opinion      respecting       the ibis,   na
turalists  at present seem       to agree in giving this appellation to
a bird, a native     of Africa, nearly of        the size    of  the stork,  with
white plumage, and the wing feathers black                     ;  raised on long
red legs, and armed with a long bent                bill,  sharp at the edges,
indented at the extremity, round at its base, and of a pale yel
low colour, and having its face covered with a yellow ikin,
4«stitute   of feathers,    and not extending beyond the eyes.

   Such is the ibis of Perrault *, the white ibis of BrifTon t*
the white Egyptian ibis of Buffon J, the tantalus ibis of
Linnaaus in the twelfth edition of his works; fuch is the
bird which in the National Mufaeurn   is called the Egyptian
ibis, and which is there placed near, and not without rea-
fbn, to the curicaca of Margrave, or the tantalus loculator
of Linnitus, for they both                      fharp, and in
                                                        have a hooked,
dented       bill.       To     the fame bird,
                                  according   to  Blumenbach,
who, however, confeffes that at prefent it is very rare, atleaft
in lower Egypt, the Egyptians paid divine honours §.
  I participated in the error of thefc celebfated men above
mentioned, till I had art opportunity of examining myfelf
fome mummies of the ibis. This pleafure was afforded to
me lately by Fourcroy, to whom General Grobert of the
Artillery, on his return from Egypt, prefented two of thefe
mummies.      On unwrapping it with care, we obferved that
the bones of the embalmed bird were much fmaller than
thofe of the tantalus    that they weTe fcarcely f» large as
                                        ;
thofe of the curlew ; that its beak refembled that of the
latter, the length excepted, which was fomewhat lefs, and
not at all equal to the tantalus ; in a word, that its plumage
was white, with the wing feathers black, as mentioned by
the anticnts.
    We        were       therefore convinced,                      that the bird which the
Egyptians embalmed was by no means our tantalus ibis j
that it was fmaller; and that it was neceflary to fearch for it
among the genus of the curlew.
    After fame refearch,                     we found              that \he mummies of                   the:

Ibis, opened before our tjme by different naturalists, bad
been similar to ours.          Button fays expressly that he exa
mined several of them ; that the birds they contained had
the bill and size of the curlew ; and yet he blindly followed
 Perrault, in considering the African tantalus as the ibis. One
 of the mummies opened by Buffon still exists in the Mu-
 sæum     ; it is similar to those we have seen. Dr. Shaw, jn the
 Supplement to his Travels*, describes and gives an exact;
 representation      of  the bones      of  a similar mummy     ;  the  bill,
 be fays, was six inches English in length, and resembled
 that of the curlew, &c. In a word, his description agrees
 entirely with ours.
     Caylus, in his Recueil d'Ant'iquilh f, gives the figure flf"
 a mommy ibis, the height of which, with its bandages, was
 only one foot, seven inches, four'lines ; though he fays ex
  pressly, that the bird was placed in it on its legs, with it*
  bead erect, and that no part was bent back in its embalmed
  state-
     Hasselquist,      who considered      as the ibis a ftnall white an4
  black heron, assigns as his principal reason for doing so, that
  the height of this bird, which is equal to that of the crow,
  corresponds      perfectly with the height of the mummies of
  the ibis | ; how then could Linnæus give the name of ibis
  to a bird as large as the stork j hqw, in particular, could he
  consider this bird to be the fame as the firdea ibis of Has
  selquist,    which,    besides   its   small size,   had a straight bill ;
  and how could this last error, jn regard to synonyms, be still
  retained in the Sjjlema Npturœ?
      The only' figure of the bill of an embalmed ibis, which
  does not accord       with ours,    is that given by Edwards §.         It is
   a third larger than it ought to be ; but as it contradicts all
   £he other testimonies,        we must believe that it was taken

     #4                              Memoir en the Ibis              of
     from the          mummy of
                            some bird different from the ibis ; of
    that the draftsman enlarged the proportions *.
      It was necessary, therefore, to seek for the real ibis some
    where else than among these birds of the tantalus kind, of a
    great height and with a (harp                     bill.      In viewing       the collection
    of birds, which Lacepede has arranged in such beautiful
    order in the Musæum of Natural History, we discovered a
    species,      never       before mentioned or described                   in any of the
    systematic   authors except Latham, and which alone corre
    sponds to every thing indicated to us, by antient authors,
    monuments, and mummies, as characters of the ibis.
       It is represented in the annexed figure (Plate III.) ; it is a
    bird of the size of the curlew ; its bill is similar to that of
    the curlew, but proportionally a little shorter, and of a black
     colour; two-thirds pf its head from the neck are hare of fea
    thers, and covered with sliort black down ; the plumage of
    the body, wings, and tail, is a dirty white, except the tips of
    the large wing feathers^ which are black, and those of the
    lower part of the back, which are of the same colour, and,
    being long, fall over the tips of th? wings when they are
    folded. The feet are black, and like those of the curlew.
       The individual in question formed part of the stadtholder's
collection, but we are unacquainted with its native country.
Desmoulins, who has seen two others, assures us that they were
both brought frorn Senegal ; one of them was even, brought
                                                          tie;
from that country by Geossroy        Yilleneuve   but, besides                :
that the climate of Senegal    in nothing different from that
                                                 is
of ^e Nile, we shall see hereafter that Bruce found this spe
cies in abundance in Egypt; and     imagine that the modems
                                                       I
will not admit, without                       some latitude,       the assertion        of   the
antients, that the ibis never quitted that sacred land.

             I                C. Olivier had the goodness to stiow ms

                          he took from two mummies

     Besides, this assertion would be as much contrary to the
 tantalus ibis as to our curlew ; for the individuals which we
 possess       of that      species,   have been brought from Senegal.                     It
 was from this country that Geossroy de Villeneuve brought
 the one in the Miisæum of Natural History : it is even much
 rarer in Egypt than our curlew, since, according to Perrault»
 no one had ever said that he saw it there, or had received it
 from that country.
    Since we are now acquainted with this bird, if we examine
 the works of the antients, and antient monuments, we shall
 find every difficulty vanish, and                        that all their testimonies
 agree with the best of all j which                   is,   the body    of   the bird itself
 preserved and embalmed.
                                           "    The       most common kind           of the
 ibis," fays Herodotus*,                " has
                              the head and neck bare, the
 plumage white, except the head, the neck, the tips of the
 wings, and the rump, which are black.  The bill and feet
 resemble those             of the other kind of ibis :"             and he had said     of
 the latter,       " they      are all black, have feet like the crane, and
a hooked bill." There are many modern travellers who do
not give such good descriptions of the birds they observe as
that which Herodotus has given of the ibis.     How could
naturalists apply this description to  bird having no part  a
naked but the face, which                  is   red   ?     To   a   bird which has the
ritmp white, and not black     This last character, however,
                                            ?
was essential to the ibis. Plutarch fays, in his Treatise De
IfiJe  Ofiride, that the manner in which the white was
          et
mixed with the black in the plumage of this bird, made                                   it
appear as                  crescent; and, indeed, the union
                   marked with
                  if                   a
of the black of the rump with that of the two tips of the
wings, which forms on the white      large semicircular ina
dentation, makes the white have        resemblance to that figure.
                                                 a
    It  more difficult to explain what he means when he fays
         is
that the feet of the ibis form with its bill an equilateral triangle.

walking in the courts of the temples : they are perfectly
similar to the bird which we have pointed out : we may in
particular observe in them the characteristic blackness of the
head and neck; and it may be readily feen, by comparing
their size with that of the personages irt the paintings, that
it  must have been             a   bird of about half        a  yard in height at
most,     and not a yard, like the tantalus ibis.
    The    mosaic      of Palestrine exhibits           also   in its middle part
several ibises perched on buildings, and which are in nothing
different from those of the paintings of Herculaneum. A sar
donyx in the cabinet of Dr. Mead, copied by Dr. Shaw *,
and representing an ibis, seems to be a miniature of the bird
which we are describing. A large bronze medal of Adrian,
 an engraving of which is given in the Musæum de Farnese,
 and    another of the same emperor os silver \, exhibit figure*
of   the ibis,    which, notwithstanding their small size, have a
 great resemblance to the bird in question.
     In regard to the figures sculptured on the                        plinth   of the
 statue    of the Nile        at the Belvedere, and            in  the copy of it in
 the garden          of   the     Thuilleries,     they    are not well        enough
 finished      to    serve as proofs       ; but we still         have   a   sufficient
 number to obviate every doubt.
     We must do Bruce the justice to                  say   that he discovered the
 real ibis     J.     His abou'batmes, compared with the bird we
 have     described,       is    so similar, that it is hardly possible not to
 consider      rt as   of  the fame species : and this traveller fays ex
 pressly, that it seemed to him to resemble those contained in
 the repositories of the mummies.                       He fays also, that thi9
 abou-bannes, or Father John, is very common on the banks
 of   the  Nile    ;  while the bird represented by Bufson under the
  name of the white Egyptian                   ibis, was never seen there by
  him.      This abou-bannes has been inserted by Latham, in his
  Index Ornitbologicus, under the name of Tantalus Æthio-
  picus ; but he does not speak of the conjecture of Bruce re
  specting its identity with the ibis.

     All         who preceded or followed Bruce, seem to
             travellers
have been in an error. Belon * gave the name of black Ibis
to a bird, which is nothing else than a black curlew with a
naked head, and the feet and bill red ; which does not agree
with the description of Herodotus, who fays that the black
ibis is black all over.
     This bird of Belon          is very common          in collections    ;   and yet
as naturalists sought also in the black ibis a tantalus with a
sharp bill, the modern naturalists have almost all said that
Belon alone had           seen   this bird.       Lacepede has rectified this
error, and given the name                 of black ibis   to the bird which
had  been distinguished  by that name by Belon.                            In   regard
to the white ibis, Belon believed it was the stork;                        in which
it is evident he contradicted every testimony : no one, there
fore, has coincided in opinion with him in this point except
the apothecaries,         who have taken the stork for their emblem,
because they have confounded it         with the ibis, to which they
ascribe the invention            of injections.     .
   Prosper Alpinus, who ascribes this invention to the ibis,
gives no description of the bird in his work on the Medical
Art of the Egyptians f. In his Natural History of Egypt                                  J
he speaks only from the information of Herodotus, to whose
account he only adds, I know not from what authority, that
this bird in its figure and size resembles the stork. He savs
he had learned that both the black and the white kinds were
found in abundance on the banks of the Nile ; but it is evi
                                           seen any of them.

or ox-bird, which Gmelin, very improperly, refers to (he
tantalus ibis, is of the size of the curlew, has a white body,
and the feet and bill red.       It frequents the meadows near
cattle ; its flesli       is not well tasted,           and soon spoils.        It may
be easily seen that this is not the tantalus,                   and   still    less    the
ibis, of       the antients.

     Hasselquist                neither with the white nor the
                         was acquainted
black ibis : his ardea ibis, is a small heron with a straight
bill. Linnæus, in his tenth edition, placed           very pro                          it,
perly, among the herons but he was wrong, as   ;       have                              I                 al
ready said,          in transporting                  it   as   a    synonym of the genus of
the tantalus.
   Maillet, in his Description of Egypt*, conjectures that
the ibis may have been      bird peculiar to Egypt, which
                                                  a                                                         is
called there Pharaoh's capon, and at Aleppo, sapbanbacha.
It devours serpents. Some of these birds are white, and some
black and white, and         follows, more than it   hundred                                 a

order that        it                    of the animals killed
                       may feed on the carcases
in the course of the journey, while   every other season none        in
of them are seen on that route.     But he does not consider
this conjecture as certain.   He even fays that we must give
over attempting to understand                               the antients when they speak
in   such    a   manner            as   they had wished not to be understood
                                        if                                                                  ;
and he concludes                   with observing that the antients perhaps
comprehended, indiscriminately, under the name of ibis, all
the birds which were serviceable to Egypt in freeing  from                                         it
those dangerous  reptiles which the climate produces     in
abundance, such as the vulture, falcon, stork, kite, &c.
   He was right in not considering his Pharaoh's capon as
the ibis for, though his description be very imperfect, and
             ;
though Buffon thought he could distinguish in   the ibis,                              it                   it
may  be readily seen, as well as    what Pococke  fays, that    by
this bird must be carnivorous                              ;    and, indeed, we find                  by   the
figure which Bruce         given          has               f,       that Pharaoh's               capon     is

words are sufficient to prove that he was no better acquainted
 with the ibis than others.                       <
     The error which prevails at present in regard to the white
 ibis, began with Perrault        j who is     even the first person who
described the tantalus ibis         of the   present time.    This error,
adopted by Briflbn and Buffon, has passed into the twelfth
edition of Linnæus, where it is confounded with that of
Hasselquist,      which had been inserted in the tenth, to form
with it a compound altogether monstrous. It was founded
on the very natural idea, that to devour serpents, a sharp bill,
more or less analogous to that of the stork or heron, was ne
cessary.      This idea is even the only good objection that can
be made against the identity of our bird and the ibis ; for it
may be said, How can a bird with a weak bill, such as the
curlew, be able to devour these dangerous serpents ?
    But, besides that a reason of this kind cannot hold out
against     positive    proofs, such as descriptions, figures, and
mummies; besides that the serpents from which the ibis
delivered Egypt were accounted exceedingly venomous, but
not     as  of a large size; I could answer directly, that the
mummified birds, which had a bill absolutely similar to that
of our bird, were real devourers of serpents; for I found in
one of their mummies             the undigested remains of the skin
and scales     of  serpents,   which I presented to the Class. This
destroys the objection that might be drawn from a passage of
Cicero, where he gives to the ibis a corneous and strong
bill  :  having never been in Egypt, he imagined, from simple
analogy, that this must be really the cafe.               Our European
curlew, which has a bill still weaker than the ibis, devours
eels,    as I have been assured by an eye-witness.
    I shall conclude this memoir with announcing the results.
The tantalus ibis of Linnæus must remain a separate genus
with the tantalus locmator. Their character will be rostrum
validum arcuatum,          apice emarginatum.
   The other tantalus of the            last editions ought to form a
genus      with   the  common      curlew.     We may give them the
name of numenius.            Their character will be, rostrum gracile,
arcuatum, apice inflatum.
   The ibis of the antients is not the ibis of Perrault              and
                                                                  Busson,

which is        an ardea ;      nor that of Maillet, which is a vulture ;
but a numenius or curlew, which has not yet been named by
systematic authors, and of which Bruce has given a figure
under the name of the abou-hannes. I call it numenius ibis,
albus, capite et collo nudis, remigibus fennis uropygii elongx-
tis, rojlro et pedibus nigris.
   The tantalus ibis of Linnæus, in the present state of his
synonymy,             comprehends       four species,     of     three     different
genera     :
           A tantalus, the ibis of Perrault and Buffon ;
           An ardca, the ibis of Hasselquist ;
           Two numenii, the ibis of Belon ;
           And the ox-bird of Shaw.
  The      reader may judge by this instance,              and many others,
of          in which the Syjlema Naturts still remains, and
     the state
of what importance., it would be to free it gradually from
those errors with which it abounds, and with which natu
ralists seem to load            it still more, by accumulating, without
choice and proper examination,               species, characters, and sy
nonyms.
IX. A          brief Examination of the received Doilrines refpecling
     Heat or Caloric.         By Alexander Tilloch. Read
  before the          AJkeJian   Society, December 1799        ¦*.
 J.  O detail the various theories maintained at different pe
riods, and applied to explain the phenomena to which heat
gives rife in the numerous changes presented by Nature in
chemical combinations               and decompositions, would be taking
up the time of this Society unnecessarily,                  as every       member
must be well acquainted with them. I shall                     therefore    confine
myself to           the modern doctrines         on this subject; and "even
with these I shall be brief, as my chief object     to inquire,      is,
Whether none of the circumstances that accompany the
known facts m this department, of physics (such of them,                           I

all of them had been attended to, and the legitimate inferences
been drawn from them, the theory now generally received
would ever have been admitted into science                                   ?
  The ground I am about to take may perhaps expose me to
Ihe danger of being considered as an innovator, or, what may
be deemed worse by some,                       a sceptic         as    to certain opinions,
rendered           respectable by the great names that have embraced
and maintained them       and at the fame time extremely plau
                                    ;
sible from the apparent   facility with which they are applied
to explain many phenomena that daily present themselves to
the eye of every attentive observer.    My only answer     that                                is,
I   am     in      search     of truth    ;    and    so   decided an enemy to mere
theoretical speculations, that neither admit myself, nor wish
                                               I
others to admit in physics what cannot be proved to be truth.
When the human mind       acquiesces on any ground short of
this,     either
         it   is through misconception, indolence, or pusil
lanimity, than which nothing has tended more to retard
science and shackle men with prejudices, leading them to
receive        great    names           for argument,            and, for demonstration,
long quotations.   But,                   to proceed,       I         use    the       term    beat to
denote that substance which                        possesses those      properties,   go        is
 verned        by   those laws, and produces                     those effects which (hall
 be immediately   enumerated; and     prefer   to the term I                      it
 caloric * for no other reason but because the latter  em                                      is
 ployed        by   many to denote heat existing in                          a    certain state, in
 which, they           fay,   it   may be considered                  as having actually lost
 its original character whereas    :hold, and   even hope to
                                                    I                         I
 convince the members of this Society, that     invariably re                     it
 tains the fame character, properties, and mode of action.
    *;
         The    term caloric has been adopted              in   the new nomenclature            to avoid
 that ambiguity and misconception                which might,           it   is   said, arise from cm-
 ploying the        same term to express       a   substance,      and the sensation           produced
 by the action of that substance'                  By the       same mode         of reasoning, all the
 substantives       mould     be changed        in any language             that has similar •verbs.
 But     suppose    the argument for change,           in   the present instance, to have             full
 force in some languages,           it   has   little or none in regard to the Englifl:,
 which employs the word tuarmth to express the                              sensation    occasidned       by
 beat.   I     shall, however, use the terms heat and caloric indifferently.
                                                                                              (A) Heat

     ft                  Examination of the received Doctrines
       (A) Heat is diffused through all the bodies in nature,'
     whether solids, liquids, or aeriform fluids.
       (B) Heat tends to an equilibrium ; so that, when by any
     means it is accumulated in particular substances, a portion is
     quickly given off to the surrounding bodies to bring the whole
     to one common temperature.        On the other hand, where
     bodies have been deprived              of   a portion      of   it,   heat   is   given off
     to them by, or heat           passes to them from,                    the    surrounding
     bodies,    to restore the equilibrium.
        (C) Solids,        by   the addition       of   heat,     assume the form               of
     liquids,   and liquids the aeriform state. On the other hand,
     gases,  by  an abstraction of heat, become liquids and liquids,         ;
     solids.
        (D) The dimensions of               bodies      are enlarged when heat                  is
    poured into them, and vice versa.
       The laws we have enumerated are general, and the objec
    tions that may be stated against the truth of any of them                                   so
    few, and so easily obviated, that they cannot affect any in
    ference  drawn from them. The apparent exceptions relate
    chiefly to the change of volume in some particular substances
    when pasting from the liquid to the solid form, or the con
'
    trary.               instance, in passing into the state of ice,
                Water, for
    assumes    larger
                a     volume,   though heat     then pasting out of
                                                             is
    it. The substance, however,         only apparently enlarged.
                                                  is
    In freezing, the water assumes crystalline form the crys
                                                  a                              ;
    tals, mooting in every direction, crowd against, and, as                                 it
    were, jostle each other, causing vacuities, which constitute
    no real part of the matter. We may compare this pheno
    menon to what takes place in        bundle of chips of wood,
                                                   a
    which will always, however closely packed, occupy an ap
    parently larger space than the same weight of ligneous matter
    as arranged      by
                    nature in the tree.  Another apparent excep
tion may be noticed in clay, which diminishes the more in
bulk the greater the quantity of heat poured into       but here             it   :
there     misnomer —
          is   a           not clay, but a mixture

    volume must follow.            Clay     is   therefore      not an exception to
                                                                                          the

                                  it              law;
   We shall first attend   little to the operation of the fore
                                       a
going laws ill some given cafes; and afterwards examine
the doctrines which have been established from the pheno
mena observed to accompany them                         :
   If two bodies of the fame nature, unequally heated, be
brought into contact, the heat will diffuse itself equally
through        them, and the               quantities in each will bear                         the
fame proportion to each other as the masses themselves                                   ;     but,
if   the bodies        differ    in   kind,       though equilibrium take place,
and each indicate the fame temperature,                             yet the proportions
of heat in        each will not be as the maffc9,                       but vary according
as    the bodies differ.
     (E) This          property    of   bodies to hold different               quantities of
heat,       even   when that fluid            is   in   a   state   of equilibrium, Dr.
Black calls the capacity                of a body fur heat          ;    the quantity itself
he calls specific beat.  The distinction       perfectly philoso   is
phical, nor need the terms be objected to; but they should be
accurately defined, that they may never be employed to convey
ideas different from the facts that gave rile to their adoption.
   That the fense in which we understand and use the terms
may be clearly conceived, we stiall substitute another sub
stance for heat, all other circumstances being as before. If
two substances of the fame kind (two pieces of chalk), un
equally wetted with water, be brought into contact, the one
will give off water to the other (or the one will absorb water
from the other) till the quantity                       in
                                     each be as their masses.
Jf two bodies different in kind (chalk and wood) be thrown
into water, the quantity they will each take in will be as
tbar capacities  this will also be the cafe
                         :                       instead of                    if,'
throwing them into water, we suspend both in the same
damp atmosphere; and the quantity in each, whether re
ceived    immersion in water or in the atmosphere,
             by                                        spe                                is
cific. The  latter term must be  thus considered, otherwise
ue    stiall lead ourselves             into error      ;   for there          is     at, least as
great   a    difference         between      the extremes           of the general tem
perature       in summer           and       in    winter     as    there      is
                                                                              between a'
moist, and        comparatively dry (but yet moist) atmosphere.

74-                     Examination os the received Doclrines
   Some philosophers tell us that the cause of this pheno
menon of different bodies requiring different quantities of ca
loric to indicate the fame temperature (or, in other words,
the cause          of their having             for heat) arises
                                                      different    capacities
from the different degrees of affinity which different bodies
possess for heat ! Is this an explanation ? — Different bodies
bold different quantities of heat, because they have different
capacities .-—Different bodies hold different quantities of heat,
because
                                        —
                            affinities I yet we are to consider
               they have different
the one term as expressive of a property, and the other as
expressive of the cause of that property !   Is- this consistent
with that accuracy and precision which should prevail in
the       language            os science          ?
     But this is not all.                    Heat is considered as existing in two
distinct       states ;        free,       and in chemical union.      When heat
is in equilibrio in any place ; in other words, when a body
is in equilibrio with the bodies which surround it with re
spect to its heat [that                     is,
                           has received heat from the common
stock proportioned to its capacity]                               ;    that quantity which             it
contains           is   termed         latent beat or caloric              ; combined caloric           ;
beat in chemical                    union.            We    are    told    that   in this      state
                                       by                                                              j it

that   does not affect the thermometer, but remains qui

and that      then,
               it   more
                    is   or less, in   state of confinement.       a
     Is   the heat in any body termed                              latent because            the   body
has not    capacity
               a                     to     receive        more?
                                                         any              No;     for   if,    by
means, an addition be made to the common stock of       pre                                    a
scribed system of bodies, each individual substance will still
provide lodging for       sliare of the added quantity, propor
                                       a
tioned, to its capacity, in relation to the capacity of the rest.
It  tliould be observed too, that, let the common temperature
be what        may,it   heat be     if  equilibrio, the portion in
                                                            in

                               least, held to be latent, in contra
distinction to what they term free beat.      Hence     follows,                         it
that the quantity of latent heat         given body   differs  in
                                                              in   a
different seasons of the year; for heat may be        equilibrio                        in
in  any system  of bodies in summer as well  as in winter.    An
assemblage of different bodies, in equilibrio as to caloric, in
                                                                                             Jamaica,

Jamaica,    the quantity in the whole is latent, and in each
specific and latent: the fame holds with regard to a system
 of substances in England in the month of January. The
 heat in both cafes is latent.  If the one system of bodies
could be transported to the other in a moment, and placed
in contact with       portion of that heat which was latent
                          it,   a
\a  Jamaica, would be counted sensible heat in London                                                  !
This      exactly where the doctrine lands us when viewed gene
         is

modes of        existence   !        But   let us take            a   closer view   of      it

the compound substance before us ; or in the sum of thfc
masses of two or more substances over that of the compound
from which they were separated ?
  Again — When      gases pass into the form of liquids, or li
quids  into the solid  state, heat is found to pass from them
into the atmosphere,     " the heat that was latent in them
before now becomes sensible."        Was it not cognisable be
fore ?   It ought not to have been so -when latent. I find,
however, that the volume of the body from which it has
been separated is now lejs than before; and this is exactly
what ought to take place from the general laws, not only of
heat but of matter — a substance, heat, has been separated from
a body in which it formed a part of the mass or volume,
and the remaining mass is diminished in bulk.
   Let    us, however, alter the mode                         of   expression.          A     body,
no matter          by what               means, is reduced                 into    a     less   vo
lume; it         is so constituted                as    to admit of this
                                                          being                    effect
ipassed    upon it; for                one   of
                                              heat, is
                                                  its ingredients,
                                                       a subtile
 fluid which may be dislodged ; nay, will even run out, when
 the capacity of the body which held it is lessened. It is
410 -way strange, in this cafe, that a fluid poured out of its
recipient, and which, by its tendency to equilibrium, must
diffuse itself through the surrounding bodies in proportion to
their capacities to receive                       it,
                              should make itself manifest to
our sense of feeling, we being, immersed at the moment in
 one of the neighbouring substances, the atmosphere, which
 affords   alodging for     portion of the dislodged heat, and
                                        a
 serves to transport other portions of    to all the neighbouring

                             is   it   substance which, while

 from the   preceding statement that this is a mistake ? Be
 fore the heat passed out of its then combination it made a
 part of the volume which we contemplated      with our eyes,
 and the proportion                   that this part bore to the whole might,
 in many cafes,                be determined by actual      measurement.   la-
 sensible heat, or rather heat in 'such combinations as it is                                    in
 when that term is used, cognisable by any other means ?.
    To me it would appear as correct, when, by any power,
 the capacity of a-vessel filled with a liquid (water) is dimi
 nished,          to say that the portion                of liquid        thereby ejected            is
 set   at liberty ;        meaning thereby that it has undergone an
 essential         change as to its form, properties, or mode of ex
 istence ;        as to fay, when the volume of a substance contain
 ing       heat     is abridged, and a proportionate quantity                             of    the
 heat is dislodged,             that the heat, so dislodged,                 has undergone
any such change.
  The fact in my opinion                          is,    the substance          in   which      the
caloric resided has undergone                           the    change, where there                is
          not the heat  or,                       if    it    be changed,       the change     is a
change       ;                             :
of that kind which passes upon                           a    brick or any other body
when we move              it   from one room to another.                     This,    I   think,
must be pretty clear from what we have already stated    but                              ;

 H   ray   of white light,            angular surfaces, such
                              passing between
as the almost meeting edges of two knives, was liable to be
parted by its bendings, separations, and other changes, into
those differently coloured rays, which had been supposed by
Newton to be the primogenial elements of pure white light.
 This      observation   is here applied to explain the formation         of
                                of many-coloured circles, which
those' irides or corona, conjijling
ire seen contiguous to the bodies of the fun, moon, &c.
   The order of the colours in these coronae is as follows :
I. Next to the body of the luminary a circle of grayish
black, grayish blue, or faint diluted' white, altering as it
recedes into — 2.Astronglucid white of considerable breadth.
3. Slender rings of yellow and red. 4. A succession of rings
of violet, blue,! green, yellow, red.' 5. Green, diluted yel
low, red ; diluted green, diluted red.   This is the common
order ; but it is occasionally varied by flight irregularities.
   Newton has made the only plausible attempt to account
for these appearances.      He supposes them to be produced
by the rays of light falling upon globules of water, hail, or
ice.   He assumes that globules of ice or hail may, or ac
tually do, exist in situations in the atmosphere in which they
can     receive   the rays,     so as    to produce   that analysis   of the
white light,       and that distribution  of the coloured        rays which
these coronae exhibit.           He conjectures that these        coronre in
the atmosphere,  surrounding the sun or moon, may be
produced in  the same  manner in which a miniature ap
pearance somewhat            similar is occasioned    by the reflexion    of
light from      a lens quicksilvered      on the back-side.
     But    we do not know particles   of hail or ice always to exist
in the atmosphere        when these many-coloured irides or co-
•ronæ appear.       . The ordinary refraction of direct light, in its
passage  through globules of liquid water, could not produce
these appearances.      Newton's theory, though all that he
postulates were granted, would not explain that particular
distribution of these colours in the coronæ,by which intervals
or vacant spaces are left between the different portions of the
red and of the other colours.    The iris, from a globule of

     In the work now before           us,  Dr. Saunders applies, with
  considerable skill, the information of chemical analysis to
 assist in explaining the proper remedial uses of the waters of
 the most celebrated mineral springs in Britain and on th.e
 Continent.
     His work begins with an account of the physical qualities
 and the chemical composition of water, and of its natural
 uses in the animal economy.            He then examines, what ex
 traneous substances are liable to exist in solution in water,
 and by what chemical tests         or re-agents the presence of any
 of them may       be ascertained.        A judicious chapter follows
 next, concerning the natuie, as more or less salutary, of the
 waters in common use.
    After this preliminary matter he descends into a particular
 account of the chemical          analysis    and   the   medical  uses of
 three-and-twenty       different    species of mineralised waters.
These are, the waters of Malvern, Holywell, Bristol Hotwell,
 Matlock, Buxton, Bath,          the Sea,     Sedlitz,   Epsom, Seltzer,
Tunbridge,       Spaj    Pyrmont,        Cheltenham,       Scarborough,
 Vichy, Carlsbad,        Hartfell,     Harrogate,       Moffat,   Aix-la-
 Chapelle, Borset, Barege.           A synoptical table, exhibiting,
 in one view, the chemical compositions of all these different
waters, is subjoined at the close of the chapter.
    The medical uses of water,           are,  next, more particularly
 considered.    Water in general,         as he here states, is useful,
in proper quantity, to dilute and         suspend the solids which are
taken into the stomach, sometimes              to stimulate   languid di
gestion   ; sometimes,     perhaps, to retard that which might be
otherwise too rapid.        In acute diseases, its internal use as a
diluent is highly beneficial.         Tepid water, taken in moderate
doses, acts, generally,      as an agreeable stimulant to the sto
mach.       A draught of water,      at the greatest warmth at     which
it can be drunk, will commonly give sudden relief from heart
burn.      To sedentary peisons, in acute fevers, for topical in
flammations,     cold water and the cold bath may be very use
fully employed, and in ice for burns. The warm, or tepid bath,
is adapted to prove serviceable in, perhaps, a still greater variety
of  instances.    Artificial chemical     waters are not without their
use.

and dependencies of their various                                  species on the            rest   of   na
ture, and on one another                    ?
     We       owe to two illustrious
                               foreign naturalists,  De Buffon
and Linnæus, those systems of natural history         which the                         by
knowledge   of  this science has  been,  in  the  course of the
present century, the most successfully diffused.     De Buffon,
writing  in    popular language,
                    a              and  with  great splendour of
style,    has become the natural historian                               of   the people        :     Lin
næus, seeking his chief merit in the excellencies of scientific
enumeration and arrangement, has become the guide of phi
losophers.              Buffon     is     quoted as good authority                   :   Linnæus           is
followed, with implicit reverence, as    master.  The school         a

natural history, as is that of Sir Tsaac Newton in natural phi
losophy, or that of Lavoisier in chemistry.
     In this volume Dr. Shaw gives the first part of a general
system of zoology, in which the arrangement of Linnæus is
to be chiefly followed.           Quadrupeds, birds, amphibia, fishes,
infects, vcrmes, testaceous animals, zoophvtes, are to be
comprehended in the system.                 It is to be completed in ten         -
or twelve volumes.            The present volume comprehends the
history    of    the primates, bruta, and feræ, the three first orders
in the class of mainmalia or viviparous quadrupeds.                        The
peculiar advantages of this system are, as the author hopes,
to arise from the combination of the arrangement of Lin
næus with the materials contained in the works of Buffon
and Pennant;          from the correction of errors relative to syno
 nyms ;     the institution      of new species ; the addition of more
 clearly distinctive specific characters; from the communica
 tion of those new facts in natural history which have been
learned       in late voyages to the South Sea, and particularly
 by observations        made in the great ifland of Australasia, or
 New Holland.            The descriptions are illustrated, as the title-
                                                                                   '
 page expresses,        with   engravings of the forms of many of the
 animals described.           These engravings are copied from the
 works of Buffon and other naturalists, from various original
 drawings, and from specimens in the Leverian and the
 British musæum.           The   history   of thirty-eight different    genera
 of   quadrupeds       is contained in the first volume.              The~cn-
 gravings arc, in general, well executed by Heath and other
 artists.
     It is extremely probable that the whole work, if conducted
to an end with the fame care and skill which appear in the
 first volume,       will present    a fuller and more correct system
than has been         as yet   published of our knowledge in zoology.
Its chief      merits are,    great   clearness   and accuracy     of  descrip
tion, fidelity of representation in the engravings, ease and
perspicuity of style, just discrimination as to distinctive cha
 racters, and the increase which it affords of the number of
known animals.             Its chief imperfeBions      are,  that the author
appears    to    have  studied  more in cabinets      of curiosities,  than by
conversing     '
                  with living nature     ;  that he assumes for hisautho-

narratives of original observations from which those writers
compiled; that, while intent chiefly upon accurate descrip
tion, he has told little, except in a few popular instances,
of  the manners, habits, and local relations   of the quadrupeds
which he describes.

     ELECTORAL        ACADEMY OF THE USEFUL SCIENCES
                           AT ERFURT.
   In the sitting of February the 4th, Dr. G. H. Thilow
 communicated to the Academy an account of some experi
ments he had made in regard to Galvanism. These experi
ments were a continuation of his former ones", and tend
still further to confirm            the idea       that saltpetre         possesses   the
peculiar property of weakening the nervous system.  This
he ascertained by several experiments.  Having  cut off a
portion of the crural nerve, which had been laid bare, and
weakened or deprived of its irritability by saltpetre, he laid
bare another portion towards the knee, and, by strewing
nitre over     it,
              deprived    in few minutes of all susceptibility
                               it     a
of irritation.       The      always took place as far as
                           same thing

The author thence concludes that the vital power    not to                  is
tally extinguished even when                it   cannot be excited               by the
strongest stimulants applied to             a   nerve which has been several
times subjected      to the action         of
                                        stimulant.

of frog laid bare, and still in connection with the surround

vivacity, being strewed over with  little saltpetre, its move

the animal still moved              with    such     strength,     that the whole
upper part of the body was thereby agitated from one side to
the other.   Some drops of warm milk, let fall between some
of the muscles and nerves, speedily put an end to this violent
movement.     These striking phenomena the author endea
voured to explain from the circumstances of milk removing
ohftinate spasmodic affections, and restoring the equilibrium
of   the muscular and nervous              fibres.        He    had observed also,

frequently suffered from violent              flatulencies.      He always
found that their complaints were increased by bitters or car
minatives in general, but that they were lessened by the use
of lukewarm milk.
     The same author read some observations on the use of the
German opium.               As foreign opium is brought to Europe in
an impure and imperfect state, it is of importance to dis
cover      some     substance    that might be substituted in its stead.
Profeflor       Trommsdorff found such a substitute in poppy-
heads, from which            he has prepared      a  tincture.   Dr. Thilow
having        made     some    experiments with this tincture in the
Clinical Institute of Erfurt, observed that it fully answered
expectation in casts of flux, spasms in the stomach, gout, and
hysterics*.

     C. Olivier lately read before this society some observations
on the jerboa.
     His object was to rectify an error into which the antients
 and moderns have fallen,             in regard to the manner        in which
 the jerboa walks          ;  and to    make    known      the  very   singular

 tioned by Linnæus, under the name of mus lougipes, im
 properly confounded with the mus meridianus of Pallas.
     The jerboa        is  represented    in an erect posture, on the      Cy-

say, an animal which walks on its hind                legs alone.     Olivier
has rectified      this error by his own observation, which, on
 this point, perfectly agrees with the structure of the body of
the animal, as it does not allow it to remain long upright on
 its tarsi.
    The      penis  of this quadruped,       as  observed    by Sonhini *,
 is furnished with two long osseous hooks near each other,
and placed towards the middle of the upper part of the glans.
The    latter is guarded belides with p.ipillte, almost of an ofleous
nature, bent back and sliaped like a spoon. Fn the alactaga, the
mus jaculans of Pallas, the glans is merely covered with pa
pilla, in the form of spikes, almost straight, rounded and
directed      backwards.      The telHcles are concealed in the ab
domen      ;   and  the orifice   of the vulva in the female appears
to be confounded with that of the anus.
    The description which Olivier gives of a small species
found by him in Egypt, and which, in size, is nearly equal
to that of a rat, is perfectly applicable to the mus longipes
of Linnæus; except that the latter, according to Linnæus,
has only four toes on the fore feet, while that of Olivier
has five;       but it may be possible, says Olivier, that Linnæus
did not pay attention to the thumb, which is indeed very
short.
    As   there is great      confusion in the synonymy of authors,
Olivier endeavours,         at the end of his memoir, lo rectify their
mistakes.        At    the fame time he gives         the   specific charac
ters   of  the species,      which,    in his opinion,      belong to that
genus.

 plete or incomplete.           Tourncfort        has given a section    of them
 in his family of the papilionacei. Linnæus has established
 them into three genera : the bitfemLi, characterised by its
 indented feed      ;   the pbaca, the feed           of which ought        to  be
 femi-bilocular       ;   and  the astragalus, where the feed is             bilo-
 cular  ;   but these two last genera are             not sufficiently distinct;
 for that reason Lamark united them.                        Decandolle has re
 tained    that arrangement, but he has changed the charac
 ters and rendered them more dittinct.
    The   genus    of    the pbaca has for its character a carina, fur
 nished with a long straight point ; a feed with two longitu
 dinal cells, sometimes complete, but for the most part in
 complete, formed by the folding back of the upper suture.
 This   genus     comprehends twenty species, viz. pbaca febirica;
 Linn.;      pb.myriopbylla,           muricata,Jylvatica, oxypbylla, pro-
strata.   Fall     ;   astragalu      verticcllaris,   alpinus montanus, cam-

 Pa  l l. ; astr. annuiaris,       I'o r s k .; and  seven  undescribed   species.
 The   pbaca alpina, australis batica and rigida, are referred
 to the colutca.          The genus astragalus is distinguished from
 the preceding by its obtuse carina, and its feed with two lon
 gitudinal cells, sometimes complete, or for the most part in
 complete, formed by the repli of the lower future. It compre
 hends 125 species, 36 of which are nondescript.                        This vast
 genus had been divided into three sections, according as the
 stalk was herbaceous, ligneous, or null ; but these divisions
 are not correct.          Decandolle has divided the genus into two
 sections,    according as the (lipulæ are distinct from the pe
 tiole, or adherent to it.             The first section comprehends the
 species    with   yellow     or    purpurine flowers. The second is di
 vided into three subdivisions ; the first has the stipulae ad
 herent to the petiole and the stalk, and the petiole herba
ceous and not spinous;                   the second has the petiole not
spinous and         cadityue     ;   the   third     has  the   petiole   spinous
perjistant,    and      the   folioles caducous.           These are     the   tra-
gacantha of which the old botanists made a genus; but
the fructification presents no character, and exhibits the
fame variations as those of the other astraguli.

genera in different families,               have      the vcrsicular             pericarpium
filled with air.             Decandolle        has observed,          that      if this air be
analysed at .the moment when                      it is collected            from the pe
ricarpium, it is found to be of the fame purity as atmospheric
air; but if this pericarpium   be immersed in water, the air
loses its purity, and in the course                   of about         a   day no oxygen
gas is found in it.              The     fame     thing     takes place in the fun
as well as in obscurity.                 The     total quantity            of    the air dees
not appear to the eye to be diminished.  Is the oxvgen gas
converted into carbonic acid gas ? or, rather, docs it not
serve for the nutrition             of   the     feed.     What        tends to support
this idea        is,   that Humboldt        found that the tunics of the feeds
contain azot almost in               a   state   of purity.       This fact coincides
with an observation                which Decandolle             made before on                   the
vesicles       of    the   fucus   vestculofus    ;   he observed               that these ve
sicles           atmospheric air when they had remained
              contained
some hours out of water, and azotic gas when they had been
some time immersed in it.   These facts deserve the attention
of physiologists.

is   a   tragacantba not yet described.
   The anti-syphilitic properties of the astragalus ex/campus
have of late been much extolled, and still require confirma
tion.  The rarity of this plant prevents      from beintj sub     it
jected to experiments. Decandolle recommends making them
on the astragalus inraiius, and nwn'ifpejj'ulanus, which grow
in France, and which seems to be analogous to the former.

     The    existence    of ornitholites in    strata   of submarine forma
tion, is still contested         by several   naturalists. The celebrated
Fortis has even published a memoir in which he proves that
no well ascertained instances of this circumstance had ever
been      known.        Mention      had   indeed    been   made    in several
works of those found at Montmartu                    ;  but some doubts still
remained.
      C. Cuvier,      however, has lately presented to the Institute
a fossil    which seems to have all the characters of an orni-
tholite.       It  is a leg composed         of a portion of the femur,
a    tibia, and a tarsus,       in one piece ; three toes, one of which
has three, the second four, and the other five articulations,
and the vestige         of  a spur.    These members are not found but
in     the class   of birds alone.
      This   leg was       incrusted in that kind of gypsum which in
 large strata occupy such an immense space around Paris.                     It
 was found at Ville-Juif, in the third mass, that is to fay,
 about sixteen yards lower than the strata which                   contain the
 bones     of quadrupeds       already described       by the same author.
      C. Vidron, music           master   at Paris,     having announced" a
 discovery      he had made,        by means    of which     persons born deaf
  could be enabled to hear music.               Hauy, Lacepedc, and Cu
  vier, were appointed to examine this discovery, and to make
  a report on the subject to the Institute.              It appears from this
  report that the apparatus           employed by C. Vidron consists of
  a steel rod, one end of which he places on the lid of a harp
  sichord, and the other between the teeth of the deaf person.
  This     rod   is furnished also       with a branch terminated by a
  knob, which         rests  in the pit of the stomach, and sometimes
  also with a second, applied to the cranium*                    The commis
   sioners mentioned that several authors have announced that
  certain deaf persons had been made to hear musical sounds
   by establishing a communication between their teeth and the
  instrument by means of a rod, goblet, or other body. Of
   these authors they mentioned Fabricius ab Aquapendente,
   Schellhammer, Boerhaave^ Winkler, and Jorissen.
        They endeavoured, in particular, to determine how far this

  which   one may wish to communicate.          They gave themselves
  an artificial kind of deafness by flopping their ears, and re
  moving to a great distance.      In both these cases, founds were
  perfectly heard by the steel rod, and the sounds appeared to
  them to come from the inside of the rod, and not from their
 ¦real place.   But the results were different with respect to some
  persons actually deaf,   on whom the experiments were tried.
 Some of them heard very distinctly; but the greater number
  declared that they experienced only a tremulous movement,
 .more or less general.
     The  commissioners   conclude that this method may be em
 ployed with success in cafes of deafness which arise only from
 some obstructions in the external part of the auditory passage,
 but that it is useless in those occasioned by a paralysis of the
 nerve,   or any eflential derangement in the interior organs,
 which, unfortunately, is most commonly the cafe, especially
 in those born. deaf. They are, however, of opinion, that it
 ought to be tried on young persons who are deaf; for, even
if there   were found only one in a hundred capable of deriving
benefit from this resource, it would at any rate be one source
more of enjoyment to such an individual.
    In regard to articulate sounds or words, the commissioners
found that it is hardly possible to hope that they can be con
veyed with accuracy by this apparatus, at least in its present
state.
    In  the sitting of August   23, General Dugua,      who had re
turned from Egypt, having brought with him two copies of
a  remarkable inscription found on a black granite of an ex
ceedingly fine grain, presented them to the Institute.
    This monument was discovered in digging up the earth at
Fort Elleve,    near the Bogar   of Rosetta,   two leagues from that
town.
    It was not brought to Cairo      till after Buonaparte's depar
ture, and was deposited      in the Institute of that city. The
discovery was made by C. Bouchard, lieutenant of engineers,
who was appointed to superintend the repairs of the fort.
   Two members of the commission of the arts were employed
at Cairo in taking copies of this monument, unique of its
kind, in order that it might be preserved whatever might

printing-office             in Eygpt, who possefies extensive knowledge
and       an indefatigable zeal for acquiring more.
                                               By a simple
typographic process he obtained copies with the characters
inverted, but which could be easily read by means of a
mirror.           The             C. Conte, chief of the brigade of
                         second was
aerostats,          who, by his knowledge of mechanics and the
arts, had          always been one of the most useful men in the
colony.
      He employed            the procefll-s           of engraving          to obtain copies,
which at first gave the characters inverted ; but these copies
being put under the press, gave others similar to the inscrip
tions.
  The inscription is in three different characters ; one portion
presents a series of hieroglyphics, in several lines exceedingly
regular; another which has not vet been sufficiently ex
amined, exhibits a great number of lines in characters which
still leave some uncertainty, and which require a more pro
found research.    The last portion is composed of fifty three
lines, written in Greek.                    Laport-Dutheil             one       of   the   mem

began to transcribe this part;                             and communicated to the

the substance of nearly the whole of   having transcribed the it,

Bonaparte       has ordered engravings            to be made       of them, in

   Faujas St. Fond has lately brought to Paris some curious
fossils,   having on them the impression of plants ; which he
found under lava at the depth of twelve hundred feet. Jussieu,
Des fontains, and Lamark, have observed that several of these
impressions      belong to plants common in Europe at present;
such as leaves     of the chesnut tree, of the birch, mountain-ash,
the maple, an entire cone of the pinusjylvejlris, and a portion
of a cone of the pinus sat'iva. Fabricius and Latreille dis

common        hydropbylus        or water-beetle.          Faujas       St.   Fond

   JL HERE         are many things in nature           of which      we know
 nothing more than that they exist : respecting the manner in.
 which they exist, and for what purpose, we are entirely ig
 norant.      They    are often the objects       of our wonder and ad
 miration; but, owing to the imperfection of our faculties,
 we can acquire no satisfactory knowledge of tlvir nature.
 The only course, therefore, which, as rational beings, we can
 pursue in such cafes, is to endeavour,              by the help of con
jectures,    to open a way to truth ; and, when this cannot be
 Accompli (bed,     to endeavour      to approach as near to it as pos
 sible.    This,  indued,    mav often be effected with some degree
 of  success, by admitting certain hypotheses,              or fundamental
 principles deduced from analogy, especially when our re
searches     are conducted with accuracy and perseverance.                   It
niaybe      proved    by  innumerable       instances,     taken    from the
history of     the   sciences,   that hypothetical and conjectural
explanations have often conducted mankind to the discovery
of immutable laws, and truths of the greatest importance.

the employment of philosophers ; and yet there are niany
of them respecting which our knowledge is very uncertain.
But how is it possible for such short-sighted beings as men
are, to have at command,         and employ in a proper manner,
all those external   circumstances which          are necessary for the
thorough    examination      of   such    phænomena ? A thousand
things occur daily in nature which it is impossible for our
coarse organs to perceive, and much more to observe in a
perfect manner : in this paper, however, I shall not descend
to microscopic objects, but offer a few remarks respecting a
phænomenon which frequently occurs, and which has at
tracted  the notice   of many      celebrated    philosophers — I mean
the luminous      appearance of the sea.            This phænomenon,
which exhibits so magnificent a spectacle to navigators, and
which, when beheld for the first time, must excite astonish
ment, deserves certainly to be examined with more care and
attention.     I shall here, therefore, take a short view of the
infcfrmation which has been collected on this curious subject.
    That the water of the sea sometimes exhibits a luminous
¦appearance   in the night-time, especially when struck by the
rudder of a ship, or strongly agitated by its resistance to the
motion of the vessel, is a circumstance well known; and
this phænomenon appears sometimes, in calm weather, like
multitudes of small stars dispersed over the surface of the sear
It  frequently happens, also, that the places onlv next the (hip
or the sliip's wake, or the track through which tisli have
passed, appears luminous.          The well-known Americus Vef-
pusius,   the Italian navigator, according to Kircher, was the
first person who observed this circumstance.
    In Lichtenberg's      Magazine       fdr the latest Discoveries in
 Physics and    Natural    History*,      we   find the following de
scription of this phænomenon as             observed in the Baltic: —
<U+2666>'The phosphoric phænomena in the Baltic generally appear
in the darkest nights, with an undulating motion, in the track
formed by vessels in their progress through the waves.              The
 water seems lo emit a lively light, which is sometimes of a
 pale red colour, and has the resemblance of sparks.             Some
 times it exhibits the appearance of a regular stream of sire in

the .ship's wake.                       This phænomenon                           is seen sometimes           also
    when the wind blows,                             but not with that majestic     appear
    ance as during; a calm.                            It is worthy of remark, that, when
    vessels      lying at anchor, this phænomenon is observed
                are
    here        there, darting itself from one place to another
              and
    with great vivacity, behind the vessels, even when they make
    little or no motion."    This description agrees in the most
    essential       parts          with that of Gentil, who observed the same
    phænomenon in the Indian                   seas, particularly in the channel
    of Mozambique.                        On       one occasion                 the    sea     appeared to this
    navigator and   his whole crew to be entirely covered with
    fire, and each wave to consist of a mass of phosphoric matter.
    The ship seemed as if moving up and down in a fiery lake,
    Some of the ropes reflected the light so strongly, that the people
    on board could have read by it. The fire of Saint Elmo ap
    peared also at the fame time on the summit of the mainmast *.
       Boyle        f
               sought for the cause of this phænomenon in cer
    tain general laws of the earth, or of our planetary system ;
    but, had this celebrated philosopher considered the subject
    with a little more attention, he would have found that it
    may be explained on much better principles.
      Father BourzcsJ, during his voyage to India in the year
    1704, had several times an opportunity of observing the lu
    minous appearance of the sea, and has given us a very valu
    able account                  of    the    phænomenon.                        The light        was often so
    strong that he could read by it the title                                         of   a   book, though he
    stood at the              height of nine or                           ten     feet above the surface          of
.   the water.                Sometimes                  he        could distinguish

parts from those that were       not   so  in the    ship's wake.     The
former exhibited in part luminous points and in part small
luminous globules, some of which were from one to two
lines in diameter, and others as large as a man's head.
Sometimes they formed streaks from three to sour lines in
lenrth,   and one or two lines in breadth : sometimes they re
sembled luminous vortices,         which, according       to the author'!
expression,   appeared and disappeared         suddenly    at certain pe
riods, like flashes of lightning.
   Father Bourzes       observed    also,   that the     passage   of  fish
through    the water     was marked by a stream          of light, so that
it was  often possible    to distinguish their shape and size.         He
remarked also     a  number of luminous particles in the water
drawn up from the sea, when he stirred it round with his
hand in a dark place. These luminous particles he observed
also on a piece of linen which he had dipped in sea-water,
when it was wrung in the dark, and even when it was half
dry.
   This attentive observer considers the principal cause of
these phænomena to be a kind            of   greasy viscous     matter in
the water of the      sea, which arises perhaps from putrefac
tion, because he thought that the water, the fatter it seemed,
and the more covered with scum, always emitted the more
light.   In confirmation of this opinion         he states, that having
caught a bonetta, its mouth appeared so luminous in the in
side that he could fee to read a book by it.               On examina
tion, the mouth of the fitli was found to be full of a viscous
matter, which being' rubbed over a piece of wood, the latter
became also luminous         in the dark,      but the light it emitted
ceased as soon as the matter became dry.
   The experiments of Canton,           mentioned in the Philoso
phical Transactions*,       seem   to  coincide perfectly with the
above description of father Bourzes.              I (hall therefore give
a short account of them, as they are the most accurate we
have on the subject.       On   the   evening of the 14th of June
1768, Mr. Canton        put some fresh whitings          into sea-water,
and found that they emitted light for twenty-four hours.                In

them, Fahrenheit's     thermometer stood at 540. The water
itself, when at rest, was quite dark; but, when a stick wa»
drawn through         the whole part through which the stick
                               it,
had        passed     became          luminous,           and     no light appeared                any
where else.               When        he agitated           the whole water,            it    became
luminous throughout.   When the fish had lain in the water
forty-eight hours,   was then brightest: at the end of three
                                 it
days, though ever      much agitated, so  emitted no more             it
light.
      The      sea   water, however, exhibited                   a  much more luminoim
appearance            when      a         herring     was      placed in it. The third
night       it was so strong, that, when stirred,  person could tell      a
 by
 it         the hour on a watch      and at those moments the fish
                                                  ;
seemed to be an opake           body. After this period the light
decreased            more and more, but   still continued, in some
                                                          it

                      vessel                           fresh                                  a
herring was put in the like manner, continued entirely dark,
without emitting the least trace of light.  The thermometer
during the time stood always above 6o°.
  River water, in which salt was dissolved till                                it   appeared by
a   hydrometer that                  it    had acquired the gravity                of   sea   water,
exhibited            the same phænomena as water brought from the
sea  in water to which more salt was added, the silh emitted

    It     appears from these experiments and those                                 of Sir John
Pringle   that the salt in sea water promotes putrefaction;
               *
and that therefore the luminous appearance of sea water arises
from     disposition to putrefaction, or
           a                                  commencement of it.a
    Experiments    on the mining   of fisti in salt water have been
made also            by   other philosophers besides Canton  among these       :

ance      of    sea      water is owing to              a   commencement of putrefac
tion*.
     Another circumstance which  has been proved by these
observations              is,
               that heat deprives putrid bodies of their lu
minous property. This circumstance did not escape Canton                                               ;
for he remarked                   that, though
                                       summer heat pro      a    strong
moted putrefaction,  heat twenty degrees higher than that
                                     a
of the blood seemed to prevent it. This he discovered                                                  by
the following experiment — He put            :                     a    small        piece   of   a   fish
which    had become luminous, into                                  a     globe of thin glass,
immersed            it   in water        heated to          n8° of Fahrenheit, and                    ob
served         that   it     of its luminous property in lese
                                was deprived
than      a      on being taken from the water, however,
               minute        :                                                                         it
recovered its luminous property                             in
                                   ten seconds, but the light
it   emitted was not                so   strong as before.
  Spallanzani does not agree in opinion with Canton, that
the luminous appearance of fish arises from putrefaction f.
He repeated Canton's experiments with       variety of fish,                  a
but he succeeded only with      very few of them.    Those
                                                        a
which did not emit light                           he found        in   general       to be the fat
test, though, according to Canton, these ought, above all
others, to communicate    luminous appearance to sea water.
                                           a
Another circumstance, which seems contrary to Canton's
hypothesis,   that       is,
                     -the nocturnal luminous appearance of
                                   if
the      sea    were      by the oleaginous remains of putrid
                             occasioned
fisli, as these remains always float at the surface the light
ought to be confined to the surface of the water; which ex
perience stiows not to be the cafe.

of the sea to phosphoric insects *.  The abbe Nollet, in par
ticular, while at Venice in the year 1749, paid great atten-*
tion to this phænomenon, and was confirmed in his opinion
by the following observation: — Having remarked that the
sea water in the harbour os Portofino emitted a strong light,
lie lay down on the edge of the water ; and, stretching his
head over              it,
             he saw these insects spring up, as insects   ge                                             in
neral do, from the bottom of the water, which was covered
with       sea-weeds.                   When          he attempted              to catch them in his
handkerchief, he found on                            only luminous spots, which he
                                                          it

   Le Roi, during                       a    voyage up the Mediterranean, observed
that the head of the sliip, as  passed through the waves,           it
threw up in the daytime multitude of small particles, which
                                                      a
at night had     fiery appearances.

clined to ascribe this phænomenon to insects, because, having
collected some of these luminous particles in his handker
chief,        he found them                           to be round bodies                  like pin-heads,
without            any appearance                      of animal organs, though                          he exa
mined them with     microscope.    But he does not deny that
                                        a
there are luminous insects in the sea, though he  of opinion                                    is
that its luminous appearance arises from some other cause,
which he does not further explain.

    ^04           On the Luminous Appearance            of the   Sea.
      The celebrated Forskal, who accompanied Niebuhr as na
   turalist in his travels through Arabia, having caught a great
   number of marine animals, among which there were dif
   ferent kinds of medusa, put some of them into a bucket full
   of water        After keeping      them some time, he threw the con
   tents  of   the bucket from a window, in the dark, and observed
   that all those places where the water fell seemed to be co
   vered with sparks of sire.             He made several experiments on
  this subject,       all  of which convinced him         that the luminous
  appearance        of the    sea arises  from insects.      Bartholinus    also,
  and    Donati,      ascribe   the luminous       appearance     of  the sea   to»
   marine worms (moluscev).
      Silberfchlag ascribes the luminous appearance of sea water
  to phosphorus, the component parts of which may exist in
  the sea as well as in the atmosphere.                 Jt is not improbable
  that several kinds of worms,                which,   according to various
  observations,       have been considered        as luminous, may be in
  debted     for that property to marine phosphorus adhering to
  them.       It has been found, by repeated observations, that the
 water    of the    sea, even at the depth       of forty  feet,  is phospho
 rescent   ;   and the abbe Spallarrzani           is therefore    inclined    to-
 believe    that this is the case also at every depth.              Respecting
 the luminous appearance of the sea water, however, he gives
 no decisive opinion, and considers every thing hitherto said
 on the subject as mere conjectures.
     Mr. Erich Schytte remarks, that when                   sea  water is con
 verted    into ice it retains its luminous property ; and that,
 when sea water is distilled, the luminous matter does not
 pass over, but remains behind in the still.
     Professor     J.  Mayer, in      a   paper  publislied in the Trans
 actions of       the     Royal Bohemian        Society on the luminous
 appearance       of  the   Adriatic,   fays, that the water at the surface
seems to imbibe the rays             ot   light in the fame manner as a
light magnet.           This luminous appe trance is observed mort
at the surtace than at any depth in the water, and disappears
when, by violent agitation of the waves, the water at the sur
face becomes mixed with that below. This author, however,
is  of opinion,        that there are in the water foreign            particles
which emit          a stronger    light,    and  which may       be separated

from     it,   but there are no proofs that electricity has any share
isl the phænomenon.
      M. Bajon,           on the other hand, considers the luminous ap
pearance         of   the sea as electric, and,               insupport of this opinion,
remarks that           it      is   never     observed        but when friction     pro           is
duced       by
           some body passing over or through the water.  For
this reason the light   always seen very strong around ships,
                                     is
and where great numbers of sisti are collected together. The
action of the atmosphere                        may also excite this light at the
surface     of    the sea.          It   is   promoted         by
                                                              north wind, and
                                                                    a                                    is
interrupted           by   a   south      wind,     as     well     as      by     damp weather,
&c.    This opinion, in the most essential parts, agrees per
fectly with that of M. De    Perrier, and of J. R. Forster.

   M. Le Gentil also concludes, from observations made in
the Indian seas,  that this phænomenon      produced     the             is                        by
electricity of the sea water; for he observed     only under                       it
certain cafes; as for example, when the heavens were silled
with clouds, and the  sea high, and much agitated. He ob
served      it,
            however, during calms; but this was never the
cafe except when    storm was to be apprehended.
                                a                  As lung
as the storm continued, the sea had   luminous appearance;     a
but    as   soon       as      it   was over,        the       light ceased.   When the
weather was               in the usual            Rate,       that   isto fay, when the
winds were regular, even though                             they were             strong         and    the
sea    rough, he observed nothing of the phænomenon.     He
sailed   upwards of fix hundred leagues with    strong west                        a
 wind and very high sea, but did not observethe least spark
iOf light.  They appeared most abundant in winter, which                                                 is
'the period        when the winds change, and when storms and
hurricanes take place.         M. Le Gentil asserts that at this
period of the year he never wished to observe the sea lumi
nous, because he considered   as    sign of bad weather, and
                                                it        a
could always, with certainty, foretel         when
                                                                   is by

the Indian         seas     than in those parts on this                         side   of    the Cape,
between        America,             Europe,         and     Africa.              M. Le Gentil
ascribes the electricity                 of   the lea to the dashing                   of    the waves
against each other, which must naturally produce                                            friction.

Jo6              On the Luminous Appearance            of  the Sea.
luable observations            on this subject       by professor Forster, of
Halle. This celebrated navigator and naturalist observed this
phœnomenon on the night of the 29th of October 1772,
during a fresti gale, a few miles from the Cape of Good
Hope. He saw also a great quantity of small luminous bodies
•floating on the sea, some of them near and others at a con
 siderable distance from the stiip.               He  caused some       of  the sea
water to be hauled              up in a bucket, in which he found au
 immense number of small globules which moved with great
 rapidity.        When the water was suffered to stand some time
 at rest, these luminous globules became less numerous ; but,
 when agitated, they resumed their luminous property.                           Mr.
 Forster found, when              he   examined some         of  these   globules,
 that they had life and organisation, but they died before he
 could wash them from his fingers.
       Professor Forster distinguishes           three kinds of light in the
 sea, which seems to agree pretty well with the beforemen-
 tioned observations.            The   first kind, he fays, must be ascribed
 to electricity, because the quick motion of sliips through
 the water, especially when the wind is strong, occasions a
 violent friction        ;  and because the agitation         of the waves pro
  duced     by the wind heats the waves more than the atmo
  sphere above them.              The resin, pitch, and tar, with which
  the outside       of   sliips is covered,     and the conducting property
  of water,      render the probability of this phænomenon being
  connected with electricity still stronger.
       The second kind of light appears, in a proper fense, to be
  phosphoric.          A great many animal bodies, by putrefying in
  the    sea,  become        decomposed,      and consequently their com
  ponent parts,         and    particularly the phosphoric acid, are dis
  engaged.         An      addition of inflammable matter forms with
  this acid       that mixture which            is commonly       known      by the
  name us phosphorus *.              Thus, lifli which are dried in the air
   become sometimes phosphoric; and this is the cafe with the
   ocean itself, when, after a long cairn, it has been filled with
       *
         Professor   Fo;stcr's  reasoning, hire quoted,   is  agreeable  to   the fid
   t'lCon-.   We have no right      to rker his words;  and   it will be seen by  our
   chemical    readers    that the facts might as easily be aicr.imodatcd to the
   fnodern theory.
                                                                          putridity

putridity and corruption ; as heat and tranquillity contribute
to promote the speedier solution of animal substances.    Fish,
as well as gelatinous animals, contain oily and inflammable
particles, with which the liberatedphosphoric acid may rea
dily unite and form a phosphorus on the surface of the sea,
and give rise to this wonderful phænomenon.
    The third kind of light           arises,     no doubt, from living ani
mals which float       in the      sea,      and must be produced    by their
peculiar organisation, or rather their component parts, which
deserve to be better examined by chemical experiments.
  These conjectures of Dr. Forster contain, in my opinion,
the most satisfactory explanation of this phænomenon.      All
the effects of it hitherto observed may be referred to some of
the above-mentioned causes               ;   and the general conclusion that
may be deduced from them                   is, that as these effects have been
seen under different circumstances, they must                           be explained
 by different causes.

I N our fourth Volume,       414, we laid before our readers
                                      p.
an interesting letter on this subject from Mr. Peter Cole to
Dr. Mitchill of New York, to which we refer. Such rela
tions are often questioned but in natural history,
                                   ;                                            as   in   other
branches of science, the evidence of positive facts                             is   never to
be controverted        by   mere      inferences        from other supposed or
real phenomena.             Mr. Cole         is
                                             a         gentleman whose veracity
will not    be questioned        by   those who know him,                 and we have
therefore  no right to doubt the truth os former relations of
a similar nature merely because we know not now the cha
racter of the relaters. The late Hon. Daines Barrington took
the trouble to collect       a   number of testimonies                 of similar          sub
mersions               England, which were published

jRiver*, about fifty feet from the bank, in company with our
 mutual friend Mr. Jacob Sebor. Our attention was attracted
by numerous flights of birds, which appeared to come across
 the town from the eastward, and descend immediately into
the river.      So singular an appearance excited our particular
observation. We went, out and stood close to the bank, and
then perceived that what we at first imagined to be black
birds were actually swallows ; and that, as soon as the va
rious flocks had cleared the houses, and got directly over the
river, they plunged into the water and disappeared.                   This
was not confined to the vicinity of the place where we stood,
but was the cafe as far as the eye could reach, up and down
the    river, and continued         without   cessation   for nearly two
hours, when the closing of the evening prevented our further
observation.
     "  Aware of the importance of affording any additional
information on this long disputed question in the natural his
tory of the swallow, I procured a telescope, and watched at
tentively many of the flocks from their first appearance until
their immersion, continuing my eve fixed upon the spot long
enough to be fully convinced that not one of the birds re
turned to the surface again.           Indeed, one flock of about two
hundred birds plunged into the water within thirty yards of
us, and instantly disappeared,           without   the  least appearance
of opposition       that  might be expected      to arise from their na
tural buoyancy;         and at the same time        the evening was so
serene,    and   i he river   so unruffled, that no deception of our
fight could possibly have occurred.
     " When the birds first came in view, after crossing the
town, their (light was easy and natural ; but when they de
scended near to the water they           appeared    much agitated and
distressed, flying in a      confused manner against each other, a?
    *  The houst of Mr. Pollock is. situated near the margin of the Hudson,
ibmit two hundred yards from the b(tr;ry. The river is about a mile and
a half wide, and from seven to nine Ltlioms deep, and runs with a (bong
and rapid tide.      Mr. Pollock dees not recollect the species of swallow
which then disappeared. The barn swallow (birunJo rtifiica), chimney
(wallow (bhur.do pflafgia), the sand or bank martin (birumfo riparia),
and the purple martin (birundo fiurfwrea),M frequent and build their liabi-j

 ' As some time has
                        elapsed since the above-mentioned facts
 occurred,   I thought it proper,      before I gave you  Mr. Sebor's
 name, as having been a witness to them, to consult his re
 collection on the subject, and I have pleasure in assuring you
 he distinctly remembers       every    circumstance  I  have recited,
 and  of which I made a memorandum at the time.' It may
 be worthy of remark, that, as far as my observation went,
 the swallows totally disappeared on the 84th of August 1798 j
 for, during the remainder of that year, I did not fee one.

 V_>.   D'EYMAR, in consequence of            a report from two offi
cers  of health,   respecting    the   inconveniences which might
arise  if Eschen's funeral    should    be deferred, gave the neces
sary  orders  in our  presence   for  interring the body in a proper
and decent manner.         For his purpose we made choice of a
spot  which   would   necessarily be seen by every traveller going
to Chamouni, and even by those who might ascend the gla
cier of Buet by the route of Servoz and Villy, in consequence
of the intention expressed by the præfect that a monument
erected over the grave of this unfortunate young man, with
a suitable inscription, while it preserved a remembrance of
the event, might forewarn travellers of the dangers to which
they would be exposed in traversing the glaciers without taking
proper precautions, and without paying to the information
of their guides that attention to which it ought to be enti
tled.    While preparations      were    making for the interment,
we interrogated    C, Deville     and    his companions with much

 J IO              Fatal Occident which       happened to
 interest,  respecting    their expedition to the glaciers, and the
 following     account    is  drawn up from minutes written down
 at the time :
     " In   consequence      of the order of C. d'Eymar, præfect of
 Lcman, C. Joseph Maria Deville, after causing a harpoon to
 be forged,     and   providing ropes, set out, accompanied by his
 two sons John Claude and Bernard, and Joseph Ettle, inn
 keeper at Servoz,      in order to proceed to the glacier of Buet
 iti search of the stranger swallowed up by a fissure in the
 snow. They left Servoz at seven in the evening, and tra
 velled the whole night.
     " Having    arrived on the glacier at day-break, they imme
 diately repaired to a hut built of state in the neighbourhood,
 called Castle Pictct, near which, as they were informed, the
 accident had taken place.            They observed some signs of a
 fissure covered by the snow, but there was no aperture.              They
 however continued their search, and about two in the after
noon Deville found in the snow a hole almost square, about
two-feet     in extent each way, but of which they could not
 distinguish the bottom.           In the neighbourhood there ap
 peared    some signs    of    the existence   of  a fissure beneath     the
 show.
     " By means     of a stone tied to the end     of  a rope  in the form
of   a founding-line,       they were    able  to discover in this hole,
at the depth      of more than      a hundred feet,     the presence    of  a
body of     a  nature different from snow or ice.           They then let.
 down the harpoon, which seemed to have laid hold of some
 thing, but which brought up only a single hair. Bernard the
 son then proposed lo descend attached to a rope, which he
 accordingly did ; and when he arrived at a depth where there
were only eight inches distance between the sides of the fis
 sure, he was able to touch,          with   a staff five feet in length,
 the head of the dead body below him.              He then    caused him
 self to be hoisted up,       because   he found    his position   exceed
 ingly confined, without          having   power to move        any  of   his
 Junbs,
     " The harpoon       was    again   employed, but it brought up
'nothing except      fragments of     the clothes   and    a hat.    Night
                                                                      cuinq

came on, the weather was cold, and the travellers
                                                were wet.
They were obliged, therefore, to return to the Chalets de
Villy, where they arrived about ten at night.
  "     Having         consulted        together, they resolved to return to the
glacier, after supplying themselves with some pieces of wood
and some more ropes.     They set out from Villy at break of
day, and on reaching the mouth of the fissure they con
structed a kind of apparatus, by means of which Deville the
father was let down; but he was stopped by the narrowness of
the fissure, the fame obstacle which had stopped his son.                               He
had     carried down with                   him a stiort-handled          hatchet, by
means        of which            he    endeavoured        the passage to
                                                          to enlarge
wards the place               where the body lay, in order that it might
not be covered bvJ the fragments
                          a      of the ice. He descended
gradually towards                it,
                      and endeavoured, but in vain, to move
it,    as   it   was   so   strongly       wedged    in   between   the   fides    of    the
pit.        He then         endeavoured        to cut the ice, around        it,   and    at
last disengaged             the upper part          of   the body in such   a     manner
as to be able to fasten                a   rope round     it   below the arms.          The
body was in an erect    position, the arms raised up to the
head, and the face turned towards the left shoulder.    was                        It
quite frozen.
   " Deville then called out to the assistants to pull the rope,
in order to try whether   was possible to raise the body, but
                                         it
the attempt was fruitless.  He then continued to clear away
the ice around, which he at length acconiplilhed, after three
hours labour with his hatchet. When this was completed,
he first caused himself to be drawn up, and then the body;
by this time   was five in the evenii.g.

order to find out and collect all his property, and an in
 ventory of them was subjoined to the present minutes. A
 sleege was made with some pieces of wood, and in this
 mnnner the body was conveved beyond the glacier.            The
 brothers Deville then carried     on their stiouldcrs, in turns,

    who reflect on the labour he had to endure for several hours
    in the confined place in which he was suspended, and the
    length of the way he had walked, will be astonished that he
    could hold out so long.            He refused to take any repose until
    he had     assisted,   along with us and a very numerous com
    pany, at the funeral obsequies of the unfortunate traveller;
   He    was specially charged         by the præfect to cause a temporary
   pyramid to be raised in order to mark the spot.
        The compression which the unfortunate young man had
   experienced       by an accelerated fall of more than a hundred
   feet, in a fissure the fides of which approached each other in
   the form of a wedge, had been so violent that his watch was
   beaten flat.        We found in his           pockets    78 livres     in moneys
   and the third volume of Saussure's Journey through the Alps.
   Such of his effects as were of any value were given to Deville,
   according to the agreement made by                   M. Zimpflen,          and the
  præfect engaged to transmit the rest                   to his relations.        We
  thought proper to add to them               a   lock of the hair of this in
  teresting youth.
       In his pocket-book        was found      a  letter which he had begun,
  written in German, and directed                 to his father.       We cannot
  resist  the temptation       of publishing       some fragments        of it;  they
 display     a just spirit os' observation, and great sensibility of
 mind: I hope his unfortunate parents will forgive us ! It is
 the part which we take in their grief that renders us perhaps
 indiscrete in publishing the letter of the son ; but we wish to
 make our readers participate in their regret, and to announce,
 wherever this work may circulate, what kind of son these
 parents     have lost, what hopes have been snatched from them
 for ever *.

      One of our countrymen, young and active, having ven
 tured without a guide, and without proper stioes, to traverse
  the steep and rocky declivities which form the base of the

  Rudy    and   my Sophia.       It  is needless to tell you that I travel on scot,
  and you may also guess that I travel in company with a friend ; for the
  heart and mind never enjoy the most beautiful aspects ofnature but when,
  conscious that a living being sympathises with us.               Every thing beautiful
  and sublime, in order that it may make 3 deep impression on the soul of
  man, ought to be united with the enjoyment of love and friendship                   ....
     " Scarcely have you reached the canton of Fribourg when you lose sight
  of that opulence, civilisation, culture, and those natural beauties, which
  distinguish the canton of Berne ; and the contrast           is painful.    I have found
  here a confirmation       of the opinion I long before entertained of the old
  government ot' Berne.          However      deficient it might be in many respects,
  it was incontestably superior        to all the other governments      of  Swisserland.
      " In  the hermitage (near Fribourg) there is now living an old hermit
  \vith   a long white beard called Le Frtre des Bois, a name given here to
  hermits.     Though pretty far advasced in years,           he is still very fresh.    He
  served   a long   time as an      officer   in a Swiss regiment in the pay of        Au
  stria.   We were very much surprised, when we                   ascended   towards him,
  to fee him coming slowly to meet us across the large hall, not in the dress
  of a hermit, but in a hussar uniform ; his short open red cloak, bordered
  with fur, and his white breeches, formed a contrast with his long snowy
  beard.     He received us with great kindness, spoke to us in French and
  German, complained a great deal of the depravity of the present age, and
  told us that it was not sufficient to pray, it was necessary            to act, &c.    He
  congratulated     himself   on   the tranquillity of his life, his habitation being
  at a distance   from all bustle, and his ears being assailed by no noise, except
  th .t occasioned    by the fall of a neighbouring       torrent,    and the singing     of
  Virds."

of Baime     to the north,       and at a little distance   from the neck
or  passage   of that name which conducts from Chamouni                 to

to pieces at the bottom of the precipice.
    A  Genevese family, who had gone to visit the ice cave              of
Arveron,      and    who happened to be there at a time wheo
the arch fell down in successive fragments, in consequence,
it is said, of a pistol being fired, having been so imprudent
as not to retire      in proper time, while the accumulated ice
obstructed     the torrent, one      of the sons was cruslied to death
by the   falling blocks of ice, and hurried away by the waves;
another was severely wounded ; and the father, after both
his legs were broken, escaped from destruction only in a
manner almost miraculous.
    These, however, are the only unlucky events which have
taken place for a long time in a country visited by many of
the curious, who are sometimes imprudent.                 It may readily
be believed that none of these accidents would have hap
pened, had those who fell victims to them listened to the
yoice of common prudence, which would dictate nearly as
follows  :
    That   there   is very    little merit or glory in exposing one's
life, through ostentation, in order to display a courage in
which the most common rope-dancer will always be superior
to the traveller who attempts           to give proofs  of his  good head,
er agility in attempts more or less dangerous,
    That no one ought to think of traversing these mountains
except when conducted by a robust, prudent, and experienced
guide. Nothing can be more treacherous and deceitful than
those things which appear easy when seen at a distances
those apparent      passages, in which       travellers are gradually in
volved, without reflecting that,          if  they are at  last stopped by
fear, or by the impossibility         of proceeding further, this fear
will double     the  difficulty of retreating, because it destroys that
coolness which is necessary for extricating one from disagree
able situations.       I have more than once experienced that it
is possible to recover this coolness by resolving to look only
forwards, and endeavouring, by an essort of the imagination,
                                                                        U*'

                 a Traveller      on  tie Glacier of Buet.              a$
to suppose that you are walking merely on the highway, or
stepping from one stone to another, or along the top of a
stone fence    in order    to avoid wetting your feet.
   In a word, it is necessary to place the most implicit con
fidence in the cautions of your guide. Men of that class,
Xvhen    they   accompany       a  traveller, lie under the weight of
great responsibility.       If an   accident should take place through
their fault,    it would ruin their reputation ; and on this re
futation    their maintenance depends.             The guides, therefore,
are interested by one os those motives which are dearest to
hian, to give good advice ; and the traveller ought to obey it.
From these precautions, which may be called moral, I shall
how proceed to the physical.
   The most essential of all is proper shoes. Three kinds of
difficult declivities are found on the Alps — rocks, declivities
of ice, and those covered with grafs, which are more slippery
than ice when the         sole  of  the (hoe is smooth, as it generally
becomes      by walking over them. The use of cramp-irons
either on the heel, as Saussure recommends, or placed across
the sole, as they are used by some of the mountaineers, will
render travelling over these declivities secure to a certain
degree   : but they must often be put on and taken off, because
they render walking more or less cumbersome ; which is a
great inconvenience.           I have found so much utility in an
invention which I substitute for them, that              I  do not hesitate
to recommend         it to those fond of visiting          these romantic
scenes.
   The traveller     must provide strong slioes, the soles       of which
are at least six lines in thickness, and           having the upper lea
ther and quarter double to           a  certain height around the sole.
The upper leather must be exceedingly pliable, in order that
it may nowhere hurt the foot, and the shoes sliould be tried
several times    in   short excursions      before a long journey is un
dertaken    with them.        Nails of     tempered   steel must be pro
vided', the tails   of which form a screw ; their heads, not less
than four lines and        a half in diameter, must be cut into the
form of a square pyramid, which will have two points in
consequence of the notch cut into each for receiving the
screw-driver to fix them in the slioes.             Twelve of these nails
                                         Q^      .                   must

116                Fatal Occident which           happened lo
must be put into each sole,             viz.   seven around the fore-past,
disposed at equal distances, and five around the heel, as near
the edge of the sole as possible without endangering the
bursting of the leather.              The interval between these nails
ought     to  be   filled    up with common large-headed nails, so
dose that their heads may touch each other.
    Shoes of this kind will cnsufe safety to the traveller in all
places of difficulty ; the nails will hold on granite as well as
on the grafs, will occasion no inconvenience in the plains,
and will last for a long time.              When the steel heads become
worn down, others mav be substituted in their place.                      The
first stioes  of this kind, which I          caused to be made        a dozen
years    ago,   and      which      I have frequently employed during
that period, are still sit        for service.
     A staff, five or fix sect in length, stiod with iron, is also
useful to those who traverse the glaciers, either for sounding
the deceitful       snow      which covers the listures, or for walking
with more safety over the (lipperv ice.                 Staves of this kind,
ready prepared by          the   guides, may be found at Chamouni.
    When the traveller has to ascend for a considerable time,
it  is a bad plan to be desirous           of hurrying.     By   these means
the traveller becomes            heated, and loses breath,      and his pro
gress is more retarded             than he expected.        The guide must
be ordered      to walk        foremost   ; and it will be necessary to be
directed     by his    step?,    which are measured, as it were, in ca
dence,     and to stop      from time to time, but without fitting
down, and without halting too long to catch cold.                    He may
ascend in this manner, without stopping,                  200 fathoms per
pendicular height, and that is enough.                    He must pull off
his coat when he begins to perspire, and carry it folded up on
his (boulder     :  in this manner the heat produced by the labour
of walking may            be moderated,        and he will find, when he
 halts, the benefit of an additional covering, without any of
its inconveniences.             In regard to dress, it is of essential ad
vantage, when a traveller sets out for the glaciers, whatever
may be the heat in the plain country below, to take proper
precautions to guard against the cold, which it is not always
possible to foresee.          To    the ladies in particular  I recommend
this attention.
                                                                        These

   These precepts are addressed, more or less directly, to all
travellers      who mav be desirous of traversing the mountains;
but I (hall add a few words to those who are philosophers or
naturalists, and to the amateurs of lithology in particular.
The latter have frequently experienced the inconvenience of
having nothing but their pockets to contain the specimens of
rock which they detach with a hammer : these are soon filled,
and barass the traveller bv their swinging movement.                     I
supply      this deficiency,       with   advantage,  in< the  following
 manner      :
   To    a pretty broad leather belt         I  have adapted  a loop    of
the fame material,          placed in an inclined position, to receive
 my hammer, nearly in the fame manner as the Turks carry
their poniards.          Gn the other fide is a small pocket, which
contains a bottle of acid in a wooden cafe, a piece of steel
for striking fire, &c. This belt or girdle forms the upper
part  of   an apron      of very thin leather,   which, when   let down,
would cover          the knee,   but which, when tucked up on each
fide, forms       a large  horizontal pocket before, open at the top,
and supported in the middle by a thong shaped like an in
verted Y; the two branches of which are sewed to the girdle,
and   pass     round the apron below. The tail of the Y is turned
up before,        and is buckled to the bandolier with which             I
carry rav barometer.             The    stones which    I put into this
pocket being disposed,          as  it were, around the centre    of gra
vity of the body, and being supported in part by the shoul
ders, on account of the thong which envelops the apron,
occasion        no inconvenience.         I thus have them all under
my eye, and at hand when I wish to substitute one specimen
for another; and they experience no agitation, and do not
rub against each other as they do in the pockets.
   To     the    fame    girdle, on one fide, are suspended, by steel
books,      one    of Ramsden's       sextants of three inches radius,
which      gives     even the minutes of a degree; an instrument
exceedingly convenient for measuring angles.               On the other
fide is suspended an artificial horizon, with a spirit level for
taking heights. The box of this instrument I dispose in
such   a  manner that it        serves  me for a stand when necessary,
being supported          by a staff that opens at bottom with three
                                                                     sect;

  an   excellent walking-stick             when    the    three    branches     are
  folded together.          Though     the   whole     of   these instruments,
 added     to the      usual    quantity of     stones    collected during an
  excursion of this kind, amount in weight to more than
  twenty pounds, I am not much incommoded by the burden,
 on account of its being equally distributed; and in my last
 Alpine journey,            which    I  undertook with the unfortunate
 Dolomieu, he             envied    my lot, though, instead of being
 accoutred       as   I   was,   he carried only       his hammer and his
 specimens*

                       the places frequented by these vermin, place
                         tile one or two meat spoonfuls of dry oat
upon     a state
meal; lay it thin, and press it flat, that you may more easily
know what is taken away. The rats, if not interrupted, will
come regularly to feed there; supply them thus with fresh
oatmeal for two or three days ; then to about six spoonfuls of
dry oatmeal add three drops of oil of aniseeds; and having
stirred    the    mixture well together, feed them with this for
two or three days more; then for one day give them only
half the quantity they have usually eaten of this scented oat
meal, and on the following day place the following mixture :
     To four ounces of dry oatmeal, scented with six drops of
oil of aniseeds, add half an ounce of carbonat of barytes,
previously pounded very fine in a mortar, and sifted through
a little sine muslin           or cambric : mix this intimately with
the scented oatmeal, and lay this mixture of oatmeal and
barytes upon the tile or slate, as the oatmeal had been usually
placed, and allow the rats to come and eat of it for twenty-
four hours without interruption.
    * For this communication         Mr. Taylor     received   the thanks  of the
Society.    As   that Society has   not yet published     any of its transactions,
sur inserting this article cannot fail    to prove highly useful.
                                                                          A   few

    A   sew hours after eating thereof, you                            will frequently            fee
some     of them running        as if drunk, or paralytic, but
                                           about
eventually they generally  all retire to their haunts and die.
As rats are extremely sagacious, it may be proper, where
they have only eaten a small portion, to allow the mixture to
remain for forty-eight hours.      It will be best to burn what
js left after that time, as a fresh mixture may be prepared at
a trifling expense, when wanted.
    During           the time in which mixture of barytes is ex
                                                    the
posed to the rats, it is necessary to keep shut the doors of the
places where it is laid, to prevent the vermin from being
disturbed, or    possibility of accident to any other animal or
                          a
person ; for though it is not so extremely dangerous, if taken.
internally, as the preparations commonly employed for kill
ing     rats,    and          is even in some cafes used in medicine,                        yet    it
is fatal    if   taken improperly.
    The oil of                aniseeds    renders       the mixture          disagreeable          to
dogs     and         many other animals,                 but    is,    in   small quantities,
alluring to rats.

    120            Examination      of the  received Doctrines
    its original bulk, then the added heat is latent ; it is in che
    mical union ; it is combined caloric ! Because now not cog
    nisable by our senses ? No.             We fee the volume of the
    steam much larger than that of the water; and the more
   heat we add,        the greater    is  the   increase   of volume while
   water is left to receive it.         Yet I   am not to believe that the
   heat is cognisable by any organ of sense or external sign 1
   In other words, I am commanded to believe as true, a state
   ment which the evidence           of my own      fenses makes it impos
   sible  I can give credit to.
       But,   fay   the advocates for this doctrine, a substance fo
   charged     with   caloric as to become vapour, will not indicate,
   by the thermometer, any further increase of temperature,
   though we continue to pour heat into the liquid that pro
  duces the vapour; therefore the extra heat must have become
   latent in the steam that has been generated.                Nay, we can
  prove the fact; for this fame latent heat may again be made
 sensible in the common process of condensation.
       This mode of reasoning appears to me to be more specious
  than just.       It is demanding that the common thermometer
  mould do in this cafe what it never does in any. This in
  strument never         tells the quantity of heat passing into anv
  body, even in those cases where heat is counted sensible or
Jree\ it only tells the comparative quantity pasting into itself
  from the body in which it is immersed, or with which it is
  in contact,     to bring it into equilibrium with that body as to
 heat.
      Boiling water, steam, the materials of which the thermo
 meter is made,         become    each charged with heat in proportion,
  to their capacities,     and   this whether the thermometer be in
 the water or in the steam.              The thermometer kept in the
 steam      will  never rife higher than 213°,          " because there the
 heat is latent!"         Keep it in boiling water for a year, and it
 will not rife higher than 21a ; yet there the heat \s sensible!
 Is this distinction reconcilable with common fense? But the
 result may even be altered at pleasure.             It will not rise higher
 than 3 J 2° in boiling water under the common atmosphere : —
 in other words, if we wish to raise the heat higher, we must
 put    a greater   pressure upon the water.          Constae the water so
                                                                        that

that none of it may escape, and the heat will rise in it far
above 2120.  Confine the steam, and in it the heat will rise
just as high          as    in   the confined water; yet in the one the heat
exists    in       a different       state   from what it does in the other                ! !   —
The      result,        may be altered by mechanical contriv
                       we see,
ances    nay, strictly speaking, What is the effect produced
         :
by the atmosphere but mere mechanical pressure ? Yet we are
to believe that a change has been effected in the physical
properties of one of the substances subjected to                             its mechanical
•peration !-—\f Nature had so constituted the                                atmosphere          as
to have only half its present gravity, the point                             at   which heat
would become latent, as it is called, in steam would have been
far below 21a0. When water is made to boil in an exhausted
receiver at a lower temperature, have we done any thing but
removed   weight from its surface, and vice versa-? — Does the
heat in the steam in these cases pass into a latent state also ?
Ifit does, the effect is mechanical : if it docs not, then the
mere accident of the atmosphere being of its present weight,,
has nothing to do with                         the    boiling    point happening to fall'
at 2120        !     But    he that would fay so                would be counted mad:
     At Munich,      other places equally elevated above the

tially exhausted receiver the fame effect takes place  and yet                     :
the doctrine of latent heat    never considered as inconsistent
                                                 is
            really for no other reason but because
with the fact          ;                                                               a   com

   To demand that thermometer should a                                measure the quan

 would be to demand, that      pint measure dipt into the ocean
                                                a

 insist that, otherwise, the water on the outside of the vessel
 must        have lost its original                   character, and be different from
 that within          :    it   demanding that mercury, which,

 laa           Examination of      the received   Doclrines
 ture, fliould be able (without our making any comparative
 experiments to determine the point) to inform us how many
 times water will be increased its own bulk when we pour a
 greater quantity of heat into it!
    The heat in the steam is as much sensible or free heat as
 it was before it passed into the steam,      if  these terms are to be
 applied   to heat cognisable      by our   senses,   and   that may be
 measured    comparatively.        But  the Jleam is really its own
 thermometer; and it indicates as truly the quantity of heat
 that has passed into a given quantity of water, as the ther
 mometer does the quantity that passes into itself; aye, and
by the same means too — the magnitude of its own volume.
    Instead of supposing,     in the   case  of   steam,   that heat has
become latent, or been           changed,   would      it not be more
 correct to ascribe the phœnomenon that led to this idea to
 another cause, a change in the form of the water, which, by
 its constitution, is forced to become vapour, under the common
prefjureo'i the atmosphere, whenever a certain number of times
its own hulk of heat is poured into it. The quantity, after
 proper comparative experiments, could then be expressed in
sensible terms, and would turn out to be the whole bulk of
the Jleam,   minus the original volume       of  the water in the corn-
found.
    If some such method were followed, it appears to me ex
tremely probable that we fliould soon arrive at many truths
respecting   the operations    of   the universally diffused substance
heat,   which otherwise     must escape us, though the facts that
might lead to them arc daily presenting themselves in almost
every chemical process.         It would surely tend much to the
advancement of science,         if the hulk, mass, or volume of heat
necessary to convert     different solids into liquids, and liquids
into gases, under a given prefjure, were accurately deter
mined by experiment.          The thermometer would then be a
more useful instrument than it now is — But we should never
look to it to perform impossibilities; we stiould no more ex
pect it to measure the quantity of heat passing into or out of
bodies,   than we fliould attempt to measure the quantitv of
water delivered from a pump, by placing an hygrometer or
any twisied fibrous substance in the stream, and then exa-

imining how much its length is diminished or its diameter
increased.
   Some may say, that the case of the conversion of water into
steam is not held by them as one of those that prove the
passing of heat from a sensible to a latent state, and that
therefore        our reasoning,             drawn from that example, will not
invalidate the doctrine;                "    for in the case of water they con
sider the heat as in simple mixture, and it would be an abuse
of words      to call     so   weak an union                     by the name        of combina
tion."
     I
     reply, that this cafe was one of the earliest brought in
support of the doctrine, and also thought to be one of the
strongest ; and if the good understanding of any has led them
to give it up, it is the more surprising they should be so blind
as to    continue upholding                a   fabric which was built on this as
one of its foundation stones                       ;       and which does not appear to
me to be upheld by any one fact that may not be as satis
factorily explained, without admitting the existence of heat
in two distinct states.
   But, fay these, two different fluids of the fame temperature
when united will often give out heat — What can we fay of
this heat, but that it was latent or combined in one or both
of the fluids, and that it is thrown out as sensible or free
hent by their union             ?     I would              say   no such thing without a
previous examination of all the accompanying phænomena ;
arid one of these I find to be a reduction in the volume of the
compound, which is less than that                            of       the sum    of the two. The
moleculæ of the two substances occupy                                   less   room united than
in their respective fluids. For instance,                                 when sulphuric acid
and water are joined, the volume of the mixture is less than
that of the two before mixture                         ;    there      is,
                                                                  therefore, less lodg
ing-room         left    for the heat          :       in other words, the capacity of
the compound for heat                 is   less        than the sum of the capacities
of   the ingredients:               there-lore,            compared with            surrounding
bodies,     it   has now        too large          a       quantity, and,          by the law of

ment in the petty processes of the laboratory.
   Are there any cafes in which heat is distodged by the union
of two liquids, and where, at the fame time, the volume of
the mixture is not reduced below that of the sum of the vo

tempt to explain them when they are adduced.    In the mean
time, when a diminution of volume follows, or rather ac
companies,         t he      extrication of heat from any body, instead of
running          to the       doctrine of latent heat being then made

namely, that the molcculæ of the two liquids are        con                                so
structed and formed as to admit of their coming closer toge

sequence         of being thus
                          dislodged (for two substances cannot,

the increase to be attributed not merely to the                                          addition of
heat, but to the addition of   quantity equal in bulk

 of the volume of any substance, when heat     added or ab                       is
 stracted,       is   the real bulk       of          the       heat    so   added or abstracted.

                 Experiment.
  On a board of about 4 feet 6 inches long, I placed at one
end a small plain mirror, and at the other two thermome
ters *.          The   of No. 1, from the face of the mirror,
                          distance
was 3 feet 9^ inches; and No. 2 was put at the fide of                                                it,
facing the fame way, but out of the reach of the rays that
were to be reflected      the mirror. The colours of the priim
                                      by
were thrown on      sheet of paper, having parallel lines drawn
                                 a
upon       it,
          at half an inch from each other.   The mirror was
stationed upon the paper; and was adjusted       such   man                         in            a
ner as to present its polished surface, in an angle of 45 de
grees, to the incident coloured rays,       which means they                 by
would be reflected towards the ball of the thermometer No. 1.
In this arrangement,                    the whole                apparatus         might be with
drawn from the colours to any required distance,        attend                               by

lines of the paper.               When the thermometers were properly
settled to the             temperature of their situation, during which
time the mirror had been covered,                                   the apparatus           was drawn
gently away from the colours,                       mirror, so    far    as to cause the
which was now open, to receive   only the invisible rays of
heat which lie beyond the confines of red.  The result was
as follows        :

    I  made an apparatus           for placing the small steel mirror at
any required angle *; and, having exposed it to the prismatic
spectrum, so as to receive it perpendicularly, I caused the
colours to fall on one half of the mirror, which, being covered
by a semicircular piece of pasteboard, would stop all visible
rays,     so that     none of them could reach                the   polished   surface.
On     the     pasteboard     were     drawn several lines, parallel to ;he
diameter, and at the distance of one-tenth of an inch horn,
each other;          that, by withdrawing               the apparatus,        I  might
have it at option to remove the last visible red to any required
distance       from the reflecting surface.                   In the focus of the
 mirror      was placed the thermometer No. 2.                        I covered now
 also the other         half of   the    mirror, till the thermometer had
 assumed the temperature of its situation. Then, withdrawing
 the apparatus out of the visible spectrum, till the last tinge of
 red was one-tenth of an inch removed from the edge of the
 pasteboard,       and the whole        of  the coloured         image thus thrown

19 degrees.           Now, by this                alternate     rising and falling of the
thermometer,            three points are clearly ascertained.                            The    first
is, that there are invisible rays of the fun. The second, that
these rays are not only reflexiblc, in the mariner which has
been proved in the foregoing experiment, but that, by the
strict laws of reflection, they are capable of being condensed.
And, in the third place, that by condensation their heating
power is proportionally increased ; for, under the circum
stances of the experiment, we find that it extended so far as
to be able to raise the thermometer,                            in two minutes, no              less
than 24 degrees.

Were fixed the two thermometers No.    and No. 3, with their    2

the opposite way.                A    little of the wood was cut out of the

I  must remark that, from the cases              of invisible    rays brought
forward in the four last experiments, it is evident that the
conclusion that rays must have illuminating power because
they have a power of occasioning heat is erroneous; and, as
this must be admitted, we have a right to ask for some proof
of the assertion, that ravs which occasion heat can ever be
come visible.         But,  as we    shall   have     an opportunity to say
¦more    of this    hereafter,   I  proceed     now to investigate the      re
fraction of heat-making rays.
           J lib   Experiment.       Refraction of Solar Heat.
    With     a new ten-feet Newtonian telescope, the mirror of
which is 24 inches in diameter of polistied surface, I received
the rays of the fun ; and, making them pass through a day-
piece with      four lenses,     I  caused them to fall on the ball          of
the thermometer No. 3, placed in their focus. Those who
are acquainted with the lines in which the principal ravs and
pencils move through a set of glasses, will easily conceive how
artfully, in our present instance, heat was sent from one
 place   to another — heat crossing          heat,     through many inter
secting courses,       without jofiling        together,     and   each  parcel
 arming      at  last  safelv to its destined place.           As   soon as the
 rays were brought to the thermometer, it rose, almost instant
ly, from    60 degrees to 130 ; and, being afraid of cracking the
 glasses, I turned away the telescope.                Here the rays, which
 occasioned     no less than 70 degrees of heat, had undergone
 eight regular successive refractions ; so that their being subject
 to its laws cannot be doubted.
      \llb  Experiment.        RefraSlion of      the   Heal of a Candle.
    I  placed    a lens   of about    1,4 inch focus and 1,1 inch dia
 meter, mounted upon a small support,                    at a distance   of 2,8
 inches from       a candle    *;   and the thermometer            No. 2, be-
 h.nd the lens, at an equal distance            of about 2,8 inches; but
 which     ought to he very carefully adjusted to the secondary

 caneve, was a p-.iiebcard screen, with an aperture of nearly
 the lame size as the ien».          The    support      of  the lens had an

place, and returned to the fame situation again, at pleasure.
This arrangement being made, the thermometer was for a
few moments exposed to the rays of the candle, till it had
assumed the temperature of its situation. Then the lens was
turned    on its pivot        so as   to intercept the direct            rays    whicli
passed   through the opening in the pasteboard screen, and to
                      focus, in which the thermometer was
                       Here, in three minutes, the_thermometer re
                         ceived 2f degrees of heat, by the refraction
                         of the lens. The lens was now turned
                         away.
                   Ilpre, in    three minutes, the thermometer lost
                        2J- degrees of heat.   The lens was now' re
                        turned to its situation.
                   And, in       three minutes, the thermometer re
                         gained the 2y degrees of heat.     A greater
                         effect may be obtained by a different ar
                         rangement of the distances.     Thus, if the

mometer situated,        as   before, in the secondary focus, we shall
be able to draw from 5 to 8 degrees of heat, according to the
burning of the candle, and the accuracy of the adjustment of
 the thermometer to the focus.                  The experiment           we have re
lated stiows evidently that rays invested with                    a    power    of   heat
ing bodies issue from a candle, and are subject to laws of
refraction, nearly the fame with those respecting light.

 VII. An     Examination         of Sr. Pierre's       Hypothesis  respecting,
    the Cause of the Tides, which, in opposition to the received
    Theory, attributes them to supposed periodical Effusions of
    the  Polar    lees.    By   Samuel Woods,             Esq.   Read before
    tbe-jijlesian     Society November $, 1799.
  X HE tides         are two periodical motions actuating the ocean
 (called the flux and reflux, or ebb and flow), which succeed
each other alternately at an interval of about six hours; the
period of a flux and reflux being, upon an average, 1 2 hours
24 minutes, the double of which, 24 hours 48 minutes, cor
responds to that of a lunar day, or the time elapsing between
the moon's passing a meridian and coming to                  it again. These
alternate    elevations       and   depressions    of the   ocean so exactly
correspond     with the course of the sun and moon, as to time
and quantity, that the influence of those luminaries has in
all ages been considered as the cause of their production                    ;
but it was reserved for modern times to ascertain the princi
ple  of their laws,       and to calculate,     with precision, the effects
produced by the different situations            of  the fun and moon, and
the proportions of their power. This principle is no other
than gravitation. It is evident that, if the earth were entirely
fluid and quiescent, its particles, by their mutual gravity,
would form the whole mass into a perfect sphere : now$ if
any power be supposed to act on all the particles of this sphere
                                                                         with

 would be moved together without experiencing any alteration
 in its figure. But this is not the cafe with respect to the moon's
 action on our globe: the power of gravity diminishes as the
 square of the dillance increases, and therefore the waters
 (at Z, Plate V. fig. 1.) on the side of the earth (A,B,C,D)
 next the moon (M), are more attracted by the moon than the
central parts of the earth (O), and the central parts more at
 tracted than the waters on the opposite fide (at n) ; and there
 fore the distance between the earth's centre and the waters
on its surface under and opposite         to the moon      will  be in
creased.     For, suppose three bodies in the fame line (H,0,D),
 if they are all equally attracted by any power (as M), they
will all move towards it with equal rapidity, their mutual
distances continuing the fame; but if the attraction of this
power (M) is unequal, the body most forcibly attracted will
 move fastest, and their reciprocal distances will be propor
tionally increased : thus, the power of gravitation acting un
equally on the three bodies (H,0,D), the distance of the
first (H) from the second (O), and of the second from the
third (D),     tfill be increased    in propdrtion   to the difference
of  the gravitating power at       the distance of   the  three bodies
 (H,0,D)      respectively,    now, suppose    a  number     of   bodies
 (ABCD)       placed round the centre       (O) so as to form a fluid
ring,    unequally    attracted   by some    power (M), the parts
nearest    and furthest    (H  and  D)  from this power will have
their distance from the centre (O) increased, while the fides
of this ring (B and F), being nearly equidistant from the
power (M), the centre (O) will not recede, but rather
approach the centre (O), and form an ellipsis (nLIzN).
To apply this reasoning to the case under consideration,
while    the earth, by its gravity,    tends toward the moon,        the
water directly below her will swell and rise gradually; the
water on the opposite fide will recede from the centre (or,
more properly, the centre will advance), and rise, or appear to
rise, while the water at the fides is depressed, and falls below
the former level : hence, as the earth revolves on its axis from
the moon to the moon again in 24 hours 50 minutes, there will
fee two tides of ebb and two of flood in that period.           In con
                                                              sequence

sequence        of the earth's motion on her axis,            the most elevated
part   of the water is carried beyond the moon in the direction
of   the rotation, and continues to rife after it has passed di
rectly under the moon, not attaining its greatest elevation till
ithas got about half a quadrant further. It continues also to
descend, aster it has passed at 90° distance from the point below
the moon, to a like distance           of about half aquadrant;           and there
fore    in       where the water flows freely, the time of
             open seas,
high water does not exactly coincide with the time of the
moon's coming to the meridian, but is some time after.
Besides, the tides do not always answer to the same distance ot
the moon from the meridian,                since they are variously affected
by the sun's action, which brings them on sooner when the
moon is in her first and third quarters, and keeps them back
later when slie is in her second and fourth : because, in the
former case, the tide raised by the sun alone would be earlier
than the tide raised by the moon : in the latter case, later.
     We      have hitherto             moon as the principal
                                  considered   the
agent in producing tides, but it is obvious that the inequality
of the fun's action must produce a similar effect; so that, in
.reality,      there         every natural day occasioned by
                       are two tides
the fun,        as   two tides every lunar day occasioned by
                     well    as
the moon, and subject to the same laws : on account, how
ever, of the fun's immense distance, his action is consider
ably inferior to that of the moon. By comparing the spring
and neap tides at the mouth of the Avon, below Bristol, Sir
Isaac Newton calculates the proportion of the moon's force
to the fun's as 9 to a nearly.  Dr. Horsley, in his edition of
the Principia, estimates it as 5,0469 to 1 ; and, considering
the elevation of the waters             by this force as an effect similar
to the elevation            of the equatorial above the polar parts of the
earth, it will be found that the moon is capable of producing
an elevation of about ten feet, the fun of about two feet ;
which corresponds pretty nearly to experience.
     In order        to understand     the cause     of spring   and neap tides,
we must consider, that the moon,                 revolving round the earth
in     an elliptic      orbit,    approaches    nearer and recedes further
from     it,   than her mean distance,         in    every revolution or lunar
month.          When        nearest, her attraction     is   strongest,    and vice
                                                                             ver/3:

 versa: when both luminaries are in the equator, and the
 moon in perigeo, the tides rife highest, particularly at oppo
 sition and conjunction : at the change, when the attractive
 forces      of   the fun and moon are combined,               the  tide is raised
 to a greater height           :  at the full,    when the moon raises the
  tide under and opposite to her, the fun, acting in the fame
  line, raises the tides under and opposite to him, whence their
  conjunct effect is the fame as at the change, and in both cafes
  occasions        what we call spring tides : but at the quarters, the
  fun's action diminishes the effect of the moon's action, so
  that they rife a little under and opposite the sun, and fall as
  much under and opposite the moon, these tVo luminaries
  acting obliquely on each other, and producing what is called
   neap tides *.
       The spring tides, however, do not happen precisely at the
   full and change of the moon, nor the neap tides at thequar-
. ters,      but about two days later. In this, as in many other
   cafes,      the effects are not greatest, or least, when the imme-.
   diate      influence of the cause is greatest or least : as, for in
   stance, the greatest           heat of summer is not at the time of the
   solstice, but some weeks after; and if the actions of the fun
   and moon mould be suddenly                suspended, the tides would con
   tinue for some time in their usual course.                    The variations of
   the moon's distance from the earth produce a sensible dif
   ference in the tides.            When the moon approaches the earth,
   her action on every part increases, and the differences of her
   action increase in a higher proportion as the moon's distances
   decrease.          According to Sir Isaac Newton, the              tides increase
   as the      cubes of the distances decrease; so that               the moon, at
   half her distance, would produce tides eight times as great.
   The fun being nearer the earth in winter than in summer,
   the spring tides are highest, and the neap tides lowest, about
    the time of the equinoxes, a little after the autumnal and
   before the vernal ; and, on the contrary, the spring tides
    lowest and         the neap tides highest at the solstices,            when the

in the           the tides are equally high in both parts of the

                ;
tides are alternately higher and lower at places having north
or south latitude : while the fun is in the northern signs, the
greater of the two diurnal tides in our climates is that arising
from the moon above the horizon : when the fun is in the
southern signs, the greatest is that arising from the moon
below the horizon.                    Thus       the   evening;      tides    in summer        are
observed        to    exceed        the    morning tides,             and      in winter       the

                                                 evening tides        :     the difference
Bristol is found to be 15 inches, at Plymouth 12,     It would
be still greater, but that a fluid always retains an impressed
motion for some time, and consequently the preceding tides
always affect those that follow.
     If   the   earth        were     covered all over with the sea to                   a   great
depth, the tides would be regularly subservient to these laws ;
but various causes combine                            to produce     a great       diversity    of
effect, according             to the peculiar situation and circumstances
of places, shoals, fords, and straits: thus, a stow and imper
ceptible motion of a large body of water, suppose two miles
deep, will be sufficient to elevate its surface ten or twelve feet
in   a tide's time;               whereas,       if    the fame quantity           of   water is
forced through      narrow channel forty or fiftv fathoms deep,
                         a
it produces          rapid stream, and of course the tide is sound
                     a very
to set strongest in those places where the sea grows narrowest,
the fame quantity of water being constrained to pass through
a smaller passage, as in the straits between Portland and Cape
la Hogue in Normandy; and it would be still more so be
tween Dover and Calais,                     if   the tide coming round the island
did not check: it.
     The   slioalness        of    the sea and the             intercurrent continents
are the reasons why the tides in the                          open         ocean   rise but to
very inconsiderable heights, when compared                                   to what they da
in wide-mouthed rivers opening in the direction of the stream
of the tide; and that high water is some hours, after the

 Uigh water; and the same is said to be the case on the western
coast  of America : so that tides happen to different places at
all distances    of   the moon from the meridian, arid conse
quently at all hours of the day.
   To allow the tides their full motion,           the space  in which
they are produced ought to extend from east to west 900 at
least ; such being the distance between the places most raised
and   depressed   by the moon's influence.           Hence it appears
that such tides can only be produced in large oceans, and
why those of the Pacific exceed those of the Atlantic ocean :
hence also it is obvious why the tides- in the torrid zone be
tween Africa and America,          where the ocean     13 narrower, are
exceeded by those os the temperate zones on either fide            : and
hence    we may comprehend why            the tides are     so small  in
islands at a great distance      from the shores, since the water
cannot rife on one shore without descending on the other :
so  that at the intermediate islands it must continue at a mean
height between its elevations on those stiores.
    The tide produced on the western coast of Europe corre
sponds to this theory.       Thus, it is high water on the western
coasts  of Ireland, Spain,     and Portugal,     about the third hour
after the moon has passed the meridian         ;  from thence it flows
into the adjacent channels, as it finds the easiest passage. One
current, for example, runs up by the south of England, and
another by the north of Scotland ; taking considerable time
to move all this way, and occasioning high water sooner in
the places at which it first arrives, and begins to fall at these
places while the current is proceeding to others further di
stant  in its course.     On  its return it is unable to raise a tide,
because   the water runs faster off than it returns,        till, by the
propagation of a new      tide from the ocean, the current is stopt,
and begins to rise again.        The tide propagated by the moon
in the German ocean, when slie is three hours past the me
ridian, takes twelve hours to come from thence to London
bridge;   Ib that, when it is high water there, a new tide has
already attained    its height in the ocean, and in some inter
mediate   place  it must be low water at the fame time. When
the tide runs over slioals, and flows upon flat stiores, the water

146              Examination of St. Pierre's Hypothesis
is elevated to      a ereater  height than in open and deep oceans
that have steep banks, because the force of its motion is not
broken upon level shores till the water has attained a greater
height.       If a place communicates with two oceans, or by
two different openings with the fame ocean, one of which
affords an easier and readier passage than the other, two tides
may arrive at this place in different times, which, interfering
together, may produce a great variety ofphænomena.
    At several places it is high water three hours before the
moon comes to the meridian ; but that tide which the inoon.
drives,   as   it were, before her, is only the tide opposite to that
produced by her when nine hours past the opposite meridian.
    It would be tedious to enumerate all the particular solutions
easily deducible from these doctrines : as, why lakes and seas,
such as the Caspian and the Mediterranean,               the Euxine and
the Baltic, have little or no sensible tides ; since, having no
communication, or being connected by very narrow inlets
with the great ocean, they cannot receive or discharge water
sufficient to alter their surface sensibly.           In general, when
the time of high water at any place is mentioned, it is to be
understood on the days of new and full moon : the times of
high water in any place fall at nearly the fame hours after a
period of about fifteen days, or between one spring tide and
another.
    This theory, however,        is not without objections and diffi
 culties;     which has encouraged a Frenchman of some emi
 nence, St. Pierre, to frame a new and singular hypothesis,
ascribing all the phænomena of the tides to the periodical
 effusions of the polar ices.          1 shall first mention the most
 material facts and considerations          which    appear   to militate
 against    the common       theory,  as  stated   by St. I'ierre ; and  I
 shall then endeavour       to explain the theory he has substituted
 (which      it has cost me tome pains to collect, abstract, and
arrange), as nearly       as possible  in  a  literal translation of his
 own language.
    IT is said that, if the moon acted by her attraction, her in
fluence must extend to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, the Cas-
               8                                                     pian,

pian, and the vast lakes of North America, in some degree
at least; but all these have no sensible tides*.                     This tran
quillity    renders     her    attraction     liable   to  suspicion ; and we
shall, perhaps,       find that the greatest part of the tides in the
ocean have nothing more than an apparent relation either to
her influence or her course.
    The phases of the moon                 do not correspond         all over the
globe with the movements of                the seas.    On our    coasts the flux      ¦
and reflux follow the moon rather than her real motion                         :  in
various places they are subject to different laws, which obliged
Newton to admit (chap. 25.) " that in the periodical return
of   the tides there must be some other mixed cause,                     hitherto
 undiscovered."
     The currents        and tides in the vicinity of the polar circle
 come from       the pole, as appears from the testimony of Fred.
 Martens,      who asserts, thatthe currents amidst the ices set in
 towards the south        ;   but adds,      that he can    state  nothing with
 certainty respecting the flux and reflux of the tides. — Voyage
 towards the North Pole, 1671.
     Henry Ellis observed that the tides in Hudson's bay came
 from the north, and were accelerated                as the  latitude increased.
  It is impossible     these tides should come from the line or the
 Atlantic. He          ascribes them to a pretended             communication
  with the South        sea.    At Waigat's       straits these north tides run
  at the rate    of eight or ten leagues an hour. He compares
  them to the fluice of a mill. — Voyage to Hudson's Bay, 1746.
      Linseotten, in 1594, made nearly the fame remarks, and
  observes that in       Waigat's      straits the water was only brackifli.
  He     fays  the   tides come from            the   east  with great velocity,
   bringing with them large islands of ice.
      W. Barents ( j 5 95 ) confirms this account.
      All these effects can be produced by nothing else than
   the effusion of ices surrounding the pole.                 These ices, which
   melt and flow with such rapidity in the northern parts of
   America and Europe about the months of July and August,
      * The Caspian      sea is about 860 miles long, and, in one place, 269
   miles broad : there aro strong currents, but no tides.
      There is no regular flux and reflux in the Baltic.
      In  some particular   spots of the Mediterranean     there is a small tide.    •
                                                                             greatly

    greatly contribute to our high equinoctial tide9 ; and whea
    these effusions cease in October, our tides begin to diminish.
        If the tides depended on the action of the fun and moon
   on the equator, they ought to be much more considerable
   towards the focus of their movements than any where else.
   But this is contrary to fact (Dampier fays). From Cape
   Blanc, from the third to 300 south lat. the flux and reflux of
   the sea does not exceed two feet.               The tides in the East
   Indies rise not above a foot;          near the poles they rise 20 or
   iS   feet.
       In  the   road    of   the island   Massafuero (3$° 46' south lat.
  8o° 22' west long.) the sea runs twelve hours north, and then
  flows back twelve hours south : its tides, therefore, run to
  wards the line. — Byron, April 1765.
      At English Creek, on the coast of New Britain (50 south
  lat. 1520 west long.) the tide has a flux and reflux once in
  S4 hours.
                — Carteret, Aug. 1767.
      At the Bay of Isles, in New Zealand (350 south             lat.), the
 tides set in from the south. — Cook, Dec. 1769.
      At Endeavour River, in New Holland, neither the flood
  nor ebb tides were considerable, excepting ouce in 24 hours.
 — June, I77°-
      At Christmas Harbour, in Kerguelen's Land,                 the flood
 came from          the south-east,     running  two knots an hour. —
 Cook, Dec. 1776.            It appears to have   been   regular and di
 urnal, i. e. a tide       of twelve hours.     The tide rises and falls
 about four feet.
      At Otahcite      the tides seldom rise more than twelve or sour-
 teen inches      ;  and it is high water nearly at noon, as well at the
 quarters     as at the   full and change of the moon. — Cook, Dec.
 1777. It       is evident, from a table of these tides for 26 days,
that there was but one tide a day;            and this, during the whole
time, was at its mean height between 11 and 1. These tides,
therefore, can have no relation to the phases of the moon.
     Let us now take a cursory view of the effects produced by
the tides in the northern          part  of the South sea.    At  the en
trance of     Nootka it is high water, on the days       of new and full

  higher. — Cool, April 1778. These semidiurnal tides differ
  from ours in taking place at the fame hour, and exhibiting no
  sensible     rise till the second or third day after the full moon :
  all which is perfectly inexplicable on the lunar hypothesis.
     These northern tides of the South sea, remarked in April,
  become, in higher latitudes, stronger in May, and still stronger
  in June ; which cannot be referred to the moon's course then
  passing into the southern hemisphere, but must be ascribed
  to the sun's course passing into the northern hemisphere, and
  proceeding, as its heat increases, to fuse the ices of the north
  pole  :   besides, the direction     of   these northern     tides  towards
  the line constitutes a complete confirmation that they derive
  their origin from the pole.
     At the entrance of Cook's River there was a strong tide
  setting out      of the inlet   at the  rate    of three or four knots an
  hour    :  higher up in the inlet, at a place four leagues broad,
  the tide ran with        prodigious violence at the rate of five knots
  an hour.        Here the marks of          a  river displayed themselves,
'the water proving considerably fresher.             — Cool, May 1778.
     What Cook calls a river, is nothing but a real northern
  sluice, through which the polar effusions arc discharged into
 the ocean,          Middleton {Voyage to Hudson's Bay, 1741 and
  1743)     found,   between lat. 65° and 66°, a considerable inlet
 running       west,    which    he calls    Wager's River j and,        after
 repeated trials of the tides for three weeks, found the flood
 constantly coming from the east.                  This is another of the
 northern sluices.
     In Karakakooa Bay, Sandwich Islands,                 the  tides are very

     At the town of St. Peter and Paul, in Kamfchatka, the
 tides are very regular every twelve hours. — Cletle, Oct. 1779.

their directions,            sometimes         eastward,      sometimes        westward,
according to the monsoons ; finally, their elevation, which
increases in proportion as we approach the poles, and di
minishes in proportion to the distances from                         it,   even between
the tropics, demonstrate that their focus     not under the       is
line.  The cause of their motions depends not on the attrac-                                ,
lion  or pressure of the fun and moon on that part of the
ocean, for their forces would undoubtedly act there with the
greatest energy,         and      in   periods as regular as the course              of   the
two luminaries.
   Why, then,            are the tides            between      the tropics      so   feeble
and     so   much        retarded       under the           direct influence of the
moon    ?
   Why       does the moon, by her attraction,                      give us two tides
every 24 hours           in the Atlantic ocean, and               produce       only one
in many          parts    of the South sea, which                   is     incomparably
broader      ?
   Why       do the tides         take place there constantly at the fame
hours, and rise to           a   regular height almost all the year round                  ?
   Why       do some rise at the quarters                   just the fame       as at the
full and change          ?
   Why       are they always stronger                  as   you approach the poles,
and frequently set           in   toward the line, contrary to the principle
of lunar impulsion           ?
   These problems, which            impossible to explain
                                             it   is      the                        by

alternate fusion of the polar ices.     r-
   Such are the most material objections adduced to invali
date the lunar theory. How far they are conclusive, sliall
be left to suture investigation.
   But St. Pierre      not content with demolishing the old
                             is
structure; he has judged proper to erect      new one; and      a
fair exposition of this system will enable us to determine,                                by a
comparison, to which we sliall give our suffrage.
   It   is   well known that Sir Isaac Newton and Casfini differed
in their opinion     respecting the figure of the earth the former         :
conceiving        it   to be an oblate spheroid, flattened                  at the poles    ;
ill'.: latter    contending            it   must be oblong, or elongated             at the
                                                                                     poles.

                    respefling   the Cause    of the Tides.               145
 poles.     To ascertain this point, some of the most celebrated
 mathematicians of Europe were appointed to determine, by-
 actual measurement, the length of a degree both at the equator
 and at the pole.       They found that       the polar degrees exceeded
 the equatorial, and concluded they must consequently               be parts
 of  a larger circle, and, of course, that the earth was flattened
 at the poles.      This was universally considered as decisive of
 the question,    till the genius of our Frenchman detected a gross
 and palpable    error in the calculation, which had escaped their
 accurate    knowledge and penetration          :  but,  as the  elongation
 of   the poles constitutes     a  leading feature in the new theory,
 I shall give it a more detailed examination.
    This polar elongation, as he conceives, is supported by
 four direct and positive proofs : — the first geometrical, upon
 which     he lays the greatest stress,        and   upon which     he has
 staked his reputation ; the 2d, atmospherical             ; the  3d, nau*
 tical  ; the 4th, astronomical       : of all which in     order.
    The    1st, or geometrical proof,        is what he calls a demotir
 stration    founded      on the     measurement       of  the earth,    and
 admitting     the    polar degrees to exceed the equatorial         :  here
 follows the demonstration          :   If you place a degree of th«
meridian at the polar circle on          a degree   of the fame meridian
 at the equator,         the first degree, which measures 57,422
fathoms, will exceed the 2d, which is 56,748 fathoms, by
 674; consequently, if you apply the arc of the meridian
contained within the polar circle, being 470, to an arc of
470 of the same meridian at the equator, it would produce
a considerable     protuberance, its degrees being greater.
    To render this more apparent, let us always suppose
that the profile of the earth, at the poles, is an arc of a
circle containing 470 ; is it not evident, if you trace a curve
on the inside of this arc,         as the academicians      do when they
flatten the earth at the poles, that it must be smaller than
the arc within which it is described, being contained in it ?
And the more this curve is flattened the smaller it becomes.
Of   consequence,      the 470 of this entire curve will be indi
vidually smaller than the 470 of the containing arc.                But as
the degrees of the polar curve exceed those of the arc of a
circle, it must follow that the whole curve i* of greater extent

be more protuberant                     :   the polar curvt,               of        consequence,             forms
a lengthened             ellipsis.           Q.'E. D.*
     It     be acknowledged that this demonstration is very
           must
perspicuous  and convincing.  How the most celebrated aca
demicians and mathematicians,                        century,   for nearly half                      a
could have overlooked a proposition so plain and simple, can
only be ascribed, in the opinion of St. Pierre, to their ob
stinate and inveterate prejudices. He pursues his victory in a
strain of vain and indecent exultation, which would dishonour
a more respectable cause ; but, perhaps, a little attention will
induce us to doubt at least whether the charge of gross igno
rance may not, with justice, be retorted on their accuser.
     It would           have   extraordinary, if men of sci
                                  been           indeed
ence had been absurd enough to imagine that a larger arc
might be included in a less ; but they might suppose, with
propriety and justice, that the smaller arc of a larger circle
can be included in the larger arc of                                      a smaller             circle, which,
in     the present instance, appears to be the cafe. In measuring
a degree     on the meridian, a certain spot is fixed upon, where
the elevation of the polar star is taken by a quadrant ; from
this spot they proceed in a direct line north, till the quadrant
indicates an additional elevation of one degree.      In propor^
}jon as this degree                       constitutes          a part       of        a    larger         or smaller

  VIII.    Account of a new Operation lately performed with Suc
     cess   in France, for restoring Sight in certain Cafes of
     Blindness.       By C. DeMours.
  V>. DEMOURS,               who performed this new and inge
 nious operation, presented a memoir on the subject to the
 National Institute, which was read on the 15th of June lasts.
 From this memoir the present account has been extracted.
    Thp fyp is a ball or globe filled with different transparent
 humours, which are contained in several membranes. The
  outermost of these membranes is called the cornea ; it is
 transparent, and placed before the iris, which is the coloured
 part of the eye, and which itself forms a second membrane;
 but the latter is not transparent, and would prevent the rays
 of light from penetrating to the hind part of the globe of
 the eye, were it not pierced with a round hole, called the
 pupil.      A  little beyond this hole is the crystalline humour,
 foiming a kind of lens, through which the rays of light are
 obliged to pass ; and by means of which they form distinct
 images     on the retina at the bottom of the eye.     The humour
 contained in the inside of the globe is called the vitreous hu
 mour; it is perfectly transparent, as is also the aqueous hu
 mour, which is placed between the transparent cornea and thfr
crystalline.
    C.    Sauvages, on whom C. Deniours performed the opera
 tion which is the subject of this article, had for several
 years an abscess      in the cornea, in consequence of which the
 aqueous      humour was entirely wasted,       and the  transparent
part of      the cornea had become      totally white and opake in
the right eye, and for about four-fifths in the left eye.        This
eye     is  represented    in  the  annexed    engraving   (Plate V.
fig. 5). The transparent cornea, C, suffers to be seen to
wards the upper part but a small portion of the iris.            The
white spot covers entirely the round hole or pupil, which
exists in the centre of the iris, and through which alone the
rays of light can pass.
    C. Demours, taking advantage of the transparency which
ftill existed towards the upper part of the cornea, made there
at small aperture,      denoted by the letter A j and having in
                                                            troduced

            Cultivation and Use of                    the   Syrian Sili-plant.                       i 49
troduced into that aperture a delicate pair of scissors, made
a small hole in the iris, of the size of a feed of sorrel, indi
cated in the engraving by the letter                             D.
   Through this hole, made in a non-transparent mem
brane, the rays of light now enter, and form images on the
retina at the bottom of the eye. It    therefore, an artificial  is,
pupil which supplies the place of that covered      the white                        by
spot of the cornea.   But as behind this new pupil there                                                 is
no crystalline humour to collect the                                    rays      with    sufficient
accuracy on the retina, C. Sauvages                                is   obliged, in order to
read,      to make use            of   a   very convex           glass,      such as      is   used      by
persons      who have undergone an operation for the cataract,
and       who have lost the crystalline humour.  He does not
employ the glass, however, except in cafes which require
more distinct vision and he still possesses the invaluable ad
                                  ;
vantage of seeing well enough to direct his way, and                                                     to
discern perfectly every object around him.  By means                                                     of
this ingenious operation,   fight in future may be restored to
the greater part of those who have lost that faculty        large                              by
spots or white scars, cafes hitherto considered as incurable;
provided that some part of the cornea, opposite to the iris, has
remained transparent.

at a man's singer,            is straight, round, and smooth,              and beset
with     oval leaves     of   considerable   size,    covered on          the   upper
side with             and on the lower fide with whitish
                dark green,
down.    The plant has a milky juice, which is said to be
perfectly harmless.  The flowers appear about the end of
May,      and    continue till the month of            July;    there are often
from twelve to sixteen on one stem, each of which forms a
bunch, containing from thirty to forty single flowers, Each
single    flower adheres to the bunch by a long thin stalk, and
has a     sweetish odour.  Each bunch of flowers is succeeded
by three, four, and sometimes ten long, flat, and rough
pods, which inclose several round, yellowish brown, flat
and thin seeds wrapped up in a beautiful shining white kind
of silk. The seeds are winged ; a form which nature has
given with great variety to many others, in order that they
may be conveyed with more ease, and to a greater distance,
by the wind.
   II. Uses.
             — ist, The silk, which covers the feeds in the
pods, is the principal part of use, and that from which the
whole plant takes its name. The pods gradually acquire
maturity from August to the beginning of October, at
which time those who cultivate this plant must watch with
great care for the period          of their bursting, in order             to collect
the silk, lest it should          be carried away by the wind,                  or be
spoilt by the rain.  The pods when collected are spread out}
to the height of about half a soot, on a net or rack, in an
airy place, in order to dry.
   The silk, which is of a shining white colouf, from an inch
to an inch and a half in length, and exceedingly elastic,
is then taken out, and being freed from the feeds is hung up
in thin  bags in the fun, in order that it mav become per
fectly dry ; and at the fame time it is often softened with
the hand, or by being beat.  This vegetable silk may now be
used, without any further preparation, instead of feathers and
horse-hair,       for beds,  cushions, coverlets to beds, bolsters,
and mattresses.         From eight to nine pounds of     which oc   it,
cupy the        space   of from    five   to fix cubic feet,        will    be suffi
cient for   a   coverlet, bed, and two pillows         ;   such beds therefore
are exceedingly convenient for travelling.                     It   is    not advise-

able,   however, to use              this silk in common for beds instead
of   feathers,     as it is too soft and warm.                 It   requires as little
preparation for quilts and counterpanes, and is lighter and
warmer than those of common silk.
   For spinning, however, notwithstanding its fineness, which
approaches   near to that of common silk, it is not fit when
taken alone, as it is almost too short, and therefore must be
used with an addition of flax, wool, or common silk, but par
ticularly of cotton. One-third of this silk with two-thirds of
cotton forms               mixture for gloves, stockings, and
                    a very good
caps. Other mixtures may be used for different kinds of stuffs ;
but it has been observed that the cloth is much stronger when
the vegetable silk is employed for the woof rather than for the
warp.   Many colours have been applied to such cloth with
great success, but as each substance requires a peculiar mode
of treatment, more experiments on this                       subject are necessary:
a mixture     of one-third           vegetable silk, and two-thirds            of hare's
down,  forms hats exceedingly light, and soft to the touch,
which have a great resemblance to beaver hats, and are much
 cheaper.
   2d, As soon         as the pods           have     been collected, the stems,
 which contain         a fibrous part capable               of being   spun,    must be
 cut before they become dry or suffer from the night frosts.
 They  must then be immersed for some days in water, like flax
 or hemp, and then dried by being spread out on the grass.
 Care, however, must be taken                       to ascertain,by experiments,
 the proper length of time,                  as too   much or too little would be
 prejudicial.  In the last cafe the flaxy part is brittle, and in
 the former it loses its strength. After it has been watered it
 is beaten and heckled  for beating it various kinds of ma
                                     :
 chinery have been invented, and for bruising the stems parti
 cular mills are used.
     A mixture       of   the threads spun from the flax                of   these stems
  with     the vegetable                       a kind of cloth
                               silk and cotton, produces
  very proper for furniture,  It has been however employed
  chiefly, with and without an addition of rags, for making all
  kinds of writing and packing paper; which sometimes                                      is.
  similar     to the      Chinese paper,              and    sometimes       exceeds     in
  strength       the usual paper           made from rags,
  .,***-                                                                       3d, Both

        3d, Both the inner white (kin, and the external green hulk
     of the capsules, which contain the feeds, might be employed
     for manufacturing the finer forts of this silk paper.
        4th, That as little as possible of this plant should remain
     useless, Nature has provided        in   the sweet juice  of its flowers
     excellent nourishment for bees.             According to the author of
-
     Geschicbte  MAner      Bienen,    this    plant, in the above respect,
     the lime-tree excepted, is superior to all other vegetable pro
     ductions.
        In America a kind of brown sugar is prepared from the
   juice of these flowers.
        The great utility of this plant        has been known only within
    these thirty years,     though    it  is   probable that it was intro
    duced into Europe about the time of the crusades.                 A ma
    nufactory   of articles   from   the   silk of this plant has been   esta
    blished at Paris since 1760, and it has long been employed at
    Lausanne, with advantage, for making candle-wicks ; but no
    one has shown more zeal in regard to the cultivation and
    preparation of this article than Mr. Schneider of Licgnitz,
    who has recommended            it in two different pamphlets.           In.
    regard to the application      of it  to paper-making,      Mr. Schmid
   of Lunenburg has made a variety of experiments ; and it is
   much to be wished that others would imitate his example.
       III. Cultivation. — This plant is propagated two ways,
   either by the feed or by flips. In the month of March, after
   the land has been well dug, the feeds are sown thin, and
   singly, in furrows of the depth of an inch, and covered with
   earth, which is thrown over them to the depth of half an
   inch : thev are secured also from the night frost by moss or a
   little light dung.      In from four to six weeks the young plants
  begin to appear.         The first year they produce flowers, but do
  not bear feeds till the second, and do not come to full ma
  turity till the third.       In the third year they are transplanted.
  But this    method    is more laborious, and perhaps ought not to
  be recommended          but in particular cafes, such as when the
  roots have degenerated, or when they are transplanted to a
  different climate.
       The object will be sooner accomplished by flips from the
  roots.     As the plant throws out around it long roots with
                                                                        new

                      if the  Syrian Silk-Plant.                     153
hew eyes, these must be lopped off from the old stock either
 in autumn, when the milky juice in the plant has dried up,
or in the spring, before it again flows 5 and are to be cut into
pieces   of from four   to six inches in length,      but care must be
taken     that  they have a sufficient      number of eyes.      Afresh
incision     must be made     in   the  root before and behind,      and
they are then to be planted in the ground, to the depth
of four or five inches, in an oblique position, with the eyes
or buds standing upright.            Those planted in autumn will
produce seeds the next summer, and those planted in spring
will bear the second summer.
    In  regard to the further cafe which this plant requires, the
following observations deserve attention : — It thrives in al
most every kind of foil, and even the most stonv, without all
further care : but, in order to be brought to perfection, it re
quires   a tender   sandy foil  ;  which,   however,   must not be too
poor and dry, and which ought to have as much fun as pos
sible.     In such foil, when properly nurtured, it produces the
longest, finest, and most beautiful silk.
   The ground,      before it is planted, must be dug up to a good
depth, and well dunged.           It must also be well    weeded,    and
kept exceedingly clean.         After the crop has been collected,
the   stems    must   be cut close to the ground;       and the plants
which     have died must be replaced       by young ones.       Towards
winter they must be covered with a little dung, which ought
to be spread in the spring.           A sufficient space also must be
left between the plants. They ought to be planted in rows,
and at the distance of one foot and a half, or rather two feet,
from each other.
   Of    the   stems' which     shoot    up, only   the  best (perhaps
about one half) stiould be left standing ; the rest, as soon as
the flowers appear, should be cut, and placed in sand or
earth, to dry up the milky juice that flows from them. Even
of  the prime plants, it will be proper to suffer four or five          of
the lowest bunches       of flowers    to come to maturity.       By fol
lowing      these cautions, the filk obtained     will be  of a  superior
quality;      The increase is very great.      In the year 1785, Mr,
 Schneider began with six plants, and in 1793 na(^ a planta
tion which contained 30,000. The first crop produced eight,

                         the crop has been   be thrown  toge
ther in heaps to rot, they form an excellent manure for fu
ture use.  In regard to the preparation of the silk, little is
necessary to be said.                     It   may easily     be conceived       that it     will
be    of      advantage           to separate that which               is long       from the
shorter part,            in order that the former may be employed for
spinning.           The      shorter kind may be used for beds and for
hat-making.
     This plant may                    be employed      also in      the manufactory           of
paper.          Schmid, an ingenious paper-maker near Lunenburg,-
has made several experiments with the capsules       of this plant,
which gave the following results :

with one-third of rags, he obtained writing-paper                                       pretty
white, of         a     good quality,           and similar to the silk paper           of   the
Chinese.

coloured paper,              which, when sized, was stronger than paper
made       of    rags   :   itwas almost as close in its texture as parch

netrate       through            it.     This kind       was exceedingly proper for
wrapping-paper.

could scarcely be distinguished.

        of phosphorised hydrogen gas. No chemist before
discovery
him had observed an elastic fluid which, like the one here
spoken os, possesses the singular property of inflaming    the                          by
contact of the air alone, without requiring its temperature to^
be raised, or an ignited body to be presented to it.

                                            and
which this gas gives birth ; when made to burn bubble by
bubble in a place where the air is perfectly calm; the splen
dour and   magnificence wliich accompany its combustion
when effected in oxygen gas perfectly pure; the sudden pe
netration of these two gases, and their total conversion into
water aud phosphoric acid;                  such were the only facts known
•which     had been interesting to chemistsin the history of phos-
phorised hydrogen gas,     when  I endeavoured   to discover whe
ther this elastic fluid did not possess other properties, which,
if   they did not exhibit so brilliant              a spectacle    as    the greater
part of those above alluded to,                 might be worthy of engaging
the attention of chemists.
     The property, long known, which sulphur communicates
to hydrogen,   and hydrogen reciprocally to sulphur, of being
able to dissolve together        in water, while both taken separately
are perfectly insoluble,         had already given me reason to            think
that the        might be the same with the
             case                                                 combination of
phosphorus and    hydrogen; and that these two substances,
being previously united, might perhaps then become sus
ceptible os partaking in the liquidity of water, and commu
nicate to it new properties nearly analogous to thole possessed
by that solution of sulphurated hydrogen gas known under
the name of hcfatifed water.
     To   destroy or confirm this supposition,             I
                                              took a glass bot
tle, and, having silled it with newly distilled water, inverted
it on the slielf of a pneumatic tub, in order that I might in
troduce into it phosphoriled hydrogen gas arising from the
decomposition of water by a mixture made with phosphorus
and fresti-staked lime. When the bottle was half filled with
phosphorised        hydrogen gas        I   removed it from the tub, taking
care to shut very closely its aperture with my singer, while                         I
shook it with force in order                to effect more speedily an union
of the gas with the water, in               the fame manner as the solution
of carbonic acid gas, as well as that of sulphurated hydrogen
gas, is facilitated by making use of the same means.
   I soon perceived, by the strong adhesion of my finger to
the mouth of the bottle, that a considerable vacuum had been
effected    in   it,   and perhaps, even, that the whole                of   the phos-
                                            X   %                             phorised

l$6                       New     Properties   discovered tit
phorised      hydrogen gas in it had participated in the liquidity
of   the water.
     I   then removed my finger, but not without some difficulty,
from the mouth of the bottle,                    that       I might          examine     more
accurately the nature and properties                   of   the liquid it contained,
and to ascertain whether there did not yet remain some por
tions of the gas susceptible of inflammation by the contact of
the air. But, scarcely was the communication established
between        the atmosphere the inside of the bottle, when
                                      and
a loud detonation took place, accompanied with a very bril
liant light. I readily judged from this phenomenon, that
the whole of the phosphorised hydrogen gas had not been
absorbed by the water contained in the bottle ; on which ac
count I closed the aperture, in order to prevent the combus
tion from being longer continued; which would not have
failed to produce           a considerable      quantity of phosphoric acid,
and consequently            to occasion      great uncertainty in regard tq
the results which           I   wished   to obtain.
     The      bottle     having been        closely     stopped,         I    continued      tq
shake        it several times, under an idea that                    I   should by these
means be able to    entirely the last portions of the phos
                            six
phorised hydrogen gas which had remained undissolved.
  Hoping that I had succeeded, and impatient to know the
new properties which the water saturated with the gas might
have acquired, I determined to unstop the bottle a second
time in contact with the air. This was soon followed by a
second detonation, stronger, indeed, than the former. After
this     I did not think of stopping           the aperture              of   the bottle, so
that     a   flame exceedingly pale continued for some minutes                               to,
issue from it.
     When I       observed no more apparent                      signs of combustion,
I examined             by the smell and        taste    the       liquor remaining in
the bottle.            Its smell appeared       to me exceedingly disagree
able, and altogether diflerent from that of gaseous phospho
rised hydrogen; its taste, though very bitter, had in   how                           it,
ever, something insipid and disgusting;                           and its colour was          a
little inclining to that of lemon.
     When       tried with tincture       of turnfol        it   soon made       it    sensibly
red, which       I      ascribed to the small portion               of phosphoric acid
                                                                                        which

                      phospbor'ifed    Hydrogen Gas.                  l$^
ivhich      must    have been produced       at the moment when the
detonations took place, as well as during the disengagement
pf   the flame which followed the second detonation.
     I was then obliged to begin a new operation, that is to fay,
to dissolve phosphorised hydrogen gas again in water, that I
might ascertain, by employing more caution, in what accu
rate proportions this solution might be effected; and that I
might prevent combustion also from taking place in the in
 side of the bottle, which would have become a source of error
in the conclusion of my experiments.
     I  had ascertained      with certainty, by means of the quantity
 of  water and gas which I had tried to dissolve the first time,
 as well as by the detonations which had taken place at the
 moment when the bottle was unstopped, that distilled water
 could not dissolve at the temperature of 47° a volume of
 phosphorised        hydrogen gas equal to its own.           I took care,
 therefore, to introduce into the bottle the second time only
 about a third of its capacity of the gas.              I then repeatedly
 shook the mixture in order to render             the   union of the gas
 with      the water speedier,     and    as complete as possible; aster
 which       I unstopped    the bottle, holding    it inverted in a small
 tub, which         I had filled with newly distilled water, that I
 might       see  whether it would become entirely filled with it
 merely by the effect of the pressure of the atmosphere, and
 that I might thence judge whether the whole gas had been
  liquefied.
      I  indeed saw a portion      of the water in the tub ascend into
  the bottle,     but  I perceived also that it was not entirely filled;
  which confirmed me in the opinion that there still remained a
  portion of the gas which had not participated in the liquidity
  of the water. Having then tried to make some bubbles of it
  issue out through this liquid, these bubbles inflamed fponta-
  taneously      by the contact of the air alone; which proved to
  me    that   the phosphorised hydrogen gas had not been decom
  posed at all by agitation, nor by its contact with distilled
   water;.     whereas   it soon loses  its highly combustible property
   when collected in bottles filled with water which has not been
   distilled, or distilled water which has been long kept, which
   I ascribe to the quantity of air which common water always
                                                                     holds

 l$S                         New Properties              discovered      in
holds in solution, the oxygen of which, joining a portion
of the phosphorus, effects its separation from the hydrogen by
converting it into phosphorous oxyd, which being altogether
insoluble, deposits itself on the sides of the vessel, without any
appearance in this kind of oxydation of any sensible sign of
combustion ; while the oxygen of the atmospheric air, which
participates in the liquidity of the water, being always in that
cafe deprived of a large portion of the light and caloric which
are combined with it in its aerial aggregation, cannot pro
duce these two effects in a very sensible manner when it
passes       in this    state     of liquid        aggregation         from one combina
tion to another.
    Having         again agitated the bottle after closing the mouth                            of
it, I    was able,         by   means    of   the small quantity of water which
had been introduced into'                 it,    of which
                                                   and        kept an exact

account, to render the                 absorption of the last portions of the
gas complete; for, having    second time uncorked the bottle

                     may affirm, therefore, from these trials,
                           I

                                      I

a   little   less than       the fourth       of   its volume          of phofphorised      hy
drogen gas, and that with this dose         completely saturated.

   This solution thus prepared, and kept free from the con
tact of the air, always exhibited the following properties                                 :

    When examined in                  the dark, this solution does not appear

    When brought~into contact with atmospheric air, this

 inflammation,       except when brought into contact with a
 body in a state of ignition.         If the solution be long exposed
 to  the   air, and     if  the points    of contact     be frequently re
newed      by agitation, it becomes completely decomposed ;
that is to fay, is entirely resolved into phosphorus, oxyd, and
pure hydrogen gas.

change in their colour            from being      in  contact   with  liquid
phosohorised      hydrogen ;       which proves that this liquor is
neither acid nor alkaline.
    The sulphuric      and   nitric acids, or   the simple or oxygenated
muriatic,      when poured over this liquor, produce no effect
worthy     of  notice.

    The    oxyds  of mercury       and lead are speedily      reduced,   and
Immediately converted into metallic phosphurets, by being
mixed, with the solution of phosphorised hydrogen gas.
    When      poured into nitrat      of  silver,   this solution immedi
ately produces     a very    abundant black precipitate, which does
not in the least change its colour, and which, when tried

tallic phosphurets.
    When brought into contact with                 a solution   of mercury
by nitric acid, it gives also immediately a very considerable
precipitate, which has first a black colour, but which be
comes white and crystallised in proportion as it passes from
the   state of phosphuret to that of mercurial phosphat, by
Imbibing oxygen, either from the nitric acid in which the
precipitation takes place, or from                  the   atmospheric     air
with which it is in contact.
    A   solution of lead by the nitric acid is also decomposed

solutions of silver and mercury are. There is formed in this"
decomposition also phosphuret                               of   lead,      which in       the course
of time is converted into                       a phosphat.
  The sulphat of copper                     shows also,               at the end      of    a certain"
time,             abundant black precipitate when poured into
            a pretty
a    solution of phosphoril'ed hydrogen.  This precipitate, like
that obtained by the decomposition of nitrat of silver, re
tains its colour; which may give us reason to believe that
it   can be converted  only with difficulty into a phosphat.
.     Sulphat of iron did not appear to me to experience                                           any
sensible decomposition                   till    the end         of   several days.        Nitrat of
arsenic,          poured into this liquid,                  did not experience           any sen
sible decomposition               till   the end            of   several     days.     There was
then formed a precipitate                         of   a very beautiful yellow colour
under the form of small grains, and which could remain a
long time exposed to the air without experiencing any kind
of change.               This   precipitate         was an arsenical
                                                 phosphuret.

this gas can unite itself to distilled water, in the proportion'
of    about a fourth          of its volume, when the solution is ef

meter*,             ad,    That this ga9 communicates to the water in
which it           is dissolved     a strong            disagreeable          odour,       as   well   as
a bitter taste, which may one day make it be employed with
success in the treatment of many diseases, either on account
of      facility with which this preparation suffers itself to
      the
be decomposed,      or of the part performed by the phosphorus
it contains  in the  formation of animal matters. 3d, That
when water well freed from air has been employed to liquefy
this gas, and when care has been taken to keep it thus dis->
solved           well corked, it mav be preserved a long
                 in bottles
time without experiencing decomposition, so that by heating
the solution you may extract from       in the state of gas,          it,

Ihe water has thus been freed from all the phosphorised hy
drogen it had dissolved, it becomes pure water; which
proves that it was indebted for its new properties             to the pre
sence    of this   gas alone.      5th,   In  the last place,    that this
solution is capable of speedily reducing several metallic oxyds,
whether alone         or dissolved by acidsj and of forming with
them, by means of double electrive attraction, water and me
tallic phosphurets, combinations which hitherto have been
obtained only in the dry way ; that is to fay, by heating
metals with phosphorus, or by decomposing phosphoric glass
 or metallic phosphats by           metals and      charcoal.    Such are
 the    properties   which appear to me sufficiently interesting to
 be worthy      of being     added   to the still    imperfect history of
 phosphorised      hydrogen gas.
 XI.     On the general        Nature of Light.        By Mr.    Robert
               Heron.         Communicated     by the  Author,
   \.    HROUGH the medium of the Philosophical Maga
 zine I beg leave to lay before men of science the following
 opinions, which hive lately suggested themselves to me as
 necessary and fair inductions from those facts that have come
 to my knowledge respecting           light.
     1.  Light   passes  only through the vacuities in other bodies;
 does not penetrate their solid substance, so as ever to coexist
 with it in the fame place.
     2. It passes through those vacuities in straight perpendi
 cular lines, without         any loss of its qualities by attenuation
  and    subdivision    of its particles : or, it is refracted from the
  perpendicular with       a subdivision   of  its particles, by which its
 qualities are altered : or, its passage           is wholly interrupted,
  and it is either reflected or absorbed.
     3. Since general attraction acts in bodies in the proportion
  of their masses      and aggregation ; since the more the affinity
  of aggregation      is in any bodies destroyed, so much the more
  readily   and    powerfully do the chemical affinities of com
  position    act upon them;       since the extreme      tenuity of light,

  \6%                 On the general Kalure         of Light.
  the subtilest       of all    visible   substances,   renders    it infinitely
  sensible,    equally to the general attractive force and to the
  chemical affinities of other bodies approaching it : — for these
  reasons, the fame general and chemical affinities, which pro
  duce the other changes            on material bodies, must appear suf
 ficient to occasion the different phænomena which light pre
 sents in its various transitions.
     4<   The     true    primitive colour of light, when unmixed
 with other substances, when its particles exist together in
 their natural arrangement and aggregation, when the at
 tractions of other bodies for it act not              so as to scatter   or de
 compose       its parts, is white.
     5. Its colours and its peculiar action on the optic nerve
 depend on the peculiar forms of its elementary particles, on
 their peculiar aggregation, on their mechanical and chemical
 qualities, on the modes of its diffusion.
     6. It passes •without alteration or deflexion             through trans
 parent bddics       in which      the absolute vacancies       are sufficiently
 numerous to receive             its   rays,  in which     the dispositiori    of
 these vacancies        is perpendicular       to the direction    of  the rays,
 and    in which      the    attractions of the body for the light are
 not   so strong     as to act   on the rays with a dissolving or a de
 composing force.
     7.   It is refracted, when           the vacuities    in  the bodies     on
which it falls        are not disposed throughout the transparent
medium perpendicularly to the direction of the rays; and
when the attractions, chemical and mechanical, of the
parts of that medium are, in respect to light, so powerful as
to occasion either a tendency to the carrying of the ray into
new combination,             which shall alter its aggregation, or even
a   partial fixation of it in some new compound.
    8. It is reflected when it falls on surfaces which present
no rectilinear         vacancies,       none but      such    as   are   curves,
through which           its rays cannot pass; and when, at the fame
time,      those    surfaces have, no affinities for its particles of
sufficient .strength to attract these particles into their own
composition.          When these circumstances concur in their
utmost power the reflexion is complete, and all the falling
rays     are   returned from the surface;            but the     required cir-
                 8                                                 cumstanecs

                   On   the  general Nature of Light.                   163
cumstanccs seldom do          so  fully concur.      In  most cases  of the
 reflexion of light, there is a portion of the falling light either
transmitted    or absorbed.
    9. Light is absorbed in the bodies on which it falls, when
their attractions fix it in new compounds with their parts ;
or when they present a medium in which it may be for a
time suspended,        though        not carried into      actual   combi
nation.
    10.  As  the primitive       colour of light depends, in a great
measure, on the conformation and the relative arrangement
of its particles, so the other colours which it assumes in re
fraction depend      likewise on changes           in the arrangement of
those particles     which      vary the effect     of their conformation.
While the particles remain in the fame arrangement the
colour is the fame ; and their elementary conformation, and
the law of movement to which they are subject, continue
their   illuminating      effect    to the eye till   they are lost by ex
treme    diffusion, by absorption, or perhaps by entire decom
position.
    The permanent colours of the surfaces of bodies depend
on the fame laws as the colours of the rays of light.                  The
 conformation and the arrangement of the extreme elementary
particles at the surfaces of all bodies determine, respectively,
their different colours.         White surfaces, for instance, have
one conformation and arrangement of the minutest par
ticles at their extremities       :   blue surfaces   have   another con
formation and arrangement of the fame particles : red sur
faces another, &c. &c.            These extreme particles of the sur
faces   of bodies do not constitute          light, because they are not
unconsihed and in motion,             have not its peculiar rectilinear
elasticity, possess not its chemical affinities ; but when
light is thrown upon them, they become visible, each set of
particles under a different colour, just as its conformation
and arrangement are different.                The extreme particles of
Hue surfaces have the fame conformation                 and   arrangement
as the    particles of light in        a blue  ray;  and so   of other  co
lours.

XII.    Some Account    of Frederick
                                             Augustus Eschen,
   fi'bo was swallowed up in a Pijsure of             the  Snow in   the-
    Glacier of Bud *.
JL Eederick          Augustus Eschen              was born in 1777,
at  Eutin, in    the  circle of Lower Saxony, where his father
enjoyed a public office, which gave him an opportunity of
having frequent intercourse with the archbishop of Lubec,
his sovereign, bv whom he was highly esteemed. The prince
stood godfather to this son, and invested him with the ca-
nonicate.      Being the eldest of a numerous family, young
Eschen was destined for the study of jurisprudence, with a
view that he might be fitted for holding some public employ
ment; but his father did not confine his education merely to
those branches of knowledge necessary for that line. He was
instructed in the sciences and the fine arts ; and, being early
familiarised with both, he applied to them with unabated
ardour, and made such a rapid progress as attracted the at
tention of some of the most celebrated men of Germany,
among whom was Vofs, who li\ed in the fame village, and
was an intimate friend of his father.              Young Eschen      was
particularly noticed also by Count Stolberg, well known by
 his translation of Plato's Dialogues and his Travels through
 Swisserland    and Italy.
    At   the age   of twenty, young Eschen         quitted  his father's
 house, and repaired      to the university   of  Jena, where    he ap
 plied chiefly to philosophy and jurisprudence; the former of
 which he studied under Fichte, the disciple and rival of the
 celebrated    Kant; and the latter under Professor Hufcland, a
 man as much distinguished bv his private virtues as by his
 talents and learning.       Natural hillory and philosophy occu
 pied  also  some  part  of  his  attention ; nor did he neglect po
 etry, to which he had a strong natural propensity.           He trans
 lated, several pieces from the Greek and Latin languages,
 which were almost as familiar to him as his own, and to
 which     he had    added almost all those    of Europe.      He pub-

Jished       also various    specimens of original poetry, many of
which,         of   the  Idyl kind, met with the approbation of
Schiller and Goethe, the former of whom inserted one of
them in the Almanac of the Muses, of which he is the
editor.         Another of them, entitled Die Lehre der Bescbie-
denheit, The Lesson of Modesty, deserves to be known on
 account of the ingenious manner in which the author treats
 a trifling subject little susceptible of poetical ornaments.
 Eschen wrote also several          essays and dissertations  on different
 points of antient literature, which appeared              in some of the
 German journals, and which procured him an acquaintance
 with several men of eminence in the republic of letters.                It
 is no little recommendation of Eschen's character, than we
  can mention among these Schlegel and             Humboldt.
       In   the spring   of the year 1798, Eschen undertook a journey
  to Swisserland       in order to superintend the education of a young
  man, chiefly with a view that he might improve his own ;
  and for that purpose settled at Berne, where one of his coun
  trymen had been before engaged in the fame occupation.
  Others soon followed him ; and some young inhabitants of
  Berne, who had been the companions of his studies at the
   university, joined themselves to the circle of his friends.           In
   the enjoyment of their company, with the charms of friend
   ship and study, though amidst the storms of the revolution,
   he saw two years         glide away in peace, and distinguished by
   labours which might have done honour to a longer life. His
   translation of the Odes of Horace           had just appeared a little
   before      the fatal event which snatched him from letters and
   from        his  friends.     This production     may be reproached
    with containing         too many Latinisms      and   bold  expressions
    little suited to the genius      of the German language ; but with
    all   these   faults it will still remain a clastic work worthy of
     being ranked among the real treasures of German literature,
     and which ought to have inspired the greatest hopes of a
     young man, who, at twenty-three years of age, could ven
     ture to undertake a task so difficult.
         The unfortunate       catastrophe  which   terminated the life of
     this interesting young man has been already detailed in this
                                                                   journal.

 end of July, this year, Efchen undertook, in company with
M.    Theodore Ziemssen  his friend and countryman, a tour
to the borders         of
                      lake of Geneva and the valley of Cha-

behind the village of Servoz, celebrated by the experiments
made there by De Luc and Saussure, and which commands a
view of the country round Mount-Blanc. They were just on
the point of reaching the summit, and nothing seemed to
announce that any danger was to be apprehended ; Efchen
was walking forwards in high spirits before his friend and
their guide, when, all of a sudden, his two companions lost
fight of him.  A thin crust of snow, which covered a deep
fiflure,   had given way under his feet,                and he fell into the
abyss ; where he perished as already related.
XIII.   On the Discovery of that Salt known under the Name
   of Seignette's Salt (Tartrite of Soda). By ProfeJJhr Beck-
   man     \.
 J.   HIS       neutral salt, which consists of the mineral alkali
(soda) and the acid of wine-stone (tartareous acid), was pre
pared and made known by a Frenchman named Peter Seig-
nette, towards the end of the last century.                       The confidence
with which the inventor recommended                     it, it,
                                                                  and the care he
took to conceal the method of making       had, as   usual,               is
such an effect:, that  was employed in preference to many
                              it
other medicines, long known, which had been equally ser
viceable   ;    and    by   these means he was enabled,            without much
trouble, to acquire         a    fortune.
                                    must, however, be allowed
                                            It
that he was    skilful chemist, who,
                 a                                by
                                          his writings and the
invention of various other medicines, had obtained consider
able reputation as     physician and naturalist.
                            a                     He was esta
blished    as    an apothecary         at   Rochellc;   published        papers on
various natural objects which he had observed his neigh-            in
bourho<xl, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences at
Paris, as well as           in    other works, and died on the             nth of
                                                                           March

                 On the Discovery       of Selgnette'    s Salt.             167
 March     17 19*.      He   recommended         this salt, which enriched
 him and rendered        his name famous, in some small                 treatises
 printed, in particular, about the year 1672.                      He called it
 sometimes     alkaline salt, sometimesyiz/ polycbrefl, and some
 times Rochelle salt.         After his death, his son continued to
 prepare and to vend        it with  the greatest success.
     Manufacturers      and mechanics have been often reproached
 with the jealousy which they entertain of literary men ; but,
 in my opinion, the latter are the cause of it. It must indeed
 be confessed, though        humiliating for human knowledge, that
 the most useful discoveries have            at first presented     themselves
 to    the  former,      while    engaged      in   the   various operations
 which     their employments require;              but their merit consists
 principally in remarking and following phænomena till they
 produce from them something useful.                   If they are so fortu
 nate as to succeed,       they keep their discoveries secret in order
 that they may enjoy a monopoly of them ; but no sooner has
 the man of letters heard of a new discovery than he wislies
 to have a (hare in the honour           of making it known;             and his
 zeal in this respect is proportioned to its importance                 and the
 care with which it is concealed           ;  because, in general, he can
gain only by rendering it public.               The man of       letters, how
 ever, has a great advantage           over    the mechanic or manufac

shows how they may be applied in various cafes of which
the artist or manufacturer never had an idea*. If, by this
conduct,             he lessen the merit               of one, he on the other hand
points out employment to                             many; and gives rife to establish
ments in which thousands                              participate,            and      by which          they
acquire riches.
    Thus Seignette                       discovered         sal       polychrest while             he        was
engaged  in making                        soluble     tartar          (tartrite of potash), and,
according to the old opinion, imagining that both the fixed
alkalis were the fame, used soda instead of the alkali of tartar
(potash).    By these means he procured, not without surprise,
a salt different from the common soluble tartar, which he
wished to prepare, and from the other well known salt also.
He       was induced therefore, to examine it ; and having found
it to be a new laxative, he recommended it and became rich.
The experiments of learned chemists discovered the compo
nent parts of this salt; the mode of preparing it was then
made publicly known ; and, by more accurate examination,
the difference, before                          overlooked,              between         vegetable           and
mineral              alkalis       was        determined          :   by which new light                     was
thrown upon chemistry, and an important                                               service    rendered
to a variety               of    arts.
   Among those who contributed to bring this salt into re
pute was Nicholas Lemery, to whom Seignette sent a large
quantity of   which he distributed at Paris, though unac
                           it,
quainted with its component parts     Its composition was             J.

of pit-coals,      I  have  reason  to believe that they contain a
small portion      of succinic acid. The collected products from
30   Ib. of  pit-coal afforded me about one dram of a particular
salt, which, by it's smell, indicated the presence of that
 acid.
    But what more particularly arrested my attention in the
analyses    of pit-coal was a very peculiar combination of some
of the carbonaceous matter with a portion of sulphur, and
where pyrites was not present.             A coal in the vicinity of
Almaden,       in Estremadura, which contains no pyrites, yields
very white ashes, and from which no sulphur can be ob
tained by distillation, exhibits, however, as it passes from
incandescence to incineration, proofs of containing sulphur,
which, becoming           oxydated   along with the coal, makes it
sensible to the smell.       A  peculiar carburet of sulphur there
fore exists in this coal      ; but combustion is necessary to its
decomposition. Exposed to the greatest heat, this coal neither
discolours silver, nor affects iron in the forge.
    This singular phænomenon,              happily    perhaps    for  the
arts, is one of the causes which        so  beneficially retard or pro
long the combustion of pit-coal.               Phosphorus combined
with charcoal is much less combustible than when alone :
neither the contact of atmospheric air, nor even the com
bined action of alkalis and water, is sufficient to sepa
rate phosphorus from its combination with carbon.                   From
the difficulty with which the carbonaceous portion of ani
mal substances is burnt, the fame inference may be drawn
respecting sulphur ; for sulphur is known to exist in a con
siderable proportion in animal substances.              Wool, unques
tionably,    contains    much   sulphur,   but none    passes over when
that matter is distilled.      Where then can it remain, if not in
union with        the   carbonaceous residuum       ?    That residuum
fliould be examined with a view to this point.              One thing is
certain, that soap of wool, prepared in a silver vessel, deeply
sulphurate* its interior surface.

   Professor   of Medicine in tin University of Turin,           on  Animal

   1   HE    electric phenomenon which you observed in my
electrometer, placed on the back of a diseased animal at the
moment of its being attacked by a fit of shivering, appears
to me to be a necessary consequence of the general theory
of electricity, and of the modifications which it experiences
in the animal economy. The following is the manner in
which, I think, I have proved in my letter on the origin of
animal electricity, that man, in the state of health, like all
other animals, has parts positively electric, while others are
negatively    so.
    It  appears that, in the animal,          the negative    part, that   of
the excretions,       is not so strong     as  the poiitive part, that of
 the blood.      But if     the change     of the animal economy de
stroys the natural boundaries of electricity in the body, on
account of the tendency of the latter to bring itself into
equilibrium, it ought to escape and to manifest itself exactly
at the moments when the boundaries are destroyed                     f ; that
is to fay, when the virus changes the internal parts, which
is proved by the sits of shivering : soar and other violent pas
sions, as they change the animal economy, ought also to
produce the fame eflect.            Thus you have seen the strings of
 my electrometer, placed on the back of the animal, separate
 from each other, either during              the fits   of slnvering occa
 sioned by a contagious disease,           or during those produced by
 fear; vou    see that the same       theory explains also the want of
electricity which you observed in diseased cats.                  I  am per
 suaded that this want will in no cafe exist till the             disease has
 continued several days, and the .animal economy has become
 deranged.      When I concluded my electric experiments on
 water and ice     %,   I repeated them on several liquids,          animals,

 and vegetables, as well as on different preparations of water.
 Urine and animal humours exhibited to me the greatest
 degree   of electric difference, You fee then that my opinion
 is  supported by facts.       As I have found, however, that the
 blood of those labouring under an intermittent sever is still
 positively electric *, it might be useful to ascertain in what
 diseases, and     at what degree       of those diseases, it loses its
 electricity.     Might     not the electrometer be employed            to
 distinguish desperate diseases, and be used, if I may be al
 lowed the expression, as a vitalitometer ? But many expe
 riments are still wanting before we can reach that point of
 perfection in the science of electricity.           The discovery of
 electricity in the torpedo seems astonishing.            That of Co-
 tugno, who received an electric shock from             a mouse   which
 he was dissecting;      and that    of Tonso, who     had one from a
 cat;   and my electric experiments on rats seem conclusive.
 But the immensity of nature still presents matter for new
 researches; and at present, since I have found the electricity
 of the blood and that os the excretions contrary, I fee how
 much remains to be done to reduce to their just value the
 opinions of Gatdini, Bertholon, Tristan, and Carlieu, on ani
 mal electricity.     You     have pursued the best route,     which is
 to interrogate

this is perfectly known.   The instrument itself, and not its

as consisted    of only       one  word, not evidently denoting Com*
false relation, might           without inconvenience be admitted;
but in process of time descriptions were admitted instead of
names, and these often false or absurd, as sal mirabile, sal
secrelum,      arcanum        duplicaium,          arcanum    corallinum,        &c.
The inconvenience            and evident         impropriety of many of these
designations     at   la/l    attracted     the attention    of those eminent
philosophic chemists, Bergman and Morveau.       Morveau, so
early as the year 1782, published an excellent memoir on this
subject in Rozier's journal, and his sentiments met with the
entire approbation of Bergman. The new denominations he
sought to introduce, soon however gave way to the more
exquisitely devised systematic appellations grounded on the
discoveries    of Lavoisier,        and the total elimination        of   the phlo
gistic element formerly admitted. These, in the formation
of which Morveau also, in concurrence with a few of the
most    eminent Parisian chemists, bore a considerable                          part,
were    since admitted and recognised                 by most European che
mists, and particularly         in England.           The exceptions that        ap
peared to me reasonable              to the general       rules laid down by
this highly respectable association,                or to some of the term*
they introduced, I thought of too little consequence to men
tion, knowing that the few antieut denominations I retained,
and the still fewer new ones              I introduced,      were perfectly in
telligible ; nor should I attempt at present to vindicate them,
had I not perceived th«y attracted the censure of many on
whose esteem      I   set    the highest value.          Thus circumstanced,
I   feel myself justified      in examining     propriety of
                                                      the general
those rules     and        principles from which I thought
                       assumed
proper to deviate, and of the denominations which I reject.
  The first principle laid down by M. Morveau         " that              is,
phrases are not  name a          ;    that substances and chemical pro
ducts should be denoted                by names sit to indicate them on
every occasion,       without        having       recourse   to circumstances      :
p. 373. To this principle            I    give my entire assent.
   Another rule laid down                   byM. Morveau
                                                       that in      is,   "
choosing   denominations  we  stiould prefer those which  have
their roots in the dead languages more generally known, in
order that the fense fliould suggest the name, and the name
                                                                                 the

the sense."         It   is for this reason, combined with the first,
that I prefer (ingle names, already understood, ?nd well
known by all those that have attained any knowledge of
chemistry, to new names derived from the Greek or new
unknown        barbarous Latin names.                    Hence       I  prefer the term
hepar,     denoting in al! chemical authors a combination of
sulphur to every basis except a metallic, to the barbarous
unknown Latin term sulpburet ; and, with respect to metals,
I   prefer the well known                 terms     pyrites and galena, to the
newly-devised sulpburet of iron, ercojiper, or lead; the former
has the advantage of denoting the particular specific combi
nations of sulphur with iron, copper, arsenic, or cobalt, and
of excluding not only other sulphurated metals that do not
give fire with steel, as the vitreous silver ore, sulphurated anti
mony, or lead, cinnabar, blende, sulphurated bismuth, &c.;
but also such compounds even of copper and sulphur as do not
give fire with steel, as the vitreous copper ore and the gray
copper ore, and the purple. On these, and many other consi
derations which will presently be mentioned, I hope the inge
nious    Mr. Mustiet will recall his wish that I                      had modelled       my

bert, who      asserts       that the new are more                   exact,       sonorous,
and significative        ;    for any term is exact and significative
when it denotes,             without obscurity or ambiguity, the thing
signified; and as lo sound, it maydeserve attention in poetry,
but surely, if not exceedingly uncouth, it deserves none in
science.       He acknowledges that                these alterations may                 cause
some     embarrassment              to the    present race          of men, but think*
that succeeding generations will bless those that introduced
them. J think on the contrary that they will curse them, for
obliging them to learn both the new and the old denomina
tions under the penalty of not understanding Stahl, Henckel,
Margraf, Lemery, Geossroy, Duhamel, Macquer, Bergman,
Scheele and many others of the highest merit. Can any one
be so arrogant as to pretend that these immortal                              authors can
become unintelligible without prejudice to the science? Is
itpossible that musicians sliould judge more shrewdly than
those who profess to be philosophers   ? Yet these have rejected
all the modern alterations  of notation that have been proposed
 to them, though attended with some advantages, from the
single consideration that, if new modes were adopted, the in
imitable compositions of the last and present age would either
soon become unintelligible, or the arduous task of learning
both methods of notation would be imposed on all succeeding
generations.   I am not however for the total exclusion of the
term sulpburet ; let it be employed to denote the composition
 of sulphur with any basis in general, whether alkaline,
 earthy, metallic, oleaginous, spirituous or carbonaceous ; in
this most extensive           fense, the old nomenclature supplied                         no
term,    and yet some name was                wanting; in this                fense there
fore it may be retained.
     Another   general maxim advanced                    by   M. Morveau
                                                           that                    is,
"    the denomination          of
                          chemical compound
                                    a             neither clear          is

                                   names conformable to their
nature the ingredients that enter into that compound."    This
maxim,     unhappily          too easily adopted              by   the French       school,
tends to the subversion         of      the received language            of all   sciences,
and even    of common life.                By this rule             we    are to banish
the name water, and instead of                    it   substitute     its     component
                                                                              ingtedients

  stead of common soap we are lo say oleaginatedsoda,                 and for
 glass, silicited alkali, &c.
     The French chemists it is true retain the xwcaz soap, but
  in contradiction with their own principles; for they surely
  cannot in this word discover the rad'cals of its composition.
  Nay, Lavoisier retains the old word nitre and salt petre con
 jointly with that of nitrat of potash, (see his Treatise of Che
  mistry, vol. I. p. 79 and 232, French) and yet they disap
  prove of my retaining a lew of the antient denominations
 (hat were as well known to all chemists as the names soap or
 gl ss in the language of common life, such as Glauber, Ep
som, mid Sylviau (rejecting only the term salt usually tacked
 to them; but evidently superfluous) ; also selenite, gypsum,
 borax and alum — these I retain for two reasons; first, because
 they express their respective objects by         a jingle   name, which
 appears    to me   a considerable      advantage,     and secondly,       be
 cause   those names      continually     occur in all treatises of che
 mistry published before the year T790, and in many since,
 and consequently must be known by all who wish to under
 stand them.
     Morveau and the French school in general reject the names
 of inventors, " as having no conformity either generic or in
 dividual with things :" and for the fame reason they should
 reject the names Alexandria and Conslantinoplt derived from
 the founders ; and in general, by the fame rule, all names
 of  places should be changed for such           as  would express their
 situation.    Is it not     therefore evident,        when the signifi
 cation of names      is already     fixed and generally known,           that
 they should     be retainedf,        the  inconvenience of rejecting
 them being far superior to any advantages               proposed by       the
change ? Yet, strange to tell, they object to           a few   new names
which I introduced in mineralogy, though exactly founded on
their own principles, and not attended with any inconve

nation previously assigned to them, and even possessing pe
culiar properties of great importance. Thus they disapprove*
of the    name muricalate,        a name      which   I  thought proper to
bestow      on such limestones        as  contain   a   notable proportion
of magnesia;       and haryto-calcyte       on such as contain. a notable
proportion of baryt.es; these stones having been distinguished
by no name, and these new names being in conformity with
the principles of the French school derived from and grounded
on their component ingredients.
    Mr. Tennant has since shown, in an important paper in
the Philosophical Transactions for 1799, the evident necessity
of distinguisliing these muricalcites from common limestones,
with which they          have always been confounded ; and, from
the deleterious      properties    which barytic lime water possesses,
it  is evident that the limestones          that contain any proportion
of barytic earth cannot without danger (sometimes to human
life) be confounded with common limestones.                      The stona.

approaching       in our  language      too  nearly   the  word appetite, I
have called phosphorite to mark its composition; but as the
phosphoric acid has also been detected, or at least suspected,
in composition with argil,          to distinguisli this compound from
the former I call it phofpholite, a name better suited to it
than that of Valentia garnet, by which it was formerly de
noted — a change attended with no inconvenience, as the
stone itself was known in no part of Europe but Spain.                    To
these denominations          they object their monotonous termina
 tions  5  but these terminations are best suited to our language            9
 th^y do not recollect that the terminations              in at,  as nitrats,
fulphats,       muriats, carbonats, phofphats, oxalats, &c. &c.
 are equally monotonous in theirs. They think, or rather
 magisterially decide, that minerals should be denoted by
 the same name as similar chemical compounds ; a rule that
 might be admitted if such minerals were not previously gene
 rally known by other single appellations, and if their com
 position was perfectly similar to analogous chemical com
  pounds.      But in    the   first place    several minerals are already

generally known by peculiar proper denominations ; for
instance, cinnabar, surely a more convenient name than
the drawling new name sulphurated red oxyd of mercury :
and    in  the   next place they should consider that chemi
cal   compounds being artificial productions may contain
only those ingredients which their compound names im
port.     But minerals      whose    principal     composition is ana
logous, often contain other substances also, which the new
chemical name would not express, and would thus lead
to important      mistakes.     Thus, for       instance,    phosphorite   is
commonly contaminated with silcx, aerated lime, muriated
lime and iron, and sometimes with manganese and fluor;
whereas the analogous chemical compound on which the
name phosphorated lime is properly imposed,                    is free from
such contaminations.          Substances,        therefore,    so  different,
should certainly be distinguiflied bv different names, or at
least the word natural or native must be tacked to the name
of the chemical compound;           and though, with respect to fos-.
file metallic chemical compounds, this inconvenience may
often be avoided by the addition of the word ore, yet here
also the antieht name often expresses some                  other inherent
property   ;  thus the term     vitreous added to silver ore denotes
hot only the composition, but also the easy fusibility of that
 particular ore.

      The object of the present treatise is to explain, in a man
    ner consistent with the leading principle formerly advanced
    by the author, another important class of the pharnomcna of
    light and colours.
       Sir Isaac Newton                       the smallest parts of all
                                 has represented
    natural bodies                       He supposes those parts to be
                           as transparent.
    placed in a       medium, inferior in refractive power to them
    selves.                                     transparent, which
                 Those bodies are in his estimation
    consist uniformly of the smallest parts and the smallest inter
    mediate spaces : those arc black, which have their integrant
    parts and the intervening spaces of a size somewhat greater :
    such    as    are variously coloured consist            of       parts    larger than
    those     of either transparent or black bodies.                         The rays of
    li^ht are, in his judgment, disposed, by a natural indestruc
    tible quality, to be alternately transmitted through opposing
    media, and reflected from them.      By this quality, the trans
    missions of light, its refractions and its reflections, appeared
    to him to be in all cafes regulated.
       The author of this           treatise,   on the contrary,              denies tha*
    the           integrant particles of bodies are known to be
           minutest
    transparent; that there exist within bodies any such refrac
    tive media surrounding their parts as Newton has imagined ;
    that refraction and reflection depend in any measure on the
    arrangement and conformation of the parts of bodies, which
    Newton supposes;           or that light         is,   by
                                                      mysterious natural

    quality, disposed,         byturns, to easy transmission and to easy

       He maintains, that all the phænomena which Newton has'
    thus erroneously explained, are only                   so

    bodies approaching them.      According     to him,  as     should            it
    seem, light      never, in any circumstances, made to exhibit
                      is

                                     6,
their first sitting since the long vacation, when the commence
ment of Dr. Herschel's Second Part of his Inquiry respecting
Heat and Light was read.
  On     the 13th the Society occupied itself in reading the con
clusion of-Dr. Herschel's paper, which contains                         a   detail of a
number of most interesting experiments relative                             to the   dif

substances and through different coloured                           glasses.     From
Dr. Herschel's experiments                 it    appears      that red glass allows
most heat and least            light   to pass through.            One experiment

     Thursday, Nov. 6, the Society met for the first time since'
 the summer vacation ;       on which evening, and on the 13th
 and 20th, several very curious fragments of the paintings from
 the walls of St. Stephen's chapel, representing various sub
jects from the books of Job and Tobit, were exhibited; and
 a very curious memoir on the subject, by their learned Se
 cretary, was read.      The President addressed the Society, and
 informed them that the Society had appointed a committee
for the purpose of superintending the execution of drawings
 which were making of all the curious remains that have been
discovered     during the alterations that were carrying on at
St. Stephen's chapel, and which of late had excited such
 general curiosity among all classes     of people.
         SOCIETY OF NATURAL HISTORY AT PARIS.
     C. Haiiy lately   read before the Society a note on the crys
tallisations osiron ore. The intended publication of a treatise
on mineralogy by this author having induced him to revise,
with great care, what he had written on crystallisation, he
found that he had rectified only in part the incorrectness into
which he had fallen in regard to the crystalline forms of iron
ore.
     He  had already announced,     in an extract from his treatise,
that the crystals of volcanic iron were not segments of the
regular octaedron, as believed, and that the difference be
tween their angles and those of these segments was more than
                                                               12 de-

Ia    degrees.        He     has since found that they have for their pri
mitive form          a  rhomboid somewhat acute, in which the angle
of   the summit is about 87 degrees.
     Buthe thought also, with all othernaturalists, that the crystals
of   the iron      of   the island   of Elba   were derived from the cubic
form     ; and he had referred          to that form that  of the crystals of
Framont in dodecaedra                composed    of two right pyramids in
complete.            He     had always been struck, however, with a kind
of singularity         presented     here by the cubic     form which per
formed the function of the rhomboid                  ; that is to fay, that it
was necessary to suppose an axis pasting through the two op
posite solid angles, which were to be considered as the sum
mits, and the laws of the decrement which took place around
 the summits were different from those which related to the
 lateral     angles.
     He      was     still   more surprised, when, having lately tried to
  apply theory to a variety            of the iron of Framont, which he
 had not before examined, he observed that it was necessary
 to suppose it to result from a decrement by twenty rows or
  the inferior angles of the primitive cube, in order to have re
  sults corresponding with observation.
      This law, though perfectly admissible, deviated so much
  from the usual laws, that it inspired the author with suspicions
  respecting       the cubic form itself, and, by the help        of goniome-
  try, he measured, for the first time, on the                 crystals of the
  ifland of Elba, the mutual incidence of the primitive faces                  ;
  whereas        he had before        confined himself to measuring that
  of   the     faces       produced by the decrements, either among
  themselves or on the primitive faces, having no idea that
  there could be any uncertainty in regard to a form which
  presented       in   so sensible a   manner the appearance of a cube ;
  and the more             so as the facets  by which it was modified pre
   vented      the difference from being observed.              He perceived
  that this form was            a real rhomboid similar[to that of volcanic
   iron   ;  and in that cafe, this law, which had appeared so
   singular on the hypothesis             of  a cube, gave place to a simple
   law,     and     every     thing, as we may       fay,  was   reduced   into
   proper order.

  he found no change to be made             in the old laws  ; because the
  secondary       incidences which      he had    determined in the     sup
   position of a cube, differed only half a degree from those
  resulting from the rhomboidal form.               This, lays t!.e author,
  is one of those       cases  where   a  quantity very sensible of itlelf
  is diminished by pasting          into certain results which depend
  on it.
      It arises   from these researches, that all the iron ores which
  retain    a  metallic appearance may be reduced to two kinds,
  very distinct from each other ; one of which contains sub
  stances that crystallise in regular octaedra,          such as the iron
 of Corsica;        and the other, those having for their primitive
  form    a   rhomboid somewhat acute, as the iron of the island
 of Elba, that of Framont, and that of volcanoes.                      The
  first will continue      to  be distinguished by the name         of oxi-
 dultitcd iron, and the second will be           called oligijl iron; that
  is to fay, little abundant in iron in the metallic state. It is
 here seen, that a greater quantity of oxygen imprints on the
 primitive form a character entirely peculiar, by making the
 regular octaedron pass to the rhomboid; and this seems to
 indicate       two very distinct points of equilibrium,             which
 chemistry no doubt will determine when it has carried the
 analysis     of iron ore to a degree of correctness, suited        to that
 perfection which this science has already attained.
                        PHILOMATIC SOCIETY.
     C. De Sauffure, the son, read lately before this Society 3,
memoir on the influence which the foil has on certain con
stituent pans of vegetables.             It was formerly believed that
 the foil had no influence on vegetables, but in proportion
to the faculty it pollened of retaining a greater or less quan
tity of moisture ; and it was to this cause alone that the
difference between          the  abundance and        size  of  vegetables
growing        in calcareous    foil,  and the fame qualities in those
found in granitic soil, was ascribed.               But Sauffure having
remarked hat the animals which live in the calcareous
lands, that produce these vegetables, were larger, fatter, and
gave a greater quantity of milk, richer in butyraceous and
caseous parts, than those in granitic districts, conceived an.
                 3                                                    id<*

idea,   that there must      exist   between    these vegetables     a  dif
 ference   still more important, and which ought to depend
more on the         nature of the foil.         Saussure therefore has
made a series of experiments, with a view to ascertain the
difference which the nature of different soils produces in the
composition of the vegetables which grow in them. That
these experiments might         be conclusive, it was necessary to.
make them very much comparative, that is to fay, to take
the fame quantity of the fame vegetables, of the fame age,
growing under similar circumstances or in the fame expo
sure, at a distance      from the course of streams,         and   beyond
the reach    of cattle.
    It was  necessary also to repeat the same experiments a
great  number      of times in order to obtain mean results, and
to approach the truth by multiplying probabilities.                    This
C. de Saussure did. He began by analysing the stone that
composed the mountains the plants of which he examined.
He then     proceeded     by the usual chemical means, which              he
describes   in his memoir,         to analyse    the vegetables,    with a
view to ascertain      the respective     quantities of natural water,
charcoal, earths, and salts which they contained.                 That he
might    obtain    more   general    results  he   operated   on  different
kinds of plants, viz.        the pinus ables;       sinus larix; rhodo
dendron Jerrugineum        ;  vaccinium myrtillus ; juniperus com-
munis. All those vegetables which belonged to granitic
districts contained more water than those of calcareous coun
tries.    The    smallest quantity     of the extreme     difference    was
as 57 to   58, and the greatest as 52 to 59. , These differences
cannot be ascribed to the quantities of water which might
be retained     in the mould of the granitic foil and that of the
calcareous, for they are the inverse of those presented by the
vegetables of these two soils.           De Saussure concludes with.
Duhamcl, that the wood of calcareous countries is prefer
able, in point of solidity, to that os granitic countries.
    Proceeding then to a comparison of the quantities of
charcoal contained in vegetables, Saussure remarks how dif
ficult it is to estimate with precision the absolute quantities
of charcoal    ; the relative proportions of that principle can at
most be known ; aud he found that it is more abundant in the
    Vol. VIII.                          B   b                   calcareous

calcareous     vegetables ; so that        it   seems to supply the place           of
that quantity of water which they had                    less   than the granitic
vegetables.
   Granitic       vegetables being more aqueous,                ought, according
to the observations      of Duhamel,             to have a softer texture,         and
consequently to contain             more        ashes.   The incineration           of
granitic and calcareous           vegetables       gave differences     too    diffi
cult t6 be appretiated  but, however small they might be,
                              ;
they appeared~to confirm this observation.
  The ashes furnished by incineration having been carefully
Analysed, Saussure found in those of calcareous vegetables
a greater quantity of that earth, and much more (ilex in the
granitic; so that the allies of the calcareous rhododendron
in ioo parts contained 57 parts of the carbonat of lime and
5 parts of filex; while those of the granitic rhododendron con-
tained 30 parts of carbonat of lime and 14 parts of filex.
This great difference is one of the most Convincing proofs
of the influence of the soil on vegetation. As the lime-stone
of mount la Salle, where Saussure collected the vegetablei
the ashes of which he analysed, contains filex, this che
mist was desirous of knowing whether vegetables collect
ed on soil entirely free from that earth contained any of
it. He therefore analysed the ashes of some plants which
had grown on lime-stone totally free from filex, in the
mountain of Reculey-de-Thoiry, in Jura, and found in one
or two cases only a very small proportion of filex, while in
the ashes of the vegetables of Breven he perceived much
more calcareous        matter than that mountain                   could furnish.
Saussure      thence    deduces      this geologic conclusion, that ve
getables      cover    with   calcareous    matter mountains which
have a base       of filex, while     the inverse        of this   does not take
place.
   In    the last place, he made a comparative analysis                       of   the
mould in which the plants of Breven and those of Reculey-
de-Thoiry grew, in order to determine the relation which
ought to exist between that mould, the soil, and the ashes
of vegetables which grow in    and had nearly the follow

    A memoir was read by C. Beauvois on the American fox,
and the rabbit of the fame country.             A comparison of the
skull of the European sox with that of the~Ameriean fox,
cams virginianus       Gmel.,  as weii as  of  the European    rabbit
with that of America,         lepus americanus      Gmel. has evi
dently shown that these two species have been improperly
considered by Boston and several other naturalists as mere
varieties   of  the   European species, and that Erxleben and
Gmelin were authorised in making them distinct species.
   Foxes, like the dog, bear, badger, and several other ani
mals of the fam^ of the feræ, have on the top of the head
two salient lines, which proceed from the posterior angle of
the orbit and proceed backwards.          In the European fox these
two lines unite at the future ot the frontal bone, where they
form a ridge more or less salient according to the age of the
 individual.     In that of America     these lines are three   times
as large    and as prominent;     instead  of uniting  at the frontal
bone, they separate from each other, and extend as far as the
occipital ridge, where they unite.
   The lower jaw in these two animals presents still other very
sensible differences.     Each   branch, which     in the European
fox appears      under the form of a well-rounded          curve, is
straight in the American fox, and forms, with the ascending
branches, an angle of nearly 1450.
   Differences equally striking are observed between the Eu
ropean and the American rabbits in the elevation and thick
ness  of  the orbicular apophylls.     The American rabbit      never
burrows, like that of Europe, and always brings forth two
young, like the hare.       From all these characters it appears
that the American rabbit is an intermediate species between
our hare and our rabbit.
   C. Decandolle communicated some experiments respecting

1 88       Influence of Artificial Light on Vegetables.
object which the author first proposed in his researches was
to ascertain the influence which light has on the deep of the
leaves and flowers of plants.       It appears to the author, that
regular vicissitude of day and night in the ordinary course of
things renders any researches in this respect exceedingly diffi
cult; and he thinks that they might be rendered much easier
if vegetables were exposed to an artificial light, continued or
combined in various ways.        For this purpose he placed six
lamps   in  a dark cellar, and  disposed them in such a manner
that the illuminated plants had only about 66 or 67 degrees
of heat, and were slieltered from the smoke. These six lamps
gave a light equal to 54 tapers.      The experiments which he
made with this apparatus      are as follow  :
   Mustard (the myagrum fativum) and cresses, sown, reared,
and made to grow, exposed to this artificial light, had a sen
sibly green colour ; but their stalks were a little longer than
those which grew in the open air.
   The leaves of different plants put under water, and exposed
to the light of these lamps, produced no oxygen gas for
twenty-four hours ; afterwards they putrefied, and formed a
deleterious gas. This result is not astonishing, for fix lamps
are not equal to the light of the fun ; and it is well known
that in the shade no oxygen gas is disengaged.
   Branches of the lime-tree, solarium lycopcrjlcum, immersed
in water and exposed comparatively to the light of these
lamps, an obscure heat of 690 Fah. and the open air during
night, attracted much more water in the light than inobscurity.
Branches of the oak attracted little water in the light, and a
great deal when exposed to heat. Branches of the fir attracted
very little in the light.   It would appear that this element
has a stronger action on vegetables that slied their leaves
than on ever-greens.
   The cessation of suction and of transpiration during the
night is a real sleep common to all plants. This name,
however, is given to a particular position which the leaves

   Linnæus diflinguisties the solar flowers into three classes ;
the meteoric, tropical, and equinotlial.       C. Decandolle is of
opinion that to these we ought to add the ephemeral, which

flower at      a certain hour, and perish at a certain determined
period, which never exceeds twenty-four hours. The marvel
of Peru {mirahilis jalapa) when exposed to the light of the
lamps for three days, continued to open in the evening, and
to close together in the morning, nearly at their accustomed
hour.       The case was the fame in total darkness ; but, being,
exposed       to the   light of the lamps during the day, they first
exhibited some irregularities, but on the second day they
opened       in   the morning and closed up at night.             The con
volvulus purpureus, which unfolds itself in the openest air at
 ten   in  the evening,      having been exposed to the light of the
lamps, opened the first day at ten in the evening, and next
 day at six.
     The rock-rose, broad-leaved tree-primrose, bind-weed, ficoi-
 des, marygold, and thediamondsig-marygold,                exhibited   a great
 number       of variations mentioned by C. Dccandolle, which it
 would be too tedious to detail here. We shall only add, that
 the Egyptian fig-marygold (mefemlryanthemum                   nocJ'iflorum),
 when exposed to light during the night-time, and to obscu
 rity during the day, opened in the morning and closed them
 selves at     night;     and   that the mefemlryanthemum         ^splendent
 and     tenuifolium, exposed to a heat of 690, opened their
 flowers in a very short time, while the same heat had no
 influence whatever on other plants.
     Bonnet, who has endeavoured                 to explain the sleep of
 plants, supposes        that  the  lower  surface  of the foliole, such as
  those of the false acacia for example, is susceptible of ex
  tending by moisture, and that its upper surface is suscep
  tible of extending by dryness.             But C. Decandolle observe*
  that the moving cause seems to act on the insertion of the
foliole,    and not on the entire surface ; that this explanation
  cannot be applied to the leaves the foliole of which inclines
  forwards or backwards ; and that it would be necessary to
  admit that the fophora and the guilandina, which in the night
  throw down their leaves, are organised in an inverse manner
  to the false acacia; which is not confirmed by anatomy.                  The
  cause   of   the steep   of plants  is therefore  really unknown.
      In none of the experiments was there any change made in
  the progress of the oxalis JlricJa and incarnata, but a power
                                                                            ful

  ful influence was observed on the sleep of the sensitive plant.
  Several sensitive plants, exposed for three days to the conti
 nued light of the lamps, opened and closed each day two
 hours sooner than the day before; from which it appears that
 the continuance of light hastened and did not interrupt iheir
 movements. When exposed to the same light during the
 night,    and to obscurity in  the dayi-me    they exhibited a re
 gular progress for nearly two days; at>' «' ">ch they ex
 panded in the evening and closed in the n.orr "*.             Their
 movements were not deranged by total obscurity, b> ? they
 seem to have been retarded by a heat       of 60° to 80'.    A heat
 of 78" rendered the plant sickly,     and deprived  it for two days
 of its sensibility when touched.
    These facts, according to the author, can be explained
 only two ways.       We may fay that these periodical move
 ments are peculiar to the fibres of plants, and that external
 circumstances are only the stimulants which excite or retard
them; or that       the periodical movements continue notwith
 standing the change of external circumstances, only on ac
 count of the habit acquired by the fibres.        This last expla
nation appears more      probable  than the other, because we are
already acquainted with lome facts which seem to indicate
that plants arc susceptible os habit. But, whatever may be
the explanation we adopt, we must admit as the foundation
of it the theory of irritability ; that is to fay, to acknowledge
that vegetables are endowed with a peculiar kind of life or
force, in consequence of which their fibres are not affected
by external bodies, as unorganised beings would be from the
mere laws of mechanics.
    The English journals having announced some new experi
ments respecting the theory of Galvanism, a memoir on which
had been presented to the Royal Society by Professor Volta,
these experiments have been repeated by C. Robertson, and

Lowry, of Titchfield-street, engraver, and Mr. Alexander,
of Newman-street,          well known as draughtsman to the late
Chinese embassy, intend to publish a selection of picturesque
and accurate Views (about the size and in the manner of
Hearn     and Byrne's Antiquities)         of the crosses and conduits
erected at different times in various parts         of this island,  many
of which, from their           present decayed state, and there being
no accurate representations          of them, must otherwise soon be
irrecoverably lost.        The drawings will be made by Mr. Alex

from the known abilities of these artists, the public have a
right to expect a work equal in execution to any thing of

   The following useful hints we copy from a Paris paper :
   " A Journal, which has a very extensive circulation,
has lately announced secrets for curing the smut in wheat,
preserving    it from weevils, and for making bread from smutty
wheat     as good and salutary as that made from found wheat.
As   a  farmer,    I  take the liberty  of giving my opinion      respect
ing   these discoveries.
    " I    can certify with truth,       that the method of Trianon,
which     consists    in washing the     seed in a  solution of lime in
water, has always preserved            my wheat from smut since           I
have made use of it.          In my opinion it is impossible to find a
preventive    less    expensive.   Besides, I do not employ it but for
the fifth part of the wheat which I sow each year; that which
arises from     it  is employed for feed the next year, and so on        in
                                                               succession  j

  succession ;    but  I  take great care not to dry the wheat pre
  pared     in this manner either in      an    oven   or stove, lest the
  germ should be injured ; it must not even be dry when sown,
  because the lime would detach itself, and injure the sower.
      "   In regard to weevils, one of my neighbours has en
  tirely cleared his house of them by a very easy process.             In
  the month of June, his granaries and barns being entirely
  empty, he caused a number of large ant-hills to be collected
  in bags,    and   dispersed them throughout         the places infested
  by these insects.      The   ants immediately attacked       the weevils
  and devoured     them entirely, so that not one of them was to
  be    seen.   Since that period none of these destructive in
  sects have appeared on his premises.
      "  The third    secret is very simple    :  it consists in washing
  the smutty wheat in pure water till it no longer becomes
  black ; it must then be immersed in boiling water and dried,
  so   that it can be ground.        By this process as good bread
 may     be  obtained  as  that made   from wheat which is free from
  smut."

      Mr. Klaproth, of Berlin, having lately             analysed  honey-
Jlone, has found that the alumine contained in it is united
 to an acid, the radical of which is the fame as that of the
 vegetable    acids, but with different proportions         of the carbon
  and hydrogen.
      The vegetable alkali     has  been found     in different minerals.
 This new fact cannot         therefore fail to prove interesting, and
 may lead to some useful facts respecting the connection              be
  tween the vegetable and mineral kingdoms.

 PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE.
                     DECEMBER           1800.
I. A   short
              Vwjj of   she new EleBric Experiments performed
                     by  Dr. Van Marum.
  JL HE experiments which form the subject of this article
were performed with the large machine in the Teylerian mu-
sæum at Haarlem, partly undertaken at the request of other
philosophers, and described in his last work on electricity,
entitled  Tweede     Vervolg dcr Prorfncemingen gcdaan met
Teeyler's EL Much.      Haarlem 1 795, 4to: It must here be
observed   that, since the last publication respecting these ex
periments, great improvements have been made in the large
machine, and particularly in regard to the cushions. Ac
cording to the old mode of construction, the cushions werd
pressed towards the glass plates by means       of two   screws, in
Consequence    9s   which it   was not possible to maintain      an
uniform    pressure  on both sides.     At  present,  however, art
Uniformity of   pressure is obtained by two steel springs,   which
are applied with hinges to the end     of two iron plates, and are
kept together by one single screw.       As these springs exercise
their pressure on the centre of gravity of the cushions, the
pressure is uniformly the fame in every part.          Besides this
improvement, the conductor is constructed in such a manner
that, merely by turning, it can be employed sometimes for
receiving positive and sometimes negative electricity; so that
both these kinds of electricity can be communicated to the
conductor    by changing

longer furnished with spikes, but is perfectly smooth and
somewhat rounded, and has been lengthened from six to ten
inches.
   By  the conductor alone experiments were made.
   1. Respecting the    effect  of electricity on the pulse.    Dr.
Van Marum thought        he had    reason   to conclude from     his
former experiments, that electricity does not increase           the
pulse.    But, as some doubts arose on this subject, which
were supported by a paper of Messrs. Von Troostwyk and
Deiman, he thought it might be of some utility, in a subject
of so much importance to medical electricity, to repeat the
experiments according to the method of these philosophers.
For this purpose eleven persons were selected, and the expe
riment was repeated sour times on each, both with positive
and negative electricity.      These persons were placed in a
room which was at such a distance from the machine that
they could not hear the noise it made in turning; they were
also insulated, and their pulse was felt when the machine
was in motion as well as when it was at rest (which last cir
cumstance was unknown to them), and the beats were told
by a good observer     by means     of  an excellent watch.       In
some single cafes a few beats more were observed,      but on the
whole there was no particular increase of any consequence.
In general, however, [here was great irregularity in the pulse
both during the time the persons were electrified, and during
the time the machine was at rest.
   2. Respecting the increase of insensible perspiration during
the time the persons were electrified.      Dr. Van Marum em
ployed for this purpose a very sensible balance, one scale of
which was insulated by means of a silk cord. On this scale
he placed a boy, eight years of age, connected with the con
ductor, and brought -the balance into equilibrium.         He then
examined the loss of weight sustained in half an hour before
the boy was electrified, and found it amount to 280 grains ;
after which    the machine     was  turned for half an hour, and
the loss at the end of that time amounted to 295 grains. By
a similar experiment on another occasion, the loss of weight
before being electrified was 330, aud after being exposed to
electricity only 310.    A  girl of seven years lost, before being
                 8                                      electrified,

                     JVi.it/  EhSlric    Experiments*                195
electrified, 1 80 ;   and when electrified, 165 grains. A boy
of eight year's and a half lost unelectrisied 430, and when
electrified 290. Another of nine years, unelectrisied 170,
electrified 240. As the last boy was exceedingly quiet during
the experiment, it was thought that the increase was the
consequence     of electricity ; on this account lie was several
times subjected to the experiment, and the results were in the
unelectrisied state 550; in the electric 390, 330 and 270,
550 and 420.        In most of the experiments it appeared that
there was rather a decrease.
    3. Respecting the irritability of the vessels of vegetables        as.
the cause of the ascent and descent of sap. —The result                of
these experiments {viz. that from the cut stems of different
kinds of euphorbia, and other plants of the like nature, when
exposed    to strong sparks, no more sap flows, as, by the irri
tability of the fibres being destroyed, the vessels are rendered
incapable of contracting themselves) is already well known.
    4. Respecting the existence of caloric in the electric matter.
—Dr. Van Marum               caused a conductor       of  very thin brass
plate, five inches in diameter and eleven inches in length,
to be constructed with a cavity in the middle, in which he
placed the bulb of a very sensible thermometer, and suspended
it by silk strings near the conductor of the large machine.
Neither by positive nor negative electricity, however, did
their appear the least sign of the thermometer rising. As
charcoal is an excellent conductor, he introduced the bulb of
 the thermometer into a cavity made in a piece of that sub
 stance; but still there        was    no sign of heat.      From this it
 appears to him, that the signs         of heat exhibited, by electricity
 niav arise only from the great velocity with which the electric
 matter passes through bodies, and that the fusion or combus
 tion of these bodies         thence resulting may be occasioned by
 the friction thus produced.           Isa stream of electric matter be
 conveyed    to  the   bulb    of a tfiermomcter,    it immediately rises
 as   Van Marum found,            and often from 80 of Fahrenheit
 to 100 and more       :  but this experiment cannot be considered
 as a proof of the existence of caloric in the electric matter,
 as Cavendish found the electric current decomposes the at
 mospheric air, by which            means    some caloric    may be dis-.
                                      Cct                         engaged:

196                   New 'Electric Experiments.
engaged from it.        To    ascertain   the truth of this conjecture,
Van Marum introduced             a  thermometer into a receiver be
tween two conductors, and, having exhausted part of the air,
threw the electric stream on the bulb.                   The thermometer^
however, rose higher than in the open, air, or to 120 degrees.
The air in the receiver had been rarefied lo ^ . That he might
proceed with still greater certainty, he performed the experi
ment in oxygen, gas and azotic gas rarefied in the fame de
gree ; but in both cafes the thermometer rose as much                         as
before.       Van Marum thought           he should       find another proof
of   the above     opinion, by trying         whether    the  electric matter
was able to convert aqueous liquids into expansible fluids ;
for, as the elasticity of all such fluids is ascribed to their mix
ture with caloric, it seemed reasonable to conclude that caloric
must    exist wherever it is possible         to form      expansible   fluids.
 Priestley converted vitriolic ether, by means of electric sparks,
into inflammable gas, and obtained the like result from oil
of turpentine, spirit of wine, and ammonia; but Dr. Van
Marum, from        these substances,       obtained only very little gas,
though his machine worked with much greater strength, and
the small quantity which was obtained was again soon ab
sorbed   ;   and therefore     he is of opinion that these gases were
rather expelled     from     the   above substances by the electricity,
than prepared by it from their component parts. With ether
 and ammonia the quantity was a little larger; but, as these
 substances are exceedingly volatile, it could not be determined
 with ccriai.ily that     the air was       produced     from the caloric of
the electric matter        ;   because     several   liquids    acquire their
liquid form mealy from               the   pressure    of the    atmosphere.
Dr. Van Marum conceived               the idea     of making      the experi
 ments in vacuo with other fluids, because in that case a small
quantity of caloric might produce air.                  For this purpose be
 employed the Torricellian           vacuum, and, having put platina
                                                '
 wires into several barometric tubes              inch in diameter, fused
 the glass around     them ut     a lamp    ; he then inverted      the tubes>
 and rilled them with quicksilver in such a manner that                 4  inch
 of  each    remained empty.           Into this empty space he intro
 duced     the fluids,   through      which    the electric sparks were to
 be conveyed     j then   closed    the   aperture,     and   again inverted
                                                                             the

 the tubes, that the fluid      might ascend to the upper part of
 them.      The   exhausted  space left by the descent of the mer
 cury was some inches in length, which appeared to him to
 be the most advantageous.         He then held the tubes in a ver
tical position in a vessel filled with mercury, and, placing a
 ball three inches in diameter on the wires at the top of the
tubes, caused the sparks from the conductor to fall upon it.
The quicksilver in the tube was at the fame time connected
 with an insulated ball by means of a wire.
    The first experiments were made with water, carefully pu
rified by boiling and by the air-pump.               When the sparka
struck the water through the vacuum, a considerable quantity
of air seemed immediately to be produced, so that in three
minutes the mercury fell         i|   inch.     During the next five
minutes the mercury fell only ^ of an inch, and the produc
tion of air then totally ceased.           After three days, the air
which had been produced did not appear to be in the least
lessened.      By another experiment of the like kind such a
quantity of air was produced that in four minutes the mer-
pury fell 3 inches 4 lines ; but next day the air was lessened
1  inch   8  lines : the remainder retained its elasticity.
    In an experiment with alcohol, such an abundant quantity
pf air was produced that at first the mercury fell [ inch at
each spark.       The production of air, however, decreased in.
proportion to the falling of the mercury.           Two experiments
of the fame kind gave more striking results, which in other
respects were similar to the former.
    In  an experiment     with  caustic   ammonia, a column of air
pf   31   inches was produced in five minutes.           Carbonat of
ammonia gave a column of 18 inches, and camphor one of
6J inches in the fame time. The air produced by alcohol,
when tried by a test, was found to be pure inflammable air:
that from camphor was found to be nearly as free from mix
ture : that, however, from both kinds of ammonia consisted
pf inflammable air mixed with azot.              From this it appear*
that the electricity had separated from each other the two
component parts of the ammonia, hydrogen and azot.                Dr.
Van    Marum      imagined  that  the   air produced  from the  water
V^ould   consist also  of oxygen and hydrogen, and on that         ac

the air he obtained till                         almost equalled in that respect at
mospheric air,                by
                     immersing the barometric tube in    wider                                  a
one silled with quicksilver   but inflammation   did
                                                 ;   not  take
place until    little oxygen gas or atmospheric air was intro

than the former;                   and,      as   it   appeared       from former experi
ments, that the electric spark decomposed oxygen gas, its
oxygen may have pasted into the mercury, and the caloric
may have escaped    no signs of oxydation, however, were

     All      the kinds of air produced                        in this manner, that from

Electricity, therefore,

prove that caloric exists in the electric fluid.  This much
however           is   evident,     that the electric fluid               is   not caloric itself,

  5. Experiments made to determine whether it was pofiible(
by electric sparks to decompose certain substances, or to
change them in a sensible manner. — As Dr. Van Marum, in
the years 1785 and 1787, was able to decompose nitrous and
alkaline air by electric sparks, he wished to try the fame ex
periment with other substances,     -For this purpose he em
ployed tubes of from 15 to 14 inches in length, and from
3 to 4 lines in diameter, into the ends of which he introduced
platina wires, and fused th? glass around them.     When the
bodies to be examined requited mercury, Tie filled the tubes
with that      substance,    and       introduced the- bodies              in   such   a
manner that they floated about an inch over it. Above the
bodies an inch of air was left, that the sparks might be con*-
veyed to them with greater force; for he had been taught,
by experience, that the (hocks are of the utmost importance
in experiments of this kind.  However, he could not venture
here to employ any atmospheric air ; as this air, when de
composed,      gives nitrous acid, which               would have mixed with
the products obtained. The fittest for this purpose were vital
air aud azot.  When he tried such substances as attack mer
cury, the whole tubes were filled with the acid, and a platina
wire was immersed in           it,
                               that its upper end was an inch
                                       so
deep below the surface        of     the acid.         This wire        served instead
of   the mercury as    a    conductor.
   Having introduced concentrated sulphuric acid into this
last apparatus, and conveyed to       for quarter of an hour,
                                                 it,     a
positive or negative sparks, no signs of any change were ob
served.   The case was the fame when       was strongly heated
                                                        it
or rarefied.
     Fuming nitrous     acid gave,          in   the course    of   five minutes,      a
column of two inches of an aeriform fluid                     ;   but in    a   quarter
of   an hour very little     of   it   remained.        It   appears that the ca
loric of the electric matter had given the acid                     a   gaseous form,
but in itself no change could be perceived.
  Common nitrous acid gave column of air of half an inch,
                                            a
which disappeared also when the electric matter ceased to
act.
     Common fuming muriatic acid exhibited the same phe
nomena   as the former. The hyperoxygenated did. not pro
                                                                                   duce

duce the least gas ;       it   appeared that the caloric had no great
tendency to unite itself with the oxygen.
   Carbonat of potash, or fused salt of tartar, treated for a
quarter of an hour over mercury with sparks, experienced                      no
change.
  Concrete volatile alkali gave, between mercury and air, so
much gas that the whole tube was filled with it. In this
cafe the product was partly inflammable air and partly azot ;
and it appears from these experiments that the formation of
gas from both these component parts takes place as well in
air as in vacuo.
   Tincture of lackmus did not become red, though exposed
to sparks for half an hour.
   Professor Volta had requested Dr. Van Marum to convey
sparks to fused saltpetre, in order to try whether a decrepita
tion would        take   place.       This, however, was not     the cafe)
and, after    cooling,        the saltpetre    did not appear to be in the
least alkalised.
   As oxygen separates itself from horn-silver in the light of
the sun, Priestley first proposed to Van Marum to expose it
to electricity j but no air could be obtained from      either     it,
between      the    mercury       and    water,   or in the Torricellian
vacuum.
   Solutions of silver, copper, iron, lead, and quicksilver, in
nitrous acid, and of gold and tin in aqua-regia, did not give
the least precipitate in    tube furnished with
                                  a              platina wire.

With    silver, lead, tin, and quicksilver,       a   little aeriform mattes
was observed,      which however did not amount to above one-
fourth of an inch,        and was again immediately absorbed after
the experiment.

   These experiments were made in consequence of      visit              a
from  Landriani, on the 10th of November 1788. Lavoisier's
combustion of charcoal in oxygen gas had proved merely

                         fixed
heat from a mixture of charcoal-dust well dried and freed
from air, and red precipitate exposed to heat. In order that
the      vessels    might be freed from all moisture they were ex
posed to a strong           heat, and the quicksilver employed in the
apparatus           was   In order to try whether the
                           boiled.                                                         car
bonic acid obtained   contained any water, strong sparks                                   were
made to pass through it; and the operator watched                                          with
great care to observe whether water would be produced,                                      and
whether a long spiral iron wire, employed in the apparatus,
would be oxydated.    The fixed air itself occupied in the tube
the length of nearly 4 inches 6{ lines before being subjected
to electricity,           and the diameter             of the tube was 7 lines. As
soon       as the sparks entered                it,   the operators saw with asto-
nistiment that the column                       of air gradually
                                                   increased, and,

caustic      alkali till its volume ceased                  to be lessened, and              the
residuum           in the tube amounted to two inches.                             The    flame
of   a   taper being then applied       to the aperture, this electrified
residuum           inflamed, and therefore mowed that      consisted en    it
tirely of unmixed inflammable air.                               As this        result did not
coincide with what we are taught                            by   theory,    it   was resolved
to repeat the experiments, and to employ double care in
order to drive ofl the moisture.  But as greater attention
was now paid to what took place during the revival of the
mercury,           it   was observed that some vapour was                        deposited    in
the upper part of the flask employed for the experiment, as
well as in the tube through which the produced air was
made to pass.     was supposed on the first view that this
                           It
vapour was sublimated  mercury; but     soon formed itself into

small drops of water, which increased in size,   that no doubt             so
now remained respecting the production of water.       The re
duction was then suspended, and the whole apparatus was
heated       and        dried    as   well   as possible    ;    but, on continuing the
experiment, the drops again appeared.    Now, as    was im-                       it
possible that this water could arise from the moisture of the
vessels,     it    seems proved to Van                Marum that carbon not only

nothing more than that charcoal is not a simple substance*;

 certainly the eminent abilities of Fourcroy, and the consum
 mate (kill and sagacity of Berlhollet and his associate Welter,
 have thrown the clearest light ; yet I must own that the
 terms employed by the two last to denote the different com
 pounds appear to me verv perplexing, though the bell that
 could be chosen on the principles of the new nomenclature *.
  I flatter myself, therefore, that a short explanation of them,
 and of the names I would with to substitute in their room,
 will not    be unacceptable      nor out of place on this occasion.
                 Sulpbure, Sulpburet        of  the English.
     Bv this the French      understand      the   compound       of sulphur
jingly with any bases         except     hydrogen    :   these compounds      I
 call hepars    if unmctallic, but if metallic         I apply their antient
 names.
            Hjdrogene Sulphurs,          Sulphurated Hydrogen.
     This complex denomination expresses the union of sulphur
 with hydrogen.         I call it by its antient name, hepatic air.
                            Souffre    Hjdrogene.
     This term expresses      the union     of sulphur with hepatic air.
 The sulphur abounds,          and it does not form a permanent air,
  but assumes an oily form.           English neologists would, I pre
 sume,     have called it bydrogenated sulphur : it is plain that
 this name docs not express all the ingredients, for it is to
 hepatic air, and not merely to hydrogen, that the sulphur is
 united;     I call it therefore    bepaticated   sulphur.
                             Hydro Sulpbure.
      Hepatic air is capable of uniting to various bases, and even
 precipitates sulphur from them if previously united to them ;
 on these compounds Berthollet bestows the above denomina
 tion.     The English, I suppose, would call them bydrojulpbu-
 rets; I call them bepalules.

these compounds          bydrogenatcd sulpburets : this appellation
does not express the composition.              I employ the term hefa-
ticated lo express this composition.               Berthollet has disco
vered that fixed alkaline hepars, when dissolved, or even
moist, are always in this state, and consequently, that an
alkaline hepar cannot exist but in a dry state.
   In the case before us, we fee the confusion and perplexity
occasioned      by a strict adherence to the rule recommended by
Lavoisier      , that a conformity or connection should be main
tained between        the   names   of  a bails and its  compounds: in
some     cases it is highly proper, and hence the different de
grees of oxygenation of certain acids are very properly indi
cated by a flight alteration of the termination of the name of
each,   as  sulphureous and sulphuric        ; but these names indicate
only extreme Jhitcs, the first only the smallest degree of oxy
genation constituting an acid, and the last the state of perfect
saturation: now, this fame acid commonly occurs in neither
of these states, but in a state participating more or less of
both   ; these   names, therefore, applied to it when thus circum
stanced are falls     ; and as in this intermediate state it has al
ways been known by the name of vitriolic acid, I think this
name should still be retained. Nay, the sulphureous acid is
itself capable of two very different stales, as may be seen in.
the 6th volume of Dc Machy's edition of Junker, p. 143,
So the term nitric is very proper to denote the full saturation
of  the nitrous basis with oxvgen.            But the term nitrous, em
ployed    lo denote the smallest degree of oxygenation necessary
to convert this basis into an acid, is improper,           as it has ever
more conveyed        a  different idea.     Hence I express this lowest
extreme     of   oxygen uion by the term mepbilo nitrous, as the
radical primary bafi-. may be called mepbite, or mephitic air,
instead of the new coined name azot.               And the term nitrous
acid may still denote,       as it has evermore     done, the mean state
of o\ vgenation     ; that indeed    in which it is usually found, and
for which the French school have no name but that of one or
other of the extreme         states, which must therefore       be falsely
api lied.     The   term epinitrous    air, introduced     by the learned
and ingenious Dickson, may be             used   to denote what    Doctor

Priestley called depblogisiicaled             nitrous air, at least until    its
nature is better developed.
  It is in vain that the authority of Bergman is invoked to

p. 257.   It is true he affirms that the bcjl names are Jucb
as indicate the compqjition, or Jbme essential property ; but of
this fort he gives no example, nor rejects any old names
merely on this account : on the contrary, where expressive
names cannot easily be had, he tells us it is better to apply
some that convey no determinate expression, p. 059 ; and
this is often the cafe where different proportions or numerous
ingredients are to be denoted.
   Hence I am far from rejecting, but on the contrary ap
plaud the ingenuity of the inventors of the terminations of
at and ite to denote the different                  proportions of oxygen     inv
the acids contained in different compounds, as sulpbats,                    sul
phites, nitrats and nitrites, &c.              as   such general   names were
undoubtedly wanting, and the old school afforded none. But
the welcome admission of these does not require nor imply
the dismissal   of   such      of   the old as were faultless,     and enfran
chised by prescription.
  A highly valued friend suggested to me, that the use of
the old names was a departure from the system on which the
new denominations              were   founded.        I   replied, that systems
were    the creatures     of convenience,           and should be adhered     to
only as far as they promoted it; nitre, epsom, borax, &c.
are much sliorter (and equally well known) than nitrated pot-
assi or sulphat of magnesia; and Lavoisier himself preserves
the name borax;           he might       as    well have     preserved   that of
epsom.
     The fifth rule (very properly) laid down by Morveau with
respect to names         is,
                           that they ssiould be adapted to the genius
of   the language    ;   consequently,    old names be retained, they

nor restricted within narrower bounds: on this ground      re            I

  alkali in its purest slate; for that name, both in English and
 French, has always denoted an impure alkali; but the purest
 alkali of this fort, having been formerly denoted bv the name
 of salt of tartar,      a name certainly improper,               I  substitute in
 its room      the  unexceptionable name lariarin, which, by its
 affinity to the former, easily suggests its signification, and is
 moreover attended with a smooth flowing adjective, tartari-
 nated, which is often wanting.              For      the lame reason      I  reject
 the name ammonia to express the volatile                  alkali,   as the   name
 ammoniac has always been employed                   to express the combina
 tion of   a volatile alkali with an acid, and,            if no particular acid
 was expressed, the muriatic was understood                   : instead   of   vola
 tile alkali,   which is   a  compound denomination,                  I substitute
 volalkali,     whose signification cannot be mistaken.                     Its   ad
jective is not, indeed, quite so happy : instead, then, of volal-
 halised, I use the word fulig'matcd, which easily indicates
 the fame idea.       These are the only new chemical names I
 employ.
     The term oxide is     also unsuited       to our language, in which
 it naturally expresses     the   bide    of   an ox.         In pronunciation'
they cannot be distinguished ; in its stead I would use oxat or
 txidat, and instead of oxided I would substitute oxidated. The
 application of either of these terms to metallic substances in
 an oxidated state is generally superfluous, as such substances
 are already denoted, and known under the name of metallic
                      * has
 calces.     Guyton            lately proved that diamonds are the
purest carbon; yet surely even the French school will not at
tempt to suppress that well-known name, and exchange it for
 carbon.      Neither, I suppose, will they call charcoal an oxide
of carbon, though        proved to contain some portion               of oxygen;
 and for the same reason        I shall not exchange the             well-known
 term plumbago       for that of carburet of iron, though with re
 spect to similar compounds of other metals the term carburet
 should be employed.
     This system of conciliation the French school rejects with

scabrous and abrupt precipices                       ;     and hence departed from                     by
Lavoisier himself,             as we have seen                 in the instances          oft saltpetre
and borax,          and indeed           bv the           whole French              school     in the
instances         of water         and        diamond,          as already        mentioned     :     for
common fense, in some instance or other, seldom fails of as
serting its rights         :   yet Lavoisier              tells us he was censured (by
some chemical bigots) for this condescension.                                      The principles
of religionand justice are the only that can in no possible case
yield to conventency.
   Among many just reflections that occur in the preface
to Lavoisier's            celebrated           elementary             treatise      of chemistry,
there         are some connected with                          this subject        that appear lo
me not quite correct.             Thus, p. x. (of the original) he tell*
us,       "   that the    only way of avoiding these errors (unfounded
hypotheses)          is   to suppress reasoning, or at least                             to simplify
it   as   much as possible,              as   it   proceeds from us, and can alone
lead us astray       ;    to try
                         always    the test of experiment, to

we might be led to conclude that all reasoning                                      should be        ba-
ni'lied from chemical investigation, or, at least, that only the

  the most signal instances of successful                chemical investigation
  in the obscurest subjects, and the happiest display of chemical
  sagacity, are the results of very complicated reasoning.                     Such
  is Berthollet's theory of aqua regia, Berthollet and Welter's
  observations      on hepatic air, Fourcroy's on hepatic waters,
  Vauquelin's theory of the mutual decomposition of nitrous
  air and the solution of vitriol of iron *, most of Scheele's and
  many of Klaproth's analyses,               and a few others.
      The just arrangement to which mathematicians owe the
  easy solution of their problems, is itself the result of profound
  reasoning, as is evident in the formation of equations. But
  the modes of reasoning employed in the solutions of mathe
  matical and chemical problems cannot properly be compared,
  the former being founded on the relation of identity or equa
  lity,  and the latter on that         of   cause and effect.
      Page vi. he tells us,
                                  "  it is the series of facts that consti
 tutes science."        I should rather say,           it  was   a  knowledge of
 the relation that      subsists    between       the facts     that occur ; but
 neither the facts themselves             can often be discovered without
 much subtile reasoning, nor can they be marshalled in a lu
 minous series without discovering the reciprocal relations of
 the component ingredients of compound substances to each
 other   ;  a discovery    which often requires an elaborate               train of
  reasoning.
     Lastly, both he and Morveau                tell   us that the memory          of
 learners     is singularly relieved          by compound denominations
 expressing      the component ingredients of each compound.
 In   reply to   which, I fay, that the science is not to be charged
 with a cumbersome train of words merely to gratify the indo
 lence of beginners. Are we then, on every occasion, to sub
 stitute the definition     of words for        the words themselves        ?   .Are
 we, in imitation of the Germans, to fay a band/boe instead of
a glove? Helvetius has long since remarked, that every man
of common understanding              possesses sufficient     power of memory
    •  All foreign chemists are    infinitely  obliged to him    for giving the old
denominations of weights      and measures     instead  of centimetres, &c.    Che

should therefore    speak  a   language universally       understood,  and fcake off
the yoke of national pedantry.

   The fashionable rage of coining new words from the Greeks
without any necessity f has been particularly baneful to mine
ralogy, insomuch that foreigners, though well acquainted with
the received terminology, cannot, without being versed in that
language, understand the meaning of the new-fangled terms
lately introduced.  It is well known that the mineralogical
knowledge of all Europe is chiefly derived from the Germans
and Swedes, whose nomenclature is in most instances the
fame, and where any ambiguity has arisen it has been re*
moved by the exertions of Werner.     His nomenciaturej
where not too discordant with the language, or at open va
riance with the received technical names of other countries,
mould therefore,                for the fake of precision and uniformity,    be
universally preserved.
   Abbe Haiiy, who is now preparing a treatise of minera
logy, of which the highest expectations are justly entertained^
since,   in addition to his own superior intelligence and pro
found physical knowledge, he is assisted with the chemical
abilities of Guyton, Vauquelin, Descotilles, and many Others,
and the extensive researches of Dolomieu, seems convinced
ttf the propriety of retaining the received terminology, at least
For the present, with the limitations and restrictions above
mentioned           ;    for,      in his prefatory discourse, Journal des
Mines,      XXVII.              p. 224, he tells us,
                                                     " that with respect to
minerals of the first class (that   consisting of mere earths),
                                                  is,
he left them those names which they had hitherto borne, and
did not take the liberty of imposing new ones, except in cafes

have altered such names only as were intolerably ambiguous."
     Yet   after this declaration we find the following new-coined
names      :

                         way of note, that C. Guyton,       re               in
viewing the first volume of my Mineralogy, Ann. Chem.
p. 105 and 106, has fallen into two mistakes, which          am           I
persuaded his candour will prompt him to acknowledge. The
first is,
        in stating that my experiments on the fusibility of dif
ferent stones        and    earths were      made      in     limestone   vessels,
whereas they were in Hessian crucibles.                       The   second   is,   in
stating the alleged infusibility of barytic earth and lime at
the result of my experiments, whereas         expressly quoted
                                                        I
Lavoisier, having myself made no experiments on such mix
tures.  (See Mem. Par. 1783, p. 599 and 600.)       Other
writers have frequently imputed to me mistakes of Bergman,
though I  expressly quoted him.

  III. A brief Examination         of the received Dotlrincs respefting
     Heat or Caloric.         By   Alexander Tilloch.               Read
     before the AJkeJian     Society, December 1799.
  I
                        [Concluded   from Page 126.]
      SHALL        now endeavour to prove that the position which
 maintains that       " heat, when in chemical union in bodies,
 cannot be made to manifest itself but by the action of some
 new chemical affinity, does not hold universally, and there
 fore may fairly be questioned.
     Gases,   as every one     knows, are formed      by the solution of
 certain bases in caloric.        (Whether light be also an ingre
 dient, or whether light be a modification of heat, or vice
 versa, affects not the present argument.)           The base or bases,
 and the caloric, are chemically united, and therefore the ca
 loric, according to the received doctrine, is latent in the gas;
 it is not cognisable by any external sign or organ of senje.            I
 (hall not stop to insist here upon the large increase of volume
 acquired     by the base so dissolved — an increase cognisable by
 our organs of vision, and also tangible if the gas be received
 in a bladder, having already used a similar argument when
 speaking    of   the conversion    of  water into steam — but  proceed
 to observe     that this chemically combined caloric may be, par
 tially at least, separated from its base by means merely me
 chanical.
    To   suppose that any body can by mechanical force be re
 duced into a smaller compass without any portion            of  its ori
ginal ingredients being thereby driven out of the mass, would
 be an absurdity. When we attempt to compress in a metallic
vessel, of a known capacity, a quantity of any gas equal in
volume to twice that capacity, we, by the mechanical force
employed with that view, absolutely cause a portion of one of
the ingredients in the composition of the gas to percolate
through the materials of which the vessel is m;ide (every sub
stance in nature being pervious to heat).             That ingredient,
that substance; is heat.         The vessel in this cafe performs the
office  of  a filter, suffering  the beat to pass, but keeping hack
the other ingredients;        and the quantity of heat passed off in
                                   Lei                               this

jr»                Examination of the received Doelrines
this cafe will be, if denominated by its volume, exaclly of the
bulk of the capacity of the vessel. If the vessel has been
charged with a quantity of gas equal in bulk to three times
its own capacity, the heat forced out will be equal in bulk to
twice that capacity ; and so of any other proportion of charge.
     Here, then, the lame eflect takes place as when we con
fine steam ; the means are mechanical in both ; the heat is
squeezed out through            the sides  of  the vessel by the force em
ployed,       as  water is squeezed from a spunge by pressure ap
plied to it.        Was the water in the spunge of a different na
ture before and after being expressed, first latent and then
sensible     ?   If it would be absurd to      say so,  why should we sup
 pose heat, when dislodged by similar means, to have under
gone any change as to its nature, and to have been latent
 before but sensible after ? meaning thereby that its character
 istic properties were different before and after the process.
      But have we any experiments that prove heat to be actually
 separated by mechanical force from substances in which it is
 lit Id to be latent or in chemical union? When the condenser
 of    mi    air gun, or any other proper vessel, is charged with
 more than one atmosphere, the materials, as the process goes
 on, b.'come         of  a   higher temperature than the surrounding
 bodies*, and heat is given off to them. This shows that
 heat is expressed fiom the contained air; and that, not being
  able to     pass freely,    but forced to pass more or less slowly,
  according to the conducting             power of the materials of the
  vessel, it is partially accumulated in til? materials, and then
  from them passed off to surrounding bodies to restqre equilU
  jjrium according         to the general law.
      If  the wall ot separation, which forces the confined             gas tq
  remajn charged with a smaller quantity qf heat than its con
  stitution would permit, but for the violence employed, be
  removed, what takes place ? The gas instantly seizes upon
  a   pq'rtionof the caloric employed         in maintaining the common
  temperature        of the surrounding bodies,        fitted U> its own ca
   pacity in its unrestrained        (late, and   in   consequence resumes
  |ts original volume.            This plainly    appears     tp be the   cafe,

for any substance placed before the cock when it is opened
is reduced in temperature.  Water so placed will even be
converted into ice, in consequence                       of   a portion     of   its heat
being violently seized                  upon by the gas, and              more quickly
taken into union with it than the privation experienced by
the water is compensated for by surrounding bodies in the
passage     of caloric from them               to restore the equilibrium.
  I am      aware that it may be              objected    against this experiment,
indeed      I   have heard the objection offered, that the friction                             of
the forcing syringe must excite or accumulate a considerable
portion of heat in the materials of which it is made ; that
the air, pasting instantly from it into the condensing ball,
must necessarily carry a portion of the heat along with it,
having no intermediate bodies to come in contact with ; and
that therefore we have no evidence of heat being in this cafe
expressed from the compressed air.
  Some force might be allowed to this objection, if the air,
when liberated, had no effect in reducing the temperature of
the bodies exposed to it ; but, as it has the power of taking
from them            a   portion of their heat, and of reducing them below
the common temperature, the objection falls to the ground :
for, if the heat found to be accumulated in the materials of
the condensing ball was only a consequence of its containing
air, made hot by passing from a cylinder heated byfriStion, the
air when liberated should blow hot, and raise the temperaure
 of   the bodies exposed to the                stream instead        of lowering          it,   as
 we find        it   does.      The     reasoning    here     is   conclusive, but any
 person may also have                   the evidence     of   a     direct experiment.
 Expose the ball              of   an air-gun, charged       only with one atmo
 sphere, to the heat               of   a   common   fire till the temperature of
 the ball be raised            a   few degrees   :   the contained air            will now
 be    in   a    situation to expand itself as soon as the valve                                 is
 opened     ;    for we know that the air has been heated        the                  by
 ball. Expose thermometer to the aperture as the air escapes,
                         a
 and the thermometer will indicate an increased temperature.
  I      have        heard    some object to the inference from                       a    con
 densing         ball being heated when charged,     questioning the by
 fact, for

 from the air, the effect may not be immediately obvious                                               :   it
 would be    long time before

 but who would therefore                             deny that heat has passed into the
 metal?             Instead      of applying their hands                        to the condensing
 ball, let them,                 as before        stated, place           a   thermometer in the
 stream        of   the air when liberated, and they may receive com
 plete evidence that the air demands     portion of caloric to        a

  I sliall here briefly state the results of an experiment under
taken for the express purpose of ascertaining whether there
had been any mistake                       in   the   fails      reported        by   others respect

the table, was charged with as much air as could be forced

        For   the execution      of this experiment     am indebted to the London

wiihed       to see   ascertained, the subject was taken up with that alacrity and
zeal    which characterises all its proceedings.                   The        apparatus wr.s prepared
by     Mr.   Varley,    experimenter            to that    institution,       and the experiment was
rn*Jc in      the presence       of   the Society on the          i$th of November          1799.
                                                                                                  charge

 charge the air, that thermometer sunk to nine degrees below
 the temperature          of the room, or sixteen degrees below the
 point to which          the other had         been raised by the expressed
 heat.
     It cannot     be urged that       in this experiment the air passed
 immediately from the syringe into the air-vessel, for it had
 to traverse a tube interposed between them of about four feet
 in length.
     Now, when it        is considered      that the thermometer was in
 contact with the        vessel  B in only      one   minute point (for the
 tube in which it was inserted,            and against      the side       of which
 the bulb rested, was more than three times the                         diameter of
 the   bulb),   and     that the whole surface of B was above J50
 square inches ; and when it is also recollected that only a
 small portion of the effect which the air issuing from D was
 capable of producing could manifest itself by means of the
 thermometer exposed to its action (as the thermometer was
 obliged to be kept at some distance to prevent its being
 broken by the discharge of the air); some idea, though not
 an adequate one, may be formed of the mass of heat that
 must have been 'thrown off from the whole surface of B in
 the process    of charging       that vessel *.
                                                                                 The
  *
    Subsequent to the delivery of the present      paper to the Society,    I received
Mr. Musliet's     interesting communication,      which was afterwards inferred
in the Philosophical      Magazine   for February    1800.    It  contains some cu
rious facts which confirm and illustrate       the results obtained from this ex
periment.    Speaking of the effects produced in the blall-furnacc              by the
nature, compression, and velocity of the air used, he observes that the com
pression always occasions an increase of temperature. On entering a blow
ing cylinder   immediately after stopping the engine, he finds the thermo
meter rise from 15" to 17 J* higher than the surrounding atmosphere., A
thermometer held in the middle of the current of blast was found to be
reduced below the common           temperature    as  much    as   the cylinder    was
raised above    it.   In  some cafes, when    the common temperature is about
540, the blast, as it issues,   will sink the thermometer        i°  or  j» below die
freezing  point.
    He states another fact (see also Mr. Roebuck's paper, Philosophical
Magazine, Vol. VI. p. 324.), which completely dots away every idea of
any part of the effect being derived from friction.            At some iron works

 21 6             Examination      of the received   Doiirims
    The   results obtained by the preceding experiment, though
 only a small part of the effect could be appreciated,               are suffi
 cient to ascertain the fact it was meant to establish             —that    the
 doctrine which         asserts  heat to   exist  in  a latent state in the
 atmosphere,       and    consequently    to   be not separable       from it
 without a chemical decomposition of the air, cannot be true,
otherwise      mechanical pressure and chemical decomposition
mean the same thing, which the advocates for the existence
of heat in two distinct states will hardly maintain.
    But the effect would be much more striking, and the
quantity of heat could even be comparatively estimated by
employing in the experiment such an apparatus as would
enable us, in some measure,            to intercept the heat as it passes
off from     the wbole surface      of  the air-holder,     and accumulate
it in  some liquid.
    After thinking on various contrivances, with this view, a
method of constructing such an apparatus occurred to me, a
description of which, though I have not yet had time to carry
it into execution, I         beg leave to lay before the Society.
                   Description    of a Gaso-Calorimeter.
    The gas-holder A, fig. a. of any capacity, fay a quart, con
structed     of tinned copper or any other metal, well soldered
and riveted at the joinings, should be made double, or, in
other words, the vessel, properly called the gas-holder, should
be covered with another of the same shape made of thin metal,
 (as tinned iron) in such a manner that the two may not
touch each other except at the lower part, where they are
fitted on, and soldered fast to one common collar.                    By this
means a space is left between the exterior surface of the gas-
holJer and the interior of the cover, to be filled with a fluid
for the purpose which shall immediately be stated. The in
terior vessel, which is to receive the gas, is open at the collar^
and into this collar is fitted the cock B, made of glass, be
cause of the mercury to be employed in the experiments, and
the purpose of e^uatising the blast.     In these the increase of temperature
is more sensible    than   in the blowing cylinder.    It takes place at a con
siderable distance   from any mechanical friction, and is therefore evidently'
produced bv heat extricated from the air.
                                                                            for

                           respecting Heat or Caloric.                                     217
 for    convenience of seeing.
        the                        The exterior vessel has an
opening at the top C, into which is fitted a glass tube CD.
Through this tube (or before fixing the tube in its place) fill
the space between               the interior       and    exterior       vessel   with any
coloured liquid.
 . If this double vessel be now filled with, and immersed     in,
warm water, it is plain that the heat thus communicated to
it will expand the coloured liquid contained between the in
terior and exterior sui faces, and make it rife to such a height
in    the glass tube as (hall correspond                  to the temperature         of the
water in which it is immersed.     By employing water                               of dif
ferent    temperatures    different degrees of heat, as ascer
                                  the
tained by an accurate thermometer, may be marked upon the
tube, or on a scale attached to it ; and thus the vessel itself
will, in fact, become a large hollow thermometer.

218               Examination of          the received      DoQrines
sure      of air contained in the vessel E, having now no way                           to
escape, will, by the ascent of the mercury in E, be forced                              to
pass through the cock B into the gas-holder A.                              As soon     as
this is perceived,          by the mercurv showing itself in                   the glass
cock B, flint that cock.
     The gas-holder will            thus become          charged    with two atmo
spheres,       and     that in    a   way     so  expeditions       as   to allow but
little time for the escape and loss of caloric, especially if the
tube FG be of large diameter, and if the vessel E have been
previously lined, and the vessel A covered over with some
bad conductor           of  heat.     The     expressed heat         must     then    pass
through         the fides     of   the gaso-calorimeter,            and there, exer
cising its action on            the    interposed      thermometric fluid, must
make        it ascend       in the tube      CD      to a height proportioned to
the heat thus communicated to the fluid *.
     Another atmosphere may be introduced by shutting the
cock F, opening a and b, and withdrawing another measure
of mercury as before, and then, by mercury poured into GF,
making the air to ascend into A, in the manner already de
scribed t.         Then note again the height to which the ther
mometric fluid rises in CD; and so of a fourth or a fifth
atmosphere         ;  observing      that the height of the column of mer
cury in        FG      must    always be proportioned to the number of
atmospheres          to be introduced.
     The quantity of          coloured      fluid contained between the ex                 -
terior and         interior of the double               vessel A,   should be deter
mined         by weighing         the quantity          introduced before gradu
 ating the tube CD. By this means it will be possible to de
 termine not merely how many degrees the heat expressed from
 the air raises the fluid in the tube CD, but to how many
 ounces       of the fluid it communicates that degree of tempera
 ture.       The weight of the materials of which the double vessel

     **  As mercury      is found to be a good conductor         of hear,      it would   be
 advisable to have a little oil, or some other liquid, in the vessel              E, before
 the    fust introduction     of the mercury.        The   oil would   rise on its surface,
 and the interposed stratum rising         "ith  'he mercury prevent its contact with

to the same degree.
     The    converse may be exhibited by the same apparatus                                              by
a different mode of operating.                               Detach the        vessel    A from the
vessel     E;      invert        it,   and sill     itwith water, previously deprived

latter with mercury                     in   the manner thai has been already de
scribed,         and to the cock                  b   adapt         an iron tube,        of   31 or 32

220            Examination of the received DoElrines
pressure, or the contrary, and that it will we have already
sufficient evidence, of what kind is the heat? According to
the received doctrine, it is nehher sensible nor latent heat ; for
that heat which, united to oxygen and azot, forms atmo
spheric   air, is not sensible,   and that which raises the tempe
rature of bodies is not latent:        but this heat constitutes one-
half, two-thirds, three-fourths, or four-fifths of atmospheric
air (according to the number of atmospheres compressed into
one), is a constituent chemical ingredient of the atmosphere,
and therefore    latenl heat: and yet it raises the temperature
of other bodies, without being separated from its union with
the oxygen and azot by the exercise         of  any chemical affinity :
therefore it \ssenfible heat.
   The doctrine      seems   evidently to stand opposed to itself;
or shall we, to avoid this conclusion, fay that heat has a third
mode of existence,      in which it may be called sensible-
 latent caloric          !  Absurd as such a position might be,
it would not      be more     so  than the doctrine of latent heat,
taking that term in its common acceptation.
   I meant to have troubled the Society with a few further
remarks on this interesting subject,          but, having already en
croached further upon its time than         I  at first intended,  must
defer them for the present.
   To conclude     : The doctrine of latent       and sensible heat ap
pears to me to have arisen       from a want of due attention to
the facts established by the veteran Black respecting the dif
ferent capacities of bodies for heat.           This eminent chemist
was the first who proposed any thing rational on this subject,
and, when the beautiful simplicity of the first principles
which he established is duly attended to, it appears wonderful
to me that the simple and permanent structure that might
have been reared upon them should have escaped his saga
cious observation.      Having     established    this incontrovertible
fact, that different substances have different capacities for
heat, this truth of itself necessarily embraced another, which,
though it could not possibly escape observation, has never
been applied as it ought; namely, that in every chemical
combination we effect we are altering the capacities of bodies
for heat,   and   consequently deranging         tlie equilibrium  ; for
                  9                                                  the

                      respecting Heat or Caloric.                  22%
 the product differs in its capacity from the ingredients; ana
 the fame holds in decompositions.           Had this been properly
 attended to,     it would have been       found perfectly sufficient,
when taken along with that property by which heat tends to
equilibrium, to explain the passage of heat from substances to
ether substances, without ever once supposing the heat changed
in  its properties.    Heat seems to act uniformly, and its effects
depend always on its quantity (not kind) compared with the
capacity of the body into which it enters : but it is continu
ally bandied about,       as it were,  by the constant changes that
are passing upon bodies, by which their capacities         for receiv
ing or holding it are altered ; so that it is in a constant state
of influx     and efflux in bodies, and there is going on a con
stant adjustment, as it were, of the differences existing among
them, each requiring its own stiare of the common stock, and
giving off, receiving, or merely transmitting heat, according
to circumstances.       Bodies are continually undergoing change
by the    auction  of heat.    This is admitted on all hands.     Is it
necessary then to look for a change in the agent as well as
the patient ? In many respects its action, as we have before
observed, may be illustrated by that of water. Different sub
stances require different quantities      of water to dissolve them ;
and different substances require different quantities of heat to
dissolve them.       The property which different substances have
to take in different quantities       of water, may be called their
capacity for water : but who ever talks of a certain quantity
of water, when diffused among any number of substances in
proportion to their capacities, being latent -water? or, when
an interposed hygrometer is affected by its passage from one
substance to another, of its being then sensible or free?

IV.     Refle&ions on the Theory               of the Infinitesimal Calculus.           By
     C.  Carnot, Ex-DireSorof                       the   French Republic, Minister
     of War, and Member of the                    National Institute, Paris 1797.
     Tranjlated from              the   French,       and illustrated with Notes,
     by  William Dickson, LL.D.
             To     the    Editor of      the   Philosophical Magazine.
           DEAR SIR,
   1 HE           mathematical readers of your excellent publication
need not be told of the importance of the infinitesimal calcu
lus, or of the assistance it lends to every part of natural phi
losophy, which falls not within the province of chemistry.
That calculus is practically the fame with what we call the
method of fluxions, except in name and notation.                                  But the
theories of the two methods are different ; or, rather, those
theories are only different ways of illustrating one ^ind the
fame method under different names and symbols.                                 The flux-
ionary theory,             as delivered       by its inventor,       the incomparable
Newton, is confessedly                the most accurate ; but the               infinitesi
mal, otherwise called                  the differential theory, is generally
thought,         I    know not for what reason, to be the most easily
understood *.               As it is often advantageous to consider a sub
ject in different points of view, it was perhaps fortunate that
 M. Leibnitz claimed this discovery, as he was, of course,
 obliged to give it a new explanation ; and thus we have the
 ideas of two of the most acute men who ever existed, on one
 of   the most extraordinary and sublime speculations                         which ever
 exercised the human intellect,
     • " We trust,"        said the excellent apoflle,    with infinitely more depth and
 propriety    than appears at first light;        "  we trust that we have a good con
 science."      I    trust   that  I understand      something of Newton's fluxionary
 theory ; but       I  never could     understand      the differential,   as delivered    by
  Leibnitz, in the AHa Eruditarum                  of Leipsic,    for   October   1684,    of
 which     the    learned      and ingenious      Mr.  Raphson has inserted a translation
 in his History of Fluxions.            I   believe most   impartial   persons, who    try to
  read that perplexed and perplexing piece, will be far from accusing the his-
  toiian of severity, when he says, that it contains           " far-fetched, symbolising,
  insignificant    novelties,''    and that the notation is     "  less apt and more labo
  rious." than that of the real inventor.
                                                                                          In

            On     the Theory       of tie Infinitesimal Calculus.                   323
  In     the essay,      of which the following is           a translation, the
two theories are blended, and   clearly explained, that those
                                            so
who think the pure fluxionary theory, even as facilitated hj
Mr. T. Simpson, in his excellent " Select Mathematical
Exercises,"  still somewhat difficult, may derive instruction
from the author's new and perspicuous way of treating the
subject. This theory, like other mathematical theories, being
of an abstract nature, may perhaps, after all, be more easily
conceived than expressed. And, as happens in the practice
of arithmetic, there may be persons who are expert in the
application of fluxions, but who have never been able fully
to satisfy       themselves as to the demonstrable                validity of the
theory.       It   should however be" remembered,                that all rational
practice entirely depends on sound theory ; and, to use the
words of the great Maclaurin *, in proportion as the " ge
neral methods are valuable, it is important that they be esta
blished above all exception ; and since they save us so much
time and labour, we may allow the more for illustrating the
methods themselves."
  Those who, with a competent knowledge of geometry, al
gebra, and the conic sections, attentively peruse the following
essay,     will
              perhaps wonder why a subject capable of such
clear illustration has been represented as so difficult. The
performance, though obviously not without faults, upon the               is,
whole, well worthy of the attention of such mathematicians
as   I    have     alluded    to.      The translation      is   as   literal   as    the
idioms of the two languages would bear; and    have annexed      I
notes where    thought they
                   I         would be useful.  Though de                         1

       Some years ago, the author of the following reflections re
    duced them to the         form in which he now presents them to
   the public.        He   is at present charged with business so very
   important     as   to  forbid  his resuming his former studies ; but,
   as every circumstance announces that the mathematical sci
   ences are about to soar to a new elevation,                  it is believed    that
   some advantage may result from the publication                      of a memoir
   in which     the theory     of  the differential calculus is discussed at
   large, and with precision, and in which are united the different
   points of yiew in which that theory has been considered.
                   RubjeB     of  the  following Dissertation.
       i.  No   discovery     ever produced          so  happy and      so' sudden a
  revolution      in the mathematical             sciences as the infinitesimal
  analysis ; nor hath any improvement furnished us with such
  simple and efficacious methods of arriving at a knowledge of
  the laws of nature. By decomposing, so to speak, magnitudes
  into their constituent elements,                 that analysis      seems,     as  it
  were, to have detected their internal structure and organisa
  tion.     But as all extremes elude the cognisance of the senses
  and the powers of the imagination, we have been able to
  form but an imperfect idea of those elements, a singular kind
  of beings, which must sometimes be treated as real quanti
  ties, sometimes         as absolute       nullities,   and which seem, by
 their equivocal properties, to               hold    a  middle     place between
  magnitude and zero, between existence and nothing *.
      Happily this difficulty hath not interrupted the progress of
 the discovery.         There are certain primitive ideas which are                     .
 always somewhat clouded in the imagination, but whose first
     *  I here speak in conformity     with the vague ideas which we commonly
 entertain   of infinitesimal quantities, 'Svhen we have not been at the painj
 to examine their nature.      But in truth, nothing can be more simple than
 the notion of infinitesimals.     Indeed,* to fay that a quantity is infinitely
small, is precisely to affirm,    that   it is the difference of two magnitudei
which have for their limit the fame third magnitude, and nothing more it
meant.      The   idea, then, of an    infinitesimal   quantity is not more difficult
 to conceive than that of a      limit;    but it has besides,  as is universally  a!.
lowed, the advantage of leading to         a much more simple theory.
                                                                   consequences,

which may be easily traversed.  Such appears to be the idea
of infinity, of which many geometricians, who perhaps were
never able to fathom       have made the most happy use *.

Philosophers, however, unable to content, themselves with                                            so
vague an idea, have been wishful to ascend to principles   but                               ;
in doing this, they soon found themselves divided  in opinion,
or rather in their manner of viewing the objects of their re
search.   My design in this performance    to reconcile those       is
different points of viesv, to show my readers their relations,
and to propose hew ones;                     and    I   shall     think myself well re
warded for my trouble,              if  I      should succeed          in throwing some
degree      of light on      a   subject       so   interesting.
The Origin which the Infinitejimal                          Calculus might have hadi

pressing    equations the different conditions of problem, and
              by                                                             a
in resolving those equations, might have given birth to the first
ideas   of the infinitesimal calculus. When,                         indeed,     it   is   too dis*
ficult to give an exact solution of                     a   question,    it   is   natural for
the analyst to seek the means                   of approximating              to   it   as      nearly
as possible,       by neglecting the quantities which                         embarrass            the
combinations,         if   it    be foreseen that such quantities,                           on ac
count of their small value,                                 without pro
                                               may be neglected,
ducing       any sensible         error in the result of the calculation.
Thus, for example,               as the discovery            of   the properties        of      curve
lines   is   very difficult,       they have been                 considered       as polygons

fathom quantities infinitely great or infinitely small       had almost said,
                                                                         ;   I
even in the restricted sense of the mathematicians, who define them to be
quantities greater (or less) than any assignable quantities.   Yet the rheta,-
physicians    can prove      that such quantities            must necessarily be             received
among the other e/itia ralianis; and the mathematicians demonstrate many
'of their relative powers and properties; just as the chemists, mulau's mu-

.226"'                          Carnot on         the Theory     of
of    a very great number             of    sides.         If, indeed, we.   conceive   2
regular polygon to be inscribed                       in    a circle, it is evident that
those figures, though they be always different, and can never
become identical, yet resemble each other more and more as
the sides of the polygon increase in number.     The circum
ferences of those figures, their surfaces, the solids formed by
their revolutions about a given axis, the analogous lines
drawn without and within them, the angles formed by those
lines, &c. are, if not respectively equal, at least the nearer to
equality the more the number of sides augments. Hence,
by supposing the number of fides to be very great, we may,
without any sensible error, attribute to the circumscribing
circle, the properties which we have discovered to belong to
the inscribed polygon.
      Farther,       the    sides    of this polygon evidently diminish                 in,
toiagnitude in proportion                  as   their number is augmented ; and
consequently,          if we  suppose the polygon to be really composed
of    a very great       number of sides, we may also affirm that each
of    those sides      is really very small.
      This being                 in the course of calculation,
                        understood,             if,                                     a
case happen to occur in which many operations would be
touch simplified                by
                       neglecting, for example, one of those
fides, which   small in comparison with
                      is                      given line that    a             ;        is,
 by employing  in  the  calculation   that given line instead of                        a
quantity equal to the sum of that given line and the little side
in question,      clear that this may be done without incon
                      it   is
venience       ;    for the resulting error must be extremely small,

not unusefully employed       mathematical combinations, and

that the quantities signified by these expressions may afford
much     help in facilitating     solution of divers questions
                                             the
which may be proposed.      For, the notion of such quantities
being once rightly understood and admitted, all other curves,
as well as the circle, may be considered as polygons of  great                   a
number of sides    all surfaces may be divided into
                     ;                                   great                 a
number of fillets or zones all bodies may be resolved into
                                         ;
corpuscles and,
              ;        word, all quantities may be decomposed
                         in   a
 into particles of the fame species with themselves. Hence
arise  new relations and combinations; and we may easily
judge, from the examples already adduced, of the resources
»n calculation, which the                    introduction       of    such   elementary
quantities must afford.
   7.   But   the advantages            of admitting          these quantities   is   still
more considerable         than could, at first sight,                   have been ex
pected.       For   we   have      seen,       in   the examples
                                              proposed, that
what was considered, at the outlet, as     simple method of     a
approximation, conducts us, at least in certain cafes, to re
sults perfectly accurate.                It   becomes         interesting, therefore,

to be    able to distinguish the cases in which this accuracy
<akes   place, and thus to convert this method of approxima
tion, into a calculus perfectly exact and rigorous;                     and such is
the object of the infinitesimal analysis.
   8. Let us first fee, then, how it came to pass that, in the equa
                   y           +

                                            found in article 3d, though we
neglected     MO       and     NO,       the justness   of the result   was not       af
fected ; or rather, how the result became exact from the sup
pression     of   those quantities,         and why     it was not exact before
that suppression.
  Now, the reason               of what happened in            the solution      of   the
above problem           will    easily appear,     on remarking that the hy
pothesis on which that solution is grounded, is false ; it being
absolutely impossible that a circle can be a true polygon, what
ever be the number              of its   fides ; so that there must result from
that hypothesis an error of some kind in the equation                         TP =
y (zy + NO)

less exact, as was proved by the comparison of the two tri
angles CPM, MPT, we found that MO and NO might be
neglected in the first equation.  Indeed these quantities ought
to be neglected, in order to correct the calculus, and to de
stroy the error w:hich had arisen from the false hypothesis first
assumed.    The rejection of quantities of this nature is not
barely allowable, but is absolutely necessary in such cases,
as being the only manner of expressing accurately the condi
tions of the problem.
The Accuracy                                     is owing      to a Compensation

For the distance of RS from MP, was not supposed nothing,
or even very small, but equal to a line arbitrarily assumed.
It follows, therefore, of necessity, that a mutual compensation
of   errors took place           in the comparison of the two erroneous
equations*.
                   ¦
                     Wby       this Compensation         takes place.
     10.    Having shown that                there    exist compensating errors,
¦whence       they originated and how they are proved, I shall next
proceed to explain them, and to search for a mark by which
it may       be known that a compensation takes place in calcula
 tions similar to the preceding, and the means of producing
such compensation               in particular      cases.
     * This     " compensation of errors" the acute Dr. Berkeley, Bishop of
 Cloync, in The Analyst, published in 1734, laboured to magnify into a
 serious objection        against   the differential calculus ; not considering that
 errors which we may make as little as we please, will affect the truth as
 little as we please.       Thus 1*999999, &c. is not, in rigid strictness, equal
 to';     but as, by annexing 9's, the error          may   soon be rendered incompre-
 benfibly minute,      no one can doubt        that its ultimate ratio to 2, is a ratio us
 equality.     Hence     the word false, applied by our ingenious author, in this
 paragraph and elsewhere, to differential equations, is abundantly too strong;
 and, had he read The Analyst, he would certainly have used a less excep
 tionable term, such as incorrect, or inaccurate, or imprrfeQ, a word which
 in the sequel he takes in a similar fense.            But false (faux.faujsc) signifies
 not minuteness of error, but a total negation of truth.                 It is not always
 easy, indeed,      to find     words    exactly suited to express   very abstract ideas.
 The     great Simpson (_Selefi Exercises, p. 239.) admits that, had Newton
 used the word limiting instead of ultitnate ratios, Dr. Berkeley might not
  have conjured up his         " Ghosts    of departed Quantities.'' Yet Mr. Simp
 son, and all other competent judges,             allow that Newton, by representing
  fluxions   not as in rhe tatio of the whole          increments, hut in the first ratio
 of    those   increments considered as nascent, or in their ultimate ratio con
  sidered at evanescent, has           effectually anticipated every reasonable     objec
  tion ; and this, no doubt,         the learned and ingenious       bishop would     have
  confessed,   had he given himself time to digest this doctrine, which is partly
  unfolded    in the present tract.        W. D.

=    —   -— ,    may be rendered              as    small     as we please             j and the
same thing would take                 place    if    there        were     any error in the
resulting equation               TP   = -^ — , and            if    that error depended
on the arbitrary distance of the lines MP and RS.      But no
such error can exist in this last equation ; because the point
M, through which the tangent must pass, is given, and not
one of the quantities, TP, a, x, ory, is arbitrary.
    Hence it follows, that the compensation of errors, which
takes     place in the equations                   TP   =    y        —— , and             -— - =
                                                                      RZ                   RZ

a — x
tities MZ and RZ, which caused those errors. Consequent
ly, after having introduced these last quantities into the cal
culation, to facilitate the expression of the conditions of the
problem, and having treated them, in the equations expressing
those conditions, as nothing in comparison of the proposed
quantities, we have only to eliminate those quantities out of
the equations, in order to free them from error, and to ob
tain an accurate result.
    II.The inventor of this method might therefore have been
conducted to his discovery by                      a very simple           train      of   reason
ing.
           " If, instead        of a proposed quantity," might he have
said,
          " I substitute       in my calculation a quantity which is not
equal to        it,   some   error will certainly result.  But  the dif               if
ference     of   the quantities in question be arbitrary, and                         I    have   it
in my power            to render that difference             as   small     as
                                                                             I        please, the
error cannot be dangerous.     may even commit several similar

I   have always         in my own power            the degree         of precision, which
I   choose to give to mv results.                   Besides,       it    may happen             that
those errorswill mutually compensate each other, and,        so,                            if

will suggest an answer to this question.  " In fact," might
the inventor continue,   " let me suppose for a moment that
the desired compensation has taken place, and let nie inquire
by what mark it ought to be indicated, in the conclusion of
the calculation.  Now it must naturally happen, that when
the quantities which occasion the errors disappear, the errors
themselves         will disappear at the same time.                           For    those quan
tities (such as MZ and RZ) having, by the supposition, ar
bitrary values, ought no longer to exist in formulœ, or re
sults, which are not arbitrary, and which depend:, not on the
will of the calculator,                but on the nature              of     the things whose
relation, expressed by those results, he proposed to investigate.
The mark, then, which announces that the desired compen

tities which produced the errors ; and therefore I have nothing
more to do, in order to effect that compensation, than to eli
minate those arbitrary quantities."
     12.    With     a     view to          more firmly in the
                                            six those ideas the
mind, and to give to the principles thence derived the ne-
cessarv degree of precision and generality,  shall remark, that          I
the quantities which we have occasion to consider in the suh-
ject    before us, may be distinguished into two classes. The
first class consists of quantities which are either given, or de
termined by the conditions of the problem, such as MC,
MP, PT, MT. The second                               class is composed              of quantities,
     RS, RT'f ST, which
such as                                              depend on the arbitrary position
of    the point      R,        and which, as the point                R      approaches       to the
point l\[,        do respectively             approach their corresponding quan
tities in the first class.                   Thus MP, for example, is the limit
of RS, that              is,   the fixed        term
                                            continually apto which        it
proaches,      you will, its last or ultimate value.
                   or,   if                               In?
like manner, MT   the limit or ultimate value of RT', and
                                 is
PT that of ST'. For the fame reason,          clear that the              it   is

of equality,        and such

 blems of the fame kind, let us now put the cafe, That any
 system whatever of quantities is proposed, in order that the
 relations which exist between them may be investigated *.
    14. And first, I shall comprehend under the name of
 assigned          quantities            squantilis           dejigneesj         not only            all the
 quantities proposed                 in          problem, but
                                          the very enunciation                    of   a
 also all those which  depend on those quantities, that                                                       is,
 which are functions of those quantities, and of none else.
      15.       On     the other hand,                I       shall give the names                   of    un~
 assigned, or auxiliary quantities,                             to all those which make no
 part of the system of assigned quantities, and which conse
 quently do not essentially enter into the calculation, but are
 introduced            solely       to    facilitate the comparison of proposed
 quantities.
   Thus, in the preceding example, MP, MC, MT, DP,
&c. are ajsigned quantities because they depend only on
                                                    ;
the position of the point As, to which the tapgent       to be                                       is
drawn.     But RS, and all its dependent lines, MZ, RZ,
T'T, T'P, &c. are auxiliary quantities because we should                 ;
not have thought of drawing them, except their assistance
had been wanted in the solution of the question, the object
of which      to discover the proportion, or relation, of MP
                    is
to       MT.
     *Ihere suppose that,    any problem proposed, the relations which exist
                                     in
between such    or such  proposed quantities has been previously discovered
If, for example, the problem be, to find curve which has certain dt-
                                                               a                               a
terminate property,           I   suppose      that the relation between an ordinatc of that
curve and the corresponding                    abscifTe   is   already known.              In like   manner,
if    it   were    required      to draw       a   tangent to.any indeterminate                point of that
curve,   I     begin     by   arbitrarily fixing on the point to which       wisli to draw I
the tangent, and       I      limit the problem to the investigation of the relation which
subsists, for instance, between the subtangent and the abscisse,                                   or between
the ordinate and the corresponding                        subnormal       at    that point.          But   if it
fliould    be asked      how   I    apply the definition            of infinity    to such questions as
these:     Is   matter divisible     ad    infinitum      ?    Is   the Jpace     in which         all   created
beings exist infinite  say,
                          f     I        if    such questions fliould be put to me,            fliould
                                                                                                   I
answer, that my definition                is   restricted to mathematical          infinity, and that
it   can only be applied to problems whose object                      is   the discovery of the re
lations which exist between different rr.athfmatical                           quantities,     and that the
metaphysical questions just stated can by no means be referred to the theory,
of which    I     here propose to establish           the principles,
                                     »                                                               Hence

     Hence it evidently follows, that into all unassigned quan
tities there necessarily enters something arbitrary ; for, if this,
were not the cafe, their value would then be assigned, by the
very conditions of the problem, and consequently they would
wholly depend on proposed quantities;              which is contrary to
the supposition.        .
     16.   Since in the mathematics, two lines, two surfaces,
 two solids,    in short two quantities of any kind whatever, are
 supposed     continually to approach each other by insensible
degrees;     so  that their proportion, or the quotient represent
 ing that proportion, differs less and less, and as little as we
 please, from unity,       we say, that the last, or ultimate ratio      of
 those two quantities is a ratio        of equality.
     17.   If  one   of   the quantities be assigned, and the other
 auxiliary, the first is called the limit, or ultimate value of the
 second.      Thus   a  limit is nothing else than an assigned quan
  tity, to which an auxiliary quantity is supposed continually
  to approach, in such a manner that their difference may be
  rendered    as small as we please,       and that their ultimate ratio
  may be a ratio     of equality.
      Thus auxiliary quantities alone can be properly said to
  have   limits; for assigned quantities, being supposed constant
  and unchangeable, and          to be themselves     the terms, or ulti
  mate values     of auxiliary quantities, cannot, in       strictness,  be
  said to have any limits      ;  unless we choose to say,      that every
  assigned quantity is its own        limit,  a liberty of  speech   which
   cannot be refused us; since the ultimate value of any de
   terminate quantity whatever can be nothing else than that
   quantity itself.
      18. Hence,       in general, we give the names of ultimate
   values and ultimate ratios of quantities, to the values and
   ratios which are, in fact, the last, or ultimate, ones assigned
  •to those  quantities and their relations, by the law of conti
   nuity,   when   each of them is supposed to approach, by con
   tinued and insensible degrees, to its corresponding assigned
   quantity.
       19.  We generally        give   the name    of  an Infinitely  small
   quantity,    to the difference      between    any auxiliary quantity
   whatever and its limit.         Thus, for instance, RZ, which is
                                      H   h s                            the

                            Carjiot       on the Theory
  236                                                            of
  the difference      between        RS     and    MP,        is what we call an          in
 finitely small quantity.
     20. On the other hand, we call every quantity Infinitely
 great, or simply infinite, which is equal to unity divided by
 an infinitely         small quantity : consequently the quantity
  ttt, or r— — — —            is infinite,      or infinitely' great.
  RZ          RS — Ms.                                               b
     But, since MP            is the    limit, or ultimate value, of .RS, it
 is evident      that o is the        ultimate value of RZ, or RS—MP,.
  and that 4 is the ultimate value                   of
                                                          RZ
     HI. Thus        we may affirm,              in general, that An infinitely
small quantity is a quantify whose limit is O ', and on the
  contrary, that An infinitely great, orjimply an infinite, quan
                                                   '
  tify is a quantity whose limit is .
     22. Under the name of Infinitesimal quantities, we com
 prehend quantities whjch arc infinite, or infinitely great, as
 well as those which are infinitely small.                         AH other quantities
 are caWed      finite.
     23. To fay, in conformity with common usage, that In
 finity is that which has no bounds, or is that which is
 without limit, or is that whose limit does not exist, is a
 mode      of   expression      which conveys              a simple      idea   of what      is
 meant, and whjch is by no means destitute of propriety ; be
 cause in fact, the limit of one kind of infinitesimal quantities
 is o, and that of ttye other £ ; and o and £ are not real quan
 tities *.
                                                                                  24. But,
    * This kind of notation, which            is in general use, is very apt and       signi
 ficant. But we are under no ncreliity            of making       o always rcpiesi.nl abso
lute nothing.      We   are at   liberty,   when     our    sub] rt requires it> to make

aud accordingly      may be represented by *. — Thus die diameter of the
                                                                                        earth

    34. But, from o and ^ being the limits of infinitesimal
quantities, it by no means follows that these quantities them
selves are chimerical entities.                 On the contrary, it appears
from the definition (article 19) that an infinitely small quan
tity is the difference between two very efficient quantities,
namely, between any auxiliary quantity whatsoever and its
limit.
     25. Hence it follows farther, that every infinitely small
quantity may be considered as the difference between two
auxiliary quantities, which have the fame third assigned
quantity for their limit.              For, let X and Y be two different
auxiliary quantities, whose limit is the fame third quantity
A. I fay, that X— Y is an infinitely small quantity. For,
since the limit, or ultimate value of                  X     is A, and that of Y
is also A, it follows that the ultimate value of X — Fwill be
A — A, or o. Therefore the limit of A + (X— Y) is A j
earth may be reckoned -very small,          compared with the distance    of the fun,
and as relative o, compared with that of any fixed star; and conversely,
the distance     of the  sun is very great,   and that of a fixed star *, or infinite
compared with the earth's          diameter. — Again   ;  supposing a rectangle to be
continually      diminished     by the parallel motion of one of its sides, the law
of continuity      tells us that it will come to o, or that the moving side       will
 arrive  at the fixed      side of the rectangle ; so that o here is not absolute
 nothing,   but it is a   line, which however may be looked upon as o, if com
                                                           *
 pared with the rectangle ; and the rectangle as , or infinite, if compared
 with the line.       In like manner,     a point  and   a rectangle are as o, or no
 thing, when respectively compared with a line and a parallelopiped ; and
 these last as
                  ' , or infinite, when       ectively compared with the two first.

 Thus    we fee that the fense of the o is always to be determined by the sub
 ject into which it is introduced.         See Emerson's P. S. to the id edition of
 his Algebra, where he replies to the Reviewers, who had misunderstood
 the very elegant solutions of his 73d and 74th problems.            •
     The 1st, 3d, 6th, and 7th corollaries to the former of these           problems
 will  be useful in this place.

and consequently we may consider X    —   Y as the difference
between an auxiliary quantity A ¦+¦(X — Y) and its limit
A, and this difference (by article 19.) is an infinitely small
quantity.              It may       therefore        be affirmed, in general, that                     An
infinitely small quantity is the difference between two auxiliary
quantities which have the fame limit.
   26. Two quantities cannot have the fame third quantity
for their limit, unless the ultimate ratio between those two
quantities themselves                    be a ratio           of equality.          For,      since,   by

 an infinitely      small quantity      ;  and, reciprocally,          the second is
 said to be infinite or infinitely great, relatively to the first.
      29. Two quantities are said to differ infinitely little, or to
 he    infinitely little different, from one another, when the ratio
 of the      one to the other differs from unity only by an in
 finitely small quantity ; so that their ultimate ratio is a ratio
 of equality, and such evidently are RS and MP.
     30. The Infinitesimal Calculus may be defined to be the
 art of discovering, by the help of quantities called Infinitesi
 mals, the proportions or relations, whatever they may be,
 which      subsist between the different parts of any system of
 quantities proposed.
      These infinitesimal quantities being nothing more than
 auxiliary quantities, introduced into the calculation only to
 facilitate the expression of the conditions of any proposed
 problem, it is evident that they must necessarily be eliminated
 out of the calculation, in order to obtain the desired result,
 namely,       the   relations sought.          Thus we may in some re
 spects affirm, That every Infinitesimal Calculation is an un
finished calculation ; for in fact, as soon as the auxiliary
 quantities, which are not essential, come to be eliminated,
 the calculation        ceases   to be infinitesimal,          and in every thing
 resembles an ordinary algebraic result •.
     To complete        the explanation        of  the principal       terms which
 relate to the theory        of Infinites in general, it remains for me
 to state what      I  understand      by an imperfect equation.
     31. I call every equation An imperfect equation, whose
 two. fides are unequal quantities, the difference however be
 tween them being infinitely small ; or, which comes to the
 fame thing, Every equation is imperfect, the two sides of
 which, though unequal,               have     for their ultimate ratio, the
 ratio of equality.
     Thus, for example, the false equations,                         TP    =   y —-.
                                                                                  t\Ju
         — —¦                                                      I
 and                           (fee article 9.) are what              call imperfect
                 =s
     9
        Every one knows, indeed, that       a calculation,     in which Infinitesimal
 quantities   have any place,     is not supposed to be finished,         and that we
 sever think the result accurate      till all  the  infinitesimal   quantities are en
 tirely eliminated,
                                                                          equations    j -

 equations, whence they are derived, are infinitely small quan
 tities.  On the theory, therefore, of this kind of equations
 is founded the solution of the question before handled, and
 that of all questions of that fort. For this reason it     that                       is,
I        shall proceed    to investigate     the principles    of the theory of
 imperfect equations, which     the        is        foundation of the Infinite
 simal Calculus, or rather, which                    is   itself that calculus.

                                                  a
brought up to the business of carpenter, enlisted at Amster
                                            a
dam, in the year 1781, as     soldier in the service of the
                                            a
Dutch East India Company,                       with whom he entered into an
engagement for seven years.                     On the 21ft of June he failed
from the Texel, and on the                 21st      of September            arrived    at the
Cape of Good Hope, where                    he was conveyed                 to the hospital
along with eighty-four other sick, who had come out in the
fame vessel. After being    month in the hospital, he was
                                     a
relieved       from military duly,          by    being taken into the service
ef Mr.                        at the Cape and president of
               Brand, the postmaster
the council, who sent him to Faisfe Bay, where he remained
a whole year, employed in various labours, such as loading
and unloading ships, Cutting down Wood in the mountains,
and other things of the like kind.
   Soon after he was promoted                   by
                                   his master to be his houfe-
fteward, and in this situation discharged his duty for some
time to the complete satisfaction of his employer, who after
wards carried him back with him to the Cape Town           but                         ;
having quarrelled with his mistress, he found himself exposed
to so much ill-treatment,  that he resolved to desert, and to
make his way to Europe     land.    In order that he might be
                                    by
better able to carry this plan into execution, he requested his

toaster to send him back to False Bay, where he expected            he
should    have an opportunity     of effecting his escape     with the
less   danger  of detection.    This request was granted, and he
set  out for the Bay on the    14th of November 1783, after hav
ing put -his box into the Company's waggon, received twelve
months pay due to him, and disposed of various articles
which     he considered as entirely useless for his intended expe
dition.
    Among     the  Dutch   troops  at the Meisenberge     was   a cor
poral named Martens, a native of Hanover, who having
accompanied Colonel Gordon on a journey into the interior
part of the country as far as Caffraria, had constructed a map
 of the districts through which he had passed and presented it
 to the Company, under an idea that he should be rewarded
 for his trouble ; but instead of a reward, he was enjoined,
 tinder the pain of severe punishment, never to attempt any
 thing of the like kind in future. This man however was so
 fond of these pursuits, that he still amused himself with
 making charts, and our traveller after some difficulty pre
 vailed on him to allow him to copy some of them in order to
 assist him in his enterprise.
     On the 24th of December, every thing being ready for his
journey, he obtained leave of absence from the sergeant on
 command under pretence of going to the Cape Town, but
 proceeded    towards   Stielenbusch,   so called  from a governor of
  the name    of Van Stiel, who formerly     presided over the   Dutch
  settlements    at the  Cape, where he arrived next evening.
 Being acquainted      with the bailiff of this farm, who had often
  seen him at Mr. Brand's house,         he accosted him with     con
  fidence, and was received in a very friendly manner, especially
  as he told him that he was go'ng to his master's plantation,
  to fee that every thing was properly conducted.
     At this    place Dambcrger     purchased    a new (owling-piece,
  and on the 36th proceeded       to the farm of another acquaint
  ance, named Munch, from whom he obtained two pounds
  of powder and thirty balls. On the 27th lie came in fight of
  his master's farm, but did not approach it till the evening, lest
   he should be observed by the bailiff.       As  soon as it was dark
  he went privately into the apartment inhabited by the slaves,

  242                       Travels   through     the
  whom he requested not to sav any thing of his arrival, and*,
  after partaking of some refreshment, retired to rest, but with
  a mind so agitated that he enjoyed very little sleep.                 Next
  morning at day-break he continued his journey, and on the
  19th of February reached Blettenberg's Bay, where he pur
  chased     several things necessary      for his intended expedition,
  such as a calabasli     to hold water,     a few more     pounds of pow
  der,   a   flint  and  steel, matches, &c.         During the few days
  that he remained here,          he took up his lodging in the house
  of  a person     named Vogtmeyer, who was not then at home ;
  but he* was kindly entertained by his wife, and he embraced
  this opportunity of obtaining from the Hottentots in the fa-
, mily every information possible respecting the route he in
  tended      to pursue.     The country       around    this place has a
  beautiful appearance, and is exceedingly fertile ; it abounds
  with timber of every kind, and has a good supply of ex
  cellent water.       When Vogtmeyer returned, which was on
  the 25th of February, he received our traveller with great
  sriendsliip, but at the same time told him that he knew he
  Was a deserter, and that he would send him back to the Cape,
  where he was sure he sliould be well rewarded by his master.
  He however entertained no such design; for, after being in
  formed of Danibcrger's         real views, he furnislied      him with a
  knapsack       made   of  a calf's   skin,   a  hand-bill, with     several
  other small articles, and wished him            a good  journev.
     Our traveller, who         had   now got to the distance of 74
  miles from the Cape, again sot out on the 26th of February,
  and, pursuing his way towards Cassraria, arrived next day at
  the   first Hottentot     kraal he had       seen,   which    consisted  of
  about twenty huts.         In this kraal he remained nine davs, at
  the end of which time he had an opportunity of continuing
  his journey in company with some Hottentots of another
  kraal, who had come hither to procure slicep.                Having pro
  ceeded two miles with great difficulty through the long grafs,
  which      rendered   their progress exceedingly tedious and tire
  some, they halted for the night on the banks of the Silver
  River ; but were unable to sleep for fear of the wolves, which,
  attracted by the sheep, kept prowling around them ; as they
  were afraid of kindling sires to frighten them away, lest they
                                                                      sliould

 should     set sire  to the grass, which was exceedingly long and
 almost dry.
     In the morning they              reached    the   summit of the       Milk
 Mountains, where              they found good pasture ; they therefore
 fat down to breakfast, and turned their sheep loose to feed.;
 but scarcely had they put a morsel to their mouth, vvheu they
 espied ten men rapidly advancing towards them.                       Our tra
 veller having soon learned from his companions that these
 strangers, were Boslimen, who no doubt would attempt to
 plunder them of their sheep, he endeavoured to inspire them
 with courage, and, immediately loading his piece, fired it at
 the enemy, one of whom fell ; the rest then, discharged their
assagays, and betook themselves               to flight.
    Next morning our traveller arrived at the kraal where his
 companions resided. As he was much fatigued, having spent
 several     nights without the least repose, he threw                  himself
 down in one of the huts and enjoyed a found sleep.                      When
 he awoke the Hottentots              brouoht him some milk           and roast
 mutton      ; and whilst he was partaking            of this repast the chief
 of   the horde entered          the   hut in his dress of ceremony, and,
 bowing several times before him, thanked him for the affist-
 ance he had given to his countrymen.                    The chief then told
 him that these Boslimen, a few days before, had stolen from
the kraal thirty (heep.             Our traveller, in consequence of this
 information,        inquired what might be the strength of the
horde, and where they resided.                  Being informed that they
 consisted     of about thirty men,        and that they resided at a place
in the mountains a few miles distant, where, to guard against
 the danger of an attack, they had fortified themselves behind
a kind    of abbatis,      and were furnished with a great number             of
stones,      he told the Hottentots that he thought             it not impos
sible   to drive them          from their lurking-place,        and offered to
lead the attack,         if they would     promise to support      him.    The
chief     listened     to this     proposal    with    great  pleasure,   as it
held    forth hopes         of recovering the         stolen slieep ;   but he
started some objections            as to the   practicability of carrying it
into execution.           It   was   however at last agreed that the at
tempt sliould be made, and D;imberger, after giving proper
instructions to the Hottentots, desired each to furnish himself

244                      Travels through    the
with   a stout   cudgel,  a bundle of dry grass, and      a  little dry
wood.    •
           As   soon as it grew dark,       they proceeded in great
silence towards the mountain, where, as soon as they arrived,
our traveller divided the whole troop into two bodies, one
under his own command,            and the other under that       of the
chief.     They then rushed towards the first fence, which being
instantly set on sire, the flames were soon spread by the
wind, and in a little while the whole mountain seemed to
form one general conflagration.          They now proceeded to a
place  at   the bottom   of the  mountain,     by which it was sup
posed the enemy would be obliged to make their escape.
Here they had not long waited, when they heard a dreadful
howling, and saw several of the Boshmen half scorched rush
ing through     the flames.     To terrify  them   the more,     and   at
the fame time to give a more general signal to the Hotten
tots to attack them, our traveller discharged his piece among
the flying enemy, who were attacked with such fury by his
Hottentot allies, that this whole horde of plunderers were ex
tirpated.     Next morning     they not only recovered some       of the
stoleu sheep, but found several more which had belonged to
the enemy. When the conquerors returned to the kraal,
they were received with great joy.             As our traveller found
himself much fatigued by the expedition, he retired to enjoy
some rest in the      chief's   hut, but the Hottentots spent the
whole night in rejoicing on account of their victory.
   Damberger continued two weeks among these people, who
treated him with great respect ; but as it was then the most
favourable period for travelling, he resolved to proceed and to
take advantage      of the winter season, as it is called, which
takes   place   in April,   and   which    however is distinguished
only by the weather being rainy and the air cooler.
    In consequence     of this resolution    he left the kraal on the
25th of March,        and   directed his course eastwards towards
Fish River,     but with some caution to avoid falling in with
any of    the Dutch plantations,     of which there were several in
the neighbouring districts. After passing another kraal he
took up his lodging for the night in a third, which was the
last within the jurisdiction of the Dutch East India Company.

                                                                     "  Mr.
Vaillant    has given a very ample description            of   the manners
 and customs       of these people, but      he is not always correct.
     "   The chief of a horde bears           the title of Montur.      This
 office however is not hereditary, and the persons chosen to
 fill it are those who have distinguished themselves by some
 heroic action, such       as  killing   some savage animal,      or obtain
 ing    a victory    over the enemy. The chief of each kraal,
 whether it lies within the jurisdiction of the Dutch or not,
 receives from the Company a large cane,                having at the top
 a silver    knob,     inscribed with the         Company's arms, and
 which is borne by           the    chief on    solemn   occasions.     Each
 Hottentot       also receives annually two pounds          of  tobacco   and
 two bottles       of brandy    ;  but, in return, must        endeavour    to
  learn in some measure           to understand      the Dutch language.,
  Those who reside among the planters learn it with great ease;
  but those who live at a distance must embrace some other
  opportunity of learning it         : and when the Monturs go to the
  Cape Town, they must always carry with them some men
  belonging to their horde, to whom various occupations, such
  as cutting wood, &c. are assigned in the castle, that they may
  become      familiar with the language by frequenting the com
  pany of    the soldiers,    and the inhabitants.        When the Mon
  tur goes to the Cape the next year, he carries with him some
  more of his countrymen, and those who came the preceding
   year return. These Hottentots are perhaps the laziest people
   in the world ; but in. many parts            of their country     they are
  destitute    of water.    They     leave the most fertile fields unculti
   vated,  and     only plant here and there a little Turkish            corn.
   Their chief occupations        are the rearing of cattle and hunting,
   biit they pursue the latter only when compelled by necessity
   and the want of food.             They pay little attention to fissiing,
   though they have very good opportunities, especially in win
   ter, of catching fish without great exertion. There have been
   instances    of their enduring hunger for        several days rather than
                                                                          give

      246                       Travels through the
      give themselves      the   least   trouble to search for food.        The
      Company have frequently offered              to supply them with nets,
     corn, and other articles, and to assign lands to them nearer
     the Cape, if they would only become a little more active and
     industrious — but without the least effect ; as they believe that
     in this   cafe they should        be exposed      to more    bodily labour.
     They   prefer    living in  poverty     in the midst of the deserts, in
     a state little superior to that       of their   cattle ; and are so timid
    as to suffer themselves          to be driven sometimes         towards the
     South by the Caffres, and sometimes towards the East by the
    Bofhmen.         If they could only assume a little courage, they
     would soon make their enemies sensible of their power ; but
    they have very little care for the future.
        "  The women are very active in the management of their
    domestic economy, but have a considerable degree of vanity,
    for they employ a great deal of their time in ornamenting
    their persons.       To a mother a child is a great treasure, and
    the husband dare never presume                to take it into his hands as
    long   as it  is at the breast,      though in other respects he treats
    his wife    as  his slave.    This right has been claimed by the
    mothers in consequence of the cruelties formerly practised
    by the fathers; for, when the Portuguese first visited this
    country, many of the men fold their children to them for
   brandy or tobacco; this incensed the mothers, and therefore
   they assumed the above privilege.                 A child is suckled for
   four months, during which time the mother in the day
   carries it about on her back wrapped up in a sheep's skin,
   but in the night places it in her bosom ; after that period it
   is suffered to lie on     a  mat spread out on the grafe, and has
   the fame food as the rest of the family..
        " I was much pleased with their treatment of the dead.
  They never bury them until every mean possible has been
  tried to recall them to life. Those who die of chronic or lin
  gering diseases, they (hake and beat on the ribs with their
  fists ; if they exhibit no signs of life, they are interred the
  fame evening, but not until similar experiments have been
  tried to revive them.          On young persons who die suddenly

life appear,       they are committed to the earth next evening.
The    corpse      is  immediately carried out from the hut, and
watched by some of the relations, who do the fame thing for
twenty-eight days after it has been buried, in order to pre
vent it from being torn up by wild beasts.
    Our traveller       resumed       his journey on the 25th, directing
his course towards Fish River, andaon the 29th entered- Caf-
fraria,   where at first he had to ascend                steep   mountains,      but
towards evening descended                  into the level       country.       After
passing    through       several hordes       of Caffres, by whom            he was
in   general     well received,        he arrived     at a kraal consisting        of
127 huts, and containing 1400 inhabitants.                         As he was here
treated with great friendship, he remained some weeks ; and
having heard from the natives, among whom he saw several
European articles, that            a sliip had been stranded         on the coast,
at a place      lying   at the distance        of two    days journey,        he re
 solved to go thither,          and prevailed       on some of the Caffres to
accompany him.               They accordingly set out on the 27th of
April, and next evening reached the remains of the vessel,
which were lying in a bay between Fish River and the river
St. Lucia. Here they found several half-putrid bodies, most
of them pierced with wounds, scattered about on the shore,
and intermixed with casks, chests, bales of cotton, and other
articles, entirely spoilt by the sea water and the sun.                        What
chiefly attracted the notice of the Caffres was the iron work
belonging to the ship, of which they collected as much as
 they could.         After burying the bodies f, and picking up
 various articles, among which was a pocket compass, they
 set out to return.          The compass, which was not injured, fell

    +  This  fliip had been lost in consequence of a mutiny which broke out
 among the crew, who first murdered their officers, and then ran the vessel
•n shore.    The     crew   then   landed,   and wandered about in the country,
where they either fell a sacrifice        to the climate or were massacred     by the
Caffres.   Of   the whole ship's company       four only  escaped,  and of these four
 two died of dicir wounds.          The other two made their way       to the Cape.
                                                                                   to

 S48                       Travels  through the
to the lot    of our traveller, who    considered   it as an acquisition
of no   small importance.
    On   the    aoth of May, Damberger took leave of these
friendly Caffres, and, after encountering considerable dangers
and difficulties between that period and the nth of July*
directed    his course eastwards,      with    a view of proceeding to
Egypt.        Towards     evening   he   discovered     some huts at a
distance,     but was not able to reach them          ; he therefore lay
down on the grafs with his head on his bundle to enjoy
a little rest, but was soon roused by four Caffres, who con*
ducted    him to their huts.       Here he was robbed of his fowl
ing-piece and bundle, but they were both afterwards restored.
 He was attacked also with a violent pain in his bowels j but
on making known his complaint to one of the Caffres, he
gave him some dried leaves to chew,            which   acted as a strong
emetic, and soon afforded him relief.
    Among      the next horde whom he visited he was more un
fortunate,     being robbed both of his bill and his fowling-
piece ;   the former he recovered, but the latter was broken to
pieces   by the Caffres in order that they might convert the
iron part of it into points for their affagays.
    Soon after leaving this horde he was obliged to pass the
night in the open air on the banks of a rivulet, where he
made a large fire to frighten away the wild animals, but was
unable to steep a moment on account of the multitude of
snakes which swarmed around him             ; and towards morning he
saw hundreds        of large baboons. The latter had taken up
their station on all the neighbouring trees, and did not seem
in the least shy or afraid.
    Of these    people   the author says,     " This   nation, as well as
several more      of the  African tribes,   are accused    of indolence,
but I am convinced that the industrious Europeans, if trans
 ported hither, would be equally inactive. The heat oppresses
the labourer too much, and exhausts the powers of the body ;
 to this it may be added, that most of these tribes are destitute
 of  the necessary implements,         such as spades, hoes,    &c. and
 the ground is so hard that, before any other tool can be used,
 it must be cut up with a sort of pickaxe. The cultivation

observed     that   two    stout active men could till in a day no
more than six feet square.           The land, after being sown, was
covered,    to  the height    of  two inches, with sand, in order that
the excessive heat might not too soon dry up the moisture,
and to prevent the ground from cracking by the drought and
the rain. They derive more advantage, without much la-
br>ur, from rearing of cattle, and from hunting and sistiing.
This nation,      indeed,    have a strong propensity        to stealing, but
they never commit murder;             and much        less   do they devour
human fleslu         Several    Europeans *, however, who have vi
sited these people,      assert  that they ea.t human flesti with great
avidity; but this is absolutely false.           If a traveller understand
their language he has nothing to fear, especially if badly
clothed and in possession of no articles of value.               If they take
any thing from him, he may rest assured that they will give
him something of theirs in Teturn if he asks for it.
    "The dead are interred at some distance from the kraal, and
the relations kindle a large sire near the spot, which they
maintain      three days, to prevent the savage animals, that
might be attracted by the smell, from coming to tear up the
body.     Few persons die in the kraals, as the sick are removed
to huts situated at a distance;         for they believe that every dis
ease is  infectious, and thai it is their duty to guard against
the contagion."
    After  a stay  of  three weeks among these people,             whom our
traveller calls the Jamatians,         he continued his       journey,. and,
crossing    the   Makumbo river,         entered    the    territories of the
Muhotians.         Here he was at first treated           with great harfli-
ncss and severity, but he (till found friends among the female
sex.    While he remained with this tribe he was conducted
to a place where he found the bodies of five white men co
vered   with wounds, and apparently pierced with assagays :
on their right arms he observed the figure of a crucifix, with
the letters    H, I, E, M,      and the date 1779.
    On  the second ot October he arrived among another tribe
tailed the Kamtarians,          who inhabit     a  district situated on the
iriver Tambo,       and who live chiefly by hunting and the rear-

ing of    cattle.  The  men in general are    of low stature, and have
short woolly hair.       These people were    of a darker complexion
than the other tribes he had quitted. They consisted of fix or
seven thousand, of both sexes, capable of bearing arms. The
women were of larger fize than the men, and exceedingly
bold and courageous. The greater part of them had been
carried away by force from other nations, or had been taken
prisoners      in war and retained by the men. These people
never rear their female children,         but destroy them as soon as
they are born.        There are no priests among them, though
there is reason to think that they are not destitute of religion.
The oldest inhabitant in each village acts generally in the
capacity of chief and judge.            Polygamy is allowed among
this tribe ; and every woman not pregnant by her husband
is at liberty to cohabit with any other man whom she chooses,
and    if  she bring    forth a boy to him, flic may become his
wife.
    These people are exceedingly superstitious, and, when the
least misfortune       befalls them, shut themselves up in their
huts, where they remain totally inactive for three or four
days.      When any one of their nation has been wounded or
killed by wild beasts while hunting, they fay " he offended
the great god ;" but if such an event take place in the night
time, and particularly by moon-light, they fay, " he offended
the little god," and on that account was punished. If a woman
die in childbed, which, however, is seldom the case, she is
buried in a particular spot, and her family must remain six
moons, at some distance         from the village, in huts set apart
for that purpose,       without   having any intercourse with the
 rest of the tribe.        If a woman bring forth a male child
during     cloudy   weather, or when the moon does not shine, it
is concluded that his father has offended the gods, and that
 the boy is not worthy of being         a  respectable  member of   so
 ciety.     When     he grows up, therefore,    he is employed in the
 most menial offices, such as cutting wood, guarding the cat
tle, arid other seivices of the like kind. Neither circumcision,
nor   any similar practice, is known in this country.
    If  a woman be delivered       of a boy at a  fortunate period, the
father kills     a

of his family.    The dead are generally buried by their rela
tions under large trees. During the time of the funeral a
large sire is kindled, in which the effects of the deceased are
burnt, and the ashes are thrown into the grave.      The fire is
kept burning till the next full moOn. Whoever steals a mar
ried or unmarried female, may keep her as his wife ; but, if
he does not choose to do so, he may sell her, and in return
generally receives        a sheep,       or     a greater       or   lese   number of assa-
gays,  according to her beauty.     These people are kind and
hospitable to strangers.
  Damberger left the Kamtarians on the 7th of October,
and on the 30th, after passing through part of the kingdom
of Biri, arrived in         the territories          of       that   of Mataman.         The
sovereign      of this country          rules    with unlimited power, and is
stiled Sohaawoia, that            is,   Chosen           by

hereditary to females as well as males. When one of the
former succeeds, she may choose from her subjects   husband                       a
to participate with her in the governnient.    The person so
chosen,       however, must be sirlt examined                        by     the oldest part   of
the community,            in order that             it   may be known whether he
possesses the talents         necessary for the intended dignity.                         The
king    here acts in the capacity  of high-priest, prophet, and
tutor to the youth.      His decisions are respected even when
he judges wrong.        He possesses the exclusive privilege Oi
 having   a plurality of  wives, and must install the inferior
judges, priests, &c.     He never takes the field against the
 enemy,   but delegates  the command of the army to another.
 The soldiers are brave, and exceedingly expert in managing
their bows and arrows.                  They        are said to amount to about
30,000.    There are three large cities in the kingdom, the
capital of which, called Secnhofa, lies at the distance of two
days journey.   This city, the residence of the king, our tra
veller resolved to visit      ;    and, being furnished with                     a   person to
show     him the way, soon reached the place. On his arrival
he repaired to the Mohtvoia*, who gave him some corn and
sour    milk, and conducted him into his hut, where he was

allowed to pass the night. Next morning the Mohwoia cas
tled him through a long street, bordered on each side with
huts, to a kind of green, where he was introduced to the
Wing, whom he found standing amidst a circle                of his attend
ants, and who appeared to be about forty years               of age. The
day before he had taken             four florins from his vest *, in order
that he might make an              offer of them to the sovereign.    This
he accordingly did, and requested  his majesty's protection
and a supply of food. The prince, after looking some time
at the money, ordered one of his wives to fetch some milk
and meal, which being mixed together and stirred round, our
traveller fat down on the ground and made a hearty meal.
He theti accompanied the king into his hut, where a mat
<vas brought for him to sit upon. The king asked him for
some more money,' and               told    him that in return he would
make him       a
             lahftcto (servant). Damberger protested that he
had none; but, as he was desirous of becoming acquainted
tvith the manners and customs of the country, he" informed
the king that he gratefully accepted his offer. Observing,
however, some days after, that he was considered in the light
of a common slave, he resolved to make his escape the first                                ¦
Opportunity he could find for that purpose.
  On the 29th of November, having been obliged to accom
pany the king his master on a hunting excursion, for the pur
pose   of can-ying     a calabash          silled with
                                                    leather bag

containing millet, and a javelin, in passing through a wood
interspersed with small hills he pretended to be suddenly taken
ill with pain in his bowels, and immediately fat down on one
          a
of these eminences.    The kinc, not suspecting any deception,
gave him permission to remain till he should call for him, and,
taking the javelin from him, proceeded forwards; but as soon

thermometer No. 1.      No. 4 was stationed, by way of stand
ard,, at a' inches from the former, and at an equal distance
from the fire. Before the thermometers was a flip of maho
gany, which had three holes in                        -,90

inches diameter, and                     a' inches long*.                       This, being made
red-hot,       was    upon an iron handle fixed on a stand so
                      stuck
as to present one of its circular faces to a lens placed at 2.8
inches distance ; its focus being 1.4 inch, and diameter 1.1,
Before the lens, at some distance, was placed a screen of wood,
with a hole of an inch diameter in          way of limiting the it,   by
object, that its image in the focus might not be larger than
necessary.       The     screen also served to keep the heat from the
thermometers.           No.         2    was situated in the secondary focus                              of
the lens   ;    and   No.     3     was       placed         within        T% of an inch of               it,
and at the fame distance                      from the lens                as No. 2. By this
arrangement, both thermometers were                                         equally within the
reach of transmitted heat  or,  there was any difference,
                                             ;          if                                                it
could only be in favour of No. 3, as being behind    part of                                 a
the lens which,   on account of its thinness, would stop less
heat than the middle. Now, as the experiment gives     result                                    a
which differs from what would have arisen from the situation
of   the thermometers, on                    a   supposition          of   transmitted       heat, we
can only ascribe   to   condensation of
                         it         a      the refraction of           it       by
the lens; and, in this cafe, the thermometer No. 3,       its                                        by
situation, must have been partly within the reach of the heat-
image formed in the focus. During the experiment, the ther
mometers were alternately screened two minutes from the
effects   of   the lens, and exposed to                       it    for the same length of
time, and the result was                      as    follows     :

Cannot be accurately ascertained by looking at it in a room
not sufficiently dark to make very faint tinges of colour vi
sible.        And      to   this must be added                   that the incipient                 red
rays must actually be scattered over                    space,       a considerable
near the confines of the spectrum, on account of the breadth
of the prism, the whole of which cannot bring its rays of
any one colour properly together ; nor can it separate the in
visible raj's entirely from the visible                       ones.          For,       as the      red
rays     will                      in the beginning of the vi
                be but faintly scattered
sible spectrum ; so, on the other hand, will the invisible rays,
separated by the parts of the prism that come next in succes
sion, be mixed with the former red ones.                                   Sir    Isaac    Newton

     There are some difficulties                        in this experiment ; but they
arise not so much from the nature                            of this kind of heat, as
From our method    of obtaining it in a detached state. A red-
hot lump of iron, when cooled so far as to be no longer
visible, has but a feeble stock of heat remaining, and loses
it   very fast.         A    contrivance               to renew and              keep     this heat
might certainly be made, and I sliould, indeed, have at
tempted to carry some method or other of this kind into exe
cution,         had     not the following trials appeared to me suffi
ciently conclusive          to render it unnecessary. Admitting, as has
been proved in the 15th experiment, that the alternate rising
and falling of a thermometer placed in the focus of a lens,
when the ball of it is successively exposed to, or screened
from, its effects, is owing to the refraction of the lens, and
cannot be ascribed to             a mere           alternate         transmission         and stop

the contrary, came to its maximum by alternate great ele
vations and small depressions ; and afterwards lost its heat by
great depressions and small elevations. After the first eight
minutes, I changed the place of the assistant thermometer,
by putting it into a still more decisive situation ; for it was
now placed by the fide of that in the focus,                      so as to  partici

unseen,      we know must be formed in the                      focus  of the lens.
Here,      if  our reasoning be right,             the assistant thermometer
should     be affected by alternate           risings and fallings ; but they
should not be         so considerable      as those    of  the lens.

        X'     All which        so  clearly confirm the effect of the re
 fraction of the lens, that it must now be evident that there
 are ravs issuing from hot iron, which, though in a state of
 total invisibility, have a power of occasioning heat, and obey
 certain laws of refraction, very nearly the fame with those
 that affect 'light.
     As we have now traced the rays which occasion heat, botk
 solar and terrestrial, through all the varieties that were men
 tioned in the beginning of this paper, and have shown that,
 in every state, they are subject to the laws of reflection and
 of refraction, it will be easy to perceive that I have made
 good a proof of the three first of my propositions. For the
 fame experiments which have convinced us that, according
 to our second and third articles, heat                 is both rerlexible       and-
 refrangible, establish also its radiant nature, and thus equally
  prove the first of them.

    Heat, excited by a Stream of Oxygen Gas thrown upon
   ignited Charcoal, on a Number of Gems and other refrac

XVII.xxFTER                  the experiments already described,       it wa»
proposed by several           of the members that some attempt should
be made to determine the degree of heat which had been
excited ; and, with a view to this end, a fragment of one of
Mr. Wedgewood's pyrometer pieces was subjected to the
blast  :   in  a few seconds, however, it became perfectly fused.
It   does not appear, therefore, that we are at present in pos
session   of any     better instrument for appreciating the intensity
of   heat thus produced than the gems themselves, which, as
some     of them are more refractory than others, and many of
them more          so   than most other substances,          may, from the
 changes which they undergo,             serve to afford   a rough method
 of estimating      the comparative degree       of temperature.

   XVIII. A         ruby-spiuel,      which weighed |£ths of a carat,
was, like the preceding stones, exposed in an excavation made
in a piece of charcoal ignited by means of a common blow-
pipe, to a stream of oxygen gas from the gasometer.                   At the
end of a '3" it had lost neither weight nor colour, but had
assumed the appearance of a rough garnet, having apparently
undergone a very slight and superficial            fusion, just sufficient to
injure its polish.

   XIX.       These stones are colourless, and harder than rock-
crystal, but      less   so    than the ruby.     They are usually found
in diamond-mines,              and, when well cut and set, play nearly
as well as rose diamonds.             That   they are however essentially

different from the diamond, needs no other proof than their
incombustibility.
   One which weighed ££ths of a carat, exposed to the heat
for 2', was found to have lost no weight; whereas a diamond
of the fame size would in that time have been entirely dissi
pated,     and  resolved  into carbonic acid gas.     The stone lost
its transparency, aud assumed the appearance           of a piece of
white enamel : it had evidently begun to fuse, but some traces
of its form, and even of its facets, are still discernible.
   XX. Another        jargoon, weighing ^TtnS °^ a carat> was
exposed to the heat for the same length of time.            It broke
into three pieces while under the blast, but now presents the
fame appearances       as the former.    The  surfaces  of both   are
more opake and white than the interior.
                              Vermilions.
   XXI. A       vermilion which weighed /Tths of a carat, treated
for  2 ', lost no weight, but became fused into a polislied opake
globule, which is nearly black, with a tinge of brownish-
green, like that of very dark bottle glass.
    XXII. Fourteen vermilions, weighing **ths of a carat,
exposed for %' 30", were completely fused into a polished
opake globule, very like the former, but not quite so dark.
It is also not so round or polislied, having been pressed while
soft. A small face being afterwards subjected to the lapidary's
wheel, the stone appeared as hard as at first, but not suscepti
ble of so high a polish.

    XXIII.     .One which weighed i^ths of a carat, exposed to
the blast for 1' 40", broke in two pieces, both of which be
came fused.        The largest presents an appearance very like
that of the vermilion No.       xxi.  ; the other is of a dark lead
 colour inclining to a bronzy hue and chatoyant, somewhat
like peacock-lead ore. Both were pressed while soft; the
latter   so much so, that it at present retains nothing of a glo
bular form.

obstinacy, makes       it difficult   to obtain that metal in its pure
state, was completely oxydated,            and adhering so loosely to
the surface of the globules that it separated itself in scales
when they were struck with a hammer.                 The globules were
then extended under the hammer without breaking.
    From this experiment it appeared probable that means
might      be devised to fuse large quantities of crude platina,
and at the fame time lo obtain the metal pure and malleable ;
an object so desirable,        that the Society resolved at          least to
make the attempt.

could be brought to a strong heat, by means of charcoal all
 round it and a pair of double bellows, before allowing the
 stream of oxygen gas to be introduced into it.                The platina
 was put into the centre of the crucible, with charcoal below
 and all round, in such       a  manner that the crucible was filled
 with    the charcoal and the metal.          The   cover was luted on,
 and    a  tube, made     of burnt clay, which        passed   from    a  hole
 near the bottom      of the crucible to the outside       of  the furnace,
 was firmly luted into the crucible, which was supported in
 the middle of the furnace.         The clay tube was connected, by
 means of another tube, with the large gasometer, and that
 again with a series     of casks   silled with oxygen      gas.
     After exciting, by means of the double bellows,                 the sire
 round the outside of the crucible, till it was thought             the cru
 cible and its contents must have attained the utmost degree
 of heat that could in this way          be obtained, the communica
 tion between     the gasometer        and the interior     of  the crucible
  was opened, and     a stream   of oxygen gas forced in through the
 clay tube among the contents of the crucible.
     It will be observed from what has been stated, that the in
  tention was not to excite       the fire in the body of the furnace
  by means     of a   stream    of oxygen. That appeared to be an
  unnecessary   waste.     All that was aimed at was, by exciting
  a sudden and    rapid combustion of the charcoal lodged in the
  crucible along with the platina, to reduce the latter ; and it
  was thought that the previous ignition         of  the crucible and its
  contents, bv the help of the furnace, would facilitate this.

     In   a few seconds       after  opening the communication           with
  the gasometer, such a vivid flame issued through the hole in
  the cover of the furnace, that it was thought unnecessary to
  carry the process further, as the gas appeared evidently to
  be acting on the        fuel in the furnace, instead of having its
  action confined principally, as was intended, to the contents
  of the crucible.
     After some time,         the furnace was examined.          More than
  a  half of the clay          tube which served to convey the gas
 through the furnace into the crucible was found "one, and
 the    remaining       portion of the tube      polished    highly on the
 surface,     the clay having been running        in   a state   of  extreme
 fusion.      The    fide  of  the crucible next the tube was poliflied
 in   the    fame    manner, and the hole in which the tube had
 been luted was sound'greatly enlarged.              The charcoal in      the
 crucible had not been half consumed, and the plalina was
 found fused at the bottom.            A few globules were found in
terspersed among the charcoal, having been arrested in their
descent by stopping the process before they had time to reach
the chief mass at the bottom; but it seemed plain that, had
the blast      of oxygen      gas been continued for a minute or two
longer, the crucible would have been completely run down.
    The platina was then examined, but the result was not
what the Society had promised themselves.                   Though it had
been completely fused, the process was found to have been of
too short a duration to oxydate all the iron contained in it.
The large button broke under the hammer.
    From this it appears that, though plalina, in            small quanti
ties   (Exper.    XXXI.)       may be reduced and brought          to a state
of purity      by oxydating the iron by means of a stream of oxy
gen gas,      it will require a considerable degree of address to be
able to apply this on a scale of any considerable extent.                   If
even rock-crystal,         and    those gems which,     till  these  experi
ments, have been held infusible, are yet found fusible by the
powerful heat excited by the agents employed in them, how
are materials to be obtained sufficiently refractory to main
tain the necessary arrangements in            a furnace during such a
process    ?

    the
         Cause of the Tides, which, in     opposition to the received
    Theory, attributes them to supposed      periodical Effusions of
    the  Polar Ices.  By Samuel       Woods,      Esq. Read before
    the Afkefian Society November 5, 1799.
                      [Concluded from Page 147.]
 I NOW       proceed to (late the three remaining proofs adduced
 by St. Pierre in corroboration of the demonstration I have
just noticed ; but, as I conceive myself to have fully disproved
 the geometrical evidence, I shall not trouble you with an at
 tempt to invalidate   these subsidiary  confirmations.
    The second proof (says he) is atmospherical. It is well known
 that, in proportion as you ascend amountain, the mercury in the
 barometer subsides: now the mercury finks in the barometer
 in proportion as you advance northward. The weight of one
line of mercury at Paris is equivalent to an elevation of 10
fathom and 5 feet, whereas in Sweden it s equivalent to
 10 fathom 1 foot 6 inches only; and of course the ground of
Sweden must be higher.          From a series of observations made
by captain Cook in the southern hemisphere in 1773 to 1775,
 we perceive the mercury scarcely ever rises higher than 29
inches beyond the 60th degree of south latitude, and mounted
 almost always to 30 inches and even higher in the vicinity
of the torrid zone; which proves that the barometer falls as
 you recede from the line, and that both poles are elongated.
    The third proof is nautical, arising from the annual de
scent of the ices toward the line, impelled by currents pro
ceeding alternately      from each    pole during their respective
summers,     immense     mountains of ice being frequently seen
 by navigators in low latitudes.
    The fourth proof is astronomical. Childrey (an English
 author of note) supposes, as I do, that the earth at the poles
 is covered    with ice to such a height as to render its figure
 sensibly oval.    Kepler says that the eclipse of the moon on
 the 26th September 1624, like the one observed by Tycho
 Brahe in 1588,      which   was total, and    very  nearly central,
                              M   m 2                         differed

  263             Examination       of St. Pierre's   Hypothecs
  differed    widely from the calculation        : for, not only the dura
  tion of total darkness was extremely           short, but the rest of the
  duration, previous and posterior to the total obscuration, was
  still fliorter,  as if the figure of the earth was elliptical, having
  the smallest diameter under the equator, and the greater from
  pole to pole.
      Navigators in the north have. always seen the elevation of
  the sun above the horizon greater the               nearer    they approach
  the poles.       It is impossible    to ascribe   these optical effects to
  atmospherical refraction.
      Barents, on the 24th           of January, in Nova Zembla, saw
  the sun 15 days sooner          than he expected, which would give a
                        °
  refraction of     %[    ;  a thing impossible, and the circumstance
  can be ascribed to no other cause than his real elevatiop.
      St. Pierre cuts the difficulty arising from the different vi
  brations of the pendulum, by observing that they are liable
   to a thousand      errors.
      The elongation of the poles being thus demonstrated, the
  •urrent of the seas and tides follows as a natural and necessary
. consequence.
      Let   us now consider the extent         of  the polar ices,     and the
  powers capable        of effecting their solution.
      The polar ices in the winter proper to each              hemisphere  are
   from six to seven thousand leagues in circumference;                 but in
   their summer, from two to three thousand.
      The    ices and snows form in our hemisphere, in January,               a
   cupola, the arch of which extends more than two thousand
  leagues over the two continents, with a thickness of some
   lines in Spain, some inches in France, several feet in Ger
   many, many fathoms in Russia, and beyond the 6o° of north
   lat. of some hundred feet. Some ice islands were seen by
   Ellis from fifteen to eighteen hundred feet above the level of
   the  sea,   and they probably go on increasing to the pole to a
   height    indeterminable.        Hence the enormous aggregation of
   water, fixed by the cold of winter in our hemisphere, above
   the level of the ocean, is clearly perceptible ; and to the pe
   riodical fusion of these vast masses the general movement of
   the  seas and tides      is justly ascribable.      The   ices at the south
   pole    exceed    in quantity     those at the north ; and two such
                                                                        bodies

                         refpeEling the Cause           of   the   TiJn.                       269
bodies       of   ices, alternately accumulated and dissolved,                             at the
two poles, must occasion a very perceptible augmentation of
its waters at their return to it by the action of the fun, and
3 great      diminution             by their reduction to ice when the fun
retires.          It   has been calculated that the earth' and sea covered
with ice, may be equalled to                    i-ioth of          the whole ocean,            and
the height         of    the polar ices is at least 600 feet               ; a mass        which
in melting             must add       i-ioth,      that is 60 feet,        to the         fcevel   of
the ocean.
   Nature has distributed sandy zones to assist, at the proper
season, in accelerating the fusion of the polar ices. The winds
ip summer convey the igneous particles with which these
zones are silled towards the poles,                      where they           assist the     fun's
action on the ices.
   The moon also dissolves                  ice by the humidity        of the atmo
sphere. When the moon                       shines      in winter nights in all her
lustre it freezes very sharply, because the north wind checks
the evaporating influence of the moon : but if the wind is
 stilled ever so little, you see the heavens covered with vapours
which        exhale       from the earth, and you feel the atmosphere
softened.
     Naturehaving determined to indemnify the poles for the
fun's absence, makes the moon pass toward the pole, which
the fun abandons                :   she crystallises,    and       reduces into brilliant
snows, the waters which cover it ; (he renders its atmosphere
more refractive, that the sun's presence may be detained longer
in    it,   and restored sooner to           it:   and hence also there             is   reason to
conclude          she has    drawn out the poles of the earth in order to
bestow on them              a longer participation of the fun's influence.
We may judge from analogy                          the general       effect    of    the tides:
A source discharging itself into bason produces at the sides of
                                                   a
that bason   backward motion or counter current, which car
                   a
ries straws and other floating substances up towards the source.
   Charlevoix (Hist, of New France) tells us that, though the
wind was contrary, he sailed at the rate of eight leagues
a    day up lake          Michigan,        against      its general        current,         by     the
assistance        of    its lateral counter-currents.
     M.     de Crevcœur assures              us, thatin sailing up the Ohio,
along its banks he made                   42a miles in 14 days, or ten leagues

   The particular effects observed in lakes and rivers commu
nicating with icy mountains, illustrate the nature of the polar
effusions.  A kind of flux and reflux in the lake of Geneva,
during summer and towards the evening, is observable, occa
sioned by the melting of the snows, which fall into it after
noon in greater quantities than at other seasons of the day.
The intermittence of certain fountains is ascribable to the same
cause.  The frequent and rapid fluxes (ten or twelve times
a day) of the Euripus, the strait separating Bœotia from Eu-
bœa, arise from the same source.
   The currents of the                         ocean      are reducible to two general
ones     :   one, during our summer,                       from the north pole, in a
south        direction;          the Other,            during our winter, proceeding
northward from the south pole.
  Dampier lays it down as a principle, founded on many ex
periments, that currents arc scarcely ever felt but out at sea,
and tides upon the coasts.
   The polar               which are the tides of the north and
                            effusions,

of the channel of the Atlantic ocean, attracted toward the
line     by
       the diminution of the waters, which the fun       inces                         is
santly evaporating.   They produce       their general current    by
two contrary currents or collateral whirlpools similar to those
produced     rivers on their banks, and the tides may be con
                       by
sidered           as   vortices       of   the        general     current of the Atlantic
ocean.
  The         general current, which flows from our pole                             in summer
with         so    much rapidity,               and     which      is   so   violent towards its
source, crosses the equinoctial line, its flux not being stemmed
by     the effusions           of   the south pole,             at that season consolidated
into ice      ;    it             Cape of Good Hope, and

 south pole,   restores the   Indian    ocean   to its natural motion
 west ; crosses, in its turn, the equinoctial line, penetrates into
 our Atlantic ocean, directs its motion north by the position
 of America, and produces various changes in our tides. All
 the bays, creeks, and mediterraneans ot southern Asia, such
 as the    gulphs of Siam and Bengal, the Persian gulph, the
 Red  sea,  &c. are directed relatively to these currents north
 and south    so as  not to be stemmed by them         ; as  all the bays'
 and   mediterraneans of Europe, as the Baltic, the English
 channel, the bay of Biscay, the Mediterranean sea, Baffin's
bay, Hudson's bay, the gulph of Mexico, and many others,
 are directed   relatively to these currents east and west ; or, to
 speak  with   more   precision, the axes of all the openings of the
 land in the old and new world are perpendicular to the axes
of these general currents, so that their mouth only is crossed
 by them, and their depth is not exposed to the impulsions of
 the general movements of the ocean.
    That these currents are not the offspring         of my own ima
gination, but actually such as          I have described      them, will
 appear from various testimonies.          Froger fays that in Brazil
the currents follow the fun, running southward when he is
south, and northward when he is north.               In the summer of
the southern hemisphere,        the tides set in northward {Scbouten,
Jan. 1661), but in winter run southward and come from the
north {Frascr, May 1712).            C. Columbus set fail from the
 Canaries the beginning      of  September, and steered to the west ;
he found, during the first days of his voyage, that the cur
rents carried him       to the north-east ; when he had advanced
200 or 300 leagues from land, he perceived their direction
was southward : finally, as he approached the Lucayo islands,
he again found the current setting         in north.
    The   nautical observations     of Cook demonstrate          that the
currents of the Atlantic ocean          are alternate   and   half-yearly
like  those   of  the  Indian ocean.      The beans called Oxeyes,
which grow only in the West Indies, are every               year thrown
up on the coast of Ireland, 1200 leagues distant.             Seeds   and
turtles are brought to the Hebrides from the West Indies
and America ; and the mast of the Tilbury man of war,
  burnt at Jamaica, was found on these coasts : the current
                                                                   which

  272           Examination of St. Pierre's Hypothesis
 which wafts      these along proceeds    in a north direction,   and
 proves that the    Atlantic current conies from the south, and
 sets  in north during our winter.       The currents of the north
 annually convey, in summer, toward the south, long banks of
 floating ices of very considerable depth and elevation, which
 run aground as far south as the banks of Newfoundland.
     Rennefort (June 20, 1666), near the Azores (in lat. 40*
 to 450), saw the broken masts, sailyards, &c. wrecked in the
 engagement      which lasted four days between the English and
 Dutch, from June 11 to 15 : this naval combat took place
 12 miles to the north-west of Ostend, about 510 north. The
 currents from the north had therefore wafted them in nine
 days   ii°  south, besides a considerable   progress westward.
    The    general   current issuing from the south pole divides
into two      branches ; one, setting in towards the Atlantic
ocean, penetrates even to its northern extremity.          This part,
 straitened by the prominent parts of Africa and America,
forms on the coast two counter currents, which proceed in
opposite directions.      One of these currents runs east, along
the coast of Guinea, to the 4th degree of south latitude ; the
other takes its departure from Cape St. Augustin, proceeding
south-west, along Brasil, to Maire's Straits. In the middle of
the Atlantic ocean,        beyond the strait formed by the two
continents,     this general branch pushes on north, and ad
vances     to the north extremities of Europe and America,
bringing     us twice every day along our coasts the tides     of the
south,    which are the half daily effusions of the two sides of
the south pole.       The other branch takes a direction south of
Cape Horn, rushes into the South sea, produces the mon
soon in the Indian ocean, and, having made the tour of the
globe, unites itself by the Cape of Good Hope to the general
current which enters the Atlantic ocean.
    In our summer, commencing toward the end of March,
when the sun retires from the southern hemisphere, and pro
ceeds to warm the north, the effusions of the south pole are
stayed,    those  of our  pole begin to flow, and the currents of
the ocean change throughout every latitude.             The general
current of our seas divides also into two branches ; the first
deriving its source from Waigats, Hudson's Bay, &c. flows
                                                                with

                   respeBi'ng the Cause     of the Tides.                V/3
with the rapidity of a sluice, descends through the Atlantic
ocean, crosses the line, and, finding itself confined at the same
Strait of Guinea and Brasil, forms two lateral counter cur
rents setting in north : these counter currents produce, on the
coasts of Europe, the tides which appear to come from the
south.    The general        current advances      south,   arrives    about
the month     of April     at the Cape    of Good Hope,       and renders
the  passage    round this cape      so  difficult  to vessels   returning
from India at this      season ; about    the middle    of May it   reaches
the coasts   of India,     produces   the west monsoon, and, having
encompassed       thq globe,     proceeds   to Cape     Horn,   re-ascends
the coasts of Brasil,         and creates a current terminating at
Cape   St.   Augustin.
   The other general bfanch, which receives much less of the
icy effusions, issues between the continents of Asia and Ame
rica, and descends to the South           sea,  where it is re-united to
the first branch.       The    ocean accordingly      flows twice     a year
round    the globe in opposite        spiral directions, taking its de
parture alternately        from   each   pole, and describes On the
earth the fame course which the sun does in the heavens.
   The   course    of our   tides towards    the north in winter is not
an effect  of the lateral counter currents of the Atlantic ocean,
but of the general current of the south pole, which runs
north.      In this direction almost throughout it pastes from a
Wider space into a narrower, and carries before it at once the
whole mass of the waters of the Atlantic ocean, without per
mitting a finale column to escape either to the right or left.
However, if it meet a cape or strait to oppose its course, it
would form there a lateral current, as at Cape St. Augustin,
and in Africa about io°'N. lat. ; for in the summer of the
south pole the      currents and tides return south on the Ame
rican, and     east  on the African     side, the whole length        of the
Gulph of Guinea,          in contradiction      to  all the laws     of  the
lunar system.
   From these polar effusions the principal phænomena of the
tides may be explained. It will be evident, for example, why
those  of  the evening should be stronger in summer than those
of  the   morning ; because the sun acts more powerfully by
day  than    bv nieht on the ices of the pole on the fame meri-

374            Examination               sf St. Pierre's Hypothecs
dian    as ourselves : and also            why our morning             tides     in winter
rife higher than those             of    the evening, and            why the order       of
eur tides changes every six months; because, the sun being
alternately towards both poles, the efiVct of the tides must be
opposite, like the causes which produce them.       At the sol
stices the tides arc lower "than at any other soason of the year,
and those likewise are the seasons when there is most ice on
the two poles,        and     consequently          least water       in   the sea      :    the
reason is obvious, the winter solstice is with us the season of
the greatest cold ; of course there is the greatest possible ac
cumulation of ice on our pole and hemisphere. At the south
pole it is indeed the summer, solstice ; but little ice is then
melted, because the action of the greatest heat is not felt
there as     with   us,    till    the earth has          an acquired heat super-
added to the sun's           action, which takes place the six weeks
following     the summer solstice.
  At    the equinoxes, on                the contrary,        we have       the       highest
tides ; and these are precisely               the   seasons    when there             is least
ice at the two poles, and of course the greatest quantity of
water in the ocean. At our autumnal equinox in September,
the greatest part of the ices of the north pole is melted, and
ihose of the south                pole    begin to dissolve.            The          tide3    in
March      rise higher than those             in September,          because it is the
end of  summer to the south pole,                           which     contains much
more ice than ours, and consequently                        sends a greater mass              of
water to the ocean.
  I    shall fay nothing           (he proceeds)          of the intermittence of
the polar effusions,        which         produce on our coast two fluxes and
two refluxes   nearly in the fame time that the fun, making
the circuit of the globe, alternately heats two continents and
two oceans,         that   is,    in the   space    of  24 hours, during which

the polar cupola of ice, whose extremities, melted the fun,                     by
diminish and retire from us every day, and whose effusions
must consequently require more time to reach the line, and
to return from the line to us. Nor sliall dwell on the other I

especially when (he is at full ; for her rays possess an evapo
rating heat, as the late experiments at Rome and Paris fully
demonstrate      * ;   much   less stiall  I involve myself in a discussion
of  the tides of the south pole, which in summer in the open
sea come in vast surges from the south and south-west. There
are two tides every day ;           because     the sun warms by turns,
every    24 hours, the east and west fide of the pole in fusion.
Precisely the same effect takes place in lakes situated in the
vicinity of icy mountains, which have a flux and reflux in
the day-time only. But it cannot be douhted that, if the fun
warmed, during the night, the other fide of thesomountains,
they would produce another flux and reflux; and conse
quently two tides in 24. hours, like the ocean.
    We are not to imagine that every tide is a polar effusion
of the particular day on which it happens, but an effect of
the series of polar effusions ; so that the tide which takes
place on our coasts to-day, is perhaps part of that which took
place six weeks ago.            But here, too, must we admire the
harmony of nature : the evening and morning tides take
place on our coasts as if they issued that very day from the
higher and sower part of our hemisphere ; and the tides of
summer are precisely opposite to the tides of winter, as are
the tides from whence they flow ; our evening tides in sum-,
mer, and our morning tides in winter, being greatest.
    If the tides are stronger after the full moon, it is because
that luminary increases by her heat the polar effusions,                and
consequently the quantity of water in the ocean.
    Let  us now explain why           the tides    of the South sea do not
resemble those        of the Atlantic     ocean.    The irregular effusions
of the poles, not being narrowed in the              southecn hemisphere,
as in ours, produce on the fliores of                the Indian ocean and
South     sea   expansions      vague     and   intermitting.  The south
pole has not, like the north pole, a double continent, which
separates into two the divergent effusions daily produced by
the son    :  it has no channel in passing through which its
effluxes mould be retarded          : its effusions accordingly flow di
rectly into the vast southern ocean, forming on the half of,
that pole a series of divergent emanations which perform the
   *  I do not know where any account of these strange experiments can b«
found.—   W.

tour, of it in 24 hours, like the rays of the fun.                 When
a bundle of these effusions falls upon an island, it produces
there -a tide of twelve hours, i. e. of the fame duration with
that which the fun employs in heating the icy cupola through
which the meridian of that island pastes ; such are the titles
of the islands of Otaheite, Massafuero, New Holland, New-
Britain, &c.    :  each  of  these tides   lasts as long as the course
of   the   sun    above   the   horizon,    and    is  regular like his
course.
    In the nothern part     of  the South     sea the    two continents
approach : they pour therefore by turns, in summer, into the
channel which separates them, the two semi-diurnal effusions
of their pole, and there they collect by turns, in winter, those-
of the south pole, which produces two tides a day as in the
Atlantic ocean. But as this channel about the 550 of N. lat.
ceases to exist by the sudden divergence of the continents of
Asia and America, those places only situated in the point of
divergence of the northern parts of these two continents ex
perience two tides       a day.   Such are the Sandwich          Islands.
Where     such places are more exposed to the current         of  the one
continent than the other, its two semi-diurnal tides are un
equal,   as at  the entrance    of Nootka Sound : but when it is
completely out of the influence of the one, and entirely under
that of the other, it receives only one tide of twelve hours
every day, as at Kamtsehatka. Thus, two harbours may be
situated in the fame sea under the fame parallel, and one
of them have two tides, and the duration of these tides, whe
ther double or single, double equal or double unequal, regu
lar or retarded, is always 1 2 hours every 24 hours, i. e. pre
cisely the time the sun employs in heating that half of the
polar cupola from whence they flow ; which cannot possibly
be referred to the unequal course of the fun between the tro
pics, and much less to that of the moon, which is frequently
                                                                     '
but a few hours above the horizon of such harbours.                    All
islands are in the midst of currents : on looking therefore at
the south    pole   with  a  bird's-eye   view, we should      see  a suc
cession  of archipelagos      dispersed in a spiral line all the way
to the northern hemisphere, which indicates the current of
the sea, just as the projection of the two continents on the fide
of  the north pole indicates the current       of  the  Atlantic. Thus,
                                                                       the

                  respcEl'mg the Cause       of the Tides.            2JJ
the    course    of  the   seas  from one pole to the other is in a
spiral   line   round the globe, like the course of the sun
from one tropic to the other:           admitting therefore the alter
nate fusion     of  the   polar ices,  all the phænomcna of the tides
 and currents      of the ocean may be explained with the greatest
facility.
    I  have then established by facts simple,          clear, and nume
rous, the disagreement           of the tides in most seas with the
moon's action on the equator, and their perfect coincidence
with the fun's action on the polar ices.
    I  have   no doubt various objections may be urged against
this hastv explanation of the course of the tides, &c. But
these physical causes present themselves with a higher degree
of probability, simplicity, and conformity to the general
progress of nature, than the astronomical causes by which it
 is attempted to explain them. — Thus far St. Pierre.
     I hesitate whether I ought not to apologise for occupying
 so  much of your time and attention in the detail of a theory
  which may be deemed unworthy of serious notice ; yet                    I
 flatter mvself it will afford an opening to curious and interest
 ing discussion.      St. Pierre complains that the prejudices of
 mankind      are  so  strong in favour of received opinions, that he
  cannot obtain a hearing.
     To   the belt of    my judgment       I  have offered a fair and can
  did exposition     of  a  hypothesis    which he has     dressed up with
  some eloquence       and much declamation, and ufliered into the
  world with     a solemn     and imposing      air of confidence and as
  surance,   tolerably well calculated to confound the ignorance
  and candour      of his readers.      I am not conscious of having
  omitted any material fa6l or argument which tends to the
  support and elucidation       of his theory    ; I have neglected much
  absurd    reasoning, yet not without retaining some curious
  specimens.       I did once intend to have entered into a ge
  neral examination         of his principles and reasoning ; to have
  shown the fallacy of the former, the inconclusiveness                and
  inconsistency of the latter; but I shall now be satisfied with
  offering a few facts and observations extracted from the 2d
  and third voyage of Captain Cook, which appear to me de
  cisive  of the question.

   &J&          Examinanoti      of St. Pierre's Hypatbefit
     Captain Cook, who spent three summers as near as the ice
  would permit his approach towards the south pole, sound on
  December 14, 1772,         and from      that date   to   the beginning
  of January 1773, in latitude from 550 to 64° south, avast
 compact body of ice which prevented his further pro
  gress.    The thermometer varied from 300 to 350. Being
 immersed       100 fathom       deep     for about      20    minutes,    it
 came     up 340 ; and on the 13th of January 1774, on a
 repetition of this experiment, the open air being 360, the
 surface of the sea 33 i°, the thermometer came up 320.
 They found water generally           freeze at 330.       " We   certainly
 had no thaw,         (fays he,)  the mercury keeping usually below
 the freezing point. Being near an island of ice (December 24,
 1772) 50 feet high and 400 fathom in circuit, I sent the
 master    in the jolly boat   to see  if any water ran from it. He
 foon returned with an account there was not one drop, or any
 other appearances of thaw." And in the summer of 1774 — 75
 his  experience    was nearly similar.      On   the 13th    of February
 1775, the thermometer stood at 290. In his 3d voyage to.
 the north-west coast of America, on the 17th of August
 1778, in lat. 70? 44', they were stopped by a field of ice 10,
or 12 feet high, as compact as a wall; " further north it ap
 peared much higher ; here and there we saw upon                it pools of
water; we tried, but found no current.           July 7, 1779, lat.    690;.
 stopped    by  a large field  of ice,    presenting    a great extent    of
solid and compact surface not in the smallest degree thawed                 1,
the thermometer stood at3i°."
    "  As far  as  our experience    went, the    sea is  clearer of ice in
August than in       July, and perhaps it may be still freer in a
part   of  September. We tried the currents, and found them
never to exceed a mile an hour; we found the month of July
infinitely colder than August ; the thermometer in July was
once 280, and very commonly 300 ; whereas it was seldom as.
low   as the freezing point in August."
    " I am of opinion (fays Captain Cook) that the fun con
tributes very little towards reducing these vast masses of ice j
for, although that luminary is a considerable time above tha
horizon, it seldom shines out more than a few hours at a time,
and often is not     seen  for several days in succession.        It is the
¦wind,   or rather the waves raised by the] wind,            that reduce*

the bulk of these enormous masses, by grinding one piece
against another, and by undermining                 and washing away
 those parts that lie exposed to the surge ; and more ice may
be destroyed in one stormy season than is formed in several
winters,     and its accumulation thus prevented."
     This  evidence clearly proves     that the fun's influence at the
poles,    so far from being equal to produce       a constant and uni
form effect, creating an impulse extending its effect to the
 remotest parts of our globe, and a daily elevation of several
 feet to the waters of the ocean, is not sufficient in the hottest
 period of summer to diffuse a sensible thaw ; and thus we are
convinced that a few plain and simple facts are of much
 greater avail than a multitude of fanciful conjectures.

      For our knowledge of         the  fluoric   acid we are indebted    to
 Scheele.
      This appellation was given to it because it             is extracted
 from a kind of earthy neutral salt, known under              the name    of
sparry jluor, phosphoric mineral, jluatc os lime.
      As   the   fluoric acid   dissolves  glass,  it is necessary, when
 you wish to have it pure,         to employ for that operation vessels
of     a metal on which neither it nor the sulphuric acid             exer
 cises any action : lead, among the known                 metals, is that
 which is belt fitted for this purpose.

full of water.       The operation is performed with a balneum
mariæ     ; and  for    this purpose you put the retort into a cop
per or iron vessel containing water, or into a salt-bath ; you
then expose the apparatus to a gentle heat, and the fluoric
acid, in proportion as it is disengaged,            will  be absorbed by
the water in the receiver.
    For this purpose, instead of a receiver, you adapt to the
orifice of the retort a bent tube of lead, the extremity of
which is introduced under a mercurial pneumatic apparatus..

    As this acid has the property of dissolving glass, it seizes
on the silex, which appears under the form of white flakes.
     Care. must be taken to employ large tubes, especially when
you operate with glass, as for want of a sufficient passage the
gaseous acid is       compressed      in the retort, and its action on.
 the glass is augmented,           so  that the retort will be soon cor
roded through.
     The silex deposits      itself in the water, because the latter
 has more affinity for the acid than the acid has for the silex.
     If you preserve some of this gas under a glass bell, it will
 dissolve the silex   of   the glass.
     If you plunge into it an extinguished taper, an incrusta
 tion will be formed on the wick, because the water which
 issues  from it dissolves       the   surrounding    acid charged with
silex, and the siliceous earth is precipitated upon it from this
 solution.
     This gas is heavier than atmospheric air; it extinguishes
 a lighted    taper,   kills animals,      reddens  blue vegetable co
lours, and has a penetrating smell, which approaches near
 to that of muriatic a.cid gas.
     It corrodes the ikin : it undergoes no alteration from light..
     In contact with the air it emits white fumes.              If you ex

          this experiment be made in a metal                            vessel,   the fame in
    crustation will not take place.

                           results
    cipitated by the contact of the fluoric acid gas and the water,
    is nothing else than a portion of the glass, which is attacked
    and actually dissolved by the aeriform acid.
      It often happens also, that when this gas is made to                                   pass
    into water, the silex is precipitated in a quartzy pellicle.
    Each bubble of the acid which touches the water is imme
    diately enveloped in silex, and leaves on its way as it ascends
    to the surface of the water, traces in the form of tubes,
    which       Priestley       calls organ-pipes, and which                      decrease   to a
    point upwards, because the bubble decreases in proportion as
    the water dissolves              it,   and the silex      is   thus carried off.
         The      silex deposited          in   the vessels      is   soon after re-dissolved
    by the excess of acid, in proportion as the water      saturated               is            ;
    for the water, being at first little saturated with the acid, has
    pot sufficient strength to hold the silex in solution.
      Bergman obtained fluate of silex in     crystallized form.   a

        Alkalies may be employed for detecting the presence of the
    silex.   The taste of this acid, dissolved  water,    like that    in,           is

T,HE         sittings  of   the 17th November, the nth and 18th
December, were occupied in reading an interesting paper on
the mechanism        of the eye, by    Dr. Young.-
   St. Andrew's day falling on a Sunday, the anniversary
meeting was held on the 1st of December.                  The auditor'*
report on the state of the finances of the Society was read.
The    names    of  the   new members, those deceased, and those
withdrawn, were declared; and the names of the officers just
elected were announced.             The Right Hon. President then
addressed the Society,         congratulating them on the progress
of   science   in   the   last year,    and concluded by informing
them     that Sir Godfrey         Copley's   medal  was    adjudged    to
Mr. H. Howard for his          paper on fulminating      mercury.     Sir
Joseph Banks then informed the Society that Mr. Howard
had also discovered a new fulminating silver, and is now en
gaged on a subject        that promises to prove highly interesting
to meteorologists       and mineralogists, namely, the analysis of
stones that have fallen from the clouds.

    This Board    has just published the following        list  of pre
miums    :
    This Board having been required, by a committee of the
House of Lords, ' to examine into, and report to their lord
ships, the best means of converting certain portions of grafs
land into tillage, without exhausting the foil, and of return
ing the fame to grafs, after a certain period, in an improved
state, or at least without injury ;' and being desirous that their
information, on a subject of so great importance, should be
complete, adapted to every sort of soil, and founded on the
most ample experience, have come to the resolution of offer
ing the following premiums for that purpose, viz.
    To the person who stiall produce, on or before the first day
of February    1801, the best and most satisfactory       essay on the
subject before    mentioned,      distinguishing, respectively, what
 part of the plan recommended, or of the details given, is the
 result of actual experiment, accurate observation, or well
 authenticated information, 200/. For the second best, 100/.
For the third best, 60/. For the fourth best, 40/.
    And to such persons who may communicate information,
 which, though useful, may be considen d of less importance,
 smaller rewards, proportioned to the opinion of the Board.
                                                                      K

    It  is required that each      essay shall  fully detail the course
•scraps, regard being had         to the varieties of foil, and the
time proposed for continuing the land under tillage.
    Also, to explain the cases in which it may be eligible to
drain land previous to tillage.
    In what cafes paring and burning are advantageous, with di
rections thereon, regard being had to the subsequent cropping*
    The depth to which grass lands should, at first breaking
up, be ploughed.
    Whether       the crops intended for cattle and sheep are to be
fed on the land, and      hy which kind of      stock, or carted off.
    To   state the crop with    which   the grass feeds in each cafe
ought to be sown, when the land shall be again laid down :—»
The     sorts and quantities of grafs feeds for each kind of soil,
and     whether to be provided by landlord or tenant : — Whe
ther it be best to mow or feed the grafs in the first year after
laying down; to detail the management in each cafe: — The
manuring which may be thought necessary : — The principle
on which an increase of rent ought to be estimated, where
permission      may be given to break up old pasture now under
lease.
    The Board requires that these objects should be particularly
attended to, with relation to the leading qualities of land, viz.
— Clay, in all its distinctions ; and soils too strong or wet for
 turnips : — Loam, in all its distinctions, sit for turnips : — Sand,
including warrens and heaths, as well as rich sands : — Chalk
land and downs:       — Peat, including moory,       sedgy,  rough bot
 toms, and fens.
     It is hoped    that no person will be deterred from commu
 nicating his knowledge to the Board on account of his expe
 rience being confined to one of these soils. only.
     The Board reserves the power of withholding any premium,
 in the cafe of no essay being deemed sufficiently important
 to merit it.

  The following account of the labours of the Physical and
Mathematical Class during the last three months of the
year 8 was read by C. Delambrc.
      C. Meislier           has given a curious comparison                of    the summer
of the      year 1800            and that     of   the year 1792.         It
                                                                       results from
his observations,                that   if   the duration   of the heat was nearly
the fame              at each     of    these periods,      it   is certain that in the
year 1792 the thermometer kept, pretty constantly,- two de-»
grees and a half higher than in the year 1800; but what
renders 'the last summer more                        remarkable         is,   the     extraor
dinary lowness of the water of the Seine.
   In the year 1792, the water, for two months and                                    a   half,
kept, pretty constantly, at about an inch above zero of the
scale on the bridge de   Tournelle.  During four days only,
                                        la
it   funk        so    low On the nth of August last
                             as    zero.                                                      was
                                                                                      it it
still lower by 4-9 inches.  On the 20th of August                                             was
even  7^65            inches below zero.      then, that in the

year 1800, the depression of the water of the Seine was some
thing more than six inches greater than     was    1792.
                                                                 it       in
     Theyear 1719 was remarkable also for                         a    long drought and
depression of the river. During the whole         of that year there
fell no more than nine inches four lines of water at the ob
servatory of Paris, which          not the half of the usual quan
                                              is
tity.   The depression of the water appeared then             extraor            so
dinary,   that, to  preserve   the  remembrance     of    the  scale of   it,
the bridge La Tournelle was constructed. This precaution,
however, did not prevent us from having 325 millimetres of
uncertainty      regard to the level of the Seine at that period.
                       in
According    to Parcieux,    the depression of the water in 1719
was indicated               by
                    the zero of the scale. According to Buache,
it corresponded   to  the first foot of that scale.    Meissier     in                  is
clined to adopt the latter indication.      But however this may
be,    it   is   certain that           in   the year 1800       the    river fell lower
            8                                                                             thai)

the one or the other of the two authors above mentioned, the
difference will be 16 or 48.
     C. Meiffier read also a     note    on the eclipse of the moon
which took place on the           first  of October    last.    The clouds
prevented      him from observing the commencement of it.
Towards the middle the moon appeared at certain intervals;
and he took advantage of these moments to measure twelve
 times the part eclipsed.       At 11 h. 21 "the eclipse seemed to
 be at an end : it was more certainly so at 11 h. d 40". Ac
 cording to the observations, of C. Delainbre, the end took
 place about 11 h. d 30"; which agrees pretty well with what
 might have been expected.
      C. Prony read a memoir containing            a description and the
 analytical theory of a new instrument,             proper for measuring
 the length of a pendulum that swings seconds.                    It is well
  known, that the usual method requires the nicest attention,
  not only in regard to the form of the body made to oscillate,
  but also that the oscillations may not be prolonged beyond
  two hours at most, and that the results deduced from them
  may be always subordinate to the regularity of the time-piece
  which serves for comparison ; and in the last place, the ne
  cessity  of fitting up, and taking      to pieces the apparatus,       may
  leave some doubts respecting         the identity    of the experiments
  made at     different times, and in different places. All these
  inconveniences C. Prony proposes to remedy. His new instru
  ment supersedes the necessity of paying attention to the form
  of the oscillating body ; the mass of it is too considerable for
   the oscillations     to continue      during    the   whole    time that
   elapses   between    two consecutive      passages   of a star over the
   fame vertical, so that the      time-piece     of  comparison is of no
   further  use  than to count with more facility            the oscillations
   of  the pendulum used for the experiment.
       The theory of C. Prony        appears    to be clear and     satisfac
   tory,   and he soon intends to subject         his new pendulum to a
   trial.   The ingenious method by which Borda found means
    to  correct    or obviate the inconveniences of the common
   method are nut yet forgotten.             His determination of the
    length   us   the   pendulum     received    the   approbation     of all
                                                                      learns

  If it be difficult to attain' to greater precision, it will at least
 be interestin<j to sec how far the results obtained are confirmed
 by a method absolutely          different.
      C. Flaugerges read several memoirs, containing obfer-
 yations on various subjects; as, on the phosphorescence                       of
 earth worms ; on the effects of thunder ; on halos, or lumi
 nous rings around the fun ; experiments tending to prove
 that the shadows of opakc bodies, exposed in the open fields
 to the light of the fun, when the (ky is serene, and projected
 on a white      surface,    are always blue,          or, more correctly, of
 the colour     of the heavens      :  and,   in  the  last place, experiments
 from which it results, that the waves, produced at the surface
 of the water by percussion, do not produce a movement of
 translation in the parts of the fluid, as has been believed, ac
 cording to Newton, but only a continued depression of intu
 mescence,      which is afterwards         propagated      circularly.

and     methodical      order, an        account      of all    the   substances
which      fall within the province of chemistry, an analysis of
them, their specific gravities and other most remakable pro

prehends in one system the methods scattered throughout dif
ferent academical collections, and in the works of the greatest

process, which has a great resemblance                                   to that used for finding
the differentials of all the orders.
     This         process he applies to different
                                      polynomons quantities ;
he teaches        method of finding the derivations in their
                        the
greatest simplicity, and of forming them almost without any
other trouble than that of writing them.   Each term of the
resolution           may be obtained directly,                             and    without        being
obliged to pass through the intermediate ones.
     This new calculus may                              be applied to simple and               double
recurring series, and to the general                                 recurrence      of    series.    It
will     serve       often         also to give more generality to known the
orems, more vigour and brevity to demonstrations; in a
word, it is of the greatest utility in the differential and
integral calculus, which indeed forms only a peculiar cafe                                            of
the calculus of derivations.

observatory             and        of    the board of longitude at Copenhagen,

    C. . Guersant,   professor   of natural   history at Rouen,     trans
mitted lately to    C   Cuvier, for the purpose of examination, a
quantity    of   bones   found in the rocks in the environs of
 Ilonfleur, by    the late Abbe Bachelet, and which belonged
to the    cabinet of the central school of Rouen.              C. Cuvier
has discovered amonji these bones those of a kind ofcroco-
 dile, hitherto unknown,         and  verv    different from the fossil
 animal of Maestricht, which some consider as a crocodile
also.   The jaw-bones of this crocodile of Honfleur resemble in
their prolongation those of the cavial, only the teeth are not
so equal,   and the sutures     of the bones are differently figured.
The most     striking difference is in the vertebrae ; those of all
the known crocodiles have the anterior face of their body
concave, and the posterior convex ; in that of Honfleur, it is
precisely the contrary,       'she apophyses of these vertebrae are
also more complex than in the ordinary crocodiles.
    This animal appears to be about 18 feet in length; its
bs>nes are petrified,     and strike   sire  with  steel.   Their hollow
parts are silled with pyrites.       They were       found in   a  marley
kind of stone, very hard, of a grayisti colour, and from which
they could not be disengaged without difficulty.              Besides the
bones    of this crocodile, C. Cuvier         has   found   others which
seem to arise from Imall animals of the cetaceous kind.

    The following account of          a very singular disease      which
attacks men and animals in the province             of Chiacas, in the
government of Fotofi, is extracted          from the journal of Lima:
" The malady, which Dr. Como Rueno calls furiosa heura,
is one of the most remarkable facts in the history of this
province.      It is chiefly in the village of Tutari that it at
tacks men and animals,          but among the latter those (such as
the    ox, horse, sheep, 8cc.) which have been brought from
Europe ; for the vigogne, the guanaco, and other quadrupeds
of   the country,   are not exposed to it.        No   force can restrain

a person          attacked     by this disease, during                  the    first sits      of
phrensy.          Being totally        a    stranger to sentiments          of   stiame, he
escapes from bed,             and      runs with violence to the mountains.

the unfortunate wretch                     is dashed to pieces      ;   but    if,    by   some
uncommon chance, the fall does not prove mortal, he soon
recovers his reason and health, and has nothing more to fear
from    a   return of this fatal malady. iliall not attempt, fays

rife from the bosom               of   the earth in    a    countrv exposed to vol
canic convulsions, may not have as great  share in this                 a
phænomenon as the constitution of the inhabitants  but                                 ;

                                                            so
what we read in Ovid's Metamorphoses respecting the leap
of Leucade, that the one would seem to have served as the
original of the other. Who knows, fays he, whether the
antient fable may not have originated from some malady
similar to the above           ?
  A     surgeon os Madrid               has been able to dissolve camphor                      in
water        by
           means             of
                      the carbonic acid.  This camphorated
solution, injected into ihe urethra of persons afflicted with
the stone, allays the pain almost instantaneously.

   Mr. Hahneman, of Altona,                       has discovered        a     new fixed        al
kali, which he calls fnenm, because, when heated to redness,
its volume     extended to twenty times its usual size.
                  is                                      crys                        It
tallises in large prismatic hexaedral crystals terminated                                      by
two inclined faces, one of which                      appears to be triedral, and
the other pentaedral.                  These     crystals    neither run per deti-
quium nor effloresce; but when pulverised they dissolve at
300° of Fahrenheit in half their weight of water, and melt
almost in their water of crystallisation. At 65" of the same
thermometer,           140 parts require for their solution about 500
parts   of   water.     By cold they separate from the water. They
do not dissolve         in    alcohol.         This alkali        produces           but little
effervescence with concentrated                   acids.         With vitriolic         acid   it

water.        The neutral         salts formed with        this alkali, and the
nitrous, muriatic, and phosphoric acids, and those in parti
cular formed with the acetous acid, dissolve with ease not
only in water but in alcohol. Its muriate crystallises in the
form of feathers         :   its phosphate          has a bitter taste.            All   these
salts, except those formed  by the phosphoric acid, part with
their acids by heat, and the alkali remains pure : the sulphate
requires for that purpose a red heat; the nitrate only 3000 of
Fahrenheit : it does not detonate on ignited coals ; nor does
it decrepitate, or become luminous, when thrown on them.
   It is difficult to saturate this alkali with carbonic acid, as it
lets it escapein the usual temperature of the atmosphere :
when saturated with       assumes the form of

salt.
   This alkali         exercises        an    action on vegetable colours.                 It
precipitates       metals    and earths          from their solutions in acids,
and in the fame manner as the other alkalies.                              It   produces   no
change on viercurius dulcis, but      gives to corrosive sublimate

A,lS     landscape     painting is at present a very fashionable
pursuit,   the   following essay on composition may not prove
unacceptable to some of your numerous readers; and should
such further observations       on the arts    as    I  may have leisure to
offer, be deemed       of importance enough              to find a place   in
your  valuable    Magazine,      they shall be at your service.

ject be landscape or history : this much it may be necessary
to premise, as it indicates the dependence of one part on an
other as to the forming a whole.      By an inquiry into the
obstructions to the obtaining a knowledge of this elegant and
pleasing  part of the arts, we (hall find it arise (as in most
other cafes) from want of knowing what plan to pursue,
and often from improper instructions ; much of our success
depending on being once in     right road.   a
   Many are taught to believe that by copying parts they
will be able to form a whole ; and this error  in some mea          is,
sure, encouraged             by
                     many of our publications.   Few things
are likely to prove            so
                          injurious as pursuing petty plans to                           ;

let us, at any rate, fall like Phaeton.
     The    means most likely to enable us to acquire                knowledge
                                                                          a
in   the arts      is,   first to study pictures,        and then resort to Na
ture   remembering to add to the stock we may collect from
       ;
the wisdom   of others, such original matter as may result from
our own diligence.      But though copying pictures may be
necessary, very little knowledge will be obtained          other              by   it,
than what depends on the mechanical parts of the art. He
win* at all times copy best, who paints best  nor can we             ;
hope ever to become great by. merely imitating another:                                      by
such  practice we may learn how to mix colours, but that
       a
is   very different from          a   knowledge of colouring.                  It   is   true,
we     must      reason from cause to effect        but that
                                                       ;                  is   a   mode      of
inquiry         seldom pursued        by   the mere copyist.
   Composition             embraces        two considerations
                                                  first, as   re    :                it
spects alterations which may take place in    view, and whicha
is   bythe artist termed composing it; and, secondly, as      ap                     it
plies to works of fancy purely.   But as the principles of one
regulate the other, all thai will be necessary         briefly to         is
state that no license             should    be taken       with the view            so   as to

a   little reflection we shall avoid such absurdities,                     and be en

an object of sufficient consequence to deserve all our atten

in the lame mind, or at least in such    degree as to producea

    The     figures    in the bustling scenes of Vernet are highly
appropriate, and will be well worth consulting ; and those in
the landscapes of N. Pouffin are excellent examples of the
higher style.         Gainsborough appears to be the only instance
of the     true    pastoral     that this country has produced, and is
well worthy our attention for the figures.

    In   treating of composition as it relates to works of fancy,
it \yill    be found to involve an inquiry after proper objects,
and putting them together so as to form a picture.
    By proper objects           is meant the most perfect     of their kind,
 accompanied with an application the most                  judicious.   And
 here begins one of our greatest difficulties, the discovering
 what is proper, as it embraces an extensive field of action:
 whoever has acquired a knowledge of what is right, is in a
 fair way to do what is right.             The foundation of all taste is
 general inquiry,         or   an  inquiry after the species; for, though
 all trees are green, and those of the same genus resemble
 each other, and though rocks and mountains bear a particular
 form, yet some are confessedly superior, and should be care*
 sully selected ; for painting is not the art of imitating Nature
 •jnerely,    but requires the aid of reason in choosing the most
 perfect of her works, and rejecting her deformities.

point out the peculiar  excellencies to be found in the works of
some       of   the most celebrated           landscape painters.            N. Pouflin,
for dignity,             will   be found       highly   deserving       attention;           his
buildings   and figures are unequalled.   Titian's colouring                                   is
rich, accompanied with great freedom of hand and fine forms
of trees. G. Pousfin's mountains are grand, and generally
form     fine line of horizon, with
           a                            peculiarity in the deep
                                                        a
parts of the picture, and depth of water truly grand.       The
eccentricities  of SalvatOr Rosa will  furnish   an  example of
great union of parts as to chiaro-scuro, colour, composition,
 and figures, while his rocks are sublime and grandly formed                                   ;
 the whole accompanied with great freedom of penciling. The
 colouring of Claude      fine, accompanied with
                                    is             lovely tone              a
 of air; but his compositions often appear studied or, in other             ;
 words, over-laboured,                   from the introduction
                                                      many                  of    too
 beautiful parts. Wilson's compositions are grand, with a
 tone of colour truly Titianesquc, and  light and shade un   a
 equalled.
   The pastoral             excellencies      must be sought among the works
 of the Dutch               and       particularly in those of
                                   Flemish masters,

  tone of colour.        To enumerate the excellencies found in the
  different mailers were endless; these hints may serve to direct
  our inquiry.
      It would be unpardonable to              pass    over the merits    of our
  countrymen Gainsborough and Barrett (not                          to mention
  many justly celebrated living artists, whose works will ever
  rank among those of the first masters).                     The former, for
  lightness of handling, elegant rusticity of figures, breadth of
  clfiaro-scuro, and sweet silvery tone of colour, is highly worthy
  of attention ; while the latter, for the character of a tree and
  the true tone     of grav distance, is highly          estimable.   The   three
  great names      of Wilson, Gainsborough,                and Barrett, form a
  school for the student,        while their labours reflect the highest
  honour on our nation.
      Some anthor calls painting           a Jixth sense; it certainly       adds
  a  delight to the existence of the artist, by enabling him to
  enjoy many beauties unnoticed by the common eye.
                                           -For him the Spring
                   Distills her dews, and from the silken gem
                   Its lucid leaves unfolds : for him the hand
                   Of Autumn tinges every       fertile branch
                   With blooming gold.                      Aklnside.
      Those beauties,      as  they escape common observation, so it
  will become        our bounden duty not to suffer them to pass
  without making such memorandums as may secure them for
  future   use : unless we do       this, and resort frequently to Nature
  for our materials, we shall fall into            a habit of repeating our
  selves, and our pictures will appear              as    if made up from the
  fame small stock       of  ideas.     It  becomes an indispensable         duty
  with us to view everything with an eye to the art; from
  the palace to the cottage, from the craggy rock to the humble
  bank of earth:        the various kinds       of trees, with      each species
  of   shrub, must not pass unnoticed.              To    the artist every thing
  is  of use ;  beautiful or terrific, awfully         vast, or elegantly little ;
  all, all   must     be treasured     up for suture use : but still in our
  research, not the individual,, but the species, must form the
   object xti our inquiry.

         The higher           style    of    landscape is by some termed the heroic,
    to distinguish it from the pastoral *. Among the objects of
    which the former is composed may be considered temples,
    pyramids, ruins of antient palaces and calllcs, altars, Sec.;
    mountains covered with snow or involved in clouds, hanging
    rocks, and huge blocks bursting, as it were, out of the earth,

    noticed.         These can only be considered as making the general

         To      act is as necessary as to think                 :    he who spends a life                  in
     comparing the styles of difl'erent masters, their peculiarities
.    of colour, effect, or the propriety of their compositions, mav
     in the end find himself a mere critic, but will never raise
     himself to the rank of an artist.      Great advantage will be
     derived by frequently comparing our works with the labours
     of others, which will give us cause to rejoice at our improve
     ment; or, what is a great step towards     discover our defects.  it,

     shown   in the production of materials, but to arrange them
     requires the soundest judgment. To make all the parts of
     the picture tend                 to excite but one emotion, will require the
     utmost        care.         If    the    scene to be described                       is   solemn,      no
     lively or fantastic                  can be admitted

     It is evident from the above examples that figures, colour,
  and chiaro-scuro, must all have -one tendency, or the picture
  can never form a complete whole.
     We need not wonder at that want of information in the
  higher walks of art which at present pervades society, if we
 consider     the want       of knowledge in those who make          a trade
 of teaching,       and   thai of the number of drawing-books        poured
 on the public.            Some consider neatness an object ; others,
 touch, the form of a tree ; or usher forth, as examples of art,
 incorrect sketches to copy; all being content with offering
 a part, none teaching the combination                of a  whole j or that
 to embody a grand idea             is the highest    point of human in
 tellect.    We      are in duty bound to exert ourselves to improve
the national         taste   by every fair and honest means; and,
should     we be so         unfortunate as not to succeed, we may be
comforted by the recollection that to labour to obtain excel
lence is excellent, as well as to endure whatever may happen
to be the result.

Epicurean.
  The best method to improve and elevate our thoughts will
be, by frequently contemplating the most noble objects in
nature, and taking every opportunity of viewing pictures the
most likely to inspire fine ideas.  But we mail view fine
works of art to very little purpose, if we feel no higher wish
than mere imitation : if the noble enthusiasm of rivalship
does not possess our breasts, it is much to be feared our re
marks will be cold, and our exertions languid           :   let us then,
like Jacob, dare to wrestle even with an angeh
  Various    schemes       have    been    recommended to       assist   the
powers of imagination.       One advises contemplating the
breaks in the plastering of old walls; another, the veins of
marble; and a third, as the ne plus ultra, has produced a
system os blotting : but those methods, however ingenious,
are fallacious.     Gainsborough is said to have formed land
scapes on the      table with broken stones, dried herbs, and
pieces of looking-glass ; and Chattelain, whose drawing he
was fond of, used to design his rocks from lumps of coal.
  This is a bad practice. If we do not resort to nature for our
materials,   andconnect our inquiry with the best works of
art, our compositions must not be expected to rife above the
pastoral character   of    of the former,- and our rocks, like
                           those
those of the latter, may smell of the coal-hole.
   The Dutch painters, in their local representation, have
copied   each object as it occurred, without attempting to im
prove them   ;       many imagine gives them a certain na
                  which
tural air, which, by the bye, is absurd, and argues a great
want of taste : this error equally attaches to the Flemish
school, and may be seen even in the landscapes of Rubens.
The universal affection for landscape painting does not arise
from the love of imitation merely ; the pastoral scenes of the
Dutch delight from other motives,             and principally     because
familiar to every imagination; they exhibit a life of peace,
leisure, and innocence, with joy, plenty, and contentment ;
blessings not to be found in the bustling scenes of active life.
One rule we are bound to observe in the pastoral ; that                   is,
not to represent     scenes    of   wretchedness,   or such objects as

may disgust.  In composing scenes of rural life, though they
do not require any great elevation of thought, or extraordi
nary capacity in the arrangement of the parts, yet they
demand the greatest care in the finishing, cleanness and deli
cacy in the colouring, and the utmost unity and simplicity
throughout the whole.   To give interest, we should add all
that stock of      lesser graces dependent               on ourselves      ; such as            a
light    elegant touch,          beautv    and cleanness          of colour,         and        a
graceful simplicity of form.               Scenes that do not interest from
themselves       must be made to do so by the labours                     of   the artist        ;
but where the subject is grand, we should clothe it with all
the dignity of art, accompanied with a broad, firm, and                                    spi
rited handling.
    The beautiful, in painting,               as   in poetry     and music,          is   cal
culated to move            the    softer passions        ;   therefore    every thing
abrupt and         hard     should be rejected           in   the forms        of   the ob
jects, chiaroscuro, or colour; as   instanced in Claude's best
                                                   is

images, forms, colour, and light and ihade,       possessing con     by
trary properties, will conspire to excite opposite sensations, as
in the works of Salvator Rosa, and some of Wilson's grand
compositions.
  Abrupt, angular, and dark objects associate best with the
sublime, accompanied with  certain degree of obscurity and
                                          a
deptli of colour.
    Violent      passions    mind are ever accompanied with
                             of    the
actions more or less angular    on the contrary, beauty loves
                                           ;
the easy sweeping line of grace, with perspicuity, light, and
a richness of colour  in fact, one effect should, as much as"
                            :
poflible, be calculated to excite painful, the other agreeable,
sensations.   Mountains involved       clouds, and objects seen
                                                    in

             a    will always appear  with more dignity than                                if
 distinctly viewed.
    All   agreeable       sensations      are founded         in temperance:
                                                                too
 great   aquantity of light, colour, or sound, excites pain.                           It       is
 trie temperate of eating, drinking, sleeping, nav, of every thine,
 that makes them delightful.                  The intemperance of Alexander

   As lines        are    strongly expressive of motion and passion,
perhaps in         a    boisterous sky the forms ought to intersect
each other more angularly than in a tranquil scene; for, as
a straight line is indicative of rest, every departure from it
must imply motion ; therefore                the nearer the forms, in cross
ing each other, approach to             a   right angle, the more expressive
of violence.           But    we must use caution in the practice.              The
slowly gliding river excites the idea of rest in its straight lines,
in opposition  to the contorted ones in the rustling current :
the violent motion of lightning is always in acute angles;
It is nearly the fame whether the eye or the object moves :
jf thefight is employed in tracing lines running abruptly in
contrary directions, it will convey the idea of violent motion,
though it is not the lines but the eye that moves.     The easy
serpentine       sweeping         lines, expressive of the meandering of
rivers or roads,             serve wonderfully to carry off the distance.
Of this      there     is a sine example      in the picture of      "   Going      to
market," by Rubens,                           The fame thing,

chiaro-scuro.
     An indifferent original composition will always                  be superior
to one patched together with stolen materials.     The arts
would be unworthy our pursuit, were they of easy attain
ment; we sliould therefore (if we wish to attain excellence)
be careful         not to suffer ourselves to be robbed              of our time

recommended                      is,   to avoid regular forms in the mass        of ob

we have an opportunity              of helping the effect    giving them             by
a (light tendency to    contrary direction: few things appear

 so unpleasant, as tiresome long horizontal lines following
each other.    But, however desirable variety may be, we
should be careful to guard against running into an affected
contrast     worse evil of the two.

 composition             :    this should be avoided               in   elevated scenes, whose
 parts should                be simple and little decorated                      :   much finisliing

II.    Letter from Professor         De Carro        to   Dr. Pearson,             on
                            the Vaccine Inoculation.
        DEAR SIR,                                         Vienna, Oct.    it,   1800.
I      Cannot  wait any longer to communicate to you my
further success in the vaccine inoculation.  A dreadful epide
mic small-pox has given this autumn       a new lustre to that
 practice, which, from the sensation it has created                         in this
 city, is not likely to be ever laid aside.
      This    extension     of practice, which       hitherto has been en
 tirely, or nearly so, in my hands, has enabled                 me to estimate
 the, accuracy      of your          on the inefficacy of a cow-
                                observations
 pock that comes too rapidly to its height, and which does not
 follow the laws of that disease. I must candidly confess, that
 until this autumn          I   had not a very exact idea of the vaccine
 pustule; that is to fay, I knew very well how it should be
 to correspond with the description of the English inoculation,
 such as I had seen it on my own children ; but I was not
 aware        that it must be absolutely Ib, and that every appear
 ance after        inoculation was not to be looked upon as a true
 vaccine.        The astonishing      likeness    of my vaccine          pustule      in
 my sixty last inoculations           has    given me a true knowledge                of
 it;   arid  I   scarcely believe    that  I   can in suture     be mistaken.
                                                                                   Oq,

 305                      On   the Vaccine    Inoculation.
On     the    third or fourth day, one perceives a flight elevation
and redness ;      it increases in a vesicular form till the iath or
13th day, and contains always the most limpid fluid : a fever
conies on the eighth or ninth day, or sometimes is not per-
ceptihle : the beautiful areola appears on the seventh day,
and increases till the crust is entirely formed : this crust be
gins commonly on the twelfth day, and becomes quite black.
   I have had some cases originating from count Mottet's
matter, where         a   patient had received the fmall-pox by inocu
lation,      and three by natural contagion                 :   one   of   these has re
taken the vaccine in its perfect form. Luckily for the suc
cess of the inoculation, the parents of these children were
advised previously of the idea I had of the imperfection of
their former vaccina ; and they were not surprised at  after                    it,
having had       a   great difficulty in believing               that the superficial
crust that     it   had formed would be sufficient to preserve then*
from future infection.
 I   have had two cases where the children were already in
fected with the fmall-pox at the time of the-vaccine inocula
tion, and where     showed itself, as usual, without interrupt
                          it

proved excessively mild; the other    still dubious.

 I     have hadtwo cafes where the inoculated spot gave signs
of inflammation only   on the twelfth day, and where the pus
tule has been perfectly regular and complete. That was the
fame subject that had been seven months ago inoculated with
the imperfect cow-pock.
 I   have not yet seen any pustule either of the fugitive or of
the variolous-Wkc appearance, although, according to Dr.
Woodville's observations, they should appear more com
monly where the fmall-pox              is   epidemic.             There never was,
perhaps,                 epidemic at Vienna as that we have
              so disastrous an

               is                 that people think

immediately      from     Doctors Tetchier and Odier, or from the
Bibliotbequc Brltannique.          I have had lately two opportunities
to make experiments upon persons who have undoubtedly had
the small-pox in their infancy. They are both medical men,
and consequently        their testimony is more admissible than that
of most others.        Upon the one, the vaccine matter produced
no effect whatever ; and upon the other, a very small super
ficial vesicle appeared, which changed soon into a crust.              la
 one word, there was not the least appearance of the true and
 usual cow-pock       pustule.    They confirm your principle, that
 one   cannot   have the cow-pock after the small-pox.               One
 single circumstance vexes me in my vaccine practice : it is
 the frequency of inoculations that fail 5 that is to fay, where
 no pustule nor inflammation is produced.              I can scarcely at-»
 tribute it to my method, which is the common puncture of
 most practitioners. I make it as superficial as I can, to avoid,
 as much as possible, to draw blood, which I believe can wafli
 off  the matter.      I  make one puncture on each arm.             I fee
 that in England,        as well as abroad,      inoculators arc divided
 upon the advantages of the puncture or of the incision.             You
  and Dr. Jenner seem to make use of the puncture                  :  Dr.
  Woodville recommends strongly             the incision.    At Geneva
  they prefer   the incision;      and here the puncture.       I propose
  now to make comparative trials; and to inoculate my first
  twenty patients in one arm with the puncture, and in the
  other with the incision.          The difficulty of making the most
  superficial  incision without drawing blood, has hitherto in
  duced me to recommend the puncture.                Upon the whole, I
  dislike  much    to  be   so  often  under   the necessity of repeating
  the   inoculation.      You will oblige     me very much bv favour
  ing me with some particulars upon this point.
     My second patient, where the two diseases have              gone on
  together, has had         also a   very favourable small-pox.       Two
   similar cases in England authorise you to believe that the
   cow-pock can render the small-pox milder when they attack
   the same subject together.

         DEAR SIR,                              Doncastcr,  Nov. 13, iSoo.

                            the vaccine   contagion   lo a person zvbo
 bad previously had the small-pox.            I  am   still  of the same
opinion, as I      have never    yet been   able  to produce the true
 vaccine pustule      in  a person    who had before undergone the
small-pox ; but I have lately had a case from which it would
appear that, if both diseases are introduced into the system
about the same time, they will both be received, and proceed
through their regular stages, without being at all affected by
each other.       A child was inoculated for the cow-pock, after
it    had   been  for some days exposed to the contagion of the
natural fmall-pox, on Friday the 26th of September. The
arm went on in the usual way till Wednesday evening fol
lowing, when the child was seized with fever, and in the
evening of the next day the small-pox appeared.               The erup
tion was confluent, and particularly so about the inoculated
part, on Monday the 6th of October, which was the eleventh
day from the inoculation        of the vaccine matter,      and the fifth
from the commencement of the fever of the fmall-pox.                     I

  3  tt                 On the Vaccine Inoculathn.
       Since the month of September, when I returned srorrt
   Boulogne, I have inoculated for the vaccine 160 subjects of
   allies, but the greater part children. All these different
   Experiments, which were attended with the greatest success,
   have invariably displayed that character of mildness which
   establishes, in an incontestable manner, the superiority of the
   new over the old mode         of inoculation; and the difference
   which we have had an opportuniiy of remarking in some of
   the results tends still further to confirm this superiority.
       All the children and adults whom I inoculated during the
   whole course of the experiment continued their usual sports
  and exercises without feeling the least inconvenience.           The
   adults followed their daily occupations, and in general ex
   perienced   a very stiort sensation  of uheafiuess,    aud ai most a
   flight febrile affection.
 '
       Six weeks after my first experiments       I made successively
  seven    counter-experiments.        I carried to      the  house  of
   C. Bcausoleil,     whose children were attacked       with  the na-»
   tural small pox, the eruption of which was very abundant,
   three children     of C. Beugne, who had been inoculated with
   the vaccine.       After leaving them a long time together, I
   inoculated    my three subjects, as usual, with the variolous
   matter taken from the youngest of the children, who was
   covered    with the eruption ; but none of them experienced
   the least effect from the operation.
       The other four subjects, whom I afterwards subjected to a
   counter-experiment, were, a voting domestic of C. Wynne,
   another of C. Bell, and two sisters of the latter. I carried
    them to the house of C. Trudin, broker, whose child had
    the natural small-pox.       They were all inoculated without
    the least effect.
       C. Magnier, of Pont-de-Brique,       having sent for his son
    from Boulogne, where he was at school, I inoculated him
    with the vaccine in the-country.       He was then sent back to
    school, where the small-pox had broken out during his ab
    sence.    The young man continued as usual to frequent the
    company of his school-fellows infected with the contagion,
    to play with      them, to eat with them, and to sleep in the
    fame room with them, without experiencing any effect.

   . I have ha4 an opportunity          in  the course   of my experiments
 to be convinced that            the vaccine inoculation can have no
 effect   on those who have had the small-pox.                  C. Beugne,
 already     mentioned,     believed   that   he had  never  had   the small
 pox, I inoculated him three different times with the vaccine,
 matter, but always without any effect. Being struck with this
 phænomenon, I asked him some questions,, when he acknow
 ledged,    that, at the age    of four   years he had flept    with    one  of
  his sillers  who had been attacked with the confluent small
 pox highly malignant, that he had. been very sick for several
 days, but that his mother did riot think him infected with
  the small-pox       because     he   had no pustules,      which     are the
  usual   symptpm.         This was an excellent opportunity for
  trying    a  new fort of cqunje,r-experiment ; . I inoculated
  C. Beugne with the small-pox, b\it they took no effect.
      The son of C. Gqnou, of Samer, aged nine years, had been
  inoculated for .the vaccine with frefli matter and of a good
 quality. Four days after I. went to examine -the chjld, and
  was much surprised to observe that the vaccine had produced
 jnothing, though the child had been inoculated in three dif
ferent, pjaces.        This experiment         had   seldom   failed, except
/when the subject had before had. the small-pox.                      On exa
  mining     the  child,   I found,   him    with   a  languid  look,    abad
   pulse, and a great deal of fever.           I suspected, therefore, that
   he had been already infected with the small-pox               at the time
   when    I inoculated him. for         the   vaccine.    On inquiring,       ,1
   found that     the child     had come from a house where the na
   tural small-pox prevailed, in order to be inoculated.                I fore
   saw that he was going .to have the natural eruption, and in
   deed the disease appeared on him two days after.                  It was of
;  the mild kind,      and the punctures made for the vaccine were
1 dry,   and almost effaced.
      My    experience    proved     to me also, that     in the case where
   the subject is already infected with the small-pox, the vac
   cine inoculation, which then remains without any apparent
   effect, adds nothing to the malignity           of the sinall-pox.      I am
   convinced that, whichever of the two infections is anter'ux
   in point, of action     and    progress,   prevents the action an4.P>y-

 gVess   of the other;      and consequently, as these two principles
 cannot exfft together,        the one cannot add to the other.
     Another very important observation, which appears to me
 to prove that the vaccine is really a species of the small-pox,
 which differs from the human small-pox only by its origin
 and the peculiar character of mildness by which it is distin
 guished, is as follows :— A child of C. Billier, salt-refiner, on
 the ninth day of inoculation for the vaccine, which is the
 critical day, cut four teeth, two of them eye-teeth. A second
  crisis of nature so violent, ought to have been, and was ac-
  companied with,        a strong access      of fever, which,    added to the
  very moderate      access arising from         the vaccine, brought out
  on the child's body an eruption of 26a large pustules filled
  with limpid matter. No common inoculation ever produced
  any of    so  beautiful a kind    ;   they ended without the least fever,
  and disappeared      at the end       of seven days without leaving any
  marks.        This child     since     inoculation    has   enjoyed   perfect
  nealth ; and     I have remarked that is invariably the effect              of
  the vaccine.       The    cafe is far from being        the   fame with the
 "common inoculation.             Of    the children    whom      I inoculated
  with    the vaccine, several were weak and ailing, often attacked
  with     a violent cough,       and two of them were wasted with a
  periodical fever.       All   these children, and in particular the
 "two last, hav« enjoyed         since the operation perfect health.
      The vaccine inoculation serves me as a criterion to diflipate
   the uneasiness of those who have need of being assured that
   they have had the small-pox, and that they have nothing to.
   fear.
       I have offered a premium for every poor person who can
   be proved to me to have had the small-pox                 after being ino
   culated, with care, for the vaccine.              I mould not be afraid
   to risk, my whole fortune at present on this head.                      But I
   cannot     too  strongly    recommend         to  practitioners   to  bestow
   more care on this operation, and to repeat it if the least

logic to reply to facts by hypotheses.                   The celebrated  Doctor
David, of Rotterdam, wrote to me in the month of October
last, that the experiments which he repeated with the matter
sent from Boulogne            had    been      attended with the most com
plete success     ;   and   Dr. Jenner,       the author      of this noble dis
covery, informed him at that period, that more than 50,000
 persons have been already inoculated with the vaccine in
 England     ;  that   a  third of that number had been exposed to
 every test    possible without the small-pox ever taking effect:
 and, in the last place,          for five years, during which time he
 has been constantly employed in repeating the experiments,
 no one has ever yet refuted this theory, or weakened the con
 clusions he has drawn from it.

 V. A Jhort View of the new Eleclrical Experiments performed
                            by Dr. Van Marum.
                            [Concluded from Page 193.]
  7"   VV HEN              the   conductor at the tower of Siena was
  struck by lightning, several persons, besides the common
  electric light, clearly observed on it a regular train of light )
  and Beccaria gave to. this phænomenon, which he endea
  voured, without success, to imitate with his electric machine,
  the name of divergent electricity.                    Mr. Landriani requested
  Dr. Van Marum            to try an experiment            of the fame kind  with
  bis large machine.             Both these philosophers considered this
  divergent electricity        as an effect       of the resistance which me
  tals oppose       to the    influx   of    the      electric matter when they
  have    too    small    a  diameter, and throw off at the sides the
  matter not received.             To- ascertain this fact, an iron wire,
   *', of an inch in diameter, was placed al such a distance from
                                                "

    the conductor, that sparks were drawn from it almost without
    interruption.     The operators now observed with pleasure that
    this small wire, though in complete connection with the
   conductor, was covered along its whole length with a con
   tinued stream of light, and that this light consisted of small
    rays, which    issued    from the wire on all sides.      The smaller
   the wire, the broader was the stream of light.           Wire of other
   xnetals, of the like diameter, exhibited the fame phænomena.
       8. Experiments to try •whether the evaporation             of vege
   tables during     their   being, electrified would be increased -when
   the pats containing them were insulated and brought in con
   nection   with     positive   conductors   .—Mitt being exposed to
   electricity for a 1quarter of an hour, the loss of weight by
   evaporation was found to be in some I -4th, and in others
   j -3d more than      in    the unelectric state.    It is here possible,
   however, that there may be some deception ; for, as the elec
   tric conductor, when not made exactly round, always emits a
   wind, so must the points of the leaves of plants, and confe-
   ^nea-tly more evaporable matter must be carried off with it.
   In   order to obtain something decisive on this subject, plants
   ¦without   leaves ought to be employed ; but these evaporate
   very little.
 .
       9. The influence of electricity, on the sensitive plants. —Thll
   was proved by Dr. Van Marum on the Mimosa pudica. He
   first exposed the plant to the sun, in order that its leaves
   might be more expanded,           and then applied it at the distance
   of two    feet scorn a conductor positively      electrified, and then
   to one negatively electrified.        No effects, however, were pro
   duced.     Being    placed    on the conductor, the small leaves
   raised themselves      up a little and expanded, when no sparks
   were drawn from the conductor; but as soon as sparks were
   drawn from the conductor,, the small leaves again fell nearly
   in  the fame manner as the pendulum electrometer.               After   a
   few such changes they at length began to approach each
   other, to close themselves up, and to become totally shut.
,  This result took place also in consequence of other kinds of
   sliocks, and therefore is not to be ascribed exclusively to elec
   tricity.   In other respects, the plants experienced no other
   change.
                                                                         In

                         by   Dr, Van Marum.                          fl$
    In experiments of      the fame kind made with the hedysarurm
gyrans, the electricity produced no acceleration nor retarda
tion in the movement of the small leaves.
    10.   Electricity produced variations in the state of the la'
rometer,    but only in a small degree when the mercury had;
not been boiled, and when, of course, it Hill contained some
moisture.
    ii.    An experiment     was undertaken at the request      of Volta,
to ascertain    whether the evaporation        of liquors at the common
temperature of the atmosphere would           be increased by electricity '»
— Doctor Van Marum             first placed water, alcohol,    sulphuria
ether, accurately weighed in small porcelain cups, on a con
ductor, and at the fame time similar quantities at some di
stance from the machine.             After being exposed to electricity
for half an hour, no signs of increased evaporation could be
perceived.        The case was the fame in other experiments
 where the circumstances were changed. Volta proposed also
two other experiments; one for the purpose of trying whether
electrified air be more impregnated with water than other
air, and, whether the atmosphere be rarefied by electricity.
     12.   On  the reduction    of metallic   oxides by eleclricity.—As
 this was effected in the year 1785 with sparks drawn from a
 battery, Dr. Van Marum was desirous of trying whether it
•could be done also with sparks from a conductor ; whether
 air was produced during each revival ; and if so, of what kind.
 For this purpose he employed tubes like those already de
 scribed in art. 5.       The sparks were three inches in length.
 Red     lead   was almost       immediately     revived,   and,   within
 twenty minutes,       there were produced       about   | cubic inch of
 gas,   1
          -3d of which       was   carbonic acid gas.      The residuum
 showed      in the eudiometer not so much decrease as atmo
 spheric air.      White    lead, treated   in the   fame   manner, was
 reduced     in  a less degree; less air also was produced;        but ip
 other respects it appeared to be the fame.             Oxide of tin was
 not reduced, and, after being electrified half an hour, gave no
 air.     The cafe was the fame with the oxide of iron. Oxide
 of mercury      prepared by heat was very soon reduced into the
  form of very small globules, of a black colour, adhering to
                    9                                                   th#

 the fides of the       vessel.   The quantity of air produced, how
 ever, was so small, that it could not be examined.
       13. Experiments for examining the quality of the air in the
 hall    in which- the machine was worked. — For this purpose1
 Saissurc's       electrometer  employed, but, instead of a
                                  was
 pointed piece of metal, the flame of » wax taper was em-
 ployeu to receive the electricity, according to Volta's expe
 riment.   The air in this hall was of moderate dryrtess ; and
 it was observed that, for the space of five minutes, during
 which the electricity was continued, the whole air was elec
 tric, though the hall was 60 feet in length, 30 in breadth,
 and 40 in height.     The balls separated from each other at
 the remotest places half an inch ; the conductor was posi
 tively electrified, and the air of the hall was electrified in the
 fame manner.
       14.    Volta entertained    an   idea that the       strength     of   thft
 conductor                       if its length were increased^
                  would be increased
 Experience, however,  proved  the  contrary.   Sparks drawn
 from a conductor 60 feet in length and 4 inches in dia
 meter, were five inches shorter than those drawn from a
 common          conductor.       The   sparks   seemed      to    be   a little
 stronger,      but they followed each other more slowly.
       15.    In repeating   the experiments on the communicating             beat
 to bodies by eleSricity,         Dr. Van Marum       conceived         the idea
 of transmitting thesparks through semi-conductors, in order
 to give them more   energy. _ For this purpose he placed a
 wooden rod, one inch in thickness and 1 1 inches in length,
 between the ball of the conductor and the conducting wire.
 The consequence was what he expected ; for a rod of red fir,
 after being electrified three or four minutes, gave sensible
 signs of heat ; and a thermometer, funk into a hole made in
 it,   rose   in three minutes     from 61 to 88 degrees,          and, in five
 minutes, to 11a degrees.   As the sparks, however, often pe
 netrated under the surface of the rod,   at length split at the
                                                 it
 end, and continually threw out rays sideways,     that     imi
                                                              so        it
 tated the effects     of lightning.

inches;         after which              it became       stationary.          In      a   darkened
room, the electricity in vacuo appeared of greenish-yellow               a
colour.   In the middle, where the electric stream was
stronger, as well a3 at the surface of the phosphorus, the
rays appeared     of a very lively red colour. After the passage
of   the electric current, the light did not continue a moment ;
but the air produced retained it3 elasticity till the day follow
ing. As soon as a little atmospheric air was introduced to                                          it,
the whole space above the mercury appeared luminous.                                            Phos
phorous gas was in all probability produced. The quantity,
however, was too small to be examined, though of the same
kind    as      that described               by   Gengembre in the Journal                 de    Pby-
Jiquc for        1785.
     17.Experiments with a lattery containing 550 square feet
of  coating. — This battery consists of 100 jars, each twelve
inches in diameter, and from 22 to 23 inches in height.
They       are coated              to    within four inches of the mouth, and
stand at the distance                   of half an inch from each other in four
boxes      of equal          size.       The boxes are five inches from each
other, and are connected at the top                              by   four brass rods, and
at the bottom                     by
                   four plates of lead.                                  In   the middle jar
stands  perpendicular tube, furnished with
           a                                  ball fix inches                 a
in diameter, and 24 holes, into which the tubes of the other
jars,      an    inch in diameter, are inserted                      :   the lower ends of
these      tubes         are      inserted        in the balls of each             jar.         In the
jars themselves there are wooden rods placed                                  on stands with
peculiar supports,                                     that
                                     and on these brass rods are stuck,                     so
nothing      cemented to the jars.
                 is                  When this battery had

where the discharge took place was pierced through,) an iron
wire, ~-6 inch in diameter and 24^ inches long, was thrown
about to     great distance in small red-hot globules.
                a                                      By                                           a
comparison with former experiments of this kind,   appeared                           it
that the strength of the machine,     improvements made in by
the cushion, had been increased five-fold.  Dr. Van Marum
considers the fusing                    of                      of
                                                        certain length and

 al eve kind,    a  similar iron wire, 36 inches in length, was
 thoroughly ignited, so that it became blue, and soon oxydated
 st the surface.    On this occasion, a phænomenon never be
fore ol erv.'.J took place.        At the moment of charging, the
whole lurlace was covered with an exceedingly lively light,
that cuuld even be observed in the open day, and which in'
darkness appeared to be an inch in diameter. The shock also
was much stronger than usual.
    A discharge    on    pieces   of quartz    rounded the corners and
points very perceptibly, and even fused some parts of the
stone.
    18. Experiments ivith the battery to ascertain the cause of
death in those Jlruck with lightning. — This cause is generally
ascribed to the irritability of the muscular fibre being de
stroyed.    Now,    as   animals hitherto have never loft their lives
immediately by electric shocks, but have been lamed or thrown
into convulsions, it appeared doubtful whether an electric shock
could actually deprive the muscular fibres of their irritability.
For this reason Dr. Van Marum in li is experiments employed
eels, which, as is well known, even when cut into three,
four, or six parts, and when deprived of the head, still retain
signs of irritability.      These eels were a foot and a half in
length, and the shock was conveyed through the whole body.
By these means they were instantly killed, and never moved
afterwards.     They      were   immediately skinned, and trial was
made, by pinching,          pricking, &c whether any irritability
remained; but no traces of any were perceptible even when
pretty large sparks were drawn from these parts.                   The
strongest salts were attended with as little effect.
    When the (hock was made to pass through indi\ idual parts,
for example the head, these only lost their irritability, while
the rest retained    it.    When the head was kept free from the
shock, the remaining parts only were lamed. The fame ex
periments were several times repeated on eels of 3 \- feet in
length,    and  with      the  fame   results.    When   the shock was
made to pass through the upper and fore-part             of the head of
large eels, the under-jaw, as well as the muscles of the neck
and belly, and even the lower part of the body, retained their
irritability, while it was completely destroyed in the parts
                                                               through

 through which the shock passed.         The same effects were pro
 duced in warm-blooded animals, for example rabbits, with
 much smaller batteries. Now, as, in consequence of such de
rangement, circulation of the blood can no longer take place,
 this circumstance, without all doubt, is the cause of the
 sudden   death   of those    struck with  lightning.     If the shock
 does not pass through the large arteries the animal may (till
 recover, provided the cerebellum and spinal marrow be not
 injured.
    19. The efj'tfls of such shocks from a buttery on trees.—
"Nairnc, in the year 1773, made experiments of this kind on
 different plants, particularly myrtles and laurels. Dr. Van
 Marum, for his experiments,          made   choice of much more
 vigorous trees, such,     for example,    as  the  young Hems of a
 common willow-tree, and at a period, viz. the middle of
 April, when the young branches usually shoot forth.
Through two of these, eight feet in length, he conveyed
 shocks, the first through a space 15 inches in length, and
 two others    through their top.       After the experiments these
 trees were planted   ; but the parts through       which the shocks
 had been conveyed sent forth no branches.            The upper parts
 through which the shocks had passed, sent forth a few shoots
 for some davs,    but very slowly, and which soon ;;fter died.
 Those not electrified sent out branches like the other trees
 planted near them.       The effects of electricity, therefore, are
 similar to those of lightning.
    ao. Experiments on comiuilors. — Dr. Van Marum                  had
concluded from his former experiments that a rod of lead
must be four times as large in diameter as one of iron to
withstand lightning in the fame manner. These dimensions,
however, are sufficient for the strongest lightning.             It ap
peared also that copper     conductors   are  equal  to thole made of
iron, even when their diameter is only one-half of that of
iron ones.     This appeared also from Brooks's experiments,
who concluded that      a slip  of lead four inches in breadth, and
so thick that a square foot of it amounts to eight pounds,
cannot be hurt by lightning.            The experiments made by
means of the large battery respecting the conducting pro
perty of copper, gave verv' different results.       As an iron wire

    with                  that this wire was fused into small glo
              astonishment,
    bules.       Another copper wire, -J-0- inch in diameter, was
    broken in two places from a like charge ; a third, of                                  inch,
                                                                                       a T'T
    remained whole.    The cause of this difference, after                                     close
    examination,           was found to be in the difference                     of   the       pu
    rity of the copper. In the last experiments the wire was of
    common copper, but in the former they had been drawn
    from an ingot of purified copper, like that prepared to be
    mixed with gold. Now, as condudtors are made of common
    copper, in determining their strength attention must be paid
    to the last experiments, and their diameter must amount to
    half that of iron conductors, in                     order to present       an equal re
    sistance to lightning.            It     is   here     supposed that the length                  is
    always the fame.    As     has been found that square iron rods
                                     it
    of half an inch in thickness can withstand the strongest lisrht-
    ning, in      regard to copper           ones,       it   will be sufficient       if      each
    fide be about four or five lines.
         Dr. Van Marum               fastened   wire, through which he
                                                    the
    made       the    shock to pass, on           aof baked sir-lath, and
                                                       piece
    found that        it   was burnt in some places where    had touched   it
    the bends of the wire.                 Another time he bound agaric of the
•   oak round the wire,             so     that   lay fast
                                                  it       and the consequence
                                                                ;
    was, that         it    took    fire    ulong         its   whole   length. Con
    ductors therefore             which      pass      along sir,     or wooden work,
    must       be made somewhat thicker                    than would otherwise                  be
    necessary.
         Patterson     has recommended plumbago                      for the summits of
    conductors, because             it     cannot be fused           by   lightning,           but   a
    charge       of   the
                   large battery always                 strongestreduced     the
    plumbago to powder. If conductors are to be made pointed,
    they ought to be furnished with several points, that, in cafe
    one of them should be fused, the rest may be in       state to                    a
    conduct the lightning.  But    appears from former experi
                                                    it
    ments that pointed conductors do not deserve that preference
    ever blunt ones which some have given to them.

                              experiments               on the
                                                  oxy dating of
metals ; on this occasion, the femi-metals. — As the semi-me
tals could not be drawn out into fine wire, thin plates of them
were employed   ;   but this could be the cale only, with zinc
and. bismuth.      After      the explosion       the metal was seen to rise
up like a thick vapour, leaving traces of it on the paper ; bwt
it could not be converted into ignited globules. Purified an
timony, pulverised and strewed in a line, was oxydated, and
exhibited the fame phænomena as zinc and bismuth ; but a
larger quantity was converted into powder before it could be
oxydated.   Some femi-metals were mixed with so much tin.
that they could be drawn out into wire T'_- of an inch in dia
                                    *
meter; for example, y zinc and         tin,   cobalt and-'_  tin,      \
-iT bismuth and  **- tin. In  their   oxydation,  however,  they
exhibited nothing particular; they always rose       vapour, and in
left spots on the paper like the unmixed metals.       platina        A
wire,  7\ inch in diameter, made            by
                                   Jeanety at Paris, exhibited
the fame phænomena in fusing as silver.     The platina was
strewed about in sine powder, which left on the paper traces
almost similar to those of iron.
  22. The so-called residuum after the explosion was, with                     a
charge of 50, double of what  was     it           by
                                         charge of 15°. a
  23. Naime found that, with     battery of 50 square feet of
                                            a
coating, the jars were readily broken, when the charge was
made to explode      by
                      too short   discharging-rod, and he con
                                       a
sidered one of five feet in length sufficient to prevent this ac
cident.   Dr. Van Marum found this length sufficient for
135 feet of coating, but not for 225 sect; and, for 550 feet,
a discharging-rod of 18 feet in length was not sufficient, for
even then the jars were sometimes broken.      None of the
jars however were             hurt when the communication                 was not
made through the strong iron wire               of    the battery, but through
very fine metallic wires, through imperfect conductors, ani
mals, and the like, where the stream found more resistance.

 succession on the opposite side           with   a   charge of 200.      Brooks

   says that the breaking           of  the jars may be prevented      if paper
   coaling be applied under that of the metal. Dr. Van Marum
  found this to be true, but observed at the same time that the
  coating was thereby weakened.
  VI.      Account      of some interesting Experiments, performed at
       ibe   London Philosophical Society, respeclurg the EJsecJs of
    ,  Heat, excited by a Stream of Oxygen Gas thrown upon
      ignited Charcoal,         on a   Number    of   Gems and other refrac
       tory Substances submitted to its Action; with a Description,
       of  the  ylpparatus employed.
                             [Concluded from Page 266.]
  J.N      the    experiments that have been described,            no account
 was taken         of  the quantity      of oxygen    gas expended    on each,
  as the objects       the Society had chiefly in view were         :
       1.  To    fuse,   if  possible,   some   of   those refractory bodies
 which had before            resisted  every effort hitherto made to bring
 them into a state          of fusion;
      3. To ascertain whether any or which of the gems would
 retain their original colour, transparency and hardness, after
 fusion, with the view of determining whether it would he
 possible by such a process            to unite small stones or fragments
into one mass possessing the properties                 of the native misused;
gems;
      3. To determine whether any other gems besides the dia
mond could be dissipated by a strong heat ; and,
    .4. To observe what other effects might be produced by the
powerful agents employed in the experiments.
      The oxygen gas employed was obtained from oxyd of man
ganese by exposing it to a strong heat in an iron retort, and
was received over water in a pneumatic apparatus.                    The ori
fices     of  the blow-pipes were about a sixteenth            of an inch in
diameter, and the gas was discharged under a pressure of
about three pounds weight on the bell of the gasometer.
     The view of        the apparatus       (Plate  IX.  fig. 1.) will convey
a very correct idea          of  the gasometer,    and  of the arrangements
made for the last experiment,              viz. the one upon platina.

    The tub ABCD, three feet high and sixteen inches and a
half internal diameter, is made of mahogany, and reds on a
low stand.        A large glass receiver E, open at the bottom,
nearly sills the diameter of the tub. This receiver is twenty-
two inches in height from                the   lower edge lo the crown,
about sixteen         inches internal diameter, aud is capable of
containing       about    ten gallons of gas : it ascends or descends
in the tub, guided by the rod FG attached to its top, and
passing through the cross-bar            HI.      In this cross-bar     there is
some simple wheel-work worked bv the pulley at                  L   (concealed
in    the cross-bar),       and    which, turning       an index, tells the
quantity of gas expended from time to time, when that cir
cumstance is wiihed to be noted. The pulley at L is worked
by the chain KL attached to the top of the receiver.                      From
 the pulley at     L this    chain   passes to the   pulley   M, where it      i3
 wound up or let off at pleasure by means of weights put into
 the shell N, or removed thence to the horizontal plate O,
 which, by      means    of  a socket,    may be either put on or taken
 from the top of the rod           FG.      This contrivance is for the
 purpose    of enabling     the operator      to Command the pressure         of
 any required        column of water which            the tub can contain,
 which    is therefore made deeper than the receiver.                  To faci
 litate this, the pulley M has two grooves on its circumference,
 one of which receives the chain KL, aud is equi-distant from
 the centre all round        ;  the other, which       receives    the cord to
 which     the scale     N   is attached,     is not equi-distant from the
 pivot, but in asnail'form,          so adjusted as,   with   a  given weight
 in  the scale   N,    to counterpoise     exactly the glass receiver E,
 whether wholly or partially immersed in the water in the tub;
 so that, when no weight is on the round plate O, the height
 of  the water     within    and outside     of  the receiver   will   be on a
 level j  in other words, no pressure will be exerted on the gas
 it contains. By then putting known weights on the plate O,
 the receiver       is pressed down in the water so as to maintain
 an uniform pressure of any required column of water during
 the whole time of the process.
     The    gasometer      is charged      in   the following      manner:—
 Water     is first poured     into the tub      ABCD      (till full  if neces
 sary); the receiver        of   course   ascends (no weight being then
                                                                              oa

 on the plate O), filled with atmospheric air : at its greatest
 height its mouth is exactly on a level with the mouth P of
 the   tube   P,Q, R,S, bent        at right angles     at Q   and  R, and
joined at the end S to the tube ah, each end of which is
 likewise bent at right angles and furnished with a stop-cock.
 The    tube  TU,    fitted  air-tight to the end b of the tube ab,
 can be taken off at        T   without deranging the end U. Thi9
 being taken off, and the stop-cock b being opened, a com
 munication is made between the air in the room and that in
 the   receiver; which being now pressed down, either by
 the hand applied, or weights put on at O, discharges the air
it contains at the opening at T ; the place of which thus be
comes supplied with water up to the top of the internal tube
at   F, which    almost touches the upper part of the receiver.
If  the experiment require that the portion of atmospheric air
 contained in the tube          PQ.RS      should   be also removed     (as
when oxygen and hydrogen are to be combined in the form
ation of water), all that is necessary is to pour water into the
tube, through the opening T, till all the air be driven out of
the tube, and its place be occupied by water up to the open
ing T.      Fill also the tube TU with water. By this means
the receiver      and    the  tubes   are entirely deprived      of atmo
spheric air.     To clear the      tubes from water, that the oxygen
gas (or any other, according to the intention of the experi
ment) may find no obstruction when the receiver is wished
to be charged, a large        tin flask,    having  a neck ground to fit
the cock     Q,  and charged       with oxygen      gas, is joined to the
cock    Q, which     must then be opened         : the gas ascends from
the flask, and the water in SR and PQ takes its place. The
cock U must then be opened, to allow the water in the tube
TU     to descend into the cask       V.
    Oxygen gas is then to be transferred to the receiver from
a cask    V, previously silled with it. The cock a is kept shut,
and b opened, and water is made to descend from the funnel
W     into the cask by turning the cock c. The water, of
course, displaces an equal volume of gas in the cask, and
forces    it through      ihe tubes    UT,     ba, and   SRQP     into the
receiver    E, displacing    the water contained in it.        While the
gas is passing into the receiver,         the funnel   W   must never be
                                                                   allowed

allowed to run itself empty, otherwise the atmospheric air
getting into the bottom pipe, a portion of it might be forced
down with the next supply of water. The receiver being
charged with gas, (hut the cocks c and b for the present.
  Should any experiment require more gas thart the receives
will contain, the stream may be kept up direct from the cask
by opening the communication UT ba, and taking care to"
keep the funnel W well filled with water. Another cask
may be joined to the first by a mode of communication                                   for
obvious that we need not describe     that oxygen gas may

easily be supplied      length of time sufficient to melt down
                      for   a
completely the whole internal arrangements of any furnace.
   In none of the experiments, except the 32d, were the- table-
furnace and its appendages employed.       In ihe first seven,                         a
simple blow-pipe was joined to the tube of the gasometer,
and the substance to be operated upon, laid on   piece of                   a
ignited charcoal, was exposed to the issuing stream of gas.
It was observed in the course of these experiments that the
substances      seemed sometimes                 to be partially cooled,         by   the
stream falling on them while the charcoal was moving about
to expose the different      parts round the               stone to the action       of
the gas.   To obviate this inconvenience, the double                             blow-
pipe already mentioned Was constructed-, the nozles of                           which
formed such       an angle       as to          make the streams of blast         cross)
each other.      From this       it   is   obvious, that the charcoal placed
fit any distance from the nozles sliort            of that where the ftream3
would cross, received two streams of gas                  j    and that the nearer
the charcoal was brought to the blow-pipe,                            the   wider wa9
the space between the Centres of the spots on which the blast
fell.  By this means   became easy to expose the gems and
                            it
other substances to the full action of the caloric liberated                           by
the decomposition of the oxygen gas, without putting them
in the way of the undecompoied streams.

 Proftfsor   of  Chemistry    in Columbia College, to Mr. Tl 1.1OCH.
        SIR,                                         New- York, Dec.    3, 1S00.
                            CONSIDERING all things, I really
 trust  that   the   western world is doing its part in the philoso
 phical work of the day. We have great and excellent oppor
 tunities of observing phænomcna here, and some among us
 arc diligent to let no opportunity be lost.                  The following
 points we think fully established :
    1. There is proof as pointed as it needs to be, that the
 sickly seasons which afflict our cities are accompanied with,
 and occasioned by, noxious exhalations, locally produced
 either on board        sea-vessels, or in stores,        cellars, dwelling-
 houses, and sinks, in our towns.
    a. When existing in fliips, these noxious productions are
 not received      on board in the ports of the West Indies, or
 other places       beyond     sea,   as  is vulgarly    believed,    but uni
 versally  are produced      within the      sides of  the vessel itself, from
 Hastiness and corruption there.
    3. Not only are the exhalations from our corrupting fish,
 beef and hides, and from our abominable privy-pits, very
 injurious    to health,     and     destructive   of life, but     these  very
 vapours arc       so  acid  as   to be smelled       and  tasted by the re-
 packers of provisions.
    4. In the alimentary canal of such persons as feed upon
 beef and fisti, and, generally speaking, of lean animal sub -
fiance, there is formed a similar acid, whose presence has
 been detected,       aud   of  a strength      sufficient to curdle milk,
 to excoriate the fundament,             and to effervesce with carbonats
 ot alkaline salts.

 pretended    stone to be composed            of   a peculiar vegetable         acid
 united with a-lumine.
     Professor Abild^aard, to whom I am indebted for many
 curious minerals from Norway, sent me a few weeks ago, by
 the hands of M. Mantey, a small quantity of mellite, a part
 of which     he destined for the purpose of analysis,                  and  I took
 the earliest opportunity         of complying            with     his wishes in
 that respect.
                       Description os        the  Mellite.
     This  substance has a light yellow colour, on which account
 it  has been called mellite, or honey-stone               :   it generally crys
 tallises in octaedra,    the angles         of which        are sometimes       re
 placed by facets arising from laws of decrement, which
 have not attained to their limits.               Its specific gravity is not
 considerable ; according to Mr. Abich it is about i-666.                          It
 is found     in Thuringia in           strata    of  fossil    and    bituminous
 wood.
                    Chemiical Characters          of Mellite.
     I.  When      exposed    to the action         of   heat    in contact with
 the air this substance becomes white,               and burns without be
 coming sensibly charred : it leaves as residuum a white mat
ter, which produces a slight effervescence with acids.                        It has
no sensible savoirr,     yet,    if   kept for some time on the tongue,
it  occasions   a faint impreflion       of acidity.
                                   Analysis.
     II. I  took two grammes of mellite, reduced to powder, and
mixed them with four grammes of saturated carbonat of
potasli dissolved in a sufficient         quantity of water.           As   soon as
the mixture       was    made      it   produced       a  pretty     strong   effer
vescence without       the assistance      of foreign      heat    ;  but to acce
lerate    the decomposition of this substance, and render it
more complete, I exposed it to a gentle heat on a sand bath.
     The liquor, when filtrated after cooling, had a brownish
colour, and left on the paper              a  brown matter, which when
dried in the sun weighed nearly o-8 of a gramme.
    III. These o-8 of brown matter, when calcined in                         a  cm,,
eible, became white,         and weighed no more than 0-33                      of  a
                                                                         gramme

                Analysis of tie Honey -ftone, or Melllte.                               33 1
gramme.    When mixed with sulphuric acid diluted with
water, they produced a slight effervescence : the mixture was
then evaporated to dryness.
  According            to what had been announced by Professor Klap»
roth, I expected that by the addition of water almost the
Whole of the above matter would be dissolved ; but, on the
contrary, the greater                part         remained under the form of a
white powder.
   The liquor having been evaporated till there remained no
more than 3 or 4 grammes, I added to it a drop of the
sulphat of potash, and obtained by spontaneous evaporation
about evi gramme of alum mixed with a little sulphat of
lime.
   I  then examined the nature of the matter, which when
treated with sulphuric acid had not dissolved in water. For
this purpose I boiled it with a solution of the carbonat of
potash, and, when filtrated and washed, I had the following
result    :
   1st.       The muriatic acid, diluted with two                       parts    of water,
attacked        it,
            exciting               a     strong effervescence       ;   but the solution
did not become clear; on the contrary,    remained milky.      it
   2d. The   liquor, when  filtrated, gave with ammonia                                      a
transparent precipitate, resembling that arising from alumine
 by the same means     but   was not entirely soluble in pot-
                               ;             it
am. The greater part however was dissolved          the potash,             by
and exhibited all the characters                        of alumine;     for, when com
bined with        sulphuric acid,
                       the             gave alum.     The cause
                                                         it
therefore why this substance    did not remain combined wish
the sulphuric acid was, -in all probability, its being too much
heated towards the end of the desiccation.
   The liquor from which                          the   ammonia       had   separated       the
alumine alreadv spoken of                     still gave flight precipitates           by   the
carbonat of potash and                        the       oxalat of ammonia        ;     which
proves that           it   contained     a   little lime.
   That portion of                 the    matter not dissolved              by   the   potash

mull contain acid of mellite united to potash ; and in tile
hope that it would give up its base to mineral acids, I put
into a portion of the liquor a few drops of nitric acid, which
produced a very slight effervescence, and gave birth to a
small quantity of a brown flaky matter. Some hours after
what      I   suspected took place ; the acid                         of mellite      crystallised
wilder the form of small short prisms with brilliant facets.
   Finding that this method might enable me to separate the
above acid from the potash,                    I   exposed the whole               of the liquor
to a gentle heat,              and    mixed with it some                     nitric acid till it
had an excess sensible to the taste.                                  I    then made         it    pass
through the filter, in order to separate the brown flaky mat
ter, and to obtain the acid in a purer state. In two crystal-*
lisations I indeed obtained about 1*34 grammes of       which                          it,
were pretty white, though     had still  yellowish tint. The
                                             it                   a

stances were as follow               :
   1st.       This   acid has        brilliant     facets,       a    considerable     degree          d(
hardness,         and
                flight  a                acid savour accompanied with                        a    little
bitterness,which may have arisen from some particles of                                               bi-»

yellowish colour.
   ad. A portion of this acid, when exposed to the flame of
the blow-pipe, exhibited at first some scintillations like salt
petre   ;   it   then swelled up, and lest                  a   matter which soon pene

                                         a                                            it
swelled up, then became carbonaceous without producing an
oily smoke,          and left        a   light charcoal which was exceedingly
alkaline *.          This      acid remained therefore      united to certain          a
quantity of potafli, notwithstanding the excess of nitric acid
added to its solution.   The same effect took place also with
the tartareous and oxalic acids, which                                by   these means pass to
the state of acidulous salts.

    5th. Some grammes of the fame acid dissolved in water,
being mixed, 1st, with a solution of lime, immediately formed
a white flaky precipitate, which soon deposited itself at the
bottom of the liquor : ad, with a solution of the sulphat of
lime, a light granulated and crystallised precipitate, which
left to the water a little transparency, but which was in
creased and rendered flaky by the addition of a drop of am
monia*: 3d, with a solution of the muriat of barytes, a
very small precipitate at first, but some moments after a mul
titude of crystals in the form of needles : 4th, with a solution
of   silver, a white precipitate, silky and brilliant like a solution
of   soap ; some time after it deposited itself under the form of
dust: 5th, with a solution of 'lead by nitric acid, a white
pulverulent and very heavy precipitate : 6th, with a solution
of mercury, a white precipitate which was rendered black by
a drop      of ammonia.
    From the result of           these experiments it appears the acid             of
the mellite has a great many properties analogous to those                         of
the acid      of sorrel;     and by the comparison which                I  made,    I
could perceive          no other differences than the following               :  1st,
The precipitate which it occasions in the solution of sul
phat of lime manifests itself less speedily, and is crystalline,
instead of being pulverulent like that formed by the acidulous
oxalat of potash.             2d, It seems less acid to the taste than
the acidulous oxalat of potash, but this may be owing to my
not having added to its combination with potasti enough of
nitric acid to deprive it of a sufficient quantity of that alkali.
3d, It swells up a little more by heat than the acidulous oxa
lat of potash.
    In   a  word, the sublimated salt, the large quantity                   of car-

       The   acidulous tartrite of potash does not immediately produce a pre
cipitate in a sulurion of the sulplut of lime,      but in 24 liours after there
are formed in the       mixture    crystals with  very brilliant facets, which are
a compound      of liine  and tartarcous   acid. Though crystallised, this tartrite
of lime has    no resemblance to that produced by the acid of honey-stone
with the same matter;        it differs from it by swelling   up in the fire, where
as   the other    is   decomposed without swelling up ; and in this has an an
 alogy to the oxalat of lir.ic.

bonic acid, that of water, and the small portion of charcoal
which  the mellite furnishes by distillation, are all facts which
seem to concur to prove the identity of these two acids ; for
the fait of sorrel exhibits in the fire the fame phænomena*.
  The octaedral form of the mellite seems also to have an
analogy with that of the oxalic acid, which is a rectangular
prism terminated by pyramids of four faces : to be certain of
this, nothing is necessary but to compare the inclination                                     of
the faces.
   However,      as    Ihad at my disposal only about 1*34 gramme
of this acid,    I    was not able to subject it to all the tests neces
sary to demonstrate,in a positive manner, its identity in every
point with the oxalic acid ; for, though they exhibited ana
logous phænomena in all the comparative experiments I
made, it is possible that by others which may be made
hereafter there may occur one difference                         sufficient to destroy
the resemblance.

is most commonly found, to repeat the analysis of    and to                     it,

sorrel. Should my opinion be confirmed       new experi                   by

                          the Infinitesimal Calculus.                                   337
  The   reason      of this      procedure        is simple.           Suppose we have
occasion to investigate           the relations         which        subsist between       se
veral proposed quantities.                 If   it be difficult             to find directly
equations to express these relations, we naturally recur to
some  intermediate quantities, which may serve as terms of
comparison. By this means we obtain, if not the very equa
tions sought, at least other equations, in which the proposed
quantities are blended with auxiliary ones ; and there can be
no question that these last ought to be eliminated.     But                                  if,
additionally, the values of these auxiliary quantities be arbi
trary, and may be supposed as small as we please, without
affecting the proposed quantities,       easy to see, that,
                                                      it    in
                                                           is                          if
the equations expressing the relations sought, arbitrary quan
tities be mixed with proposed ones, each of these equations
may be decomposed into two, one containing assigned, and
the other arbitrary quantities.   nearly in this manner,
                                                 It   is
that an equation containing real and imaginary quantities
may be decomposed into two equations, the one consisting of
real, and the other of imaginary quantities.  Now, as we
only want the equation which exists between the proposed
quantities,     evident that, in those equations where they
               it   is
are mixed with arbitrary ones, we may safely neglect the
quantities which embarrass our calculation, when the result
ing errors can only           affect the equation between                      the arbitrary
quantities which           it   contains.         Now           this  precisely what
                                                                       is
takes place in the Infinitesimal                 Calculus,        where we consider
infinitely   small       quantities        as   nullities       when compared with
finite ones.
   In order    to render             this explanation still clearer, let us re
 sume our former example.                   In article    we found

ary, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 'a—* (or

the latter part of the numerator ay — xj; and thus far the author's
new equation is right.
   But the auxiliary, equivalent to the assigned quantity zy . (a — x),
cannot be what he makes it ; for, as we have just seen, a — x ==

     Now, though y1 and ** be infinitely less JIM than their infinitely
 small roots y and x, and consequently ^;y2 + yx3, infinitely less than
 2yry, and thus may be safely neglected ; yet it would not, perhaps,
 have been amiss, if the author, while he was exhibiting all his quan
 tities, had brought them also into view.
      Some readers may be surprised at the mention of quantities infi
 nitely less than infinitely small ones.                But their wonder will cease
 when they recollect, That if any integer, or any fraction, be multi
 plied by a fraction, the product will be less than the multiplicand,
 and will, in fatt, be only such apart of the multiplicand, as the mul
 tiplier is of unity. Thus, if 'oooooooooooo 1 (prefixing cyphers ad
 infinitum) be multiplied by any other interminably or inconceivably
  small fraction,        the product will be only such an inconceivably
.small part of the already inconceivably small multiplicand, as is
  expressed by the inconceivably small multiplier : in other words, the
  product (relatively to our conceptions) may be laid to be infinitely
  le(s than the infinitely small multiplicand.              In like manner, xy may
  represent a rectangle,         whose breadth x is infinitely small compared
  with its length _y, which may be any finite line, or it may even be an
  indefinitely or infinitely great line. But now suppose y also to be in
  finitely small, or to become_y; then it is easy to see, that this second
  rectangle xy, both whose dimensions are infinitely small, will be in
  finitely less than the first rectangle xy, which has only one of its
  dimensions infinitely small. Thus also the squares x2 and y1 will
   be infinitely     less than their infinitely small roots x and y, and the
  cubes x1 and y1, than the squares x1 and y1, &c. — Neque entm novit

       Were this the proper place, we might recommend these and many

  the serious attention of certain gentlemen, who, without abating a

   The Infinitesimal Analysis, therefore, differs from the
method of indeterminates only in this, that in the former,
quantities which, were they allowed to remain, would, in the
end, always destroy one another, are treated as nothing, or
rather are understood throughout the calculation; while, in
the Method of Indeterminates,                   we wait            till   of the
                                                                          the end
calculation,      and then      cancel    the        arbitrary quantities which
ought to be eliminated.            This       last method may therefore                    very
easily be made to supply the use               of    the Infinitesimal              Calculus,
without the help of imperfect equations, and without com
mitting any error in the course of the calculation.
   38. There is yet another method of coming at the results
of the Infinitesimal Analysis, without overpassing the bounds
of ordinary algebra; and that             is,    by
                                     the Method of Limits, or
Ultimate Ratios.    For though this analysis be founded entirely
on the properties of limits and ultimate ratios, differs never            it
theless from what      properly called the method of limits, in
                         is
this, that in the latter, the quantities which we call InsiniT
tesimal,     do not enter separately into the calculation,                          nor even
their ratios, but only the ultimate values of these ratios,
which being finite quantities, do^ not   properly constitute  so
this method      a   particular calculus,            as   a   simple        application of
ordinary algebra.
   The      business before us, then,                by
                                    barely introducing into
                                                is
ordinary algebra, not Infinitesimal quantities themselves,
but the ultimate ratios of these quantities, to supply the
means which the Infinitesimal Analysis furnishes, for dis
covering any properties, ratios and relations whatsoever, of
the magnitudes which constitute any proposed system      and                           ;
this   that which
      is            properly
                           is called the Method of Limits.
  To explain the         procedure,      and give some idea                    of   the spirit,
of this method,         we shall again resume the example before

 as the ordinary Infinitesimal Analysis, it might even appear
 the most eligible of the two : for it would have the advantage
 of conducting us to the fame results, by a path which is
 always direct and luminous ; whereas the other conducts us
 to the truth, only after having made us traverse, so to speak,
 the regions of error.
    But it must be owned that the Method of Limits is attended
 with a considerable difficulty, which has no place in the ordi
 nary Infinitesimal Calculus.                  In the former, the infinitely
 small quantities cannot, as in the latter, be separated from
 each other ; and these quantities being always connected two
 and two, afford no opportunity of introducing into the com
 binations, the properties of each in particular, or of subject
 ing the equations into which they enter, to those transform
 ations which may assist in their elimination.                        This difficulty
 is much less felt in the operations themselves, than in the
 preparatory and supplemental                 propositions and reasonings.

        The Origin of     the   Name, Infinitely Small Quantities.
   40. From what has been said (in article 3.) on the origin
which the Infinitesimal Analysis might have had, it appears,
that the quantities called Infinitely Small, received that name
 from it's being at first believed that it was necessary, for the
 success of the calculations in which they were employed, to
.attribute to those arbitrary quantities values, which were really
less    than any which could be recognized by the fenses, or
conceived     by the imagination. But a better digested theory
has made it appear, that such a supposition is unnecessary ;
since the success of this calculus proceeds not from the atte
nuation      of   those arbitrary      quantities, but solely from the
compensation of       errors which they occasion      in the process.
     We                  in illustrating the example so often
           have seen indeed,
adduced, that the procedure and the results of the calculation
were precisely the same, whatever value we attributed to the
infinitely small quantities 7t/Zand RZ, and that consequently
the character, of this kind of quantities consists not in their
real minuteness, but rather in their being absolutely             indeter
minate,     that    is,
                   in their property of remaining arbitrary
throughout the calculation, and     independant on the pro
                                            so
posed quantities, that we  can always take them as small as
we please, without changing, in any respect, the conditions
of     the problem.
    Infinitesimal quantities, as was observed in article 24^ are
 by  no meuns chimerical beings, but simply variable quan
tities, characterized           by
                           the nature of their limit, which            is   6'
for infinitely small quantities, and             —   for those which   are
infinitely great.  To these indeterminate quantities, as well
as to all other indefinite quantities, may be succeffiyely attri
buted, divers arbitrary values, and among those values ought
to be included the ultimate values of all, that        o, for   is,
quantities infinitely small, and          —      for those which arc infi

Diflintlion of Mathematical Infinity into Sensible and Absolute.
  41. This observation leads to the distinction of mathema*
tical infinity into two kinds, namelv, senfible, or assignable,
infinity, and absolute, or metaphysical, infinity, which is the
limit of the former.
   Ifthen, to\ any infinitely small quantity, be assigned a

call    a.      or ajjignable, Infinitesimal; whereas, if this

will be what call an absolute, or metaphysical, Infinitesimal,
                   I
which        I   shall also distinguish          by       the name         of   an evanescent
quantity.          Thus       an evanescent quantity                  is   not that which        is
generally called an infinitely small                            quantity,        but only the
ultimate value of that quantity.                          It    is   only,   I   fay,   a   deter
minate value which, like any other value, may be attributed'
to that arbitrary quantity, which     generally denominatedis
infinitely small.
  42. The consideration of these evanescent quantities would
be almost useless, in calculation we were restricted to treat
                              if
them         as simple     for, in that cafe, they would pre
                           nullities   ;
sent only the vague ratio of o to o, which      no more equal              is
to    than
       2         to 3, or to any other quantity whatsoever.
                   it    is
But    must not be forgotten, that these nullities are here
       it
invested with particular                  properties,          as the      ultimate value of
indefinitely small quantities, whose limits they are; and that
the particular epithet, evanescent,    applied to them in order
                                                          is
to denote, that, of all the ratios and relations of which they
are susceptible in quality                of nullities, no other                 is   considered
as entering into the calculation, than those which the law                                      of
continuity assigns to them, when the system of auxiliary
quantities   supposed insensibly to approach to the system of
                  is
assigned quantities.  This idea    what some great geometri
                                                     is

before nor after they had vanished, but in the very instant of

that, before the body reaches that place, the velocity is not the ultimate
velocity,   and when it has reached the place, the velocity is nothing.                           The
answer is easy ; for by the ultimate velocity is meant the velocity of the
body, neither before it reaches its last place, nor after it has reached                            it,

 to  MZ     and MZ, any other ratio than that of equality, nor
 any other relation than that of identity *.
     43. We have seen that by introducing into the calculation
 infinitely small quantities, and by neglecting them in com
 parison with finite quantities, the equations became imper
 fect, and that the errors which they produced were only
 compensated in the required result.              JJut we have it now in
 our power to avoid this kind of inconvenience, by means of
 evanescent quantities, which being nothing else than the
 ultimate values of the infinitely small quantities correspond
 ing to them, may, like any of the other values, be attributed
 to these indefinitely small quantities ; and which being, in
  another point of view, absolute nullities, may be neglected,
 when they are found connected with any effective quantities,
  without preventing the calculation from being perfectly rU
 gorous.
     44. The Infinitesimal Analysis, then, may be considered in
  two different points of view ; by regarding the infinitely small
  quantities, either as real, effective quantities, or as absolute
  nullities.    In the first cafe, the Infinitesimal Analysis is
  nothing else than the Calculus of compensated errors; and in
 the second, it is the art of comparing evanescent quantities
  among themselves, and with others, in order to deduce from
  these comparisons the proportions              and relations, whatever
  they may be, which         subsist  among the quantities proposed.

  Evanescent quantities, as being equal to nothing, ought to
be neglected in the calculation, when they are connected, by
addition or subtraction, to any real, effective quantity. But
they have,      nevertheless,           as   we   have      seen,     relations very
important      to           relations

quantities is subjected in its mutations.    Now, in order
to discover     this law of continuity,                   it is   easy    to perceive,
that we are obliged to consider   these evanescent quantities at
some distance    from the limit where they entirely vanish,
otherwise they present only the indefinite ratio of o to o;
but this distance is arbitrary, and hath no other object but to
enable us to judge more easily of the ratios or relations which
exist between these evanescent quantities.       These are the
ratios which  we have in view, when we consider infinitely

the present point of view; but are only employed to assist the
imagination, and to indicate the law of continuity which de
termines the ratios and relations,                whatever they may be, of
the corresponding evanescent quantities.
   According to this hypothesis, the quantities represented by
MZ and RZ, in the proportion MZ : RZ :: TP : MP, are
supposed     absolutely        equal    to nothing.          But,     as it is their
ratio that is required, in order to perceive                        it's equality to
 TP
jj—     , the indefinitely small quantities, which answer to these
nullities, must be considered, not that they themselves may be
introduced into the calculation, but that the vanifliing quan

under the denominations of MZ and RZ.

Now          the consideration              os these last, at least mentally, is ne
cessary to the apprehensionof ihe law of continuity, which
determines the required ratio of the evanescent quantities

we have it entirely in our power to contider them either as
real quantities, or as absolute nullities. The difference be
tween        two ways of considering this question, consists in
            these
this, that, by regarding evanescent quantities as nullities, the
propositions, equations and results,                             whatever            they may be,
are always accurate     and rigorous ; but have a reference to
'quantities which   are  creatures of the understanding, and ex
 press the relations which exist between quantities which do
 not themselves exist *.                     On      the other hand,                 by considering
 infinitely small quantities as having some reality, the propo
 sitions, equations and results, whatever they may be, have
 for their subject real quantities.  But these last propositions,
 equations and results are false, or rather imperfect, and                                              be->
 come exact   in the end only in consequence of the compen
 sation of their errors, a compensation, however, which is the
 necessary and infallible result of the operations of the calculus.
    * Thus     the ratios of the         ordinal      numbers         (one, two,          three,    &c.)    to
 each other, while those numbers remain floating,                           so to speak,      in indeter
 minate abstraction, and unapplied                to any particular           objects of fense,         may
 be said to   "     express    tjie relations which exist between quantities which do
 not themselves exist."            Thus      also,    isa   body be supposed to fall from                  any
 moderate     height,                                 (resistance apart) will
                              its velocities at any two points
 have to each other the ratio of the sq'iare roots of the spaces supposed to
 be described ; although           no body ever atiually fell, or perhaps ever                          will
 actually    fall, from that       precise   height.        These examples, it is hoped,                will
 prevent readers who are not much accustomed to such speculations,                                      from
 raflily charging our author with absurdity, in talking of the relations be
 tween quantities which do not themselves exist ; that is, which have no
 existence in external nature.  For the truth      and                is,

 Mathematics, though originally abstracted, or copied, from external ob

 proceeds all that accuracy for which those sciences are justly valued.  The
 inaccuracy of the figures, motions, &c. of external objects induces    corre                       a
 sponding inaccuracy into Mixed Mathematics. — The inaccuracy of lan
 guage has an analogous effect               in

 unambiguous          language.        Hence  the endless disputes with which men
 unhappily     disposed        to cavil, and who affect to doubt of every thing, never
 cease to embroil       that important,           and otherwise             not unpleasant,        region of

furnishes    answers to all the objections which have been made
against the InfinitesimalAnalysis, the principle of which se
veral geometricians have thought faulty, and capable of lead
ing to erroneous conclusions. But those gentlemen have been
overwhelmed, if the expression may be allowed, with a mul
titude of prodigies, and with the splendour of the numerous
truths wherewith this principle has teemed.
   These objections may be reduced to this.    The quantities
said to be infinitely small, are either absolute nullities, or
they are not   for it is ridiculous to suppose that there exist
                   ;
entities, which hold a middle place between quantity and
nullity. Now if they are absolute nullities their comparison
leads to nothing, for the ratio               of o     to o is no more a than          it
is b, or any other quantity whatever.        on the other hand, If,
they are not nullities, but real quantities, they cannot with
out error be neglected, as the rules of the Infinitesimal Ana-,
lysis prescribe.
     The    answer     is
                     simple*  So far from its not being logical to
consider   infinitely small quantities, either as real beings, or
as   nothings, they may, on the contrary, be treated at plea
sure, either as nullities or as true, quantities.                        For   they who
wish to consider them   as nullities, may answer, that what they
call infinitely small quantities are not any nullities taken at
random, but nullities assigned        the Jaw of continuity which
                                                 by
determines their relation*; that among all the relations of
which these quantities are susceptible               nullities, they only
                                                                as
consider those which are determined                              by
                                                      this law of conti
nuity   ;   and,   in   a   word, that these relations are not vague and
arbitrary, because the law of continuity does not assign several
different relations between the differentials, for example, of
the abscisse and ordinate of curve, when these differentials
                                          a
vanish, but one only, which                 is   that      of   the subtangent    to the
ordinate.
    On the other hand, they who regard infinitely small quan
tities as true ones, may answer, that what they call an infi
nitely small quantity  one which
                               is   arbitrary and independant
                                                      is

Now it is evident, that no such error can exist, except among
quantities, one of which at least is arbitrary.    When, there
fore, we arrive     at a result       containing      no arbitrary quantity,
and which expresses any relation whatever                   between quantities-
given, and those determined by the conditions of the problem,
we may rest assured that that result is accurate ; and that,
consequently, the errors necessarily committed in expressing
these conditions, must have been compensated and have disap-
pearedj  by the necessary and infallible effects os the operation.'
   48.  Other  mathematicians, apparently embarrassed by the
objection just discussed, have simply confined themselves lo
prove, that the Method of Limits, the processes of which are
rigorously accurate, in all respects, must necesstrily lead to
the fame results as the Infinitesimal Calculus.  But, while it
is agreed that the principle           of that method        is very luminous,
it cannot    be dissembled,         that the difficulty is thus only elud
ed, not removed ; that the Method               of Limits    leads to the fame
results as the Infinitesimal      Calculus, only by a difficult and
circuitous    way   ;   and, in fine, that that method, far from
being the fame with the Infinitesimal Calculus,         on the        is,
contrary, only the art of dispensing with this calculus, and of
supplying    it    by
                ordinary Algebra.     appears      It                to me, that
(hey would succeed, in  more simple

of Indeterminates.    But why adopt one of these methods to
the exclusion of the rest, when .they can afford us their mutual
assistance? Let us .then employ them all — the Infinitesimal
Calculus,properly    called, the Method of Limits, and the

Method of Indeterminates, as circumstances may require, and
let us neglect none of the means which                   can conduct        us        to
truth, or simplify our researches.

voices, and soon after saw about tweuty armed men, who
were escorting  company of prisoners, coupled together, two
                            a
and two, with thongs.                             Some of the former immediately
sprung towards              him,         and conducted him to their leader, who,
after surveying him for some time, took  thong which was                   a
wound round his middle, and, having bound with  his hands                            it
and feet, ordered him                        to follow him.               Towards     noon they
arrived at the large village of Cuojaha, where they rested, and
procured    supply of water.
                a               This was the first village  the                                in

the size of     a   targe   pea   ;   they contain      a   kind of meal of      an excellent taste,

354                          Travels through the
province of Porguhomat, which in maps is called Osila.
Damberger's fellow-travellers belonged to this nation, and
resided at a place half a day's journey further to the north.
     This province       lies at the distance     of four days' journey
from the boundaries of the kingdom of Congo ; it is exceed
ingly fertile, and abounds with productions of various kinds.
The people are warlike, and defend their territories with great
bravery.       Our traveller was told, that they coujd bring into
the field from 18,000 to 20,000 men ; but he believes this
account to be exaggerated one half, as the population ap
peared to be only very moderate.               This nation was formerly
subject to the .king        of Benguela, who procured from it his
best soldiers     ;  but    as  these soldiers were often sold for staves
when the prince stood in need of money, the people rebelled
 in the year 1776, and, putting to death the old king Khiguan,
 declared themselves independent.              The son of the murdered
king was      afterwards     placed on the throne ; but      in every thing
 that relates to public affairs he is obliged to be guided by the
 advice of the oldest of the inhabitants, who are assigned to
 him     as counsellors.          Disputes and quarrels among these
 people are settled by the oldest persons in each family ; and
 the offending party, when the cause has been determined, is
 punished out of doors.            Many of their    customs ate similar to
  those   of the neighbouring        nations, but they have some pecu
 liar   to themselves.         There are fewer women here than in
  some    of the other      African nations,    and   it is even   not un
  common for two men to have only one wife, and yet to live
  together in perfect harmony.               The women are highly re
  spected,   and    treated    much   better than among the surrounding
  nations.      Male children immediately          after birth are circum
   cised, and great rejoicings take place         on such occasions,     be
   cause boys are much more valued than girls.                As  soon as a
   child  can speak, he is taught by his grandfather, or,          if he has
   none, by his father, to know those vegetables and fruits
   which can be used as food, and to guard against those which
   are pernicious.         He must learn also to make mats of long
   grafs, and,    when      he becomes older, to take a (hare in the
   management of the domestic concerns of the family : his
   chief attention, however, is directed to hunting, in which ft
                                                                            is

                        Interior Parts    of Africa.                  $$$
is requisite that he should distinguish himself by his boldness
and dexterity.        When he kills an elephant, he is no longer
classed among the boys, but considered            as having attained to
the rank of       a  man.     Every stranger     not engaged, in trade
with this nation      is considered   as a Have,    but he is well treat
 ed, and never afterwards fold ; for these people             detest this
 traffic, and endeavour      to free from their state    of slavery those
 unfortunate beings who are destined by other nations to be
 fold.     When they learn therefore that any slave-dealers are
 about to    pass  through or near their territories with a cargo of
  slaves, they assemble     in a large body, attack the slave-mer
 chants, and, having delivered the slaves, receive them as
  members of their nation.          Our traveller was obliged to ac
  company     a  party of them on an expedition of this kind, but
 ¦he   had the misfortune to be taken prisoner.           The   people by
  whom he was made captive were called the Sovians.
      Being liberated however some tinie after, he continued his
 journey on the 26th of February, 1786, and on the 5th of
  June following arrived at the village of Mohakam on the
  frontiers of the antient kingdom of Loango, where he pro
  cured    a guide who conducted him to the town of Malemba,
  the capital of the united kingdoms of Malemba and Cacongo.
  This country is about four hundred miles in length, and two
  hundred and forty in breadth ; it is exceedingly fertile, and
  abounds with vegetables, minerals, and animals of various
   kinds which are caught for the fake of their skins. The river
   Bambo and the lake Samoy supply plenty of fish and shell
   fish. The trade of this country is exceedingly advantageous
   to the Europeans, who for the merest trifles, such as (hells
   and bits of iron, often get in return the best skins and furs in
   large quantities.     The king's standing army consists of be
   tween ten and twelve thousand men, who can at any time be
   collected in the course of forty-eight hours. The king him
   self is a good warrior, leads his troops into the field in person,
   and is much dreaded even by his more powerful neighbours :
   whenever he goes abroad he is usually attended by four of his
   ministers, who are at the fame time officers, and twelve men
   pf his body-guard.
       The town is surrounded by        a  wall composed    of fragments
                                                   j                     of

356                       Travels through the
of rock and loose stones, heaped together without clay or
mortar, and by a ditch.            The palace where the king re-
fides is badly built, is one story high, and about five hun
dred feet in circumference.           It stands before the water-gate
on the river Maleiwpo, towards the lake, and affords a good
prospect.     Our traveller saw planted near it four three-
pounders.                    ¦¦•¦•
   After being       exposed   to   various    hardships   among these
people,    our traveller, being sent out with a          party to collect
elephants' teeth, found means to make his escape, and ar
rived among a people called the Yaganese, with whom he
remained till the end of the year.           On the ad of December
he again resumed his journey, and, crossing the Akafi moun
tains, reached the territory of Mugari. This country is small,
and thinly peopled.        The inhabitants are of low stature, and
far from being hospitable to strangers. Though of small size,
they are more expert in hunting the elephant than many of
their neighbours ; and from the hides and teeth of these ani
mals they procure their chief subsistence. The whole number
of the inhabitants does not amount to more than three thou
sand  : most   of  them live   in  caves  of the mountains.
   After pasting through        a variety    of small villages our    tra-»
veller entered the kingdom of Yukodego (Monœmngi), which
towards the east borders on Abyssinia.             The river Zambece,
which at the town of Yukora divides itself into five branches,
traverses nearly the whole        of the country, and, at the di Dance
of half   a day's journey from the town of Zambre, forms a
large lake, bearing the name of that town.                 The town of
Zambre, which lie visited soon after, consists of four hun
dred huts, and fifty or sixty houses.          The former     are built  of
timber    and   straw,   the latter    of   stones and    mortar.     The
town, which       is  of a triangular     stiape,  lies on the right side
of  the river Zambre, has two principal and three cross streets,
and is defended       on one fide by    a  wall.     The  houses, as well
as the palace, are only one story high.
   At Zambre our traveller         was introduced to the king, who
conducted him       into what   he called his hall, where he displayed
to him hi^ treasures.       They consisted of a few worn copper
eoirts,  two looking-glasses, an almanack for the year 1743,
                                                                    a few

ft few {heels of printed paper ; four small cannons, such a3
children have to play with; a few other toys, and a wooden
clock, which seemed to be quite deranged.         The king
 having, by an interpreter, expressed great concern that the
 clock did not go as formerly, our traveller, when his ma
jesty was gone, told the interpreter that he would try to re
pair   it,   if   the king gave him permission.                        The king      assented   ;
and Damberger,                  though not much acquainted with clock-
making,        was        so    fortunate as to succeed. \Vhen the king
returned       next       day he was much surprised,                    and began to en
tertain very high idea of man who had been able to effect
           a                                  a
what exceeded the (kill and ability of the most ingenious of
his subjects. From that moment our traveller's consequence
continually increased; he received the same victuals as were
        by
                                                                                                a by
used      the king, accompanied him every where, and,
means   of this privilege, had an opportunity of getting
complete view of the lake of Zambre, when the king went
thither to fee the people employed there in fowling and fisti-
ing.   This lake    in length three full days journey, and
                               is                                                               is
           with about forty small islands, frequented
interspersed                                            in                              by
numerable flocks of birds.       of an oval form, and about
                                                  It   is
half   day's journey in breadth.
       a                                                         The king    keeps      here    a
guard of two hundred men to take                                care that the fowling and
fistiing are properly conducted for his majesty's advantage;
but our traveller was told that these people dress for
themselves          the        best    of the fowls              and   the   fisli   that are
caught.
     After spending             five months at this place, Damberger, hav
ing obtained the king's leave to depart, continued his journey
on the 28th of May 1787, and on the nth of June arrived
at the first frontier huts               of   the      Moohatans;      numerous and
                                                                         a
warlike nation, who inhabit                       a    tract of land belonging to the
kingdom of Moncemugi, and subject to its sovereign. As
the rainy season had now commenced in this part of the
country, he was obliged to remain some time under very
unfavourable circumstances at the village of Mytob, from
which he set out on the 19th of July, in company with
some    travellers             from     the       country         of Mosseguejos, lying
eastward       of   the        kingdom        of Moncemugi,              who were going
to the kingdom                  of Otoba          to fetch salt.        After   crossing the

river Druma, and ascending                     a   high mountain             to the   west,
he arrived among a people                      called
                                             Mophanians,   who

dwell in caves, and by whom he was well received.          The
king of this country is an absolute sovereign, and possesses a
tract of territory ten days journey in length from west to east,
and seven in breadth             from north             to south.       Of    the various
kinds of fruit-trees found here, the most remarkable are the
domo and the inkobak.     The former bears a kind of apples
without pips, of the size of a hen's egg, having a golden
colour, and a taste like that of lemons.    It grows on the
mountains,   has long, narrow, sharp-pointed leaves, and at
tains to the height of the cherry-tree.  The bark resembles
that of the cinnamon-tree, and is preserved along with the
fruit, and used all the year through as a corroborant.  The
inkobak     tree bears       a     fruit of the nut species as large as an
egg: it     is   of   an oblong form, and has       a red husk, which in
all probability would afford a good colour for dyeing.   Our
traveller observed that the earthen-ware used by the inhabit
ants was dyed with           it,     and that      it   retained    its beauty even      in
the fire.        The nut itself         is   white,      and   tastes   like cinnamon.
The tree     as large as the oak, and all the year through bears
             is
fruit and blossoms at the fame time.
   After leaving these people, our author prosecuted his journey
through the villages of Ohgothen, Uhroh, and Mato, to
Ocymoro, the residence of the king, where he was placed
among the                 but, finding means to effect his
                      royal slaves;
escape across the sandy deserts, he ascended the Mountains
of the Moon, and arrived in the territories of the Voma-
hanians.          These   he found hospitable and good tem
                           people
pered; they presented  him  with tiger's flesli, which he had
never before tasted, and, having directed him what course to
proceed, wished him     prosperous journey.

   Dejlmflion of     the   Membrana Tympani of            the  Ear.     By

       DEAR SIK,
A,   i,T the time you were engaged in the investigation of the
structure and uses of the membrana tympani, you mentioned
a wish   to ascertain    the  effect    a  rupture of that membrane
would have upon hearing.           I   now send vou some observa
tions on that subject, which,         if you think them of sufficient
importance, you will do me the honour of presenting                 to the
Royal Society.                 I am, &c.
                                                ASTLEY COOPER.
   Anatomists have endeavoured to ascertain, by experi
ments on quadrupeds, the loss of power which the organ of
hearing would sustain by perforating the membrana tympani :
dogs have been made the subject of these trials ; but the re
sults have been neither clear nor satisfactory, and they accord
but little with the phænomena I am about to relate.
    Mr. Cheselden had conceived the design of making the
 human organ itself the subject of direct experiment ; and a
 condemned criminal was pardoned, on condition of his sub
mitting    to it ;  but   a  popular outcry being raised,          it  was
 thought proper to relinquish the idea.
    Though denied the aid of experiment, we are not without
 the means    of obtaining knowledge upon          such subjects;     since
 the changes produced by           disease   frequently furnish a clue
 which is equally satisfactory.
    It often happens, that some parts of an organ are destroyed
           * From the TranJaSiom of the Royal    Society f»r jSoo.
                                   3  A   %                               by

 $60                   Observations  on the Dejlruftion
  by disease, whilst others are left in their natural state; and
  hence, by the powers retained by such organ, after a partial
  destruction, we are enabled to judge of the functions per
  formed by those parts when the whole was in health.
     Guided by this principle, I have made the human ear the
  subject of observation, and have endeavoured to ascertain the
 degree of loss it sustains in its powers by the want of the
 membrana tympani ; a membrane which has been generally
  considered, from its situation in the meatus, and its connec
 tion with the adjacent parts by a beautiful and delicate struc
 ture, as essentially necessary to the sense of hearing; but
 which,      as  appears    by the following observations,        may be
 lost, with little prejudice to the functions of the organ.
     Mr. P         ,   a  medical student     at St. Thomas's     hospital,
 of the age of twenty years, applied to me, in the winter of
 j 797, while he was attending a course of anatomical lectures,
 requesting my opinion upon the nature of a complaint in his
 ear,   which had long rendered him slightly deaf.
     Upon inquiring into the nature of the symptoms which
 had preceded, and of those which now accompanied the
 disease, he informed         me, that he had been subject from his
infancy to pains in the head,            and was attacked,     at the age
 of  ten years,      with an inflammation        and  suppuration in the
left ear,      which     continued    discharging     matter  for several
weeks    :   in the space of about twelve months after the first
attack, symptoms of a similar kind took place in the right
ear, from which also matter issued for a considerable time.
The    discharge     in each instance    was    thin,  and extremely    of
fensive to the smell ; and, in the matter, bones or pieces of
bones were observable.           The immediate consequence of these
attacks was a total           deafness,   which     continued   for three
months     ;   the hearing then began to return,           and, in about
ten months from the last attack, was restored to the state in
which it at present remains.
    Having thus         described  the  disease   and its symptoms, he
gave me the following satisfactory proof of each membrana
tympani being imperfect. Having filled his mouth with air,
he closed the nostrils and contracted his cheeks : the air,
thus compressed,         was heard   to rush through the meatus au-
                                                                  ditorius

                      of the Memlrana Tympani.                     361
ditorius with a whistling noise, and the hair hanging from
 the temples became agitated by the current of air which issued
 from the ear.      To determine this with      greater   precision,  I
 called for a lighted candle, which was applied in turn to each
 ear, and the flame was agitated in a similar manner.           Struck
 with  the novelty    of  these phænomena,   I wished to have many
 witnesses  of them, and therefore requested him, at the con
 clusion of the lecture upon the organ of hearing, to exhibit
 them to his fellow students; with which request he was so
 obliging   as to  comply.
    It was evident from these experiments, that the membrana
 tympani of each ear was incomplete, and that the air issued
 from the mouth, by the Eustachian tube, through an open
 ing in that membrane, and escaped by the external meatus.
    To determine the degree in which the membrana tympani
 had been injured, I passed a probe into each ear, and found
 that the membrane on the left fide was entirely destroyed ;
 since the probe struck against the petrous portion      of  the tem
 poral bone, at the interior part of .the tympanum, not by
passing through a small opening; for, after an attentive exa
mination,     the space usually occupied by the membrana tym
pani was found to be an aperture, without one trace         of mem
brane remaining.
    On   the   right side, also,   a probe could be  passed   into the
cavity of the tympanum; but here, by conducting it along
the sides of the meatus, some remains of the circumference
of the membrane could be discovered, with a circular open
ing in its centre, about the fourth of an inch in diameter.
    From such a destruction of this membrane, partial indeed
in one ear, but complete in the other, it might be expected
that a total annihilation of the powers of the organ would
have followed : but the deafness was inconsiderable.              This
gentleman,      if his attention were exerted,   was capable, when
in company, of hearing whatever was said in           the usual tone
of conversation ; and it is worthy of remark,         that  he could
hear with the left ear better than with the right, though in
the left no traces of the membrana tympani could be per
ceived.
    When attending         the  anatomical lectures, also, he could
                                                                 hear,

that was delivered ; though, to avoid the regular and con
stant exertion         which it required,                he preferred       placing himself
near the lecturer.
    I
    found, however, that when a note was struck upon the
pianoforte, he could hear it only at two-thirds of the dis
tance at which             I
                could hear it myself; and he informed me,
that in a voyage he had made to the East Indies, while
others, when ships were hailed at sea, could catch words
with accuracy, his organ of hearing received only an in
distinct impression. But the most extraordinary circum
stance       in    Mr. P              *s cafe      is,   that the ear was nicely sus
ceptible of         musical      played well on the flute,
                                  tones;     for      he

not from  his own authority only, but also from that of his
father, who           is   an excellent judge                 of music,       and plays well
on the violin         :    he told me, that his son,                 besides playing on
the flute, fung with much taste, and perfectly                      in tune.
    The flight         degree      of     deafness    of which Mr. P. complained,
was always greatly increased                       by    his catching cold       :   an effect
                                                                                            it by
which        seems to have arisen from the meatus being closed
an accumulation    of the natural secretion of the ear for                            ;
frequently happened to him, after he had been some time
deaf from cold, that     large piece of hardened wax, during
                                      a
a fit of coughing, was forced from the car,     the air rushing          by
from the mouth through the Eustachian tube, and his hear-*
ing was instantly restored.
   From bathing, likewise, he suffered considerable inconve
nience,           unless       his ears were          guarded against the water,           by
cotton being previously forced into the meatus. When this
precaution was neglected, the water, as he plunged in,                                      by
rushing into the interior parts of the ears, occasioned violent
pain, and brought on      deafness, which continued until the
                                        a
cause was removad,                           is,

but he had acquired the habit of removing        forcing air             it,    by
from the mouth through the ear.

the air in the meatus being compressed upon the membrana
tympani.           In    the case here described,              no such sensation was
produced       :    Mr. P.'s ear, the air, meeting with no
                   for, in
impediment,   could  suffer no compression ; since it found a
passage, through the open membrane, to the mouth, by
means of the Eustachian tube.
     Mr. P.        was       liable to the sensation          commonly called the
teeth being on edge,                in the     same    degree as it exists in others;
and     it   was produced by similar acute sounds,           as by the filing
of   a saw,        the rubbing            of silk,
                                                 Sec. Its occurring in him
seems to disprove                  the idea which has been entertained of its
cause ; for it has been thought,                       that the close connection of
the nerve called the corda tympani with the membrana tym                                          •
pani, exposed it to be affected by the motions                           of   the malleus ;
and that, as it passes                   to nerves      connected with the teeth,
they would suffer from the vibratory state                           of the nerve, pro
duced by the agitations                   of   the membrane.           But, in this cafe,
as the membrane was entirely destroyed on that side on which
the sensation was produced, some other explanation must be
resorted       to;   and       I   see no      reason why this effect              should     not
be referred to that part                  of the auditory nerve which lines the
labyrinth of the ear,                    which, being impressed by acute and
disagreeable            sounds,          would       convey    the    impression       to     the
portio dura of the fame nerve,                        and     to the teeth with which
that nerve is connected.

         it,
 into    is
 ever, when an organ becomes imperfect, every agent which
 can be employed to increase its powers        called into actionis                               ;
 and, in the cafe here described, the external ear had acquired
a  distinct motion upward and backward, which was observ
 able whenever    Mr. P. listened to any thing which he did not
 distinctly hear.  This power over the muscles was         great,                     so
 that when desired to raise the ear, or to draw       backwards,              it
 he was capable of moving        in either direction.

 applied to me under      similar complaint, (but in one ear
                                         a
 only,) proceeding  from suppuration, and producing the same
                                                                                           effects.

  364                Observations     on the DeJ?ru3ion
  effects.   This gentleman       has the fame power        of forcing air
 through the imperfect ear ; suffers            equally from bathing, if
 the meatus auditorius be unprotected ; and feels, even from
 exposure to a stream of cold air, very considerable pain. The
 only difference I could observe was, that in Mr. A.'s cafe,
 the defect     of hearing in      the diseased     organ was somewhat
 greater than in the former;          for though, when his found ear
 was closed, he could hear what was said in a common                   tone
 of  voice,  yet he could not distinguish the notes            of a  piano
 forte at the fame distance      :   a difference   which might have in
 part arisen from the confused noise which is always produced
 by closing the found ear; or because, as he heard well on
 one side, the imperfect ear had            remained unemployed, and
 consequently      had been enfeebled        by disuse.
     From   these observations      it  seems evidently to follow,     that
 the loss   of   the  membrana tympani in both             ears, far from
 producing total deafness,       occasions      only a slight diminution
 of   the powers of hearing.
    Anatomists who have destroyed               this membrane in dogs
 have asserted, that at first the effect on the fense          of hearing
 was trivial   ;  but that, after the lapse of a few months, a total
 deafness    ensued.      Baron Haller also has said, that if the
membrane        of the tympanum         be broken, the person becomes
at first hard    of hearing,   and afterwards perfectly deaf.         But,
in   these instances,    the destruction must have extended further
than the membrana tympani              ; and the labyrinth must havQ
suffered from the removal         of   the stapes, and from the conse
quent discharge of water contained in the cavities of the in
ternal ear ; for it has been very constantly observed, that
when all the small bones of the ear have been discharged, a
total deafness has ensued.
   ut is probable, that in instances           in which the membrana
tympani is destroyed,       the functions       of this membrane      have
been carried on by the membranes                of the fenestra ovalis and
fenestra rotunda      : for, as they are placed over the water of
the labyrinth, they will, when agitated by the impressions of
found, convey their vibrations to that fluid in a similar mari
ner, though in somewhat an inferior degree, to those which
are conveyed by means of the membrana tympani and the
                                                                     small

small bones which are attached to                    it   ; and    thus, in the organ
of hearing,         each part is admirably adapted,                  not only to the
purpose         for which
                     it is designed, but also as a provision
against accident or disease  ; so thai, whenever any particular
     is
                                                                   in it,
part    destroyed, another is substituted for    and the organ,
From this deprivation, suffers but little injury  its functions.
      seems that the principal use of the membrana tympani
     It
is, to modify the impressions of sound, and to proportion
them to the powers and expectation of the organ. Mr. P.
had lost this power for    considerable period after the destruc

     Everard Home,                    Esq.
   After having communicated to this learned Society the
very curious facts contained in Mr. Cooper's paper, which
prove that the organ           of hearing    capable of receiving all
                                                    is
the different impressions           of sound, when the membrana
tympani    has been destroyed,      may not be improper to
                                               it
explain,  from  the observations contained in  former paper          a
on this subject, in what manner this may take place.
     It  there stated, that any vibrations communicated
          is                                                                             di
rectly to the bones of the skull, are as accurately impressed
Upon the organ, as through the medium of the membrana
tympani. The office of that membrane      therefore to afford is
an extended surface, capable of receiving impressions from
the external air, and of communicating them to the small
bones of the ear which   ; membrane would be incapable of
                                        a
doing, unless    hadit  power of varying its tension,
                              a                                                  to adapt
itto different vibrations.
     In   the above cafes,        in which this membrane,         the malleus,
and the incus, had been destroyed,                      would appear that the

diately to the internal organ. This not happening for some
months after the membrane was destroyed, probably arose
from the inflammation of the tympanum confining the
stapes, and rendering its vibrations imperfect.
  That sounds can be communicated with accuracy by the
bonesof the skull to the internal organ, when, received from
solid or liquid substances,        has long been well understood.
   That     the           tympani is incapable of perfectly
                   membrana
answering this purpose, when sounds are propagated through
air, has been a generally received opinion j to refute which,
was the object of my former paper. That, in cafes in which
the membrana tympani has been destroyed, the air is ca
pable of acting with sufficient force upon the stapes to com
municate vibrations to            it,   and    to produce on             the internal
organ the necessary effect for perfect                hearing,      is    completely
ascertained       by   Mr. Cooper's      observations.

 JL     HE      number of simple bodies,              and particularly that             of
earths, has been greatly increased within                      a   few years past;
and    chemistry go on still thus advancing,
      if                                                       it   is   to be appre

not be able to embrace all the combinations produced the                          by
multitude of simple bodies.
   But     the    analogy which exists between                  certain       classes   of

                              called the Gadolinite.                            367
     Till chemical means are brought to that degree of perfec
 tion, we must make known those bodies which, on account
 of their peculiar properties,              we cannot refer      to any of those
 already known,           and which,          till a new order be established,
 we are obliged to consider as new substances.                       An attentive
 examination of their properties is of great importance ; for,
 even though they may be only modifications of bodies al
 ready known,          it'may happen, of which we have many in
 stances, that their qualities may become useful to the arts
 and to manufactures, and, in any event, it is better to err
 through excess than deficiency.
     With this view I             sliall   here describe,    with some details,
 the properties of a new earth discovered by M. Gadolin, and
 which has been examined by M. Ekeberg under new points
 of view.
     I  sliall first give a short description          of  the stone,    and then
 explain the different processes which                  I employed      to analyse
 it; and stiall conclude with indicating                  the principal proper
 ties that characterise         the new earth it contains.            The  greater
 part    of   the observations           I sliall make on this subject,        may
 have      been    already     published by the chemists above men-,
 mentioned;         but their works being not much known, I have
 thought it my duty to act in this manner, that the present
discovery      may be better propagated.
     I (hall, however, repeat what has been communicated to
 me by       M. Manthey, professor of chemistry at Copenhagen,
 to  whom both Hauy and I are indebted for a large quantity
os matter containing this new earth                  *.
     In   1794,    M. Gadolin           discovered    this earth;    and   his la
 bour on the subject was printed in the                  Memoirs of the Aca
demy of Sweden, and                  in Crell's Chemical Annals for the
year 1796.          M. Ekeberg, about two                years   ago,   began    an
analysis      of   the    fame      stone,     and confirmed      the   results  of
M.      Gadolin.         To    the     new earth he gave the name                of
 Yllria, from Ytterlev,             a place     in Sweden, where it is found.
A     short    mention       of it was made also in the Annales de
    * Professor
                   Abildgaard, also, has had ihe goodness       to fend me a pretty
large quantity of this     stone,    which enabled me to vary my experiments,
and   to discover   the  characterising properties of the new earth it contains.

muriatic      ; and, if their action be assisted by a gentle heat,
they      form    a thick jelly of a grayish or yellowish colour.
If this kind of jelly be then evaporated to dryness, and the
residuum         of the   evaporation     be washed in water, you will
obtain filex under the form of a white powder, which, when
well washed and brought to a red heat, gives by its weight
the proportion in which it exists with the other principles.
      The solutions of gadolinite in acids do not all exhibit the
fame       phænomena by evaporation. The sulphuric and mu
 riatic acids retain the iron and the new earth in combina
 tion, and nothing but the silex is separated ; while, on the
 contrary, the nitric acid abandons at the fame time the filex
 and the oxyd           of iron, which may be easily conceived from
 the properties of the nitrat of iron.
       I took advantage of this property in preference to any
 other, in order to apply it to the analysis in question.
       I dissolved 100 parts of gadolinite in nitric acid sufficiently
  diluted with water, and subjected it to evaporation, exposing
  it to a little heat towards the end, to effect a complete de
  composition of the nitrat of iron.                  By re-dissolving it in
  water, I obtained, combined with the nitric acid and dis
  solved,      the   peculiar earth separated from the iron and the
  fiiex.     While my solution still retained some traces of iron,
   which     I  easily perceived     either by the reddisli       colour or by
   the gallic acid,      I   again evaporated the liquor to dryness, or
   I added a drop of ammonia, and the iron was then precipi
   tated under the form of yellowish flakes, which I separated
   by the filter.
        To separate the iron from the silex,              I boiled the mixture
   in muriatic acid a little concentrated               ;   I then diluted the
   solution with water, and made               it pass through the filter, in
   order that      I  might   collect the  filex,   and wash it till it was no
    longer precipitated by ammonia.
         In regard to the new earth dissolved in nitric acid, it will
    be sufficient     if it   be pure to precipitate it by ammonia, and
    to wash it to obtain it separate;           but having learned, by pre
    liminary trials, that in this state        it is mixed with small quan
     tities of lime and magnesia, I was obliged to employ some
     further means for accomplishing that end,
                                                                       I never-

   37°                           Analysis     of  a Stone
      I  nevertheless began          to precipitate it by means        of ammo
  nia, which           does not precipitate lime.           I then  poured int»
  the liquor,         united to the washings of the precipitate, some
  drops of a           solution of common carbonat of potash, and I
  obtained the lime combined with the carbonic acid.                         I re-
  dissolved, for the third time,             in nitric acid, the earth mixed
  with     the oxyd       of  manganese,       and added, in small quantities
  at a time, a solution           of hydro-sulphuret of         potash, in order
  that    I   might precipitate only the metallic parts, which, with
  a little attention, I was able to effect.
     I  had then the earth alone, so that nothing was necessary
  to obtain       it  pure but to precipitate       it by ammonia.
                      Analysis   of the Gadolinite      by Pot a/b.
     I  still employed another method, which also succeeded, t»
  separate the different elements which constitute the gadoli
 nite   :    it consists in fusing it with two parts of caustic pot
 ash, washing the mass with boiling water, and filtering the
 liquor, which has            a beautiful green colour.
     In evaporating this liquor,              the manganese,       which gave it
 its colour, was gradually precipitated under the form of a
 black powder, which could be easily collected by decanting
 the supernatant          water.
    When it          is observed that there is no more oxyd          of manga
nese,       the liquor must be saturated with nitric acid : on the
 other hand, the sediment must be put to digest with the same
 acid much diluted with water : by these means the earth
 alone dissolves, producing a great deal of heat ; and the filex,
 and the iron too much oxydated, do not dissolve.
    This solution with             the above     liquor, saturated with nitric
 acid, musbbe evaporated to dryness, in order that if any parts
of iron and filex have remained they may be separated : in other
respects        the    process   is the fame as before.          The   latter has
the advantage             of separating     the    manganese from the other
principles,         and    of rendering       unnecessary    an   operation th«
success       of which is difficult.
    The gadolinite might               also,   rigorously speaking,      be ana
lysed      by directly attacking it bv the sulphuric and muriatic
acids;        but as these acids dissolve at the fame time, and
                     9                                                   without

                            called the Gadoliniti.                    37*
  without     distinction,     all the elements     which    compose  this
  stone,   a hydro-sulphuret        must be employed to separate the
  metals;    and the just management of this operation is diffi
  cult, because the new earth          is precipitated by an excess of
  the re-agent.
      By  the help    of  those means, which     I have briefly explained,
  I   was   able    to discover    and   separate the substances    which
  enter    into the composition of the stone called gadolinite.
  These substances are silex, black oxyd of iron, lime, oxyd of
  manganese,       and the peculiar earth to which M. Ekeberg
  has given the name          of Yttria.
      The proportions in which they           are found are as follow  :

                                                    Loss    jo'5
      These io*5 form the smallest loss I experienced in the dif
   ferent analyses I made; for I thought it necessary to employ,
   in constructing this table, the greatest quantities of each of
   the matters obtained by either          of the processes.
      I at first thought      that this loss arose from some alkaline
   substances,    as  is the case in several kinds of stone ; but, hav
   ing  treated 100 parts by sulphuric acid,         I  assured myself that
   it arose from another        cause ; for, having precipitated by am
   monia all the earthy and metallic matters dissolved in the
   sulphuric acid, and having brought to a red heat the salt
   produced by evaporating the liquor to dryness, there remained
   nothing in the crucible but a little sulphat of lime.
      As I   suspected      that this was occasioned       by some volatile
.-substance, I heated, in a platina crucible, 100 parts of the
   stone reduced to powder, and found that it had decreased
   eight parts, and that the remainder had assumed a yellowish
   -•clour.
       The slight      effervescence    which    I  had   always remarked

gine that one part at least of the deficit was owing to the car

glass tube, destined to convey the gas into the lime-water,                                        I
poured into     sulphuric acid diluted with
                     it                       certain quantity        a

air-bubbles            passed into the lime-water,  which   was ren  by              it
dered       turbid      ;   but the quantity of the precipitate was so
small, that            it   was impossible for me to measure it. As the
space,* indeed,             in the    vessels remained empty was
                                                     which                                             so

receiver,         and  I     exposed      it    to   a   strong heat.          There appeared
in   the neck          of   the retort, and even in the bottle, some small
drops of water, the quantity of which was     small that                       so                  I
could not weigh it.   But the matter taken from the retort
weighed no more than 91 parts. Thus        appeared to me                 it
that the loss which  experiencedI  in my analyses   chiefly                                is
owing to water and carbonic a£><l.

                             called the Gadolinite.                                               373
     jd,    It is not fusible alone, but with borax it forms a white
glass,      which is transparent when it has not been added in
excess.
   4th, It is not sensibly soluble in caustic fixed alkalies : in
this it is different from alumine and glucina, which combine
with these very easily and in large quantity.
   5th, It is soluble in the carbonat of ammonia, but five or
fix times less so than glucina ; that is to fay, five or six times
more carbonat of ammonia is required to dissolve an equal
quantity of yttria.
  6th, It combines rapidly with the sulphuric acid, and pro
duces heat in proportion as the union is effected : the salt
thence resulting crystallises in small brilliant grains little so
luble in water : it appeared to me that more than fifty parts
bf cold water were necessary to dissolve         especially when            it,
not accompanied with an excess of acid.             has    taste at               It      a
first astringent,     and afterwards               sweet, like sugar or salt                  of lead.
This property, though analogous                        to that          of glucina,        is,   how
ever,   sensibly different from
           so                     that  comparing   it,                by                        them
they may be easily distinguished.
   7thj Its combination with the nitric acid has                                           a     more
striking savour,        but         it   produces     in       the      mouth an effect of

salts,     it   grows soft,         and     assumes         the      appearance           of thick
transparent       honey    ;cooling,by              it      becomes               hard and brittle
like   a    stone; when exposed to the air,                       it   attracts        the moisture
of   it,   and becomes         soft.
     The sulphuric acid,                 poured into solution of the nitrat of

  8th, The combination of this earth with the muriatic acid
exhibits nearly the fame phænomena, in the several experi
ments      I    made, as the nitrat above examined                            :    like the nitrat
it   can be dried with difficulty,                  it    is      fusible     by   a   gentle heat,
and strongly       attracts the moisture of                    the atmosphere.

  ioth, The oxalic acid, and consequently                                     the    oxalat of
ammonia,   form in its solutions precipitates which have an
appearance absolutely similar to that os the niuriat os silver;
glucina with the oxalic acid forms a very soluble salt — a new
difference     between          these   two earths.
   nth,       Pruffiat      of     potash       crystallised         and     re-dissolved      in
water occasions,          in the solutions   of this earth by acids, a white
granulated deposit          ;     but this is not the cafe in solutions of
glucina.
   1 3th, The phosphoric acid does not precipitate it from
the other acids, but the phofphat of soda separates it under
the form of gelatinous white Hakes.
   13th, It appears to me that it has more affinity for, at
least, some os the acids, than glucina has.
   14th,      It    precipitates        an infusion             of gall-nuts         in brown
flakes.
   From what          I   have said,       a    great number            of    analogies     may
without doubt be observed between      this cat'lh and glucina ;
but, at the fame time, there appear differences which do not
permit us to confound these two earths. These differences
chiefly are, the insolubility os the vttria and the solubility of
glucina in fixed caustic alkalies ; the little solubility of the
sulphat of the yttria, and the great solubility of glucina, in
the sulphuric acid 5 the difficult solubility of vttria, and the
ready  solubility of glucina, in carbonat of ammonia ; the
precipitation of yttria, and non-precipitation of glucina, from
their solutions by. oxalic acid and the prustiat of potash.
   Here then we have nine kinds of earth very distinct by the
properties peculiar to each : soon, no doubt, we shall reckon
ten,    if,   as we have reason                to presage from               the    accuracy   of

considerable, and will furnish to chemists multitude of new          a

discoveries may not remain altogether useless.           It is to be
wished also, when the properties of this new earth (hall be
better known, that chemists may give themselves the trouble
to change the name cf yttria, by which it is now known, and
which is derived from Ytterlev, the place where it is found,
that another derived from its essential properties may be given
to it.
    I shall conclude with remarking       the great difference   be
tween the result of    M. Ekebcrg's analysts and mine. I do
not know exactly to what it is owing, but I can assert that,
in sive analyses which I made of this stone by different pro
cesses,   I never had less than 12 of loss.      I presume that a
certain quantity of moisture, and perhaps carbonic acid, re
mained in the new earth obtained by M. Ekeberg, for it is
chiefly in this point that we differ.       He found 47,5, and      I
only from 34 to 35, because       I calcined it more strongly.

following.
              Citric Acid [Concrete juice of lemons'] .
   Scheele was the first person who found means to obtain
the citric acid crystallized, and well separated from the mu-
pilage, which accompanies it in the juices       of those fruits that
furnish it.
   The    process for obtaining this acid, according to that che
 mist, is  as follows: Express   the  juice of lemons,  and leave   it
                                3  Ca                              at

at rest for twenty-four            hours, to favour the separation of the
mucilage         ;    then filter it through paper, and saturate it with
a quantity           of    the carbonate os lime.             The     citrate      of lime,
which     results from this saturation, being insoluble, is preci
pitated to the bottom of the liquor : when this deposit is well
formed, draw off the supernatant liquor, and wash the preci
pitate until it becomes insipid and exceedingly white ; then
decompose this salt by the help of a gentle heat, with half its
weight of sulphuric acid, diluted with six parts of water; the
sulphuric acid takes the lime from the citncacid; the greater
part of the sulphate of lime formed is precipitated, and the
citric acid remains free in the water.   This acid may be
obtained under a crystalline form, by evaporating it to the
consistence          of clear     syrup, and then suffering it to cool.
   Dize, who made several experiments on this sul'jcci, found
that an excess of sulphuric acid was necc3ury to destroy the
portion of mucilage, which the acid obsiii- itely retains in its
combination with the lime, and which opposes its crystalli
zation.          He       observed also, tliat to obtain the citric acid per
fectly pure, it was necessary to dissolve                     it,   and   to cause    it   to.
crystallize several times.
  The      crystals          obtained      by   Dize   were
                                                      prisms,   rhomboidal
having their planes inclined to each other at angles of about
60 or 120 degrees, and terminated on each side       summits                  by
with four faces, which intercepted the solid angles.
   One part of distilled water at the temperature of ten de
grees, according to this author, dissolves i'05 of crystallized
citric acid, and, during the solution, cold equal to 1$ degrees
(290F.)      is
          produced.
  This acid reddens blue                   vegetable    colours      :    when exposed

an   account of    a   sliip  springing    a leak    in the Indian       seas,
The water, which gained            so fast as     to render it impossible,
by pumps and       the usual means, to prevent               the sliip from
finking, was fortunately stopped by pouring rice into that
part of the fliip.       The rice in four days diflblved, and in
about eight days after became so hard that with difficulty
                                                                             it

  it could    be chiseled out when the (hip came into port.         The
  author states, that the fame means           have been tried at other
  times, but not with the fame success, and surmises that heat
   is necessary.
       On    the   22d was   read a paper on the production      of cold,
   by means of muriat of lime, by Mr. Walker.
       The first consul of France transmitted to the Society
   "   Voyage autour du Monde, par C. E. Marchand," 4 torn.
   most     handsomely bound.        The thanks of the Society were
   ordered      to be returned   to  the first consul of France for this
'
    present.
                              Meteorology.
        The following particulars      respecting  the storm on the 9th
    cf November, furnished       by an intelligent correspondent, can
    not but prove interesting to some of our readers :
        The preceding night had been stormy, .with torrents of rairl.
    At   9  A. M. wind     abated and rain over.      Thermometer 55^
    Barometer, descending ,\ inch per hour, gave evident intima
    tion of the event. About noon it had arrived at its lowest point,
    having dropped from 29,9 to 28,5 since the morning of thft
     sixth. At this time it was cloudy and nearly calm, when the
     wind veered to the northward, and in a few minutes blew from
     north-west with astonishing violence for about an hour. The
     quicksilver, which had scarcely become stationary, as sud
     denly changed its direction, and continued to rise at the rate
     of ~ per hour the whole afternoon. It became stationary
     at 29,7, with a hoar-frost in the morning.          The index-hand
     of   an   excellent wheel barometer, fixed against a solid wall,
     was observed to librate continually during this rapid ascent,
     retreating about T~^, and then advancing a little more.            In
     the space of about six hours, on this occasion, the atmosphere
     passed through near one-half of its total variation of gravity,
      which would require, in       its ordinary course   in this country,
      about as many days.
         This impetuous irruption       of dense air from the northern
      regions was probably occasioned         by the suddep rarefaction
      •onsequent    upon  a general precipitation of that water which
                                                                    during

  3^0       New   Allali.—AlMine         Vrujsiat. — New Earth.
  during the preceding four weeks had been accumulating ifJ
  the atmosphere in a dissolved state.           The loss, in a certain"
  space  of atmosphere,     of  so   great   a quantity of  elastic fluids
  and the operation     of its disengaged     caloric on the remainder,
  will at once account for the effect to those who are acquainted
  with pneumatics;
                         THE NEW ALKALI.
    In  our last (p. 291) we mentioned that a Mr. Hahnemau,
 of Altona,     had announced the discovery of a new alkali, to
  which he gave the name of pneum, from its property of
 swelling by heat to twenty times its original volume; Both
 Klaproth and Hermbstadt           have    lately examined this alkali*
 and found it to consist     of nothing but boraxi
                       ALKALINE         PRUSSIAT.
    Dr. A. N. Scherer        has   (in his journal) recommended to
 chemists to take up the idea suggested by Scheele, and to
 endeavour^ by following the hint given by that author, to
 produce a perfectly pure alkaline prufliat.              Scheele states
 that prusllat of mercury is perfectly free from iron, and that,
 were a combination of that kind decomposed by an alkali,
 the result would certainly be prussiat of alkali entirely fre*
 from iron.
                           A   KEW EARTH.
    The particular properties of a new species of earth called
 Yttrid, of which an account was given by Ekeberg in the
third volume of Scherer's journal, have been confirmed by
Klaproth, who lately read            a  paper   on this subject    at the
 Royal Academy of Berlin.             Vauquelin has also analysed the
stone which       produces    this earth. — See his Memoir on this
substance    in  the present number, p. 366.
    CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS ON THE MATTER OF
                           BLACK VOMtT.
    A  memoir on the analysis of black vomit, by Dr. Cathrall,
¦was read before the American Philosophical Society at Phila
delphia, on June 20, i8co.              This is a very interesting and
instructive paper.      The experienced and intrepid author has
given a de-scription    of the black vomit, has analysed the fluids
ejected   a   few hours before the commencement of black vo-
                9                                                miting,

miting, and exhibited a set of experiments on the matter of
black vomit itself: to which he has added, experiments to
ascertain the effects of black vomit on the living system of
man and other animals, and a synopsis of the opinions of
authors concerning its formation and qualities. The expe
riments show that this singular morbid excretion contains an
acid, which is neither carbonic, phosphoric, nor sulphuric ;
and, what our readers will hardly expect, that the black
vomit may be smelled, tasted, and swallowed, without in
ducing yellow fever, or even any sickness at all : so little in
fection or contagion does it seem to contain              ! He concludes
it to be an altered secretion from the liver.
            TETANUS CURED BY THE COLD BATH :
Communicated        in a Letter lo Dr. R. H. Archer, of Balti
    more,    by Dr. William Harris, of Pennsylvania*.
    In the autumn of       1799,   I visited   a labourer,   about thirty
years   of age, of a slender make, but healthy, who was suddenly
seized, whilst in bed, with spasms in his lower extremities,
which shortly after affected his whole system, but particularly
his stomach, which was drawn in a hard lump, and protruded
to a considerable distance. His pains were excruciating. He
had a violent vomiting and purging, which came on an hour
after seizure, and continued about two hours.                At one time
he had        emprosthotonos,     at    another opisthotonos, to the
greatest     degree,    and  sometimes       complete tetanus.       The
muscles of his face were drawn in every direction, and de
glutition entirely impeded. His pulse varied much, but was
generally feeble.        He could assign no cause for the attack.
 I  bled  him, put him in the warm bath, and used all the re
 medies     laid down by medical writers, but %vithout any mi
 tigation of his pains, or relief to his spasms.
    At this time, which was twenty hours after the attack,
 when the cold sweat of death appeared to be upon him, his
 tongue had refused its office, his eyes funk, having a glassy
 appearance,      and his exit was every moment expected, it oc
 curred to me that the cold bath might have a good effect 5
 »nd, after consulting his friends, who Teadily acquiesced,              I

384          Treatment  of hocked- Jaw    by Electricity.
had him, in this state, carried in a blanket to a forge-dam
which was at hand, and plunged in. He was then insensible.
His    spasms immediately abated,     and, in twenty minutes, to
tally ceased. The debility induced by muscular exertion was
such that it required several days before he could be removed ;
after which he rapidly recovered, and is at this time perfectly
well.
     This was a complete tetanus ; and, I think, tetanus from
wounds, &c. would yield to the fame mode of treatment.
     TREATMENT OF LOCKED-JAW BY ELECTRICITY.
     Dr. Samuel Perry, of New-Bedford [America], has com
municated to the public the successful result of two experi
ments, in curing the locked-jaw by means of electricity.
 Previous to the application of the electrical fluid, recourse
 had been      had to bleeding, cathartics, antispasmodics, the
 warm bath, and opium applied internally and externally,
 without the least effect in either cafe.      But a small receiver
 being filled, and discharged through the jaws of the persons
 affected, they flew open instantaneously.         In one case the
 complaint was entirely removed by three shocks ; in the
 other, by an occasional      shock   for a few days.      Both the
 patients were strong and healthy persons, the one a man and
 the other a woman, and the mode of treating them had been
 similar.
