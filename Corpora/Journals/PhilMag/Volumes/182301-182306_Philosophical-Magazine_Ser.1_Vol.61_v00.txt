me specimens of the beetles, and also of the asbestos; the
latter appeared to be of the flexible kind, which is called
Amianth. Upon examining the former, I find it to be the
Dermestes vulpinus Fabr. (Oliv. Ins. No. 9. t. i.f. 6), a species
common to South Europe and South Africa.            As the animals
of this tribe are not particular in selecting a place in which
to undergo their metamorphosis, it is not probable that they
would have taken the trouble to perforate the asbestos for that
sole purpose, since they will not only assume the pupa in the
exuviae of the animal they have devoured, but even under their
own excrement (see De Geer,                   iv.
                                       196): but     further proof     a
 that this was not their   object,   furnished
                                            is by the varying size
of  the holes  perforated      the specimen

                                                the Amianth that
 Mr. Hunneman gave me. There were three, one which                                    of
 was    line and half
        a                  diameter; another,

fourths; and      athird, two lines: from whence      seems     fol     it             to
low that the insects that   perforated     were    different

     I observed     near the extremity of the convex side of the spur,
     a minute spot, like the orifice of a tube; and on endeavouring
     to pass a bristle from this spot, three successive drops of a
     limpid clear fluid issued from                           it.

accuracy in either the one or the other.
   The equation might        easily have been made more general,
so as to have shown the   degree   of extension or compression at
any point in the circumference: but since my object is only
to show the utmost change that can have place from the
causes I have undertaken to investigate, in order to prove
whether it be necessary to provide against them or not,                                                                 I
have not gone further than suited my purpose.              But the
equation ought to be general, if it were necessary to compute
the total quantity of extension in any quadrant of the circle.
   We may in the next instance proceed to determine the de
pression at the points C and D.
   The extension of any point in the circumference being as
the stress upon it when other circumstances do not vary, and
that stress being as the area of a segment multiplied into the
distance of     centreits gravity,      of

     Ifthe divisions be upon a ring, supported by arms radiating
from the centre, the depression will in general be much greater
than in a solid circle, because the stress is not lessened in pro
portion to the reduction of weight, and the power of resistance
may often be reduced in a greater ratio than the stress.                Be
sides, such circles are liable to be deranged from other causes,
which I shall now endeavour to explain.

shown in the figure, is well adapted for explaining the effects

VI.        On certain Species           of Carduus and Cnicus which appear
     to   be diaecious.            By Thomas SMITH, Esq. F.R.S. & L.S.*
     *ALTHOUGH      Linnaeus founded his orders in the class
                 upon nice distinctions, drawn from the various
          Syngenesia
modes in which the florets of different sexes are arranged in
each capitulum, the fact that many species were dioecious, or
had the male and female flowers on distinct plants, almost en
tirely escaped his observation; for in the last edition of his
 Genera Plantarum, published in 1764, he remarks, that Gna.
phalium dioicum is a rare example of the separation of the sexes
in this class.
   Jussieu in his Genera Plantarum, published in 1789, does
not appear to have been aware of any other example than the
above, for he observes at the end of his generic character of
Gnaphalium, “Species una dioica insigni exceptione.”
   It has however been pointed out to me by my friend Mr.
Brown, that at the time this observation of Jussieu's was
published, Friedrick Ehrhart had shown that some species of
 Tussilago were dioecious: and our native species Tussilago
hybrida and Petasites now rank as one only under the name
of Petasites, which is the male, hybrida being the female+.
   Mr. Brown in his Observations on the Composita, inserted
in the 12th volume of the Transactions of this Society, an
nounced many more instances of this remarkable circum

posed (Petrobium and Brachylaena) he has ascertained to be
dioecious; another genus, Piptocarpha, he suspects to be so; and
the dioecious Gnaphaliums (to which he shows that margarita
ceum must be added) are also thrown into a separate genus.
   It will be observed, that the greater part of the genera men
tioned belong to orders which have florets of different sexes in

    The female florets are somewhat shorter and smaller than
the male, particularly the laciniae and dilated part          the tube           of
of  the  corolla;  hence the male    capitulum,  when      flower,  ap         in

pears much larger than the female.                The part of the style
which is bearded in the male is shorter in the female, and de
stitute of pili, except a very few at the base of the fissure; this
fissure in the male opens but little; in the female it is very
Inuch opened, having the margins bent back and the apices
recurved; the apex is divided in the male, but the apices are
straight: the male capitulum is more oval, that of the female
more cylindrical inclining to conical.
    The part of the style which bears the stigma is waved in
the female, straight in the male; in the female flat, bearing
the stigma on the edges generally of a deeper purple than the
lower part; in the male compressed, cylindrical, of the same
shade of colour as the part below                            it.
    The male florets are more exserted beyond the scales                  the                         of
capitulum, and therefore longer                porportionin        than the          to     it
females, which frequently project very little beyond the scales.

 18              Mr. T. Smith   on certain Species   of
      I am
         aware, neverthelesss, that this is a very doubtful test
in a cultivated plant, the flowers of which are frequently bar
ren from causes that are not obvious.
   By the kindness of Mr. Anderson           I
                                             was enabled several
times to examine the numerous species of the genera Serratula,
Carduus, and Cnicus, which are cultivated in the Botanic Gar
den at Chelsea; and about half the plants to which, from the
state of their flowering, I could apply the tests above men
tioned, proved either male or female.
   In Serratula, the only species not hermaphrodite was the
tinctoria.
   In the genera Carduus and Cnicus I ascertained the follow
ing, as named in Mr. Anderson's manuscript catalogue, to be
female plants.
                 º
   Cnicus tuberosus, ochroleucus, semipectinatus, & Salisburgensis.
   Three or four others I suspect to be male plants; for, upon
examining          capitula that had flowered,        I
                                                   could not find
any perfect seeds.
      I
     have looked over the specimens of Carduus and Cnicus in
the Banksian Herbarium, and the following appear to be fe
male plants:
   Carduus rivularis, Chius, rigens, serratuloides, paniculatus.
Cnicus leucocephalus, rigens, Erisithales, tuberosus, acaulis,
oleraceus.
   There are specimens of both sexes of Erisithales and acaulis,
the specimen of the female plant of acaulis is remarkably di
stinct from the male.
    Since    I
            first turned my attention to this subject, a doubt has
 arisen whether in many, perhaps in most of the cases in which
female plants occur, the antheriferous plant may not be an her
maphrodite rather than a male.
    The plant which I first ascertained to be dioecious was Cnicus
arvensis : in this the separation of the sexes is undoubted and
unequivocal; for though I have examined a very great num
ber of male plants, the ovaria have always proved abortive,
except in one instance, in which two of the ovaria in one capi
tulum were most decidedly impregnated, the embryo being so
far advanced that no doubts could be entertained about it: the
stigmata of these flowers did not, however, appear to differ
from those of the numerous unimpregnated ovaria which sur
rounded them: this case must therefore be considered as
merely accidental.
    Having ascertained that this species was dioecious,    I  con
cluded that      all
                 the others were
                                     so
                                     inwhich female    plants were
to    be
       met with; but,    insome, hermaphrodite plants certainly
                                                            occur,

           Carduus and Cnicus which appear to be diaecious.        19
                    I
 occur, nor have been able to detect any males amongst these.
  It is not easy to distinguish between     g. hermaphrodite and
 the   male;  the only unequivocal test of the latter seems to be,
 that the antherae should have perfect pollen, and that the ovaria
 should be abortive; two states of the flowers which it is rather
 difficult to meet with on the same plant at the same time.
     The stigma does not supply a distinction sufficiently de
 cisive; for although, when the stigma of the female flower is
 compared with that part in the antheriferous one, a much
   reater development is perceived in the female, still in the
 former it is apparently sufficiently developed for the purposes
 of impregnation: hence it is not possible, from seeing a few
plants with perfect antherae, to say whether the species is dioe
 cious or not; it can only be determined by an examination of
 numerous specimens.
     There is another source of error: In Cnicus pratensis the
 antheriferous plants which were growing near the females had
 when gathered the appearance of being males: but having kept
 them for some days and noticed the progress of the develop
 ment of the different parts of the flower, it was seen that, when
 the pollen of a particular flower was entirely dispersed, the
 stigma became developed nearly as much as in the female
 flower, although while the style remained covered with pollen,
 it was merely indicated by a line, which induced the idea that
the plant was a male:     I afterwards found also the antheriferous
capitula impregnated, except the florets of the ray, the stigmata
of which were not developed nor the ovaria impregnated:
whether this is constantly the case, remains for future inquiry.
    Neither in Cnicus palustris nor in acaulis have I ascertained
that male plants exist; in palustris, from the numerous speci
mens examined,       I should conclude that they do not, and that
this   plant  therefore consists of hermaphrodites and females, -
the former being the most numerous.
    In another plant of the Carduaceae, equally common with
Cnicus arvensis, I have also found female plants; this is the
Centaurea nigra, but I have not found any that can be called
males, as those plants in which the anthers are perfect have
perfect seeds.
    The female and hermaphrodite (as it must be called here)
differ as the male and female do in Cnicus arvensis.         The fe
male florets are    smallest;   they project but little, beyond  the
involucrum; their laciniae are but slightly divaricate; their
imperfect antherae do not rise above the apices of the laciniae
of the corolla; their filaments are never visible: in the her
maphrodite the stamina project so much, that at the period of
their full vigour the filaments are seen above the tube of the
                                  C2                        corolla.

2O                       Mr. T. Smith             on certain Species      of
corolla.      These differences are less obvious after the flowering
is  past;   for,  the stamina being retracted, the hermaphrodite is
much more like the female: as to numbers, the hermaphrodite
is the most prevalent.
     In Serratula tinctoria, in which Mr. Brown first pointed out
 the existence of female plants, I have not been able to satisfy
 myself that males are to be met with; for in the antheriferous
   lants I have always found the ovaria impregnated. The seeds
 of the female differ in being larger than those of the hermaphro
 dite.     In this species plants occurred which showed a regular
 gradation from the female to the hermaphrodite; in one, the
 antherae were much smaller, shorter, and more imperfect than
 they most frequently are found in the female: in another they
 were as much larger, projecting, and embracing the style as in
 the hermaphrodite, but containing only a few grains of abortive
    ollen.
      The numbers of the female and hermaphrodite are nearly
 equal.      The stigma of the female is developed very soon after
 the flower opens; in the hermaphrodite, on the contrary, it
 does not appear until the pollen of                       its
                                                 own antherae    dispersed,    is
 the style remaining undivided              the apex till this period; the

22               Mr. D. Mushet                on the Crystallization
     My observations have not been sufficiently extensive to en
able me to say whether this lengthening of the pappus is a very
unusual occurrence; but I suppose it to be so from the following
remark of M. Cassini, the universal application of which must
be modified by the fact which                        I
                                  have mentioned: “L’aigrette
ne prend aucun accroissement après la fleuraison, même dans
le cas ou l'ovaire des synathérées grandit beaucoup après cette
époque”.”
   The figures of these plants are not in general delineated with
sufficient attention to detail, to show whether they are taken
from a male or a female specimen; in some cases, however, there
is little room for doubt, as in Professor Hooker's figure of
 Cnicus heterophyllus, to which I have already referred.
   Cnicus palustris, English Botany, pl. 974, and Cnicus acaulis,
Flora Danica, 1114, are certainly antheriferous plants.
   The figures of Cnicus arvensis in the Flora Londinensis and
in English Botany,           pl.
                          975, are females; but the figure      Fa                               of

considered     new and rather interesting subject.
               a                                           Mr. Lowry's
more important engagements, however, prevented him from
completing the undertaking; and            the paper had  as   reference               a

time became overlooked and forgotten.
   The subject was brought           my recollection about eighteen

informed, that Dr. Wollaston had discovered titanium in the
copper-coloured cubical crystals, which are sometimes found
in the old furnace hearths at smelting iron works.
     I
     cannot help feeling it as a matter of considerable regret,
that circumstances occurred to prevent the publication of my
paper on this subject at the time intended, as the attention of
Dr.Wollaston and other able men in the scientific world might
                                                  .

varieties of crystallized iron sent Mr. Lowry, an           ant speci   i.
men of cubes found in the hearth of a furnace at the     Clyde  Iron
 Works, in the year 1794, which it was intended to engrave,
and of which              I
                   have now a rough drawing in my MSS.
   Soon after the discovery of            cubical crystals, I sent a
specimen of them to the late Mr. Day, to transmit to the Abbé
Haüy, with the view of ascertaining whether this variety of
iron was a new discovery, or a modification, which might have
come under his extensive observation, without having been
particularly alluded to in his Crystallography.          The Abbé's
reply, through the medium of my friend Mr. Day, was, that
the specimen was rare (leaving me to infer that he had met
with it before), and that he considered it an igneous sulphuret
of iron. This answer, from authority so high, tended much
to repress further investigation on my part; and from this cir
cumstance, contrary to some experiments of my own,                was            I
led to rest satisfied with the same conclusion.
   It is with considerable pleasure, however,             learn that    I
Mr. Lowry has carefully preserved the specimens sent him                    I
twenty-three years ago; and though the silvery pyramids of
         ...;
the cast-iron must have tarnished after so long an interval,
yet,             from the only remaining specimen of the cop
per-coloured cubical crystals, now in my possession, out of
forty or fifty pounds originally obtained from the furnace
hearth,         I
             hope the specimen sent to be engraved, has pre

not exceed one-tenth of an inch on the base, and many were not

 .   .VIII.On the Declination of the Fiaed Stars. By Professor
        BEssel. Sent from Konigsberg, 29th August 1822*.
 ABOUT    the middle of the last century, a collection of astro
   nomical observations was made by Bradley, which does
  not appear to have been followed up, after the death of that
 great astronomer.        In the Observatory at Greenwich, the ob
  servations were indeed pursued with the same instruments; but
 those instruments, from continued use, had lost much of their
 accuracy; and even at Maskelyne's death had given erroneous
 results.    Other observatories either did not possess sufficient
 means, or depended too implicitly on the Greenwich catalogue,
 which was the only source from which astronomers. derived
 their information till the appearance of Piazzi's great work.
 Through Piazzi, however, declinations were given, which ren
 dered the former doubtful: in fact, Maskelyne acknowledged
 the defects of his mural quadrants, which, to the injury of
 astronomy, had continued far too long without being dis
 covered.     About this time observations with instruments be
 gan to be more frequent; and in fact, those of Piazzi, Oriani,
 Pond and Brinkley, showed an accordance in the declinations
 of the stars, which could not be expected to be surpassed:                             al
 though at the same time it showed that mistakes might                                  oc
 cur, with those who were not accustomed to look after them.
 Besides,       all
                 the series      observations did not agree, till the
                                   of
 excellent   Bohnenberger       succeeded      showing the real cause
                                                      in
of  error,    in
               the  repeating   circles.   The first suspicion      those          of
 errors arose from the difference that was observed             the obli  in
 quity  of the ecliptic       at
                            the two solstices.   The smaller repeating
 circles  gave  the  obliquity      the winter solstice

                                                            smaller than
 the obliquity       the summer solstice; whilst the observations
                        at
of   Bradley, Groombridge, and myself, gave them both alike.
 The declinations            of
                           the stars which       observed with Cary's

 vations, if had not believed that had contributed somewhat
 to their certainty by previous proofs of my circle. My confi
 dence was increased by the simplicity of the instrument, which
 allows the observer to become                      acquainted with every
 single step: added to which, his being able to compare his
 observations on both sides of the circle, affords him a proof
 of which he is entirely deprived by the use of the repeating
 circle.     Even after the doubt expressed against the correctness
 of my determinations, I was unable, by the most rigid examina
 tion of the instrument, and method of observation, to discover
 a constant error of more than one second: and even this limit
I    should consider too great, if                    I
                                              had completed my earlier
 purpose of determining the particular errors of division for

 expectation of shortly receiving the meridian circle of Reichen
 bach. From this there was much accuracy to be expected in de
                    I

 confine myself to such rules as aimed at reaching certainty in
 general.    I   considered therefore that time would solve this
 difficulty, and by progressive improvement add to the science.
 of observation.
     This expectation is greater from the meridian circle, in

        have determined by a very beautiful apparatus of four
microscopes prepared by Mr. Privy Counsellor Pistor; from
whence it appears that these errors are very small, but still
not quite irregular. These irregularities amount for each line
probably to 3-0",3251 only; whence it follows that probably
about one only in twenty-six of the lines varies 1" or more,
and that among the whole 7200 lines on the circle only two
vary between 1",75 and 2". Through these slight irregularities,
regular errors in the divisions are recognised, whose maxi
mum never reaches 1,"25; but which through the use of the
four verniers are mutually done away with, so that the pre
ceding correction does not exceed 0",33. This almost incre
dible perfection of division in a circle of 18 inches radius, can

    TAKE the liberty of soliciting you to insert in the Phi

system of working coal-mines by Way-going work, must find
a friend in every humane man, and every honest man;–with
the former, because it renders a coal-pit free from explo

sive matter; with the latter, because it prevents that shameful
waste of property occasioned by Pillar work, at present used
in coal-mines. Should the statement annexed not be suffici
ently convincing to the              of coal-works, I am read
at any  time not only to defend the system  of Way-going work,
but to give additional proofs of    utility, necessary.  its             if

   THE variation in the direction of the currents of air in mines
is not by any means such a phaenomenon as Mr. John Rule jun.
seems to suppose: it may be traced without di<U+017F>ficulty to a sim
ple cause; namely, the         of wind acting on a change of
surface.    If  the district which contains the twenty-five shafts
be  examined,    there will be found within the boundaries of its
surface, or else not far distant, one or more uptakes of ground,
                                                 #.
and these elevated spots, probably, have more inclined sides in
that neighbourhood than one.                  shafts which are on the
windward side of the rising ground will have downcast cur
rents, and those on the leeward side will have upcast currents.
The degree of strength of these currents will vary as the
  uantum of wind does: obstructions in the workings of a mine
will affect the current of air both in force and direction.
   As the opinions of the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine
are always received by the world as coming from a source
possessed of the most general and correct scientific informa
tion, it certainly becomes a duty incumbent on them not to pro
nounce a judgement without giving the subject a careful and an
impartial consideration.      Had the statement addressed to you

more than a temporary relief". The disease is too powerfully
malignant to be cured by quackery.        Remove the cause, and
you at once defeat explosion: perfect ventilation will remove
the cause, and perfect ventilation can be obtained by way
going work: but never by pillar work. All persons con
versant with the subject of working coal, well know that ex
plosion is the effect of the accumulation of foul air; and that
these accumulations arise from the very imperfect state of
ventilation which pillar work is capable of admitting,   imper
fect indeed, for,  independently of the numerous mechanical ob
structions it has to encounter, “a space offive hundred yards
square having the current of air passing up and down its work
ings would require the ventilating medium to traverse eighteen
miles.    The different methods hitherto used of propelling the
air through a mine appear to have been miserably defective.”
Notwithstanding this strong evidence, a noted viewer “ con
siders the system as beyond improvement.” That it is capable
of improvement is evident from the statement I forwarded to
   * We are always willing to admit correction or reproof, when our cor
respondents show that we deserve it; but we think our Friend to the                                                     Pit
men is rather hasty with us. There is nothing in our note by which he ought
to infer that Mr. Rule called the change of direction of currents in shaft
an inexplicable phanomenon, or that he did more than describe a fact about
which he says nothing as to difficulty of finding a cause—indeed he states it
quite as clearly as our Friend does.
   As to our opinion respecting ventilation, we beg leave to retain it until
proof comes to the contrary; and our Correspondent will recollect that
 the assertion merely of an advocate for a particular system is not usually
esteemed decisive evidence.

consideration, that we meant it for collieries as they usually are, and not for

himself use yeast of such an age. However, another expe
riment was made, in order to ascertain if that was the real
cause; it was tried at Messrs. Gray and Dacre's brewery,

which had been fermenting under the apparatus eight days,
even after it was kept three days, produced a perfectly good
fermentation.
    Some brewers have objected to the length of time it requires
to ferment in close vessels; but although the process appears
to proceed slower in them than in open ones, yet the beer is
brought much earlier to perfection; for with respect to strong
beers, as porter or ale, they are as far attenuated, and as                                    fit

 that distillers and vinegar-makers are obliged either to stop
 the process before it is complete, or to suffer a certain portion
of alcohol to be destroyed by the commencement of the acid
fermentation: in both of which cases their loss is unavoidable.
The apparatus will not only prevent this, but condense a cer
tain portion of spirit, as in every other case of the vinous fer
mentation.
   The British wine- and cyder-makers may cherish the hope
of improving their manufacture by the same method, so as to
make it superior to many of the foreign wines; cyder and

lative positions of the rest.     Mr. Russell, in his veneration for
old theories, will no doubt allow that the power of gravity de
creases as the square of the distance increases; and, admitting
this, he should inform us how the superior gravity of the
waters in one part of the world can possibly produce a rising
of the waters in another part at the distance of nearly 6000
miles, when, by the above rule, the gravity of the waters in
 this place is only the 144000dth part less than it is in the other.
 In the annexed figure, I have supposed the whole earth to be
 covered with water, with the
moon perpendicular to B, where                      P.
the  waters,  in  consequence   of her
influence, have reached their ut
most height.        Now it follows,
upon Mr. Russell's principle, that
the waters which are rising be
tween C and D must be lifted up c                                A.
by the downward pressure of the
waters that are ebbing between
B and C; and consequently that
the influence of this downward
pressure must extend to the     di
stance of 6000 miles, which is                   * ID
 about the fourth part of the whole circumference of the earth.
 This, however, is not the only difficulty attending Mr. Russell's
hypothesis; for if we suppose the waters (which is really the
case in the Atlantic Ocean) to be confined within the boun
daries l and h, there will, at this time, be a constant rising in
 every part, without any downward pressure to lift them up.
 Mr. Russell has endeavoured to explain away this objection,
 by observing that a sufficient quantity of water to produce the
flow may be poured in from the Southern Ocean : but this ar
 gument completely overturns his own hypothesis; for, to say
 nothing of the absurdity of supposing that those waters can
travel at the rate of three or fourthousand miles an hour, which
they must do to produce such an effect, the tides would then
be raised, not by the downward pressure of those waters which
                                                           ºil.
constitute the ebb, but by an accumulation of water coming in
from the Southern Ocean; and Mr. Russell has yet to
in what way this accumulation is produced. Mr. Russel<U+017F> may
perhaps be inclined to argue that the waters that constitute the
ebb are seldom, if ever, at a greater distance from those that
constitute the flood than two or three hundred miles; and ad  I
mit that they are not. But then the gravity of       all  these par
ticles must  be    very nearly the same, and consequently the one
cannot  be        up
             lifted    by                   .
                           the superior gravityof       other when

                          of the New Theory of the Tides.                                                45°
this superiority has no existence. Thus, for instance, the tide
may be ebbing on the coast of Florida, in America, while it is
rising on the coast of New England; but, as the waters which

must be proportionably less; and how then will Mr. Russell
                               º
account for their being able to produce such an effect? .
    Mr. Russell denies that my theory is sufficient to produce a
rising of the tides on that side of the earth which is furthest.
from the moon.        To make use of his own words, he says, “He
simply imagines a repelling power", which defy him to prove                  I
the existence of, and the work is done.”                This defiance comes
with   peculiar   grace   from Mr. Russell.                             I
                                                       have written a book,
in which I have      proved    at least the   possibility    of my hypothe

                     of
proper       look into this book, but calls on me
            to                                                     write over              to

the earth,       any other way, without taking away the power
                  in

 shall make use of a handful of water in order to prove that both
 of these opinions are directly the reverse of what is really the
 fact.    Ifwe take up a handful of water at the time the tides
 are rising, it must be evident that, as this water is brought
 nearer the moon and carried further from the earth, the power
 of the moon's attraction must be increased and the power of
 the earth's diminished; and consequently, if the power of the
 moon's attraction had been sufficient to lift the waters up in the
 first place, it would certainly be sufficient to prevent them from
 falling when they were brought so much nearer to                      The                       it.

    An  equal portion     of lime water not having been in contact
 with carbonic acid gas was brought to ebullition in the way
just described; it was precipitated in a much smaller propor
 tion, and the precipitate was dissolved in muriatic acid without
 any effervescence; consequently carbonate of lime had been.
precipitated in the first case, and hydrate of lime in the latter.
    Though both lime water and barytes water absorb carbonic
 acid speedily, and the carbonates are precipitated very readily
in both, but particularly in a solution of barytes, yet lime water
and barytic water, when previously mixed with ammonia, are not
in the least rendered turbid by a small proportion of carbonic
acid gas, and the earthy carbonates are wholly precipitated
from them by ebullition only.
                                                             -      -
    Lime water acts in the same manner when poured into
a solution of alkaline carbonate of ammonia; the transpa
rency is slightly clouded, and immediately after restored, and
ebullition is required to obtain a precipitate; but if a greater
 proportion of lime water be added to the carbonate of ammot
nia, a permanent precipitate is produced.                         -
    These  phaenomena      naturally suggest the question, whether
 those carbonates dissolve in ammonia and form salts with dou
 ble bases, or from what other cause these carbonates are not
readily precipitated from a liquid, which contains no super
 abundant acid, but which on the contrary is alkaline.
    Concrete carbonates do not dissolve again in ammonia; how
 ever, it does not appear improbable to Dr. V. that a super
 abundance of ammonia is an obstacle to their concretion, and
 consequently that the ammonia at least in the liquid state forms
 a peculiar salt with those carbonates, whose equilibrium is af.
 terwards disturbed by the evaporation of a part of the ammonia,
 which thus occasions a complete decomposition.
    Carbonate of lime obtained by muriate of lime and ammonia,
 when sufficiently washed, does not retain any ammonia; but
 carbonate of barytes obtained in the same way, when brought
 to a red heat, still affords some ammoniacal gas.
    If therefore muriate of barytes or muriate of lime, mixed
 with ammonia, were employed for detecting carbonic acid, it
 would be necessary to boil these liquids for some time in order
 to separate the carbonates entirely.
    But if it were desired to know the exact proportion of car
 bonic acid gas on the spot at a mineral spring where nomer
 curial apparatus was to be procured, Dr. V. for the above rea
 sons considers as the surest means, to pass the gas through
barytic water, and to determine the volume of the carbonic acid
gas from the weight       of the carbonate of barytes when dried.

within, increasing with the temperature, would be an obstacle
to the total conversion of the liquid into vapour, especially when
the space left above the liquid is only of a limited extent.

    The same    experiment    was tried  with water; but       did not                  it

G6                Analysis     of Periodical Works
to us, that there has been already a needless creation           of species,
which should be more properly considered as varieties. This
may have been the case prior to the commencement of our
monthly analysis of this work; but we do not think the charge
is applicable to any subjects we have noticed since that period.
In this Number the descriptions deficient in the last are supplied,
and the following additional plates given.      Pl. 378, three new
species of Cypraea from the Suffolk
authority of the Rev. S. R. Leathes.       ºf characterized on the
                                         They are named C. coc
cinelloides, retusa, and Avellana. May not the two last represent
the same species? their only difference is size, and in the dorsal.
sulcation of the last, which the former does not possess; but
this we know is not always a specific character.      Pl. 379.          Au
ricula pyramidalis, a shell whose genus we consider as uncer
tain.    Pl. 380 and 381. Plagiostoma Hoperi, and rusticum.
Pl. 382. P. laeviusculum, from the Pisolite of Malton. Pl. 383.
Gryphaea Columba of Lamarck, and G. nana from the clay at
Shotover.

    DoNAx; accompanied by excellent figures of D. Scortum, cu
neata, Trunculus and deltoides; UNGULINA, a genus of Daudin,
instituted on rather a slight foundation.        CAPsA; another
genus of the French conchologists, with even less pretensions.
than the last, as it differs from Donar so slightly, that we think
it should only form a division under that genus. TUBICINELLA,
well distinguished by Lamarck, and formed of the Lepas tra
chea <U+017F>ormis.    ERycINA, with very good figures of the following
species, the two first of which are stated to be new : 1. E. com
planata testà ovata, compressà, subinaequilaterå, laevi, epider
mide olivacea induta, concolore. , 2. E. striata testà acquilaterå,
 subtrigoná, compressà, costis plurimis, confertis, transversis,
anticë rigidis. , 3. E. plebeia is stated as the Donar plebeia
of English authors. NAVICELLA; a fresh water genus resem
bling a Linnaean Putella, but having an operculum.

    ledges he has not studied them sufficiently to judge of their ac
    curacy; we should have considered this the very best reason
    for adopting such reformations, proposed by botanists who
    have exclusively devoted their attention to this tribe of vege
    tables. Mr. Haworth has arranged this plant under the genus
    Gasteria.   The figure is excellent.

       The only species in this Number, is Erodium multicaule,
    thus defined: “E. pedunculis multifloris, foliis ternato-pinna
    tifidis: segmentis oblongis acutis inciso-serratis, petalis acutis
    calyce longioribus, caule ramosissimo adscendente.”
        It appears to be the plan of this work to give only one real
    species of this immense tribe in each Number; the remaining
    plates being devoted to record those hybrid varieties whic
!   may be raised ad infinitum by the London gardeners at plea
    sure, and which, if they are            to all

   From two different eminences he saw the hill from which
the mysterious Niger (there called Tembie) springs—the hill
is named Loma, and forms the commencement of a chain ex
tending to the northward from the Kissi country, where they
first arise. The Niger flowing from the hill of Loma in 9 deg.

dary between Sangara and Soolimana, the former being to the
right or east, and the latter to the left or west. The geogra
phical site of Loma was ascertained by taking the bearings
from two points thirty miles distant from one another; and
from the talent and well-known accuracy of Captain Laing,
there can be no doubt of the observations being correct.

 of Vesuvius, and M. Pepe has discovered in it the following
ingredients: sulphate of potash, sulphate of soda, sub-sulphate
of alumine, of chalk, and of magnesia; hydro-chlorate of pot
ash, that of soda, a good deal of oxid of aluminium, calcium,
silicium, and magnesium; much trioxid of iron, antimony,
and a little gold and silver.   The chemist who has contented
himself with  announcing   the existence of these different sub
stances in the ashes of the eruption, promises to investigate and
publish their respective proportions.    Other substances, which
the mountain continues to throw out, are very different from
the preceding.    This eruption appears to favour the hypo
thesis that the volcanic fire may be produced by the infiltra
tion of the sea-water, in the masses of potassium, sodium, &c.,
which are not yet oxidated; and the production of electrical
fluid in such great abundance may arise from the same source,
since the effects of the voltaic pile (auge) are obtained by the
                                           -
oxidation of metals. .
                    THE NORTH-WEST EXPEDITION.
    At the  Monthly Meeting, on Tuesday last, the 7th instant,
an interesting Paper was read to the Literary and Philosophi
cal Society, on the probable situation, condition, and prospects
of Captain Parry and his brave fellow-adventurers, an inquiry
surely not ill-timed at a season to us of joy and festivity, to
them of dreariness and darkness.         It showed the probability of
their  having  succeeded in   getting  a passage through some inlet
in the north-west of Hudson's      Bay;   since, if this had not been
the case, they would have returned, or at least been heard of
If they should have got beyond the Copper Mine River the first
summer, it is a subject of hope, rather than expectation, that
they may have passed Mackenzie's, and pushed through Beh
ring's Straits, in which case we may expect intelligence very
soon.    But in this case probably Franklin would have heard
of them. Or they may have been taken short by the climate
before reaching the Pacific, and are now passing a second
winter on this side of Behring's Straits: still a fair hope may
be entertained of their ultimate safety; but it may be the end
of this year, or the spring of the next, before we                 %.
                                                              of them.
Or, thirdly, they may not have been able to find a passage to
the Pacific;       .#
                    then the question             is,
                                             Can they get back      the to
Atlantic before the   open  weather   closes,    have  they

  sult can be obtained as to the quantity, even for a very limited

  trees, very much impedes the gradual solution of water in air,

  grow near a dwelling-house, as they always must render the

           have no wish to occupy your pages to the exclusion

                                       observations of the barometer,
the attached and external thermometers, were made in dif
ferent parts of the country for one year, or even for a much less
period, and a mean of these observations taken as above, and
compared, we might, by that useful instrument the barometer,
be enabled to ascertain the exact elevation of most parts of the
country. . It must be evident to every one, that the mean alti
                                                        º
tudes of the barometer obtained from a great many observa
tions would so far reduce the errors arising from unequal at
mospheric pressure, as not in the least to affect the results
founded on such observations; for though an equilibrium of
   ressure may never take place over the whole extent of this
island, at any given increment of time, yet, nevertheless, any
 change in one place is generally                   or preceded by a                        si
milar    change    in  others;  and  therefore,  the means in such case
cannot be much affected by this circumstance.                  But there is
 another source from which errors may arise, and which, if not
 attended         to,
                  will       great measure render such comparative

THE   subjoined sketch represents a section of the lower
  chalk strata, at the point where their course to the north
ward is interrupted, at Hunstanton Cliff, by the German
Ocean.    The intersection of the chalk beds, and of some of
the succeeding strata, forms at this point a cliff of a mile in
length, in which the general inclination to the eastward may
be observed. This spot is interesting to the collector of spe
cimens of fossil remains, from the number and variety it pro
duces.

THE
  *
            crystallization of cast-iron may be divided into two
      classes;  namely, that which takes place in chasms or shrink
ages of the metal, and that which is merely superficial.           The
former

       propriety

                                                  and variety,
                                                      stages.

menced, and which, Wii. confined to this stage, may truly be
called linear.     This is indicated by a series of lines running
parallel or concentric to each other, according as the chasm
inclines to a plane or hemisphere.             These ground lines are
intersected at right angles by a slighter class of lines, which
has the effect of covering the surface of the metal with a che
quered series of dots .# minute hollow squares.
    This stage of the operation takes place when a small chasm
is formed by shrinkage of a proportional quantity of fluid iron.
Its beauty and regularity will greatly depend upon the process
being effected in the absence of external air; wherever air has
reached the surface of the iron, the sharpness of the lines, and
a still more minute and silvery ground-work crystallization,
are destroyed by oxidation, and the beauty of the specimen
very much      impaired.

     The 2d stage of crystallization is marked by a separation of
 a certain number of these lines into quadrangular prisms,
 sometimes five, and in other instances seven lines, forming the
 stamina of the forth-coming crystals.              As the process of
 shrinkage is carried forward, the quadrangular prisms sepa
 rate longitudinally, and a series of points begin to appear,
 which are the summits of the more perfect forms. Both series
of lines become nearly of the same magnitude, are much
 more accurately defined; and such seems the effect of the per
                                                                                  i
 pendicular subsidence, that the form of the crystal is also af.
 fected by the gravitation of the mass.           The crystal may now
 be   compared    to a   spear    head,  with serrated edges, or like
some varieties of the Fern.          In indigo-coloured crystals, the
stem is frequently of a splendid silvery colour,                 at other
 times  gray,  gold,  or  purple.
    It may be proper here to observe, that although               lines                in all
                                                                                                            in

    the slender ramifications present dots or burnished points
    impressed with the parent form of the crystal; and in cells
    where the glass can only reach, the most minute but most per
    fect forms may be discovered.
         The most perfect specimens of crystallized cast-iron are
    to be found at foundries where cannon, mortars, large rollers,
    or such heavy iron machinery is made, as it is necessary to
    cast with large feeders or heads, to supply the diminution of
    volume or subsidence that takes place by the gravitation of
    the fluid iron.
                     I
         At one time possessed a very large and beautiful collec
    tion made at the Clyde Iron-Works, where a considerable
    manufactory of Government and other                  was carried on
                                                   #.
    during the early part of the late war. These crystals were
    obtained in the greatest abundance, when by accident the
    head or feeder of the gun had not been filled sufficiently high
     with fluid iron to overcome the quantum of subsidence that
     afterwards took place in cooling.       When the gun was carried
     to the cutting carriage, and the knife applied to separate the
     head close by the termination or muzzle of the gun, the de
     ficiency was soon discovered by the iron cutting open and
     spongy, and an imperfect casting indicated.          A blow from a
     heavy sledge, under such circumstances, was sufficient to se
     parate the head from the body of the gun.              The fracture
     occasioned      by such  separation  was  generally   convex   to the
     muzzle end of the     gun,  and concave to the head or   feeder;  the
     latter of which presented a fine arrangement of crystals,           in
     serted in the solid iron, while the convex surface presented
     the more perfect and detached forms grouped base to base, or
     obliquely, as circumstances had determined.
          There can be no doubt that every gun or large casting,
     made with a head or feeder, contains a portion of crystallized

  hammer. This will generally be followed by a fine display of
  crystallized iron, of every variety of colour; or, if the coloured
  crystals should be scarce, they can readily be made from the
  silvery coloured ones, by heating them in a vessel in a bright
  fire, till the summits of the pyramids begin to change colour.
  The specimen is then thrown out, and will be found, when
 cold, possessed of every shade of colour of which polished iron
 or steel is susceptible.
      Cells of colourless crystals resembling frosted silver are
 sometimes observed in large castings, opposite to the runner
 or feeder, which seem to differ from the other crystals merely
 in their formation having taken place under circumstances
 where atmospheric air has been totally excluded.                    The less
 carbon in the iron, the purer the colour and the more perfect
 the form of the crystal; and this observation may be extended
 to  all crystals       of

bages. Besides his work, which has in some measure guided
my researches,     I
                   have had valuable assistance from M.                     Vil
morin of Paris, who, being at the head of a very large com
mercial establishment in that city, particularly instituted for
oeconomical plants, has studied them with care and accuracy,
and has deduced very interesting results from his experiments.
M. Audibert, settled at Tarascon, has also had the goodness
to communicate his ideas arising from facts, which close ob
servation and assiduous practice have led him to discover.
M. Sageret, an enlightened member of the Agricultural So
ciety of Paris, has also sent me the results of his experiments
on cross-bred Cabbages, and the ingenious conclusions which
he has deduced from them. Lastly, M. Nestler, Professor of
Botany at Strasbourg, where the culture of the oleaginous
                                          rºi.
cruciferous plants is extensive, has obliged me with a few de
scriptions, and some important
                plants.
                                             on the distinctions
between these
   To these several communications I have added the re
marks which occurred from my own observation, having,
at different times, visited most of the countries where these
plants are cultivated; besides which,          I
                                           have particularly at
tended to the  specimens  grown   in the Botanic Garden at Ge
neva, where, from the kindness of Messrs. Vilmorin and                      Au
dibert, few of the known varieties of Cabbages have escaped
my notice; and I consider it no little advantage to have seen
them produced under the same climate, at the same time, and
in the same ground, from seeds which had been collected from
various countries.
   Five species of Brassica" have particularly attracted my
attention; the oleracea, campestris, Itapa, Napies, and praeco.r.
these I shall successively submit to examination, by describing
the characters, history, and peculiar varieties of each.

        From universal testimony, this Cabbage is a native of Eu
    rope; it is mentioned by Dioscoridest as an inhabitant of
    Greece, and Sibthorpf expressly says that he found it wild
    on rocks near the sea-shore of that country.            M. Bosc as
    sures us that it still grows wild on the coasts of France,
    M. Bouchet found it near Abbeville, on the hilly shores of
    Treport; and           I

      The Cavalier Cabbage has five" principal varieties, suffi
  ciently distinct for ordinary practice, though the peculiar cha
   racter of each variety may happen now and then not to be
   readily distinguished.         The first is the Brassica ramosai,
   Cavalier branchu     (Branching       Cabbage), differing only in size
   from the Wild Cabbage. There is also scarcely any diffe
  rence discernible between this ramous plant and Daubenton's
   Chou vivace.      The second variety is the Brassica vulgaris,
   Cavalier, or Chou vert commun; this shoots up higher than the
*eceding one, stalk remaining nearly single; but these two
                               its

 green, and the leaves in some individuals are nearly plain: so
 much so, that they might be confounded with the true Cava
 lier; an additional proof that this variety belongs to that race.
 The Brassica tophosa, figured by John Bauhin ", appears to
 be a sub-variety which might be referred either to the Fringed
 or Palm Cabbage, and tends to prove the diversities of cha
 racter which unite these varieties: as             have had no oppor    I
 tunity of seeing the plant itself, I cannot class it with any de
 gree of certainty.
    To these five varieties, which compose the race of Cavalier
 Cabbages, I shall add a sixth, which may, in time, probably
 be found sufficiently distinct to form another race; I mean

    to give the Latin name, has a very peculiar organization,
    the bunches of flowers, instead of being loosely spread into
    a pyramidal form, like those of a panicle, are close from their
    basis, and form a kind of regular corymb; to which is added
    a second character that may be considered as a natural con
    sequence of the first; the pedicles, from being tightly kept
    together before their time of blossom, lose their shape, grow
.   fleshy from adhering to each other, and in general produce
    nothing but the rudiments of abortive flowers; the fleshy pe.
    dicles are in general cut for use before the opening of the
    flowers, so that, contrary to all other varieties, where the leaves
    and stalk are alone taken for culinary purposes, in this, the
    floral footstalk is the only part eaten.      This race comprehends
    two varieties, viz. the Cauliflowers and the Broccolis.            1st,
    The Brassica cauliflora, Chouffeur (Cauliflower), has generally
    a short stem, with white ribbed oblong leaves; the pedicles
    uniting at the head of the primary branches into thick, short,
    irregular bundles, in the shape of a corymb; it appears to
    be a degeneration of the Brassica oleraeea costata, Chou d
    grosses cétes.   The French gardeners have three sub-varieties
    of the  Cauliflower,    Le dur, the hard, also called English Cau
    liflower, Le semi dur, the semi-hard, and Le tendre, the soft
    or tender, which is most forward in growth. These sub
    warieties, founded on different degrees of firmness of the foot
    stalk, are far from offering a constant character, and seem
    principally to depend on §e nature of the ground, and in
    fluence of the climate.        The second variety is the Brassica
    cymosa, Broccoli,         its
                              stem       more elevated, the leaf-nerves
                                               is
    less  prominent,    the  pedicles   altogether  less thick and close,
    they are also longer,           so
                                 that               on
                                            becoming fleshy, they resem
    ble  in shape the young shoots           Asparagus; hence the name

    would seem, however, from your Alnwick Correspondent's

        Now, perhaps, when the rage for “Safety-Lamps,” as the

     seeing a change gradually effected. In the mean time, I should
     feel much obliged, by seeing the following particulars or any
     of them stated in your pages; viz. what are the dimensions of
     the Measure, which your Correspondent calls a Boll 2 and
     whether it is heaped?            How many pounds does a Boll of
     Coals  weigh?,     in  average   and in extreme cases.        How many
     superficial square yards constitute the Darg P which he men
     tions: probably the Daugh, of the 2nd Report on Weights and
     Measures, September 1820, means the same thing?; but it is

106                    Mr. Hawkins                 on the Nomenclature
 made of grey-wacke slate; so little was he then disposed to
 include in this new denomination, any thing which possessed
 not the true derivative character.               The same arrangement
 subsisted at the     period   of my   second visit to Freyberg in 1793;
 but on my return thither in the year 1798, found that some                  I
 very important changes had taken place in the order of the
 Wernerian arrangements; the class of transition rocks having
 been introduced between the primitive and the secondary; at
 the head of which new class, was placed that argillaceous slate,
 which had been observed to contain organic remains; the
 true grey-wacke being here stationed at the end of the series.
 The primitive sort of argillaceous slate, on the other hand, still
 kept  its place       the system
                       in                      of

 slate.   Admitting,          Werner did, that nature had repeated
                                as
 the same operations              various intervals, there was nothing
                                     at
in   this separation           of
                             the argillaceous slate into two distinct
 classes, which could               be
                                deemed unscientific.
     And here could have wished, that the nomenclature,
                  I                                                                                    as

     primitive sort of argillaceous slate, from that which is of more
     recent origin; and considering the true grey-wacke as apper
     taining to the latter?
        Being desirous of ascertaining the synonyms of the rocks
     which constitute the principal strata of Cornwall, transmitted            I
     to Mr. Werner in the year 1793 a well chosen collection of
     specimens of some of their varieties; and in the autumn of
     the same year, I had the satisfaction of hearing his decision
     upon them. No doubt was expressed of the nature of our
     metalliferous rock, the killas.     It was pronounced to be a ge
     nuine thon-schiefer, or argillaceous slate, in no respect differing
     from that which occurs in Saxony.
        As the belts of iron-stone which encircle the granitical hills
    in Cornwall had very early engaged my attention, I felt par
    ticularly anxious to submit some specimens of this interesting
    rock-formation to the examination of such an experienced ob
    server. Those taken from the neighbourhood of Penzance
<U+017F>
    were, after a rigid scrutiny, pronounced to be hornblende
    rock intimately mixed with the constituent mass of argil
    laceous slate, and in part genuine hornblende-slate.             Some
    specimens of iron-stone from Penpillic and Corrogat in Tre
    wardreth parish, which I procured from the late Mr. Rash
    leigh of Menabilly, were characterized by Werner as follows:
     “This rock is an intimate mixture of hornblende and dense or
    compact felspar, in which a little quartz may be occasionally
        rceived.    Some specimens bear a very near affinity to the
      torn-schiefer of the Swedes.”                                          -
    ... To the judgement                 of
                                the same accurate observer submitted           I
    various specimens         our Cornish elvan; and the result
                                    of                                 their            of

108      Mr. Hawkins               on the Nomenclature              of the Cornish Rocks.
   There are evidently numerous varieties of the Cornish:
elvan, in some of which may be traced the transition from
porphyry into granite. The mass contains, moreover, in a
state of dispersion, many extraneous crystallized substances,
and is intersected by veins of different minerals, which veins
are of contemporaneous formation.            The circumstances under
which the elvan occurs, as we learn from the instructive                                             re
       of Mr. Carne, are in many respects singular, and, inas
much as they are connected with the natural history of our tin
and copper lodes, highly important. We have still, however, but
an imperfect knowledge of these, and I trust that those mem
them.      By way of hint to assist                     i.
bers of our Society, who may have opportunities for collecting
further information, will not neglect to avail themselves of
                                               inquiries,
mention, that in addition to the many extraneous substanees

Grampound and St. Austle.               shall moreover take this op

110      Rev. S. Greatheed on the Knowledge and Commerce
 was procured from some western islands, the situation of
 which was unknown.          From that date to the Christian era,
 the successive Greek writers, Aristotle, Posidonius, Polybius,
 Diodorus Siculus, and Strabo, manifest clearer information.
 They knew that tin was obtained from the northern confines
 of Spain and Lusitania; and likewise from Britain, over-land
 through Gaul; but they mostly distinguish the latter country
 from the Cassiterides, without assigning the situation of those
 islands.   Roman writers, even to a later date, discover less
 information, and more incredulity, on the subject.           Pliny gives
 the name of Plumbum candidum to the Cassiferon, or Tin, of
 the Greeks; and scouts, as fictions, the reports that it had
 ever been procured from islands in the Atlantic Ocean, or any
where but from Spain and Lusitania.              The name of Stannum,
 together with the proper uses of tin, he attributes to a metal
 which he describes as found intermixed with silver and Plum
 bum nigrum (or Lead”).           With the latter metal, he repre
 sents Britain peculiarly to have abounded; but he does not
intimate, that either Stannum or Plumbum candidum (or                                        al
 bum) had ever been found there.            Yet Julius Caesar, above

THE Academy has directed MM. Portal, Berthollet, Pinel,
  Duméril, and myself, to give an account of a paper of
M. Flourens, entitled “Determination of the Properties of
the Nervous System, or Physical Researches concerning                                                     Irri
tability and Sensibility.”
    This paper may be considered under three aspects; the ex
periments made by the author, the consequences he derives
from those experiments, and the language in which he ex
presses them.      He has repeated before us his principal ex
  eriments, and they appeared to us exact. We have followed
  is arguments with attention, and the greater number of them
seem to us just; but the language he has employed differs in
some important points from that generally received, and may
give occasion to objections and to misunderstandings, if we do
not endeavour at once to rectify                indeed from    it.

physiological experiments. Herophilus and Erasistratus de

   These experiments showed that this property of forcibly
contracting, either from immediate irritation, or in consequence
of the irritation of the nerve, exists in the muscular fibres;
and that it exists in no other element of the animal body.
Their importance excited a lively interest; the disciples of
this great physiologist repeated them, and indeed exaggerated
                                                         º:
their effects.                  -
  As the irritability is not in proportion           to the size of the
nerves which are distributed to each muscle, and as it was then
believed that there existed muscular parts entirely or almost
entirely devoid of nerves; some                     concluded that this
property belongs to the fibre itself, independently of                 con                           its
nexion with the nerve; that the nerve may                 one     the irri           be         of
tating agents, but that the other irritants would act without                                                  it.
It  would, however,                  be
                            wrong positively         attribute this opi
nion    toHaller himself. Many passages               his writings show      in to

the more these phaenomena are studied, the stronger will
the conviction                 of
                      that cooperation.      Now that the nerves
 all the muscular   parts  are  known,    that      muscular fibre can   no
be conceived which has not some connexion with                     nervous                      a
filament, nobody would venture                                 to
                                           maintain that this nervous
filament remains passive during the contraction.                The only
thing incontestably proved,                          is,
        iº

    tation does not cause it to contract; but certainly they do not
    pretend that it may not, therefore, produce irritation in the
    muscle: there is not an individual among them who has not
    always known that the contrary is the fact. When they say
    the nerve is sensible, they mean that the animal receives                                              all    its
    sensations through the medium                 the nerves; but they cer

                not  pretend   that the    nerve,   separated from the body,
    can continue            to

    that  it can experience any itself.
        We shall begin, then,                       by
                                            entreating M. Flourens              ex                        to

    to   this nomenclature, and which can only tend                         confuse              to
    ideas, without any solid advantage                   science.     Thus, from
                                                                        to
    the fact that the nerve, when pricked, produces contractions
:   in  the muscle, he concludes that the nerve                   irritable            is                :   it   is
    sufficiently clear that,        this  proposition,

                                      only changes the meaning                   the                      of
     word irritable. From the fact that the nerve separated from
     the rest       of
                   the system, no longer gives any sensation                     the                      to
    animal, he concludes that the nerve               not sensible. is   This also
    is  simply the change                of
                                    word, which tells
                                              a                nothing but what   us
     we knew before.
        M. Flourens himself admits that he introduces new lan.                                   a
    guage; for           he
                      says,              “I
                                  call irritability the property which the
     nerve has       exciting sensation and motion without experien
                       of

118              M. G.       Cuvier's Report on the Researches
    29. To what points of that system the impression must                        ex
tend, in order to produce sensation.
    3°. From what points voluntary irritation descends, and
what parts of the system ought to be untouched, in order to
produce it regularly.
    We will add, that in this first part he has considered these
questions only with relation to Vertebrated animals, and to their
nervous system of animal life; that is to say, to the brain, the
spinal marrow, and the nerves which proceed from them.
    In order to resolve these questions, the author begins with
the nerves, and repeating, with respect to them, the known
experiments, he establishes the two general effects of their                         ir
ritation which we have just described; he shows with great
precision, that to produce contraction there must be a free and
uninterrupted communication of the nerve with the muscle;
 and that to produce sensation, a free and uninterrupted com
munication with the encephalus is necessary: he concludes
that neither contraction nor sensation belongs to the nerve;
 that these two effects are distinct; that they may be excited
independently of each other; and that these propositions are
true, at whatever part, at whatever ramification of the nerve,
the communication may be intercepted.               Employing the same
method with       regard   to the  spinal marrow,   he arrives at similar
results.     When it is irritated at a certain point, it causes con
 tractions in     all
                    the muscles whose nerves originate below the
point  of  irritation,      the communications have remained free;
                             if
it  ceases to cause them          the communication
                                   if                     cut off.
                                                           is
    The exact inverse            the case with
                                  is             sensations;   and              as    in
the nerves the empire              of
                                  the will demands the same freedom
of   communication           as
                            sensation does, the muscles below the                    in
tercepted spot          no
                         longer obey the animal, and               longer  no
feels them.      Lastly;      the marrow
                              if              intercepted
                                                is            two  at it
                                                                   points,
those muscles alone, whose nerves originate from the interval
comprised between those points, will experience contractions;
but the animal has                no
                                longer any command over them, nor
does  it receive    any  sensation from them.
    We shall not detail            all
                                  the combinations        by
                                                        means       which  of
M. Flourens has varied the experiments               on
                                                      this subject;              it   is
sufficient  to  say that they            all
                                      lead      to
                                              the result which we have
just described.
    The author concludes from them, that sensation and con
traction    do not belong         the spinal marrow any more than
                                   to                                                 to

cross there, so that those of the right ascend into the left, and
vice versä ; that these fasciculi, after this first enlargement in
the Mammiferae by an admixture of grayish matter, and after
having formed the protuberance known by the name of pons
 Varolii, separate and take the name of crura cerebri, conti
nuing to send out nerves; that they again enlarge by a fresh
admixture of grayish matter, in order to form the masses com
monly called thalami nervorum opticorum; and a third time,
  to form those called corpora striata ; that from the whole exter
  nal edge of these last enlargements, is given off an expansion of
  greater or less thickness, and more or less folded externally in
  different animals, entirely covered with grayish matter, and                             re
  flected upwards to cover them again, by forming what are
  called the hemispheres; and which, after bending down between
  them, unites itself to that of the opposite side by one or more
  commissures or fasciculi of transverse fibres, the most consi
  derable of which, existing only in the Mammiferae, is called
: corpus callosum.     It is also well known that upon the crura ce
  rebri, behind the optic thalami, are one or two pair of lesser
  enlargements, known, when there are two pair, as in the Mam

                              is
to    accomplish.
     He has examined, first, how high                 we
                                                   must ascend       pro             to

                                                                                 he as
      has irritated  it                                                              it
 not act upon the muscles: and when              began
                                                     it     act,   found

                         is       place     which the sensation

  punctures and wounds may be inflicted without causing pain.
    hus M. Flourens punctured the hemispheres, without pro
 ducing either contraction in the muscles, or appearance of
F. e
        in the animal; he removed them in successive laminae;
      performed     the same operation on the cerebellum ; he took
 away, at the same time, the hemispheres and the cerebellum.
 The animal remained impassive. The corpora striata and
the optic thalami were attacked and removed, without pro
ducing any other effects. The iris was not even contracted in
 consequence, nor was it subsequently paralysed.              But when
he punctured the tubercula quadrigemina, trembling and con
vulsions immediately took place, and increased in proportion
 as he penetrated more deeply into the medulla oblongata. The
pricking of these tubercula, or of the optic nerve, produced
                                                                   -
 acute and prolonged contractions of the iris.
    These experiments agree with those of Lorry, printed in the
 third volume of the Mémoires des Savans étrangers. “Neither
irritations of the brain,” says Lorry, “nor of the corpus callo
 sum itself, produce convulsions: it may even be removed with
impunity. The only part, among those contained in the brain,
capable of uniformly and universally exciting convulsions, is
the medulla oblongata: it is that part which produces them to
 the exclusion of all others.”                                  -
    These experiments contradict those of Haller and Zinn, in
all  that regards the cerebellum     ;   but from the observations    of
M. Flourens, appears that these physiologists had touched
                it
the medulla oblongata without perceiving         it.   Hence M. Flou–
rens concludes (to use his peculiar language), that the medulla
oblongata and the tubercula are irritable; which        in ours signifies
that   they   are, like the   spinal  marrow and the    nerves, conduc
tors  of   irritation; but that neither the cerebrum nor the cere
bellum has that property.            The author concludes also, that
these tubercles form the continuation and the superior termi
nation  of    the spinal marrow and the medulla oblongata and   ;
this conclusion      is   in perfect conformity with their relations-
and anatomical connexions.
    Wounds    of     the cerebrum and cerebellum produce neither
pain nor convulsions; and,           in ordinary language, we should
thence    pronounce      that the cerebrum and cerebellum are insensi
ble.     But M. Flourens says,        on  the contrary, that these are
the sensible parts    of    the nervous system; which only means,
that they are the parts        at which the impression received by the
sensible    organs   must   arrive,  before the animal can experience
a  sensation.                                           -

 that the animal                in
                              statea   sleep. Indeedof        moves and acts      he
 precisely like        sleeping man; but we are far from believing
                          a
 that  a  man,     while asleep, who moves himself into the most
 convenient positions and attitudes,             absolutely without sensa

                              any means follow, because his perception
                              it
 of them was indistinct, and because he has retained no recol
 lection of them, that therefore he has not experienced them.
  Hence, instead saying, with our author, that the cerebral lobes
                           of
 are the sole organs           sensation, we would confine ourselves

 conclusion, reduced                exact and proper terms, would be

    with the rest of the system, it is still further supported by a
    fact in comparative anatomy, that the intelligence of animals
    is constantly proportioned to the volume of these lobes.
       Having observed the effects of the ablation of what may be
    strictly called the brain, M. Flourens proceeds to examine
    those of the extirpation of the tubercula quadrigemina.            The
    excision of one of these tubercles, after a convulsive motion
    of short duration, produces a durable blindness of the eye on
    the opposite side, and an involuntary giddiness; that of both
    tubercles, renders the blindness more complete and the giddi
    ness more violent and prolonged.        The animal, however, re
    mains in possession of                  its
                                   other faculties, and the iris retains
    its contractility.    The deep extirpation        the tubercle,    ofthe                      or
    section       of
                the   optic nerve, produces only    paralysis      the iris;            of
    whence M. Flourens concludes that the ablation of the tuber
    cle has no other effect than would follow the section of the
    nerve; that the tubercle, therefore,        only     conductor
                                                                 is         a                      of   vi

    volition.        The integrity of the                      cerebellum is necessary for the
    regularity of acts of locomotion. While the brain is entire, the
    animal will see, hear, and exhibit marked and decisive sym
    ptoms of volition; but if the cerebellum be destroyed, he will
:   be unable to preserve the equilibrium requisite for the per
    formance of locomotion. Irritability will, however, subsist for
    a considerable time in the remaining parts of the body, without
    the intervention of the cerebrum or cerebellum.    Every irrita
    tion of a nerve produces action in the muscles to which it is
    distributed: every irritation of the spinal marrow produces.
    action in the members and parts below the irritated point.
    The faculty of propagating irritation on the one hand, and
    receiving pain on the other, is altogether confined to the supe
    rior part of the medulla oblongata: viz. the part at which the
    tubercula quadrigemina adhere to            This               the place

 correspondent, who, for a considerable time past, has furnished
so many valuable articles from the foreign journals; by which
a knowledge of the exertions used on the continent for the
 improvement of that science has been diffused through these
 islands.                                                     -
    The article in your last Number, “On the declination of
 the fixed Stars,   #.    Professor Bessel,” is particularly inter
esting.     It is the first regular account we have had of the
results in declination of the new Meridian Circles of M.
 Reichenbach.      The reports of these results had occasioned
considerable interest here; as they appeared to differ very
considerably from the results obtained by Mr. Pond and Dr.
 Brinkley, which nearly agreed with those of MM. Oriani and
 Piazzi.
    I request permission to make a few remarks on this subject.
The object of them is to show that, great as the discordances
appear, there is nothing can be deduced from them unfavour
able to the respective instruments, or to the skill and care      of

  smallest degree, answerable for the discordances.      The splen
  did talents of Messrs.   Ramsden,  Troughton,   and Reichenbach,
  to whom we owe the construction of these instruments, have
  been most strikingly exhibited therein.       It is from another
  source that the disagreement of the respective results is to be
  sought for.
      I think it will be found that errors in the quantity of the
  constant of refraction have occasioned the whole difficulty.       I
  shall endeavour to show, that an error of about half-a-second
  in this quantity, as used by the different observers, will produce
  very nearly the whole effect. Also that, apparently, the at
  tempt to ascertain the constant of refraction to this degree of
  precision, is one of the most difficult things that have yet been
  aimed at in astronomy.       It appears to me that no observer,
  however excellent his instrument, and great his care and skill,
  can be certain that he has arrived at this degree of exactness.
                                           I
  It might be inferred from this, that suppose the errors of
  the results may be equally divided between the Konigsberg
  catalogue, and those of Greenwich and Dublin.          It may not
  be very unsafe to rest on this conclusion. But, from a circum
  stance arising out of a recent comparison of the catalogues
  of Mr. Pond and Dr. Brinkley, a degree of probability is ob
  tained, that their catalogues are the most exact.
      For the purpose of making a comparison with M. Bessel's
  catalogue, I shall use the recent determinations by Dr. Brink
  ley   ºorth      Polar distances, which were published in the
  Journal of Science in September last, and refer to the last
  number of the Philosophical Magazine for M. Bessel's de
  clinations.   I might equally have used Mr. Pond's North Polar
  distances; but, as the mean difference of Dr. Brinkley’s North
   Polar distances of 1813 reduced to 1820, and of those in the
  Journal of Science, is precisely=0",0,    I have taken the latter.
      M. Bessel appears to have examined, with great care and
   industry, the divisions of his circle; and there can be no rea
   son for not acquiescing in his opinion of the excellence of his
   instrument in this respect.    Unfortunately, M. Bessel has not
   added the declinations of stars between his zenith and the Pole:
   with the assistance of these, we might have made an interest
   ing comparison of corresponding large arches in each circle.
   A comparison of this kind has been recently made, as to the
   circles of Dublin and Greenwich; and the result has been
   such, as to leave no manner of doubt that the divisions of these
   instruments agree together in a very exact manner; and ap

differences.    A difference of          jº
                                    of an inch, in the two barome
ters, is equivalent to about 0°,38 in the constant of refraction;
and 2° difference in the two thermometers, is equivalent to
about 0",24: the sum is 0",62. A discordance to this amount
is not very unlikely.
    But no real source of error arises from this cause, when the
constants of refraction are determined by help of the respective
barometers and thermometers; as has been done by Dr.
 Brinkley and M. Bessel. Mr. Pond has not made public any
determination of his constant; but as he has so steadily ad
hered to Dr. Bradley's table of refraction, there cannot be a
doubt that he has satisfied himself by his own observations, as
to the constant from which that table is deduced: and in fact
it appears, by a recent comparison of the Dublin and Green
wich North Polar distances, that the constant used in each of
those places is really the same; although in consequence, as is
highly probable, of the discordances of the meteorological                         in
struments, they appear to differ by 0",68; that used by Mr.
Pond being 57",04, and Dr. Brinkley's being 57”,72.                    *
   Dr.   Brinkley  and M. Bessel make      nearly  the same allow

ance for change of temperature.        Mr. Pond,             adopted
Bradley's table, of course differs considerably from them. But
this does not affect the comparisons here made; because the
three catalogues may be all considered as made within a few
degrees of the mean temperature.        It is very difficult to esti
lmate            the discordances resulting from using at Dublin
the interior  thermometer,    and at Konigsberg the exterior.       It
is however reasonable to     suppose  they are not great. Admit
ting, then, that the two catalogues may be assimilated to each
other, by using the constants of refraction above stated, it                       re
mains to account for an error apparently so great as 0",6 in
the constant as determined at each place. If we consider the
manner in which this element is deduced, we shall easily see
that 0",6 can by no means be considered as a great error.

    When we consider the irregularities of refraction at zenith

circumstances relative to the corrections used in reducing the
observed zenith distances to the mean, it is not likely p’ can be
depended on nearer than 0",3; and, although p is not equally

182                  On the North Polar Distances                                                      of Fired              Stars.
   M. Bessel's distinguished talents and extraordinary assiduity
ought to prevent us from forming any hasty adverse opinion.
The question is quite open, and must be decided by the future
labours of astronomers: which, it is desirable, should be par
ticularly pointed to the investigation of the constant of refrac
tion for both interior and exterior thermometers.        The baro
meters and thermometers    should,  if possible, be compared   with
exact standards.     The results, then, if from sufficiently nume
rous observations, will probably be not very discordant; and
a mean of them may be adopted for the common use of astro
nomers, by which our tables of refraction and our catalogues
will possess an uniformity very different from what we see at
present.          am, gentlemen,          I      -

       FEW       young men, following scientific professions, having
          observed with regret the want of a Society in which, by
    the mutual communication of their ideas and information, they
    might acquire a just method of investigating and discussing
                   subjects; and being aware that the scientific so.
    cieties at present in existence are not calculated for that object,
    being conducted on principles which suppose a previous and
    extensive knowledge, are therefore desirous of commencing
    one to accomplish the above end; and have appointed me (as

careous matter, and barren.       Large caves are general, bearing

    he describes his journey in these words:—
        “In pursuance of my intentions, which you were made ac
       uainted with by my letter from Mourzouk, I left that place on
     the 19th of May, and after 23 days of very great fatigue ar
     rived here (Tripoli) on the 11th of last month.      One Arab
     Sheikh and two camels composed, with myself, the caravan.
     Our usual time was from 14 to 16 hours in the 24 on the march;
     and in passing the Deserts (three and four days in length)                      al
     ways 18 hours; the camels              I
                                     scarcely ever allowed to rest;
     the halt we  always made in the middle of the day to allow the
     camels to come    up, was by far the most trying part of the
    journey, exposed to the burning heat of the mid-day sun,
    where nature had not provided shade sufficient for a grass
     hopper; lying on a scorching sand,and with nothing to alleviate
    our parching thirst but wretched water which had been se
    veral days in beastly skins, was a misery I had no conception
    of before. At night we generally got a little kouscaçous, with
    some fat and salt, no bad supper; but a cup of tea was luxury
    supreme, as it satisfied thirst, and took off the edge of the pu
          .#
    trid taste of the bad water; our fire, which was always made
    by           together the camels’ dung which we found, was
    consequently uncertain, and we sometimes could not find more
    than was necessary for boiling a little water.       I had a tent
:   with me, but seldom pitched                 it;
                                         we were all too tired, and
    my Arab thought       quite useless; we slipt off our horses when

sculptured on the ceiling of the pronaos of that edifice was
made in the reign of Antoninus.     Now this zodiac, as well
as that of the great temple, begins with the sign of the Virgin,
and the date of it had been also fixed at three thousand years
before the Christian aera.   The temple itself, the erection of
which was assigned to that remote period, is not anterior to
the reign of Adrian. As for the planisphere of Denderah, we
know that M. Champollion reads on it in phonetic hieroglyphics
the word Autokrator, and assigns it to the reign of Nero. M.               Le
honne had also proved from Greek inscriptions, that the rectan
; ular zodiac of the pronaos must belong to the reign of Tiberius.
   may therefore be considered, as a fact resulting from posi
tive researches, that not one of the four famous zodiacs dis
covered in Egypt is anterior to the dominion of the Romans
in that country. The important facts connected with this
question are laid down by M. Lehonne in a work which will
appear in a few days, under the following title: “Researches
into the History of Egypt during the domination of the Greeks
and Romans; derived from Greek and Latin inscriptions, re

   At Dalmellington, Ayrshire, about mid-day on Saturday
25th January, four suns were observed in the firmament at
one time. An uncommon vivid halo, resembling a rainbow,
half-circled each of the mock suns, while the natural one was
entirely surrounded.    The appearance of the whole was ex
tremely beautiful, and exceeded in brilliancy and splendour
any thing of a similar nature which has occurred in the me
mory of the oldest shepherds in that quarter. This phaenome
non, though varied in appearance, was likewise visible at Ayr,
and in other places of the county.—Ayr Courier.

       N. B. The barometer is hung up in the observatory 50 feet
   above low-water mark; and the self-registering horizontal day
   and night thermometer, and De Luc's whalebone hygrometer,
   are placed in open-worked cases, in a northern aspect, out of
   the rays of the sun, ten feet above the garden ground. The
   pluviameter and evaporator have respectively the same square
   area: the former is emptied every morning at 8 A.M. after
   rain, into a cylindrical glass gauge accurately graduated to rºoth
   of an inch; and the quantity lost by evaporation from the latter
   is ascertained at least every third day, and sometimes oftener
   when great evaporations happen by means of a high tempera
   ture and dry northerly or easterly winds.
       BAROMETRICAL       PREssur E.—The mercurial column this
   year has shown no unusual elevation nor depression : it has
   not fallen so low by ºths of an inch as in 1821.-The mean
   pressure is Tººths of an inch higher than that of the last year,
   and    ºths   of an inch higher than the mean of any year since
   the close of 1814; but the aggregate of the spaces described
    by the alternate rising and falling of the mercury is 114th
    inches less.   This high mean pressure, which will no doubt
    be found by every meteorologist to have obtained this year,
    may be justly attributed to the fine dry weather the first half
    of the year. For 170 days that the moon had a North decli
    nation, the mean pressure was only +4+th of an inch higher
    than that in the 183 days of her South declination.       So equal
                                        i.
    an annual    pressure  with the moon on each side of the Equi
º:  noctial, does not obtain in very wet years, as in 1816 and 1821.
        TEMPERATURE.—The mean temperature of the external air
     a few feet from the ground, is            than that of any other
     year during the last eight years, and 13° higher than the warm
     year 1818. This is the result of a remarkably mild winter and
     spring year. The winter and spring months are also stated to
     have been very mild, with a humid air in the northern parts of
     Europe; while in the several countries of South America the
     cold was so unusually severe, as to have been considered a
     most extraordinary phaenomenon in the climate of that country.
     It  is a remarkable circumstance in our climate when the
     monthly mean temperature is highest in June by 1%ths of a

thermometrical observations. The mean temperature of May,
too, was higher than the mean of September, which is also
unusual: it was the means of the most early hay-making, and
of the earliest completion of an abundant corn harvest, we can
remember: in short, it brought on an early and dry summer
that was almost equal in                  its

               Meteorological Summary           for 1822.-London.              157
     August: this coincides nearly with the proportion of meteors
     which that month bears to the annual number that have been
     seen here for some years past.                -
        Now, as the maximum temperature of the ground takes place
     generally at the close of August, or the beginning of Septem
     ber, which is some time after the greatest summer heat of the
     sun's rays, it naturally induces a belief that the exhalations
     from the earth, (whose composition must be of various gaseous
     qualities,) uniting with the gases of the atmosphere, may be
     the chief agent in their production, particularly as these sum
     mer meteors are much nearer the ground than those seen in
     the winter evenings.     The evaporation is more than double
     that of last year; which is but a natural result, considering the
     dryness of the spring and summer months, and the uncommonly
     high mean temperature of the air.             -
       itain has fillen more or less on 181 days, of which 64 whole
     days and nights is the real time it has rained. July, October,
     and November, afforded more than one-half of the amount of
     this year's rain; and June, July, August, and September, more
     than one-half the amount of the evaporation. .

   GENTLEMEN,                                                                  -
HAVING           amused myself, during the autumn of 1821, in
       calculating the place of Vesta, at intervals between the
beginning of April and the end of July 1822, from Daussy's
Tables (in Connaissance des Tems 1820), with a design of
making some observations on the meridian; I was mortified,
                                                       #.
on receiving Bode's Ephemeris for 1824, to find that my cal
culations differed considerably from those given by the author
for certain days in the above months.                   when Mr.
Groombridge communicated to the Astronomical Society an
Ephemeris for the opposition of the four small planets in the
summer of 1822, (and which was inserted in the Philosophi
cal Magazine for January of that year, page 28,)             was in   I
some degree relieved from my embarrassment by a remark,
which that gentleman made respecting the above-mentioned
Tables of M. Daussy; viz. “that the orbit of Vesta having
been found, from later observations, less than at first computed,
the mean longitude given by them has become nearly twenty
minutes in arrear.”    But upon looking over Bode's Jahrbuch
for 1825, lately received, a new difficulty has arisen. In
page 181, a number of observed places of Vesta, during the
month of June last, are given by Professor Encke, and the
opposition is stated to have taken place on the 15th, at
                                       -

   As this circumstance appeared remarkable, I calculated
the position of the planet for the above given time, viz.
22h 53'29",5 on June 15, taking the arguments of the tables
for 10h 53'29",5 on June 16, as the epoch of them is mid
night, and found the result very nearly corresponding to that
mentioned by Professor Encke; the small difference having
been occasioned probably by having used a different ephe
meris for the sun's longitude, &c. I should esteem it a favour
if any gentleman would explain how the tables could give the
longitude at the above opposition within so small an error, if
they are twenty minutes in arrear.

LM the ZAIO = ALM = AHG, therefore                  Z OIG = EGH =
EBD,     and a circle may consequently be described about the
quadrilateral BIOE; the Z BIE is therefore = BOE. In
like manner since LP is parallel to IE, the ZMLP=OIE=
OBE = DCE = (by const.) ANM, and a circle may be de
scribed about the quadrilateral LNMP; the ZNLM is there
fore = NPM.       But IO and       IE being parallel to LM and
LP, AL;      AI::  AM: AO:: AP: AE, therefore OE is pa
rallel to MP and the ZMPA = OEA. The ZBAE which is
 = AOE--AEO, is therefore = BIE+ CHG, and BIA +
CHA being thus = BAE-- EGH = BAE-- DCA = BDC,
their supplemental   ZIRH    will be equal to the angle contained
in the   segment   BFC,  and the point of intersection R will
therefore be in the circumference of the circle BGCF. Q.E.D.
   The demonstration now given is equally applicable to any
position  of the point G in the circumference, and as the line
drawn through A is also unlimited in position, the point of
intersection R may be either in the same segment with G, or in
the opposite, or in the adjacent segments. Wherever, therefore,
the two points G and R be assumed, if GD GE and RB RC
be joined and the opposite lines produced to meet, that        RB
                                                               is,
with EG and RC with DG, the points             of
                                              intersection and the
point   A     be
           will    alwaysin  the same straight line.
   In like manner   if RD RE and GB GC be drawn, another
set of  intersections willbe  obtained having the point       com
                                                              A
mon     toboth; from any two points, therefore, two sets       of    in
tersections may always    be  had with reference      the same se
                                                         to

                                                    to

                                                     which the       in

  According, therefore, to the number of points R and the
number of secants to which any point G of the inscribed hexa
gon may be referred will be the number of sets of intersections
that can be formed by the figure.—This may be determined

and R may stand with reference to the secants.
   1st. Both points may be within the secants and in opposite
segments.
     2d.                                         within and in the same segment.
   3d. One may be within and the other without.
   4th. Both may be without and in opposite segments.
   5th.               without and in the same segment.
   In the 1st case, G and R will be any two opposite points
of the hexagon, and will form with the secants AB and AC
opposite sides produced two sets of intersections, in which A
will be common to both. Hence 6 will be the whole number
obtained by considering                    all
                             the opposite points with reference
to  the opposite sides; but since IAH must          common                        be                        to

        VERY thing around     living bodies, according to M. Bichat,
       tends constantly to their destruction. And to this influence
they would necessarily yield, were they not gifted with some
permanent principle of reaction. This principle is their life,
and a living system is therefore necessarily always engaged in
the performance of functions, whose object is to resist death.
Life, however, does not consist in a single principle, as has
been taught by some celebrated writers, by Stahl, Van Hel
mont, and Barthez, &c.          We are to study the phaenomena of
Hife as we do those of other matter, and refer the operations
performed in living systems to such ultimate principles as we
                             to,
can trace them            the same way that we

                                                 endowed with certain    be

                                 or                      which are those          of

                         performing the functions upon which the
continuance      of of
                  life depends.      Life, then, according        Bichat,                        to

*    This is his view of life, considered in the most general and
 simple way.           But in carrying the examination further, he
 points out two remarkable modifications of life, as viewed
in different relations, one common both to vegetables and ani
 mals, the other peculiar to animals.                 The vegetable exists en
tirely within itself, and for itself, depending upon other sub
 stances only for the materials of nutrition; the animal, on the
contrary, in addition to this internal life, has another, by which
he connects himself with objects about him, maintains relations
with them, and is bound to them by the ties of mutual depend
ence.      This affords a principle, upon which to form a distinct
classification of our functions.               Those which we have in com
mon with the vegetable, which are necessary merely to our
individual bodily existence, are called the functions of organic
life, because they are common to                                       all
                                                    organized matter. Those,
on the other        hand,     which are       peculiar        animals, which         to                                 in
them are superadded                the possession
                                            to                               of
                                                          the organic functions,
are called the functions                         of
                                        animal life.
    Physiologically speaking, then, we have two lives, the con
currence of which enables us to live and move and have our
being; both equally necessary                                   to

    rest. This rest, with regard to any particular organ, is the
    sleep of that organ; and in proportion to the extent of the
    previous exercise, and the number of organs fatigued, the state
    of repose will be partial or general. Upon this principle
    Bichat founds his theory of sleep.                General sleep is the com
    bination of the sleep of particular organs.                 Sleep then is not
    any definite state, but is a more or less complete rest of the
    whole system in proportion to the number of organs which
    require repose.         The most perfect sleep is that where               the                         all
    functions         of
                      animal life, the sensations, the perception, the
    imagination, the memory, the judgement, locomotion, and
    voice, are suspended; and the various forms                   imperfect sleep     of

 The old man moves with            pain    and   difficulty,  and speaks with
a   thick and      trembling     voice. “Seated near the fire which
warms him, he passes his days concentrated within himself;
estranged from every thing around him, deprived                          desires,                  of

:    perception, by which they become acquainted with the pre
     sence and qualities of the substances applied to them; this is
     the organic sensibility; they have then a property by which
     they react upon these substances, and excite in them motion;
     this is the organic contractility.    It has two modifications.
     1. Where the contraction is insensible, as in the exhalants,
     capillaries, secreting vessels. 2. Where it is sensible, as in
     the heart, the stomach, the intestines, and these are called re
:    spectively, the insensible, and the sensible, organic contractility.
      In the organs of the animal life, there is also a sensibility, by
:    which they are not only made capable of receiving the ini
     pression of an object and                         its

fection, still we appear to have made scarcely any progress to
that end during a period of upwards of twenty years.
    In 1801-2, Mr. Earnshaw deposited two chronometers at
the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, which, on trial, were
pronounced to be scarcely affected even when the thermome
ter was at 28° of Fahrenheit.            For the rate and true per
     º,
formance of these        chronometers,     the Honourable Board of
Longitude awarded to that artist the sum of 3000l.
           the view of attaining to as much perfection in these
invaluable instruments as possible, the Right Honourable the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, in the latter part of
the year 1820, “for the purpose of further encouraging the
improvement of chronometers,” were pleased to publish a no
tice in the Gazette, that a depôt would be established at the
 Royal Observatory at Greenwich, where chronometers would
be received from their respective makers for a year's trial; and
that, at the end of that period, their Lordships would purchase
the chronometer which should have kept the best rate at the
price of 300l., and the second best at 200l.; provided that
 more than ten chronometers should have been submitted to
 competition, and that such chronometer should have kept                                      its
rate within specific limits.
     In consequence       this notification, upwards
                             of                             thirty chro       of
nometers were sent—some                        by
                                       respectable watchmakers, and
 others     by
             practical artists.     During the period, however, al
lotted for the proof         of
                            their respective rates, nearly one half                           of
them were withdrawn from the trial. From the rates published,

40" per day        on

by two excellent artists, and that much pains were bestowed
on their construction, the principle adopted for compensating
the effect of heat and cold is either imperfect and uncertain, or
that their adjustments are not generally understood.
   Without entering, however, into this question at present, it
may not be unimportant to suggest a few hints, which may
ºnly
CIllneS.
            tend to further improvements in these valuable ma
     Inthe first place, no chronometer should be accepted for
trial, that did not bear the name of the artist by whom it was
actually made. . By this means encouragement would be held
out to the practical artisan, as a spur to his exertions; and he
would, if successful, obtain the reward of merit to which he
          j
would be entitled. Whereas, by accepting chronometers from
nominal makers, who may employ skilful workmen, they be
come the ostensible makers of a machine, though they are per
haps actually ignorant of the scientific principles on which it is
constructed.
    In the second place, no chronometer which has been tried
should ever be allowed to be submitted a second time.
    In the third place, and perhaps this is the most important
of all, no chronometer should be submitted for trial, but those
actually made for that purpose; and for which a reasonable
time           only be allowed: and this recommendation is
founded on facts too well known to be called in question.
    Of the chronometers sent to Greenwich, in consequence of
the notification of the Board of Admiralty, scarcely half of
them bore the name of the respective artists by whom they
were actually made; and consequently the very object of at
.#
taining perfection had a chance of being defeated: for, as the

     Had, however,    even one of these chronometers received the
reward, no dependence could have been placed on the same
maker producing another equally good; for it is more than
probable the nominal proprietor was not the actual artist who
constructed           it,
                 and consequently the object            the Board would      of
have been defeated: one individual would have gained                   name                        a
to which         he
              was not entitled, from the ability            the artisan on        of
whom        he
            depended for his work; and the artist himself would
not  only  have been unrecompensed, but another would have
received the reward         his labour, his ingenuity, his perseve
                                         of
rance, and his invention.
   Besides, the same artist might not always                procured;             be                        an
inferior one    might         employed;  be  and   although    the second

     meralt in the Memoirs of the Agricultural Society of Paris,
     for 1789, under the name of Chou d.faucher. It is perfectly *
     intermediate between the Colsa and Chou-navet, and there
     fore to be considered an hybrid between the two races; the
     root is fusiform, slender as in the Colsa, but much longer, the
     stalk is short, like that of the Chou-navet, but not so thick,
     the radical leaves numerous, hispid on the edges, and on the
     nerves underneath; they have a long petiole, and are lyre

elongata might be cultivated with success as an oleiferous
plant.   This species, known by the extraordinary peduncle of
the seed-pod rising above the discus, has several chances of
succeeding; in the first place, it is of a robust nature, and
thrives in tolerably good ground; secondly, it yields seed
abundantly; thirdly,        seed-pods are slow  its   opening, so                               in

Raviole, or Rave; in Italian, Ramolaccio, and Ravanello; in
English, the common garden Radish; it offers the same va
rieties of colour as the preceding race, and has besides a sub
variety of form, which might be more properly termed a varia

     Observations on the Cross-bred Vegetables found among the
                               preceding Plants.
        There is no doubt that many of the plants which                    have              I
     enumerated are the results of different cross-breeds, obtained
     by mere chance in various gardens, and preserved by the care
     of agriculturists.     Having never found an opportunity of
     making such experiments methodically,                       I
                                                          shall content my
     self with  relating   a few facts communicated to me by M. Sa
     geret, who, being an excellent and zealous cultivator, has de
     voted several years to the trial of cross-breeds. The results                                       ".

194        M. De Candolle            on the Species and Varieties
knows, disseminated throughout Europe; but from the con
fusion reigning in their popular and unscientific nomenclature,
it was impossible to know which of these species and varieties
were spoken of on different occasions, so that the experiments
of one country were useless for another, and it was impossible
to deduce any general considerations on the nature of these
vegetables.   In order to apply the classification proposed                          I
shall add two short remarks.      The distinction of the several
varieties once established, we shall find it possible to use terms
of comparison for the different experiments made by cultiva
tors, and more especially for those of Mons. Gaujacº... The

   If we now compare the cruciferous plants together, in a dif
ferent point of view, we shall obtain some curious results on
their organization. Most of them, and perhaps the whole num
ber, are susceptible of two different variations, the one hav.
ing a thin, slender, slightly fleshy root, the other a thick and
fleshy root: in general, those of the first kind bear a consider
able quantity of seeds, and are cultivated throughout Europe
as oleiferous vegetables; the others, on the contrary, bring
few seeds to perfection, and are cultivated in general for their
roots, as excellent for field or garden vegetables.           So in the
Brassica  oleracea,  the varieties  that have a  thin   stalk  are culti
vated for their  seeds, and those that have swelled        radicles  are
reserved for food.     Among the varieties of the Brassica cam
                                    large seeds, appears            emi      be

    Broccoli is an Italian name signifying sprouts, and derived
from Brocco, a stem or sprout (derived by Menage from ver
rucum Lat.): it is also called Cavolo broccoluto, Span. Broculi,
Port. Couve dos Broccos.        This Italian word Broccoli appears
to prevail through            all
                            the countries       Europe, while     of

                                         is      them. The Anglo   to
 Saxons had the word         Spnote   from   Sppaucan     Sppytan,            or         to

“ shield      of protection to designing knavery,” and the practice
of “legerdemain,”           have long          since fallen plump       “to   the
ground.”
     I wouldhere just observe, that timber so tapering that one
diameter is above triple the other, is rarely found in practice.
A tree may occur now and then, having that disparity of dia
meters; but it usually happens that the tree naturally divides
itself by sudden swells into two or more distinct parts, and
consequently must “be measured” duobus vel pluribus frustis.
     I
     will supply the investigation of the principle, as relates to
round timber, to which the abovementioned sliding rule is
adapted.
   Let s denote half the sum, and d half the difference of the
extreme diameters of any tapering piece of timber; l the
length, and p be = 7854.
     hen, the diameters themselves being s--d and s—d, the
formula       3   pl;« (s--d)* + (s—d) +         w('s-H d”   x s—d” = }pl      x

is well known) the true content.          In which (s being the dia
meter at the midlength) pla” is the cylindrical content, and
# pl d” the difference between that and the true content. Now
since 13:5405 in inches, is the diameter of that cylinder whose
length and content in feet are always equal to each other, and
since the contents of cylinders of the same length are in the
duplicate ratio of their diameters; therefore 18'54.05” (the
square of the diameter of the standard cylinder): l (its content)
:: s” (the square of the given diameter): the cylindrical con
tent required; and in the same way 13:54.05"; } l ; ; d”: the

difference, which added to the cylindrical, will give the true
conical content.        Now two logarithmic lines, sliding one
upon the other as in sliding rules, one being of a
radius with respect to the other, will, it is plain, solve these
analogies by an operation as short and easy as in the old
mode; that          is,

       We have also received from Mr. Paul Newton a letter re
 specting Mr. Gutteridge's proposed plan for the measurement

 of timber. He observes, that by this plan “a national advan

 tage is doubtless intended to be              out to us in our maritime
 capacity       Mr. G.'s plan is professedly in favour of the grower.
 Now is not this grower very frequently a Dane, a Norwegian,
 an American, &c.; and is not Mr. G. zealous to enhance the
price of that commodity (timber) for the benefit of the pur
 chaser—the British P           The expense of shipping would be
 greatly augmented on Mr. G's plan.
      “If   our shipping be worth 30 millions, according to our pre
sent mode of measuring and our present price of timber, &c.
this ‘improved                    would compel us (cordage and other
articles in proportionate advance) to pay at least 36 millions for
our wooden walls. Six extra millions would consequently issue
from the Treasury and the purses of our merchants; three
millions of which would, on a moderate computation, pass into
the hands of Danes, Norwegians, and Americans.                    Thus Bri
tons would lose three        millions, in the  single  article of shipping,
from a      regard   to a  foreign  grower.    If it be true, that Great
Britain and Ireland own at            present   about 12,000 merchant
vessels, and employ annually upwards of 4000 foreign vessels,
we may reasonably conclude that, in a few years, from the
adoption of Mr. G.'s method, these numbers, as well as the na
ture of our intercourse with foreign nations, would be reversed;
and      I fear we should in that case transfer those useful parti
tions, the wooden walls, to our neighbours.”

     Note:-Probably, whatever system   of measuring   prevails, the price will
adapt itself to it.—EDIT.

   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
                                                            Nailsworth, March 5, 1823.
IN   M.  our Number for January last, we are informed that
             Deurbroucq and Nichols have taken out a patent
for Madame Gervais' new method of fermentation; namely,
that of fermenting in close vessels.
   I have been in the practice of recommending fermentation
on this principle for several years with the superadded advan
tages   of conducting the process under the influence of a les
sened   or increased pressure on the surface of the fermenting
mass, in order to check       or accelerate the process as may be
required by circumstances and season, because I had found
experimentally that fermentation moved with an accelerated
progress under an attenuated pressure of the atmosphere, and
that an increased density checked and retarded                                 it.
   Hence recommended fermenting
            I                                      close vessels with the

    The strata or spherical shells of the atmosphere increasing
in density the nearer they approach the surface of the earth,
rays of light entering from above and not tending towards the
 centre of these strata, which is also that of the earth, pass
 with varying, obliquity through media, of increasing density,
 and, from the principles of optics, become curves conver
 towards the eye of the observer.     Hence the object is seen in
 the direction of the inferior extremity of the curve, and the
 observed elevation exceeds the true by an angular quantity
 termed astronomical refraction.     When these curves are                                         in
 tercepted by a mountain or other object within the limits of
 the atmosphere, the refraction is denominated terrestrial, and
 bears a certain proportion to the angle formed at the centre
 of the earth between the eye and the object.

     In
the refractions equally between the angles of elevation and

mere approximation, the  -

   So much for theory; let us next learn how far it has been
confirmed by actual experiment.           -
   Delambre informs us, that he found the refraction subject
to great variety, being at one time negative, but states the
 mean at T+3. The angles were measured with the repeating
 circle, which giving the double of the zenith distances cor
 rects the error of collimation and irregularities of the level at
 every pair of observations.

 and others, with the great theodolite of Ramsden, seems to

              with Remarks on terrestrial            Réfraction.            213
orists have consequently insisted upon the propriety of noting
the temperature at the two stations. The experiment has
been tried. At Pendle Hill, 507 feet higher than Rumbles
Moor, the temperature, June 19, 1821, was for several hours
4° or 5° the warmest.         The air was nearly saturated with
moisture, and the refraction, contrary to theory, remarkably
small.    In addition to this fact, the zenith distances of hills at
distances of 30 to 40 miles, although observed in different
years, rarely varied so much as 10".         Hence it is probable
that the diminution of     temperature,   variable as it is without
 doubt on the sides of mountains, may be constant in the greater
 part of the path of the ray.    If   the temperature noted at the
base and summit of the hill where the instrument is used,
 should indicate a decrease of heat different to 1* for every
 200 or 400 feet, the observer must be prepared for an unusual
 refraction, and will do well to repeat the observations the next
 opportunity.    This method is more convenient, and probably
 of more real   utility, than the preceding one. The degree of
 refraction at the nearest extremity of the curve most sensibly
 influences the estimate of the direction of the ray.
   We must next advert to the more considerable and dan
gerous variations which, distorting the ray without the slightest
reference to its extent, have rendered the ratios of the refrac
tion to the arc so inexplicably capricious.                       -
   The diurnal variation of refraction, of which the effects have
been described in my last, is without doubt the principal yet
unforeseen cause of these apparent anomalies.          Within the
range of my observations, I may describe it as being peculiar
to certain periods of the year, generally from the middle of
January to that of June. In the course of the three first
months of last year, strange to tell, it was only once percepti
ble at the Observatory, the apparent elevation of Rumbles
 Moor scarcely varying 8" during the whole period. The ex
 cepted observation was on a frosty day, nearly the only one
 during the winter.     At Rumbles Moor, June 12, 1821, the
variation was    nearly  at a maximum.     May 28, 1822, the an
 gles were constantly the same from noon till within an hour
 of sunset, when the refractions, as is usually the case, suddenly
 increased 10".    Unable as I am efficiently to account for the
 cause of the diurnal variation, yet as               its
                                               effects are greatest
 upon angles nearest       tothe ground  immediately   around the

  XLVII.       Supplementary Table for computing the Precession
     and Nutation of the Fired Stars. By F. BAILY, Esq. F.R.S.
     and L.S.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal,
        your Magazine for October last, I alluded to some new
  INtables    of Aberration and Nutation which had been com
 puted under the direction of M. Schumacher, and inserted by
 him in his Astronomische Hilfstafeln for 1822. Tables for
 the computation of those quantities are of constant use to the
 practical astronomer: but, it must be evident, to those who are
 acquainted with the principles on which M. Schumacher's
tables are constructed, that the values denominated A and B
(which are confined to the Precession and Nutation) require
to be calculated every year. M. Schumacher, however, has
given them only for the years 1819–1822; which renders the
general tables, to which they refer, of little or no use at the
present time.             -                                 -
    In order to    remedy   this temporary     defect,  I  have computed
(for my own use) the logarithms of A and B for the years
 i823 and 1824: and as they may probably be of service to
some of your readers, and perhaps render the adoption of
M. Schumacher's tables more general, I have sent them for
insertion in your Magazine.            f   should remark that, in the
                I
value of B, have included the quantity denoted by +08768
cos 2 g, in order that the total result may accord with those
deduced from the rigorous formula given by M. Bessel.

to reach the distance of two hundred miles, and consequently
would be high water at the Land's End exactly at the time set
down in the Tide-table. Now if it should be found that, at the
distance of more than two hundred miles from the Land's
End, ships are in the habit of striking soundings, it would be
evident that my theory was erroneous; but if they cannot get
soundings in any part of the world, at those distances from                                               É.
shore where my theory indicates the tides are produced, this
circumstance will amount to a demonstrative proof that my
theory must be true: for it is morally impossible that a false
theory can always be right by chance.
   Again, I have proved (fig. 1) that, if the waters were lifted
up by pressure, the elevation would be equal to only the fall;
whereas, you have acknowledged yourself, and the fact is easily
proved, that it ought to be at least twice as great. Let us now
see whether my theory of expansion will account for this phae
nomenon; and if it will, in what way can you account for a false
theory’s corresponding, in every particular, with the phaeno
mena in question? Let                        LM

ocean, with the moon vertical at M, or, rather, about two de

                          the waters gradually lifted         ex                             up

   If you will not allow the power of the moon's attraction at
the earth's surface to be so much as my theory requires, you
at least cannot prove that it is not; and, in that case, the only
fair way to determine the question is to ascertain which of the
two theories comes nearest the truth.     By comparing the di<U+017F>
ference between the high-water marks at spring and neap tides,
with the difference between the low-water marks, it is easy to
ascertain what proportion the elevation bears to the fall.
if there should be no difference between the rise and the fall, it
                                                                                                            N.
will be evident that the tides must be produced by pressure:
and not by expansion; if the elevation should exceed the fall
in a very trifling degree, the effect produced by expansion
must be equally trifling; but                 believe     the case, the
                                                           if,      I                           is

of these tabular circles, in connection with the others of
Mr. Goodwyn's Tables; by itself, this volume may sometimes
prove of important use, in abridging the labour of very long

fully found the quotient to 8 or 10 places of figures (but some
times a less number may suffice); then, by comparing the same
with the several circles here set down under the given divisor,
the peculiar succession of several of the last digits, in the quo
tient, and of others in the table, being found the same, will
mostly detect the particular circle, applicable to the case, and
also the digit of the quotient, found by actual division, as above,
whereat the circulating or repetend part of the quotient be
gins; and then, by help of such tabular circle, any further
required number of places in the quotient can be supplied,

   TURRITELLA Lamarck: a genus including such Turbines of the Linnaean
school as have a very long attenuated spire, and an entire oval mouth.
CHITON. It is almost inconceivable how Linnaeus could have associated this
genus with the Multivalves, placing it the first in his system, and Patella
nearly the last. This wide separation of two genera, so closely allied to
each other, can only be accounted for by the obligation he felt of adhering
to the rules of his artificial system. PLANAxis: a new genus (and we think
very unnecessary one) recently made from Buccinum. CRANLA: a group of
strangely formed Bivalves, allied to Anomia of Linnaeus, and remarkable for
the similarity which their interior valves bear to a human skull.  BALANus:
to which genus Mr. S. has also attached that of Acasta (Leach). NERI
TINA: it is our opinion that the only ground for separating the marine
from the fluviatile Nerits, must rest on the difference of their respective
animals.    Mr. Sowerby remarks that the river shells have no teeth, yet he
figures one with remarkably large, and another with small crenated teeth;
moreover, the teeth in his Navicella altavillensis (which he now refers to
this genus) are still more prominent. On the whole, therefore, we think
this genus is objectionable.     It can never be understood by the generality
of conchologists, who have not the opportunity of studying the animals of
these two genera, and ascertaining their respective distinctions.

Begonia argyrostigma, a plant of recent introduction to our gardens, and                re
markable for the fine red colour of the underside of its leaves, whilst their
upper surface, which is of a deep green, is studded with silver-like spots.

Mr. Sabine now proposes to separate these plants as distinct

specific character:       “C. foliis coriaceis petiolatis sinuato

   The separation seems                   be

graphical and geological description of the coast and islands
of Lake Huron in           America. The greater part of the

Manitouline islands, which stretch nearly across the centre of
the lake, with the southern coast, are entirely composed of
secondary calcareous formations.        To this paper is subjoined
a Map   of Lake   Huron,    and Plates illustrative of the organic
remains which are contained in great abundance in the lime

   March 21. A Paper was read, entitled “Observations on
the Belemnite.” By    J.  S. Miller, Esq. A.L.S. Communicated
by the Rev. W. D. Conybeare, M.G.S.
   The author commences this paper with an historical sketch
of the various opinions which have been entertained with re
gard to the belemnite, and of the works of those naturalists
who have treated of that fossil.       He enumerates the various
names which     ignorance    or  superstition  assigned to it in the
earlier periods;   and  lastly, the almost   equally discordant and
imperfect theories which have been successively advanced on
the same subject by writers of a more recent date.        Mr. Miller
then offers his own   opinion   on the  original  structure and na
ture of this organic body, and adds the reasons and the ex
periments which have led him to his conclusions.            He con
siders the belemnite to have been an animal of the       Cephalopo
dous division of the Mollusca, inhabiting a fibrous, spathose,
conical shell, divided into chambers connected by a siphun
                                            jºi
culus, and beyond which shell extended a protecting guard or
sheath. Mr. Miller refers the internal radiated texture to its
original organic structure, and not to any subsequent process
of crystallization.    To this paper is                 an enumera
tion and description of the various species of belemnites, ac            -
companied by plates illustrative of their form and structure.

      HE   sloop Paulina-Julia, Capt. D. A. Tooker, has arrived
     in 32 days from St. John's (Spanish Main). By Mr. Cooke,
one of the passengers, we learn that on Sunday the 1st of
December, the city of Grenada was visited by a tremendous
earthquake, which cracked the walls of most of the houses,
and overthrew some of the stone crosses before the churches.
Most of the tiles were shattered and stripped from the roofs
of the houses. Its effects were felt eight leagues distant. Two
or three shocks were felt every day for a week, but the first
was the heaviest, and commenced at day-light. Our informant
states that he was up, and went to the front door, where he
observed the church, which was opposite, filled with persons

natives of the East incited to follow up researches into        #.
own history, literature, and antiquities, and animated by the
spirit of improvement which has already begun to manifest
itself among them.
                   STEAM NAVIGATION TO INDIA.
   Extensive arrangements have been formed, with the concur
rence of Government, for the establishment of steam vessels
to convey passengers and light goods from this country to
Grand Cairo. The Pashaw of Egypt has engaged to have
from two to three hundred camels always in readiness to fa
cilitate the communication from Cairo to Suez, and from
Suez to Cairo, and that the expense shall not exceed five shil
lings per hundred weight.       Similar arrangements have been
made for the    passage  from Suez to Surat, and other places.
                            FRUIT TREES.
    The  growth   of weeds round fruit trees recently transplanted,
does them much injury, and diminishes their fruit in size and
quality. Sonnini, in his Biblioth. Physico-econom.,      states that,
to prevent this, the Germans spread on the ground round the
fresh transplanted trees, as far as their roots extend, the refuse
stalks of flax, after the fibrous part has been separated. This
gives them surprising vigour. . No weeds will grow under flax
refuse, and the earth remains fresh and loose.
    Old trees treated in the same manner, when languishing in
an orchard, will recover, and push out vigorous shoots.
    In place of the flax stalks, the leaves which fall from trees
in autumn may be substituted; but they must be covered with
waste twigs, or any thing else that can prevent the wind from    -
blowing them away.

            Obituary.—Mr. Sowerby's Museum.—Patents.                      239
              OBITUARY.          — Lieut.-Col. WILFORD.
     The community of letters in the East have sustained a great
loss by the death of Lieut.-Colonel Wilford, who expired of
debility at Benares, on the 3d September, 1822. This emi
nent scholar has been long celebrated as a most learned and
indefatigable cultivator of the Asiatic History and Literature
of the Hindoos. He was one of the earliest members of the
Asiatic Society, and soon distinguished himself by his contri
butions to their researches; his extensive erudition and un
wearied diligence received the highest encomiums from Sir               Wil
liam Jones, and secured the favourable notice of Warren Has
tings, by whose encouragement Lieut. Wilford was induced
to address his whole attention to those studies to which he
perseveringly devoted the rest of his life.
                         MR. sowe RBY’s MUSEUM.
    tº     We feel much satisfaction in announcing that the late
Mr. Sowerby's Museum of the natural productions of Great
Britain, No. 2, Mead Place, Lambeth, is again opened for
the inspection of his friends and the lovers of natural history,
every Tuesday, from eleven till four o'clock, under the direc
tion of his sons and executors, James de Carle Sowerby, F.L.S.
and Charles Edward Sowerby.

       GENTLEMEN,
       INCE  the discovery of electro-magnetism by Professor
      CErsted *, much new and valuable information has been
given to the scientific world by the united labours of various
philosophical gentlemen on this very interesting subject. But
                                                                                             i.
from the apparent anomalies attending some experiments, a
difference of opinion has been advanced by persons possessing
great depth of penetration as well as considerable experimental
knowledge: for it must be acknowledged that, from some ex
periments, it appeared as though the wire connecting the zinc
and copper plates of a Voltaic apparatus possessed
poles on        its
               opposite sides. But      order        satisfied re
                                                              in             to      be

needle: and the above arrangement of my apparatus enabled
me to investigate the subject more accurately than I formerly
could, the results of which I now submit to the perusal of
the readers of your Magazine.

or repulsion, as applicable to the perpendicular or horizontal
wire, I do not mean a deviation of only three or four degrees,
but that of a whole revolution.

   And as similar effects are produced on the opposite side of
the equator of the needle (but with this difference, that attrac
tion is produced instead of repulsion, and vice versä), the
needle must possess at least sixteen poles.                                         -

rection to what would have been produced by a right-handed
One.
   Ithink this contrary spiracular circulation of the fluid, when
proceeding from opposite poles of a Voltaic apparatus, will
account for the attraction of parallel wires when proceeding
from Voltaic poles similarly situated; but repelled when pro
ceeding from poles dissimilarly situated, for then the circula
tion of the fluids round the wires will be opposite to each other,
and of course will repel. This may be illustrated by placing
a left- and right-handed helix parallel to each other; for so                                    si
tuated, the direction of these coils will be seen to be opposite
to each other; which will represent the course of the fluid
round parallel wires proceeding from poles oppositely situated.
   The apparatus which                   I
                                made use of to produce the effects
on the needle consists of a copper vessel A B C D, fig. 12,
two feet deep, upwards of twenty-two inches broad, and nearly
two inches and a half wide, in which is placed a plate of
zinc E F, twenty-three inches deep, and full twenty inches
broad, with a wire L proceeding from the zinc, and another
wire K attached to the copper, on which I can slip horizontal,
perpendicular, and helix wires. The vessel holds about six gal
lons of diluted acid, which added to the weight of the zinc
plate (a quarter of a cwt.) renders it too heavy to decant the
fluid. It is therefore provided with a cock, by which the diluted
acid can be drawn off without any labour. When this apparatus
was fresh charged with nitro-sulphuric acid twelve times                                         di
luted,    its

observed, that         I
                 considered a similar difference was produced
by the wire connected with the copper end of a Voltaic ap

the zinc end.          I

LIV.    Queries relative to the Mode of using M. Schum AcHER's
               Tables of Aberration and Nutation.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
         lover of astronomy must feel obliged to your cor
EVERY
  respondent, Mr. F. Baily, for the many valuable commu
nications with which he continues from time to time to enrich
your pages.       The Supplemental Table in your last Number,
which, in conjunction with others of M. Schumacher, serves
for computing the precession and nutation of a number of
fixt stars, will doubtless be duly appreciated by those ob
servers who are enabled to avail themselves of the assistance
it offers.     Iam sorry to say, that at present I am not amon
that number.        Owing to my imperfect knowledge of the Ger
man    language,         I
                     am not certain that I understand the account
the author       É. given of the formation of these tables; and as
he has added no example of the manner in which they are to
be used,   I  feel considerable doubt as to the method of apply
ing them in particular cases: for instance, it is customary in
using tables of this kind, in leap-years, to add one day before
the 29th of February, or to subtract one after.             Is this the
case here 2     Again;    Do the tables   give the corrections for the
noon of each day? But another, and more perplexing doubt
arises, as to the days themselves.        The tables profess to give
the  logarithms     necessary  for finding   the corrections for every
tenth   day;   that      for January
                             is,           10, 20, &c. But what

out of the Nautical Almanack the longitude of the earth (allow
ing for the constant of aberration 20", and also the lunar
equation contained in the longitude of the sun), and the                                                                            di
stance of the sun; proceed direct to the right ascension and
declination of the planet. These latter for the ephemeris at
midnight may be easily found by interpolation.
   The following are two observations of Vesta, made on the
meridian, which happen to be convenient to find the apparent
opposition of the planet.

23° 27' 53”-0 for the apparent obliquity of the ecliptic;
whence the above will be found the geocentric longitude and
latitude: the opposition appears to be, on June 15th, at 22"
48° 59'"2 mean time, in longitude 264° 39' 3”.4; latitude
N. 4° 18'53"-8. Applying 9' 20", for the difference of the
meridians of Paris and Blackheath, will show the opposition
to have taken place at Paris on June 15th, 22° 58'19", being
4' 50" later than the time given by Professor Encke.
   These different results will appear in the following com

LVII.      On the Cause            of the Magnetic Power of the Poles of the
                            Earth.     By WILLIAM DoBBIE.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
                                                                   Glasgow,   Feb. 20, 1823.
THE  following communication on the discovery of the cause
  of the magnetic power of the poles of the earth is at your
service,       if you judge it       worthy of a place in the Philosophical -
Magazine.
    In an Essay on the aurora borealis inserted in the Number
for September 1820, one circumstance relating to those phae
nomena is unnoticed, being either unknown or not thought of
by me at the time (1816) that it was first written.     The fact
alluded to is the agitation of the magnetic   needle  during   the
exhibition of those lights; which fact, I presume, is established
by several observers, and has induced such to consider mag
netism as the cause of those appearances. The above fact,
I  confess, if it had occurred to me at the time, I could not have
accounted for on the principle I assumed; but that circum
stance would not have shaken my confidence as to the general
cause, it being too manifest to be affected by one fact unex
plained.
     A curious discovery made by Professor Moriccheni of
 Rome, probably about the same time the above-mentioned
paper was written, throws much unexpected light not only on
this subject, but on other still more interesting phaenomena.
The fact discovered                is,
                             that the violet rays      the prismatic      of
spectrum possess         magnetizing power.
                               a               This    extraordinary
discovery clearly points out the connexion between the polar
lights and magnetism; and also lays open the mystery              the                         of
 earth's  magnetism,    together with the deviation     the magnetic          of
from the true meridian,                  as

     to  an inconceivable extent; we have a right to infer that the
     earth itself is magnetized by the very same means as the needle
     in the above experiment.            The road to this inference is so
     direct, that to convince, it seems only necessary to point it out.
        It seems self-evident that the magnetic power cannot reside
     in water either in a fluid or solid state; and it is probable
     that it cannot be transmitted through the waters of the ocean,
     and therefore will reside where the land predominates within
     the arctic circle; and also for this further reason, that it is
     there the ice naturally assumes those forms best adapted for
     decomposing the sun's rays: hence, where this power of de
     composing the light is chiefly concentrated, the magnetic pole
     will probably be found. The prevalence of land at the north
     over that of the south pole is evidently, for these reasons, at once
     the general cause of the positive magnetism of the former, and
     the frequency and splendour of the aurora proceeding from                                              it,

  256                  Altitudes     of Moºntains,        &c. visible     from
 the utmost skill of the observer to produce consistent results:
 yet     I
         am at a loss to conceive how                       I
                                            should have estimated
 the error at 25", unless, as in the case of the proof level, I had
 erroneously noted the double of the quantity.     By referring to
 the preceding list of refractions it will be evident, that as the
 refractions for the smaller arcs are in general considerably in
 excess, the constant error of the instrument must have been
 sensibly over-rated.
    The subjoined list of refractions, determined (with few ex
 ceptions) in the course of last year, will require some little ex
 planation.
        The stations are arranged in  the order of their altitude
 (which is affixed), and are followed by the date, time, and num
 ber of observations, together with sundry meteorological re
 marks.
     The first column contains the initials of the stations ob
 served:—the second, the particular object of pointure:—the
 third, the arc:-the fourth, the number of observations:—the
jifth, the refraction resulting from the difference of the true
  and observed angle:–the sixth, the bearings of the stations:—
  the seventh, the difference of altitude as deduced by making
 use of one half of the sum of the observed refractions, or of
  1-18th when the observations were not reciprocal.         The last
 column gives the difference corrected in the manner described
  in my last.
     An asterisk(*) prefixed to a refraction denotes that it is sup
 posed to exceed the meanf (1-18th) in consequence of the
 mountain observed being flat or slightly rounded.
     When the ground was not the object of pointure, the re
 fractions appear to have been in most cases remarkably small.
 They are distinguished by a prefixed +.
     In the direction of the earcess of matter the zenith distance
 will be measured too great, and the refractions will fall short
 of     its
         mean value.     By using       mean quantity
                                                 a       calculation           in
 the determined differences                of
                                   altitude will be     defect,   in          in             or

 station itself.           In
                      cases that admit       little       of
                                                      no doubt, the      or
 mark       denotes that the
              +              plumb-line    will have been deflected
 towards the object observed. The mark           indicates   defect  —                  a

 same canal.        The observed depression was 5° 17'49", and the
 elevation    5°16'33";     the fall is consequently 798% feet; the
 bridge is 16% feet above the canal, and the latter 355 feet high.
 Hence the altitude of the fell is 1170 feet.
    PENDLE HILL was observed to be 1823 feet above the sea
near Lytham, September 24, 1821, at O' 20" P. M. The fall
 to low water would be about eight feet, giving 1831 feet for
 the altitude of the hill.
    At INGLEBoRough, June 14, 1822, at 4" P. M. very careful                f
 observations of the depression of the sea in front of Peel Castle
    ve 2380 feet for the height of the mountain above low water,
 at 3' 15"; the observation being made from the old building to
 the W.S.W. determined the altitude at 2385 feet. At 2h 50m
 P. M. the depression of the sea, apparently at the same distance
as the Castle, gave 2371 feet for the altitude. Lancaster church
tower was determined to be 2142% feet below the highest part
of the mountain *. The tower is 155 feet 3 inches above the
canal at Hest Bank, at which place the fall to the channel of
the river Keer at low water, January 29, 1823, was found by
levelling to be 76 feet 6 inches. At Glasson dock, S.W. of
Lancaster, the canal is considered to be 80 feet above low wa
ter mark at spring tides.—If we call it 78 feet, the consequent
altitude of Ingleborough will be 2876, and the mean of the
four observations will be 2378 feet. June 13th at 5' 5", P. M.
the nearest point of Chapel Isle (near Ulverston) was observed
from the station to be depressed 68' 37"; and on the 17th at
11" A. M. 68' 32"—distance not yet ascertained.                I have sup
posed high water to take place at Peel Castle at 5' 18" P. M.
and that it would be 25 feet above low water mark.                At Hest
Bank the fall was        29,  feet, and the time of     high  water 0" 44"

     To take advantage of this spherical curvature for my                                     pre
sent purpose, lay level, at the level of the sea, in a

due east and west, say one mile of cast-iron inch pipe; let each
end have a knee bending upwards, terminating above ground
in a faucette or locket, into each of which cement a glass tube :
these tubes for distinction's sake I call A and B; fill the whole
length of pipe with some homogeneous fluid, say water, until
it rises a few inches in the said tubes. Place a
of brass about 36 inches    long, truly level, at the same

the surface of the water in tube A. In looking along this
straight edge, or by means of a level micrometered telescope,
the line of vision will lead, not to the surface of the water in the
distant tube B, but 8 inches higher up. This experiment will
prove, that the amount of the earth's convexity in 1 mile is
8 inches; were the pipe to be 2 miles long, the convexity
would be 32 inches; 3 miles, 72 inches; 4 miles, 128 inches;
5 miles, 199 inches; 10 miles, 796 inches, and so on: any of
these inch numbers may    - be
                                adopted as the unit.      would pre              I

     In       1    mile,     the   unit of        8 inches is found 7920 times.
 .   In       2    miles,    the   unit of 32       inches is found 3960 times.
      In      3    miles,    the   unit of 72       inches      is   found 2640 times.
     In       4    miles,    the   unit of 128      inches      is   found 1980 times.
     In      5     miles,    the   unit of 199      inches      is   found 1592 times.
     In     10     miles,    the   unit of 796      inches      is   found 796 times.
     It
      is a curious coincidence, that the earth's convexity in 10
miles or 633,600 inches is 663 feet, or 796 inches: were this
last number adopted as the unit, there would be just 796 of
them in the 10 miles; in other words, the convexity is a 796th
part of that lineal distance.                        -
                             How    to reproduce the        Unit,     if lost.
   Suppose a person were to be deprived of all kinds of mea
 sures whatever; how could he without them find out the exact
length of 6 feet, and the exact distance of 3 miles?       Answer:
 He would first lay his pipe as near to 3 miles as possible. This
he could approximate, by making for himself a wooden fathom
measure or rod the length of his outstretched arms. To prove
its correctness,              he
                     would place     vertically just above the sur
                        B,            from A,      if it

2640     these approximated fathoms, his straight line        vision                   of
led exactly     the upper end
                        to         top            or       of
                                           the rod under examina

    diameter is to the interior diameter; nearly as 112 is to 51, or
    a proportion more easily remembered, as 11 : 5." .
        While occupied by the above inquiry, Mr. Girard says he
    was naturally led to resume the question of the resistance of
    conduit pipes to the pressure of the water in them, a question
    which gave occasion for the researches which Mariotte made
    on the resistance of solids and to the hypothesis he substituted
    for that of Galileo #.
        Mariotte made some experiments on the resistance of pipes
    of lead, and tinned iron, from which he deduced a practical
    rule for determining the thickness: but, continues Mr. Girard,
    that rule is not founded on strict demonstration; and though
    the occasion of applying theory usefully to this particular
    case of the resistance of bodies, presents itself frequently,
:   no geometer, at least to his knowledge, has yet investigated it
     with the necessary strictness.
        In assigning practical rules, he observes, we should always
     calculate the resistance for the most unfavourable circum
     stances; since the excess of force which this mode leads us to
    give to bodies, only causes small inconveniences when they are
     not destined to form some of the moving parts of a machine.
        Hence he supposes the pipe to be cylindrical, in a hori
     zontal position, and closed at the ends by two plates adhering
     to the perimeter of the pipe.
.       He also supposes the pipe to be filled with a fluid which
                                                     all

    Mr. Girard next states that he has in the above calculation
omitted the effect of the ends of the boiler, and supposing them
to be separated in the direction of their diameters at the same
time as the cylinder, and to be of the same thickness, the
linder being 2 metres in length, each of them would be capable.                                               §:
of resisting a pressure of steam equal to about 450 atmospheres.
    And in general, he observes, we may regard the resistance
of boilers at their ends as infinite in regard to their resistance
according to their length; and that they ought not to break in
the plane of the axis, but according to a line of double curva
ture traced on the cylindric surface”, of such a nature that,

 of a plane, which is a tangent to the cylinder and parallel to                                               its
axis, and that sum         the products being taken from the middle

    Encke used only the German observations. . After various
    trials he found that he could not obtain any parabola that would
    represent them within three minutes, and the error was much
    greater in the early observations made at Marseilles, being
:   above thirty minutes in right ascension, and six minutes in
    declination; a sure indication that the orbit varied much from a
    parabola, and that it was necessary to notice    elliptical form.      its
       After some-preliminary calculations, Prof. Encke assumed
    the following elliptical elements      the orbit        of

   The near      agreement   of these elements with those of the
comet of 1819 made Professor Encke feel confident that it
was the same comet.        This discovery having been communi
cated to Dr. Olbers, led him to a further investigation of the
subject; and he, with his usual sagacity and promptness, im
mediately perceived and gave the information to Professor
Bode, that it had also appeared in 1786 and in 1795.

*     On the 17th and 19th of July 1786, this comet was observed
    in the constellation Aquarius by Messrs. Messier and Me
    chain.     These two observations are not sufficient to determine
    the elements, three being the least number that can possibly
    be used.   No notice is therefore taken of it in Delambre's
    table. It appears however from the above elements of Encke's
    comet, that it must have been near the perihelion about the
    31st of January 1786, and the calculations of Professor Encke
    confirm those of Dr. Olbers, proving that the following ele

       It may be observed that other elements may be found, which
    will also satisfy these two observations; but as these elements
    vary but little from those found for Encke's comet in 1795,
     1805 and 1819, there can be no doubt that it was the same. ,
       To compare these results together, we must allow for the
    precession of the equinoxes during the intervals of the succes
    sive appearances.      Reducing them       therefore       all

       These elements agree   remarkably well with each other, es
    pecially  when we          into consideration that the disturbing
    forces   ofthe  planets  have been wholly neglected          making                       in
    the calculations.    Three revolutions of the comet have been
    completed        in
                   each        of
                             the intervals between 1786, 1795 and
    1805; and four revolutions between 1805 and 1819.             Hence
    it follows that the periodical revolution      about one thousand
                                                                    is
    two hundred and five days, which        rather less than that
                                                      is             the                                    of
    newly discovered planets.         In
                                       the perihelion     passes  within            it

                                         at             about mid-way           is
    between the orbits         of
                            these small planets and that      Jupiter.                    of
                                                                                                            From

280                                  On Encke's Comet.
   From these elements it would follow that if the comet pass
the perihelion between the months of October and February,
it would appear, upon                 its
                             approach towards the earth,     much                                     so

   To determine with precision the time and place when the
comet will next appear, would require              complete calculationa
of the  disturbing   forces     all theofplanets  upon   the comet from
the year 1795         1822. The methods

    LXIV.    Sketch of a Course of Lectures on Metallurgy, deli
       wered at the London Institution, February 1823.   By John
h      TAYLOR, Esq. Treasurer of the Geological Society.
i      N some lectures delivered on a former occasion in the Lon
        don Institution, Mr. Taylor had described the general
    position of the ores of the various metals in the earth, and ex
    plained the processes which are used in mining to obtain them.
     He now proposed to carry on the subject by giving a descrip
    tion of the metals themselves, or of those which are of most
.   importance in an oeconomical point of view,-some account of
    the rocks and countries which produce their ores; and then
º   to treat of the modes by which the metals are extracted and
    rendered into their perfect state, fitted for the purposes of the
    arts, and converted into their various forms or compounds.
       The only metals known to the ancients were seven: namely,
    gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, lead, and mercury.
       But this list has been gradually extended; and of late years
    especially, the researches of chemists have added, many to the
    number. We may accordingly now enumerate as many as 40,
    of which the knowledge of a considerable number results from
    the brilliant discovery of our countryman Sir Humphry Davy
    —that substances hitherto taken to be elementary, were but
    oxides of metals, before unknown as such : and thus the bases
    of some alkalies and several earths are perfectly ascertained
                                                                          beof.
    to belong to the class of substances now to be treated
    These latter, and indeed some others, are only however           to

    inquiry, which relates principally       the practical treatment
                                             to
    and uses of the metals.

their polished surfaces exhibit; and which, from     bein                               its

the metallic lustre.
     The next remarkable property                       of   metals        is    their opacity,

        The specific gravity in metals is different in those which
    are merely fused or cast, and in those which are hammered or
    laminated, by which they become more consolidated, and con
    sequently heavier.
        The fusibility of metals is a property that eminently con
    tributes to their usefulness; for without this it would be im
    possible to separate them from the earths and other impurities
    with which they are naturally mixed; not to mention the vast
    advantage of producing useful forms by the simple operation
    of casting into moulds of any required shape. . . The range of
    temperature at which various metals become fluid, extends from
     the highest degree that our furnaces can produce, to a degree
    of cold hardly ever occurring naturally.
        Thus, platina is scarcely fusible in the greatest furnace heat;
        Iron and some others require an intense white heat;
        Gold, silver, and copper, a bright red or low white heat;
        Antimony, a low red heat; and tin, bismuth, lead, and zinc,
     melt from about 450° Fahrenheit, to a temperature just under
     a red heat;-
        While mercury is fluid unless it be in a state of cold equal
     to about 40° below zero.
        At certain heats several of the metals may be volatilized, or
     driven off in the state of vapour; and it is not improbable that
     all may      be
                  so,   we could raise the temperature high enough.

                      dense fumes.
         Mercury, arsenic, antimony and zinc, are highly volatile.
         Lead, tin and bismuth, are less so, but are evaporated                           in
         strong fire;—while gold, silver, copper and iron, are not

   The metal of the greatest malleability is gold, which may
be beaten into leaves so thin, that they will float in the air like
a feather. Silver may be reduced to nearly the same state of
tenuity.  Gold leaf is estimated at a thickness of little more
than the three-hundred-thousandth of an inch.        Silver leaf is
about the hundred-and-sixty-thousandth.         After these may be
ranked in the following order, copper, tin, lead, iron, and

be made somewhat hotter than boiling water. The other
malleable metals are platina, palladium, nickel, and mercury.

   It might at first sight appear that the ductility of metals
would            the same order as their malleability, both pro
perties being merely a mode of extension; but it is evident
that the ductility of a substance is compounded of           mallea                       its
bility and tenacity. Hence iron, though             means       mal    by   no                  so
leable    as

the uses we make           them,   of
                                  and the    operations  for making

substances.
   By   thefirst affinity they unite together, forming mixed metals
called alloys      amalgams.
                     or           By the second they combine che

   From the properties                  of
                            the metals, we are naturally led                                         to
consider their uses, and the means                     by

    prized articles: while in the history of the civilized world, we
    may observe that metallurgic processes were greatly esteemed
    and eagerly pursued, and proficients in the art by which the
    metals were worked were honoured for their knowledge and
    enriched by their skill.
       The metals will appear upon the slightest consideration of
    the subject to form a principal ingredient in most operations
    conducive to our comfort, amusement, or improvement. With

     Copper affords us many valuable alloys; as with zinc,
 brass;–with tin, gun-metal, bell-metal or bronze, and specu
 lum metal;-with tin and lead, pot-metal".
     Tin alloyed with lead forms the common solder used by

 plumbers; —and also with a proportion of antimony and a
 small quantity of lead gives pewter.
           and antimony form type metal, which has the requi -

    Shot is made of lead mixed with a small quantity of arsenic.

  the bed of the river Thames to be proportionally deepened;
  the bridges west of London bridge which have been erected
  with relation to the present bed of the river, which do not
  stand upon piles, may fall suddenly to ruin, by being under
  mined; and those which do stand upon piles may remain so
  much longer as the piles, then become stilts, retain their holds.
  It will therefore be prudent, on the part of the City, if Lon
  don bridge be taken down, to reserve the materials of the star

       The last in this interesting  collection is a Tract on the Prin
    ciples of Pendent Bridges, with references to the properties of

          The difficulty and tardiness with which the transactions of
    foreign Societies make their way to this country, and the
    comparative ignorance in which we consequently remain re
    specting the discoveries of the more active continental labourers
    in the field of zoology, is a subject of much regret and em
    barrassment to the British naturalist. There are several societies
    in Berlin, Vienna, and other European and trans-atlantic capi
    tals, expressly formed for the cultivation of this science, and
    supported by the contributions of eminent men, active and
    zealous in the investigation of                             its
                                         various branches; but their
    writings come                  to          by
                             chance, and sometimes after lapse

    years. An unaccountable negligence           this point pervades           on
    arches each 132 feet span; and 500 feet         length    that bridge might haveof
    been saved; and       that case, the whole

       mse would have been saved also: for the descent would have terminated
      00 feet nearer the river.    The middle arch would then have been          the                       in

    We think the abstract we have now given of these inter

the zoologists and men of science in this country. . It ap
     rs to come out in monthly numbers; but how such a long
interval has elapsed between the printing of the concluding
part of the first volume (which is dated 1818) and the com
mencement of the third (which was published in July 1822),
we cannot divine.          The booksellers are, Dobson in Philadel

               Sowerby's Genera of Shells.        No. 13, 14.
    HIPPopus Lam.: a genus formed of the Linnaean Chama Hi                , to
which Mr. Sowerby has added what he conceives to be another species,
 named by him H. avicularis, but he has not subjoined a specific character;
 and it appears to us doubtful, whether this shell should not rather have
been placed as a Cardium. Clav AGELLA Lam.: a recent species of this genus
is here, for the first time, announced and figured by the name of C. aperta,
and an outline of Lamarck's C. echinata is likewise given on the same plate.
Omercula: from the remarks on this, it appears Lamarck has formed his
genus Discina from some specimens of Orbicula Norvegica sent him by the
author! In fact, we know not where the present system of genus-making
will terminate, for “the doctors” begin to be puzzled by their own genera!"
PAam AcELLA of Cuvier: the shell of which covers only a portion of the
animal, and resembles a Linnaean Limpet. OTIon, Leach: the type of which,
is Lepas aurita Linn. CINARAs : another genus of Linnaean Barnacles (or
Cirripedes of the moderns) formed from the L. villosa of Linn., a shell:
                                                                               -

except in having the imperforate Earshells removed to another family. Three
species are figured.     RotelLA : separated by Lamarck from the Trochi, the
type of which is Trochus vestiarius (Linn.). Avicula, Lamarck: accompa
nied by the description and figure of a new and beautiful species, A.aculeata,
thus defined: “testà obliquá oblongá, aculeata, aculeis compressis subim
bricatis, confertiusculis, subdepressis; cauda longiore spinifera;” the term
caudá, however, is quite inadmissible as applied to the winged process in   bi
valve shells, for the same term is used to express the base of univalves.
Mr. Swainson has judiciously termed this part linea cardinalis. Ancylus: a
genus including the fresh-water Limpets. AchATINA : with which is united .

worth: here called a dwarf variety of the common Cactus Opuntia. We                 al
most think this may turn out a distinct plant from that now become indige
nous in the south of Europe; the spines of which are always three in each
fasciculus, near an inch long, and more horny than setaceous. The Mediter
ranean plant, moreover, is erect, and not prostrate.    Hyoscyamus niger (var.
3. annua): we concur with Dr. Sims in thinking this a simple variety.        Pe
rilla ocymoides: the figure is particularly well designed; but the want of
outline dissections is doubly felt from the minute size of the flowers. Pl. 2396
represents the same species of Berberis as we have before noticed in the
Botanical Register; but it is here called B. fascicularis. In the adoption of
specific names, priority should be an invariable guide, a rule decidedly
against the name here followed. The arguments on the instability of                 Ma
honia as a genus, are the same as those we have before alluded to.       Crinum
angustum, a lovely plant, beautifully figured.    The initials of W. H. lead us

cing C. angustum as a variety of C. amabile we before alluded to, in our re
marks on that Number of the Botanical Register wherein this has been done;
Mr. Herbert's remarks on the subject strengthen our own previous opinion.

Inquiries into the labours and observations of preceding astro

tent, by being subjected to a very high degree of pressure:
 which pressure, while it permits the expansion of the molecules
of water as a fluid, prevents their further expansion, or the
 liquid assuming the gaseous form of steam.
     Instead of the boiler of the ordinary engines, Mr. P. substi
 tutes a cylinder, which he terms the generator. This cylinder
is made of gun-metal (the most tenacious and least liable to oxi
 dation) of about three inches in thickness, closed at both ends,
 with the exception of a valve in the top, opening outwards; which
 valve is loaded with weights equal to the state of the pressure
 from the expansion of the heated water within. The cylinder is
 placed vertically in a cylindrical furnace; consequently it be
                                          to all

  following ingenious contrivance.            should be remembered,     It
  that owing to the small extent of surface exposed to the ex
 pansive force of the steam, and the latter being generated only
 in sufficient quantity for each succeeding stroke of the piston,
 there is much less liability to accident from this engine than in
 most other high-pressure engines. To prevent, however, the
 possibility of such an event, the induction pipe, in which the
  steam is produced, is calculated to withstand an internal force
 of 4000 pounds to the square inch, and it is also provided with
 a thin copper tube, which is calculated to burst at a pressure of
  1000 pounds; while the pressure under which Mr. P. works
 the engine does not exceed 500 pounds on the square inch.
     In order to demonstrate the perfect safety of the operation
 of this engine, notwithstanding this immense internal pressure,
 Mr. Perkins has on several occasions urged the power of the
 steam till it bursts open the sides of the copper tube, without
 occasioning the smallest risk either to the spectator or to any
 other part of the apparatus.      This mode of allowing the escape
                             j,
 of the steam by rending open the sides of the ball, (which is
 made of a determinate strength,) is probably superior in the
                            a its
 certainty of       operation    any modification
                                                to       safety valves.             of
       It   also is  very remarkable fact, that the steam which
 escapes              in
               this case    not     any means
                                      is         by  that elevated tem         of
 perature which might have been expected from                 prodigious                         its
 expansive force”. This fact seems           involve some    points   con

   Mr. Faraday has succeeded in condensing chlorine into a
liquid : for this purpose a portion of the solid and dried hy
drate of chlorine is put into a small bent tube and hermetically
sealed; it is then heated to about 100, and a yellow vapour is
formed which condenses into a deep yellow liquid heavier than
water (sp. gr. probably about 1.3). Upon relieving the pres:

                                         Portsmouth, April 17, 1823.
 DURING           the last twelve months, from April 1822 to
       March 1823, both inclusive, I have registered the daily
 quantities of rain from two similarly made rain-gauges; and
 the following are the monthly amounts in each gauge:
          In  the Rain-gauge three feet above the Ground.
    April 2:570 inches; May 1510; June 0-385; July 4.277;
 August 1815; September 1685; October 6:750; November
 7:500; December 2,240; January 3:365; February 4:585;
 March 2:095.-Total amount 38°777 inches.
          . In the Rain-gauge   23 feet above the Ground.
    April 2270 inches; May 1865; June 0.825: July 3.850;
 August 1705; September 1-620; October 6:640; November
 7:295; December 2:240; January 3:025; February 3,700;
 March 1715.-Total amount 35-750 inches.
    Augmented difference in the lower rain-gauge 3.027 inches.
    The greatest monthly increase in the lower gauge occurred
in July 1822 and in February 1823, two wet and windy
months; for in July strong gales prevailed eleven days, and
in February eight days. The increase in the lower gauge
during these two months is almost one-half of the 12 months'
difference.     I certainly expected to have seen a greater       in
crease in the lower gauge than only tº more than that in the
upper one. It is necessary to observe that the gauge near the
ground was about 50 yards distant from the upper gauge, and
so placed as only to meet with a partial obstruction on the
east side: this, however, is not considered of material conse
quence, as we seldom have rain with an easterly wind; and
when it does come from that quarter, it is generally steady for
20 or 24 hours.

     I would  not have ventured to state anything on this already
agitated subject, without first being possessed of at least twelve
months' observations punctually made on the quantity of rain
 collected in each gauge.        With this advantage may perhaps                          I
be enabled to handle the        question   in a different manner from
what has hitherto appeared.          It is the possession of these ob
 servations that must serve as an apology for my presuming to
 publish the results, with remarks that were made progressively
during the before-mentioned period.
    The question now                    is,
                              What are the causes         the redundant                 of
quantity       rain being generally collected
              of                                      the lower gauge?          in

at the lower one; because the eddy winds alter the oblique
course of the direct rain and wind to a more perpendicular
descent, the more so as they approach the receiving surface of
the latter.    These eddy winds are formed by the springing
back of the direct current from the sides of the houses, &c.
upon which they forcibly strike; and the more violent they are,
the greater of course must be the effect of the eddies.       Hence
a gauge near the
                       #.   surrounded by walls or houses, though
its situation be tolerably open, will receive the rain more freely,
and in a greater ratio, than one at the top of a building 20, 30,
or 40 feet high; because the springing back or recoiling of the
current alters the deflected course of the rain to a more ver
tical fall into the recipient part of the gauge; a circumstance
that may in some measure be traced in the drops of rain on
 coming within a few yards of the ground.
    In the winter months, when the sun's rays have but little
power to raise the vapour plane, the clouds are generally very
low: so that we are sometimes enveloped by thick fogs and
mists; and a change in their temperature and electrical state
 will cause a sudden condensation, and convert them into rain
in a more rapid manner than appears to be effected in an op
posite season: hence it happens that rain and wind are more
 frequent in the winter than in the summer months, and that the
 redundant quantity in the lower gauge is proportionably less in
 the latter season. It may be necessary to observe, in confirma
tion of the greater density of atmosphere near the earth's sur
face, that when it was inclined to condense by meeting with
supervening cold currents, I have, after a dewy night, often
measured from the rain-gauge rag of an inch in depth; the
residuum probably amounted to rag more. So great a quantity
 of dew does not appear to be collected in a rain-gauge placed
                                                                 #.

           It would       be desirable to know the comparative deficiency
      of rain at every 8 or 10 feet above the level of the ground, up
      to 100 feet, which perhaps is as high as any rain-gauge is
      placed upon buildings, in order to be                                             all

of our language, might indeed with almost equal muscular
advantage, and perhaps some fractional advantage as to bre
vity, have been assigned to M: but when I considered that
 subsequent V is sometimes to be expressed by F,                  thought it                     I
 desirable that the double character should be               given    to F in

be rendered more definite.           I shall treat of this distinction in
 the sequel.

I  already stated, that the incipient disadvantage of these shall
be obviated by prepositives. These characters then have been
regularly applied, in the order of occurrence, to those letters

   This part of my subject shall be soon discussed. If the
immediate reading of any passage promiscuously taken up—
and not deciphering with a certain share of difficulty, by the
aid of context—be the object of the writer; occasional vowels
not only in the beginning and ending, but in the middle of
words, are indisputably necessary: and to each of these
vowels separate characters must assuredly be given.                  Na                           If
ture, then, has not furnished us with simple ones, we must
either resort to those of a tedious and complex kind ill-calcu
lated for short-hand, or we must avail ourselves of the most
eligible consonant characters, distinguishing them as vowels
                                       j
by position*. The sounds of which I have sometimes felt the
want, are as follow :     H [or aspirate] A, E, I = Y, O, U, Oo,
Au, Ou, Oi; also intermediate           (as in “beyond”). And Y                                          if,
agreeably      thetopresent  plan,  intermediate W            added, we                 be
shall  require no less than eleven characters          represent  them.          to
Of these W and         already exist;
                                 Y         simple dot shall stand for

I   =   Y;complex characters shall for obvious reasons             given                      be
to the  diphthongs;    the  aspirate   has been    already   described;
and the vowels A,                     E,
                             U, Oo, must    O,   taken from the class   be

strikingly conspicuous. They are equivalent, to capitals in

characters whose place, for the promotion of brevity, they are
intended to supply.  The looped incipients are in      but five;                                         all

in a frame in such a manner that the distance between them
could be increased by means of catgut strings, yet they should
still retain their parallel position.
   A band of paper about seven inches broad was put round
both the cylinders, which was stretched by drawing them
asunder with a force of about thirty-five or forty pounds. The
cylinders were now filled with boiling water, and the holes by
which the water was put in closed with corks. Two pieces of
Indian rubber, together nearly as long as the paper was broad,
fastened on wooden springs, were applied to the paper as it
 passed over one of the cylinders, while the latter was kept
turning by means of the winch.          A small conductor was
brought near that part of the paper which had been rubbed
 as it parted from the curved surface of the cylinder.     This

  differences which, as I believe, these resembling Shells of dif
  ferent Strata present, for distinguishing those of each stratum,

  stratigraphical distinctions, by means of 6, Y, or 8, &c. added

  tend the stratigraphical distribution of Fossil Shells; and have
  in the latter paper endeavoured to call the attention of col
  lectors and conchologists, to the minuter differences which           di
  stinguish certain multistratular Shells from each other, although
  passing at present, under the same specific name: concluding
  with a List, the result of considerable labour and research, of

      of
             of          investigations respecting the temperature
              mines has for several years past been carried on
    in Cornwall, under the direction, principally, of Messrs.
    R. W. Fox and M. P. Moyle, members of the Royal Geolo
    gical Society of that county; and the results of their observa
    tions have partially appeared, from time to time, in the                         An
    nals of Philosophy, and in some other works. Complete views,
    however, of the results obtained by each of those gentlemen,
    with others obtained by Dr. Forbes, late Secretary of the
    Society, have recently been published in the second volume
    of  itsTransactions; and,            as

       water,   accumulated, without doubt, partly from above; by
       which means the temperature, not only of the water but
       also of the air, in these mines, must have been affected.       In
       the United Mines also, there was some water when the obser
       vations were made; but it remained too short a time,           ap                                                                                                      I
       prehend, materially to affect the general temperature of the
       mine.     Dolcoath and Huel Abraham were clear of water to
       the  bottom;   and it will be observed that the temperature in
       the corresponding levels of these mines differed very little, and,
       with a few trifling exceptions (which probably arose from local
       causes), the heat progressively increased, even to the greatest
       depths to which they have been hitherto explored.”
          Mr. Fox also gives, in this paper, from the Cornwall Ga
       zette, the results of some observations on the temperatures of
      the collieries in the north of England; but as we shall append
       to the present article an abstract of the paper by Mr. Bald,
      in which those results were primarily recorded, it -is unneces
      sary to cite them in this place.

 352                  Summary Review      of the late Investigations
 one    Ihave heard of was reported to me by Captain Hosken.
  An accident having happened to a steam-engine at the United
  Mines, the water increased so much as to fill the levels marked
  in the table 190 and 200 fathoms under the surface; and thus
  it continued for two days. Immediately after it had been
  pumped out, and before the miners had begun to work in those
 levels, he ascertained the temperature of the ground in the
  upper one to be 874°, and in the lower one to be 88°. On
  renewing his observations some days after the men had resumed
 their work in these places, the heat had rather diminished than
  otherwise.”
     “It  is worthy of notice, that the principal part of the work
 is not carried on in the deepest part of the mines: on the con
 trary, there are often more workmen employed at twenty or
 thirty fathoms above the lowest part, than in the deepest level.
If    therefore the increase in the temperature were wholly the
 effect of adventitious causes, that increase would be greatest
 where those causes had their largest operation.        But the facts
 which I have detailed in the table prove that, however various
 may be the operation of accidental circumstances, in different
 parts of the mines, the temperature invariably- increases with
 the depth.”
     Mr. Fox next gives the results of some observations made
 in the spring of 1820 by Mr.               J.
                                        T. Price, of Neath in Gla
 morganshire, in three collieries in the neighbourhood of that
place.     “The thermometer was buried for many hours, from
 one to two feet under the ground, at the bottom of each of
 these collieries.     In one of them, which was only 10 fathoms
 deep, the mercury stood at 50°; in another, 36 fathoms deep,
 it stood at 58°; and in the third, which was 90 fathoms deep,
 it stood at 62°.”
     In order to controvert the opinion that the water in the mines
 receives       heat from the metallic veins, while passing through
                  its
 them,      inwhich case,       remarks, “it would surely become
                                    he
 strongly impregnated with mineral substances,”—Mr. Fox
states, that upon analysing some                of

      Mr. Fox terminates this paper with the following additional
  In Otice:—

  The hole was filled with clay round the stem of the thermometer,

Both the astronomical and the geodetical departments were
furnished with repeating circles of 13 or 14 inches diameter,
constructed by the most celebrated instrument makers of Paris.
Let us see to what degree of precision the most skilful observers
found  it possible to attain with such instruments.
   In the second volume of the “Base du Système métrique,”
will be found all the observations of latitude made with these
                                                                                                j.

the declarations of the observers themselves.
   M.   Delambre,             after relating, page 262, the observations
which he made at Dunkirk of the zenith distance of the star
6 Ursae Minoris, at upper culmination, adds the following
                                    its
remarks:

can only      beexplained                 on
                                the supposition that some derange

    M. Borda, the inventor, and consequently the ardent partisan,

    Paris, he writes as follows:—

   M. Méchain, though more adroit and more experienced
than M. Delambre, was not more fortunate           his observations,        in
or in the results he obtained.        His observations were made
at the Royal Observatory           Paris. He began
                                           at           suppressing                   by

star,   wellas   the lower culmination ºthe pole-star; but these
                      as
observations could never be found. M. Méchain has therefore
rejected more than 2000 observations.         We may easily guess
what sort         of
                agreement they would have exhibited, since we
know the reasons which induced this able, patient and sincere
astronomer        reject them. This, however,

   In the beginning of the year 1797, M. Méchain went to
make observations at Carcassonne. He made but few. M. De
lambre thinks that, in fact, he suppressed them.          He says,
(p. 479,)         “It
                is very improbable that M. Méchain passed all
the time from the 17th of January to the 20th of March in
idleness; we can only suppose that he communicated to us
only those observations with which he was fully satisfied, and
unmercifully proscribed                         all
                               the others for some irregularities
which   would,  perhaps,   have rendered them precious for the
theory      of
           refractions.        particularly extraordinary that he

     M. Méchain was                     never satisfied with his                         observations.
    M. Delambre said of        him that he was difficult to satisfy, but
    this excellent and scrupulous observer had good reason to be
    so, for he alone knew what he suppressed; he knew better
    than any body those irregularities which caused his despair.
    He said to       all
                      who talked with him           the subject,    onwrote                      he
    to his friends, he wrote even        M. Borda himself, who was

    could not make observations even passably correct. This was
    the reason that M. Méchain wished              return      Spainto   re            to             to
    peat his observations with other circles, and even             his own                  at
    expense. M. Borda constantly opposed this project; and
    M. Delambre even went far                congratulate him        having                  on

    ance       of
               excellent instruments.    But, we repeat, M. Méchain
    alone could estimate the excellence of his instruments; he alone
    could know the number          abortive observations, and the great

 362                   Zach on Repeating Circles.
    In 1809 we passed through Milan. We there made, with
 the same circle of Reichenbach with which we had made our
 experiments at Munich, several observations at the Imperial
 Observatory of Brera; among others, that of the summer sol
 stice. M. le Chevalier de Cesaris, the director of that obser
           made similar observations with the superb eight-foot
 mural   quadrant     of Ramsden. We had agreed to compare
 every day the apparent altitudes of the sun, which we observed
 with our respective instruments; this comparison must conse
 quently have given the errors of collimation of the mural circle,
 since it is well known that altitudes observed with the repeat
 ing circle are exempt from them. The following is the result:
            Errors of Collimation of the Mural Circle.

    These errors of collimation ought to be every day the same;
 nevertheless, they present anomalies which extend from zero
 to seven seconds.         These irregularities ought, without doubt,
 to be distributed between the two observations; but to which
 of these instruments ought the greater part to be assigned, to
 the dwarf, or to the colossal instrument? The question is easy
 to decide. It was only necessary to compare the latitudes given
 by the two instruments. We have calculated them as follows:
                           Latitude given by || Latitude given by

    It appears by this exposé, that in 3262 observations, not se
lected, made with a small 12-inch repeating circle of Reichen
bach, the greatest difference in these observations, from day to
day, never extended beyond 4” in the altitudes; but if we seek
these differences in a combination of the series, they never ex
ceeded two seconds.

    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
   N reply to the request of your correspondent T. M. ex
     pressed in your last Number, I shall trouble you with the
following explanation of M. Schumacher's tables.
    The term “January 0” refers to the noon of December 31st:
and the intervals are carried on, for every ten days, to Decem
ber 36; which latter date is meant to designate the 5th of
January in the ensuing year. The date of January 0 has been
long adopted by astronomers; and is inserted in Dr. Maske
lyne's tables published many years ago: so that it is by no
means a new term.               I
                               acknowledge, however, that it may
sometimes lead to confusion.
    With respect to the formation of the tables, they are con
 structed on the principles detailed by M. Bessel in his Astro
nomiae Fundamenta, page 67: and are so contrived that they
show the corrections applicable to the star, at the moment of
observation; which is made the argument, wherewith to enter
the table.    I  have not time at present to enter into a full ex
planation of those principles, or of their mode of application:
but, the following brief outline may perhaps suffice.        At some
future time I    may  probably   resume the subject, more at length.
    The  year   is supposed   to commence at the moment when the
mean” longitude of the sun is 280°; and to consist of 366+
sidereal days. Now, a given star will, at some time in the
year, culminate twice in the period of a day, according to the
civil mode of reckoning: and an error of one day, according
to such computation, would arise in the argument if no cor
rection were applied to counteract           The correction, which
                                                it.
M. Bessel has introduced for this purpose,           denoted
                                                      is          the   by
 letter
      i.
    Again; since the mean longitude              of
                                            the sun    never exactly
                                                       is
the same     atthe commencement          each successive year; and
                                           of
since, in  fact, the year seldom       never begins when the mean
                                          or
longitude    of the sun     eractly 280°,
                           is               correction for the Argu

                               counteract the effect   of
                                                        this assump
tion. This united correction for the       Argument,      denoted by
                                                            is
the letter   k;  and   a small table    given, showing

                                                            value for
certain years. Against the leap year (1820) are inserted two
numbers, differing from each other               by
                                            unity: the first           is   to   be
 *   To explain the mode,       by
                             which M. Bessel passes from the mean     the   to
true longitude    of
                  the sum, would extend this letter    to   an
                                                            inconvenient
length.

taken if the date is before February 29; and the second, for
the remainder of the year. These numbers, for 1823 and
 1824, are given at the bottom of my supplementary table.
    The commencement of the year is dated from mean time at
Paris; and therefore another slight correction for the Argu
ment (denoted by h) is applied when the observations are made
 under a different meridian.         In no part of England, however,
 will this correction be of     any
         f
                                     sensible amount.
    Let      therefore denote the day of observation according to
the civil mode of reckoning, and g the sidereal time of obser
 vation converted into the decimal part of a day; then will the
 argument of the Table be the quantity (f-H g + h + i + k);
 which is generally the given date, added to the fractional part
                                                                                º
 of a day. But,...         fact, we may
                               in                most cases neglect the

 corresponding         the logarithms

to enable the English astronomer to make use of them:           am    I
very sure there are no other tables whereby he can obtain the
same results with so much ease and expedition, and with so
little chance of error. It would be a great acquisition if the
constants were given for a greater number of stars: in this case
the tables would supersede all others which have been com
puted for such occasional references.

|        The result of the natural combination of                   these substances
    with metals is called an ore.
      Metallic ores are further compounded by including mixtures
!   of more than one metal, as in the case of yellow copper ore,
    which contains both sulphuret of copper and of iron-galena
    or sulphuret of lead, which commonly contains silver, and
    many ores which contain arsenic combined with other metals.
       Again: the metallic ores are much intermixed with earthy
    substances of various kinds, which, though not in chemical
    union, have often such an intimate mechanical union as to
    alter their character, and add to the variety of their appearance
    and to the difficulty of extraction of the pure metal.
       Some of the compounds which have been before described
    as the products of art, will appear again in the list of the ores;
    but generally speaking, owing to the circumstance of other
    admixtures, or their having been formed in modes which art
|   cannot imitate, their external characters are different in the
                                                                             º:
    one case from what they are in the other.
       One peculiarity which will strike us is the variety of form
    and splendour of their crystals, each assuming a                           in
    their structure which forms an admirable guide by which their
    nature may be detected; and this circumstance has been used
    as the foundation of a study that has rendered the greatest ser
    vices to mineralogy; it has assumed the name of crystallo
    graphy, and should be attended to by                     all
                                                          who intend         ac to
    quire   a knowledge      of
                              the mineral kingdom.                -
       Besides the ores resulting from combinations such                    haveas
    been mentioned, certain metals are found                   their pure            or
    malleable state, and we speak               of
                                             them then             as in
                                                               native   metals:
                                                                    -

          Silver, mercury, copper, antimony......frequently.
          Arsenic, tellurium, bismuth, iron.........rarely.
       Taking then into account these and the compounded state
    of the ores,    will appear that nature presents                    us

372              Mr. J. Taylor's     Lectures on Metallurgy.
         Primitive rocks;–Granite; gneiss; mica slate; clay slate:
         Secondary rocks:—Gritstone or sandstone; limestone; shale
or plate.                                            -
    Geologists indeed enumerate many others, but miners con
 sider them as modifications of the same.
    In this country clay slate is the most productive of the       pri
 mitive class, and limestone of the secondary.
    The metallic ores are found occupying certain spaces in
 these rocks, which have been arranged under the names of
 veins, beds, and masses. The two first are the most usual.
    Mineral veins, and the particulars of their position, direction,
 and appearance, have been formerly described. They are to
 be understood as fissures which have been filled up by dif
 ferent mineral substances.       Professor Brande very justly re
 marked that the term Wein was objectionable, as it conveys
 the idea of a tube or pipe filled with metal, whereas it is a
 plate or lamina.     They extend in nearly right lines, are of
 unequal thickness, penetrate to unknown depths, and usually
 are somewhat inclined from the perpendicular.        They contain
 a great  variety of metals  differing  in different countries,   and
 in distinct veins in the same country.                         -
                                          .#
    English miners have different terms for veins: in Cornwall
they are called Lodes; in Derbyshire, Rakes; and the term
Dyke sometimes used describes the same thing.                 -
    In these  deposits  the ores are                 by earthy   sub
 stances generally in a crystallized or sparry form called Wein
 stones, Matrix, Gangue.         -
    Beds are the other kind of regular depository of metallic
ores. These are flat or tabular masses interposed between
strata of rock, and thus resemble beds of coal. They are
seldom very thick, and mostly produce iron, manganese, and
sometimes lead.
    Masses, or as they are sometimes called Pipes, are irregular
deposits of the metals, and, not being usual, need not occupy
much of our notice.
    The metals or their ores are also sometimes found in allu
vium, such as gravel and sand in valleys, and particularly gold
in a native form in many places, and tin ore in Cornwall and
Banca.

                Mr. J. Taylor's      Lectures on Metallurgy.         373
    that they may be rendered as pure as these means will allow
    before they go to the furnace.
    . The following is a brief account of the processes of dress
    ling  :
         The ores, when first raised from the mines, are in various
    states; some in large masses free from other matter, other
    large masses containing ores, spar, &c.; small pieces both of
    pure ore, and that which is mixed, and much that is crumbled
    to small minute fragments.
       The first operations relate to separating them into proper
    sizes and qualities by spulling or knocking, sifting or gridling,
    and picking.
                                                                     -
       The purer parts are then separated, and are often removed
*
    at once for smelting after having been broken down to a cer
    tain degree of fineness or size.
       The other or mixed parts are submitted to various processes
    of washing, but first must be put into a proper state of         di
           cº
    vision by being bruised and sifted to uniform sizes: this is
    done           by cobbing and bucking, manual operations; or
    by crushing and stamping by machines.
       The processes of washing are very various, but depend on
    one general principle,_- that the metallic may be separated
    from the earthy parts by their different specific gravities. Thus,
    if both are agitated      ther in water, the heaviest will sink or
    be deposited first. . This principle is applied by throwing the
    ores into streams of water running over planes gently inclined.
    The ores settle at the upper, and the spar and earthy parts at
                                                                -
    the lower.
       Another way much in use is by agitating the whole in sieves,
w
    so fine as to permit but little of the solid matter to pass, but
    to admit the water freely. By this agitation in water the ore
    settles to the bottom of the sieve, and the spar or matrix at the
    top, where it is skimmed off and thrown away, and this is
    called Jigging. When the ores are cleaned by dressing, they
    are fitted #. the operations of reduction or smelting.
       The art of managing metallurgic processes with considerable
    skill and effect is of the highest antiquity, which is rather to
    be wondered    at, seeing that       so
                                       few      of
                                                the metals offer them
           to  our notice                for any useful purpose; that

    these occur  in  small quantities and      few localities; and that

    many   of the ores have    noappearances         by

    contents could    bejudged      of
       They differ indeed  in  this respect: thus
    -  Galena has much the appearance           of

     . Yellow   copper  hasa  metallic appearance,   but not indicating
    the metal.             -                                     -
                                                                 Tin,

 374         Mr. J. Taylor's       Lectures on Metallurgy.
   Tin,   ironstone, &c. have only great weight; some ores, arsé
 niates of copper, have neither weight nor metallic lustre.
    It has been ingeniously supposed by Mr. David Mushet in a
 late paper published in the Philosophical Magazine, (vol. lx.
 p. 401,) “On the Origin and Discovery of Iron,” that this
 metal might be accidentally produced in the operation of con
 verting wood into charcoal.      Tradition informs us that the
 discovery was owing to the accidental burning of a forest in
  Greece.
    Similar circumstances might, however, lead to the know
 ledge of other metals, particularly such as have ores easy of
 reduction, and which are often found - near the surface of the
 earth, such as lead and tin.
    The knowledge of the power of fire over these substances
 being once obtained, other ores that occurred to notice would
 be submitted to its action, and thus the number of known
 metals would be increased.     It has, however, been mentioned
 that the ancients  only knew of seven; but it is also certain that
 they made several alloys, and particularly of copper.         The
 earliest writings seem to prove this, and some even describe
 the operations.
    In the 4th chapter of Genesis, Tubalcain is mentioned as
 “an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron.”
    Homer has several passages which are curious; because, in
speaking of Vulcan, they describe his forges as urged by bel
lows which must have been applied nearly in the same man
ner as we use them now.
          “Thus  having said—the father of the fires
           To  the black labour of his forge retires;
           Soon as he bid them blow, the bellows turn’d
           Their iron mouths, and where the <U+017F>urnace burn’d,
            Resounding breathed; at once the blast expires,
           And twenty forges catch at once the fires;
           Just as the God directs, now loud, now low,
           They raise a tempest, or they gently blow—
           In hissing flames, huge silver bars are roll’d
           And stubborn brass; and tin, and solid gold.
           Before, deep fixed, th’ eternal anvils stand,
           The ponderous hammer loads his better hand;
           His left with tongs turns the vext metal round,
           And thick strong strokes the doubling vaults rebound.”
                                       HoMER. Iliad. book xviii. line 537.
   Virgil also, in the 8th book of the AEneid, mentions the
melting of steel, in large furnaces, as contrasted with others in
which bellows were used. And commentators on these pas
sages mention, that the Latin name for steel (chalybs) was de
rived from that of a people in Spain, who were very expertin
the working iron and       its
                            ores and mines.

     LXXVII.      On   Mr. GRooMBRIDGE's Tables of- rata.
                    By W. M. MoseLEY, Esq.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
 I AVAIL
R.
               myself of your valuable publication, to express my
     obligations to Mr. Groombridge for the satisfactory ex
            of the difficulty which   I stated in your Magazine for
      tº:
    arch, respecting the computed and observed places of Vesta
in July 1822. Soon after I had transmitted the letter, it struck
 me that some passages in it seemed to call too strongly upon
 Mr.                   to defend the assertion he had previously
made, regarding the orbit of the planet having been found less
 than at first supposed; but I beg leave to assure him, that
 nothing was more distant from my thoughts at the moment,
than such a design.         I fear, however, from the prompt and
explicit manner in which Mr. G. has answered the inquiry, in
your last Number, that he really did view my communication
as directed to himself—an impression           I am very anxious to
efface.                        -
    The circumstance which Mr. Groombridge mentions in
regard to his method of applying only the equation of the
centre in forming his Ephemeris of Vesta, affords a reason for
the discordance which I had found between his positions and
mine.     I used the whole panoply of Daussy's Tables, taking
out the small equations of longitude, where directed, to three
decimal figures.      These minor equations sometimes amount
to upwards of 50', the omission of which must produce a con
siderable difference in the final result. The planet, however,
may be found, in a telescope with large field, by a less intri
cate process.     It was very unfortunate, that after preparing,
with great trouble, many calculations of the place of this little
planet, during last summer, the weather was so perplexing
that I had not one opportunity of comparing the apparent
transit with the computed on those particular days which
were selected.     How often have observers, in this climate, oc
casion to regret the mortifying disappointments which occur
from our turbid atmosphere —“Dum latet obscura condita
nube dies” 1             -       Your obedient servant,

LXXVIII.        The characters     of several rare and    undescribed

           number of shells, unrecorded by systematic writers,
THE   which exist in the cabinets of this country, is continually
increasing. Every year witnesses the dispersion of collections,

376      Mr.  Swainson on several rare and undescribed Shells.
containing rare or unique species, which are seldom if ever
seen again, but after a lapse of years; they are either pur
chased to enrich foreign cabinets, or pass into the hands of
other collectors remote from the metropolis, and become of
difficult access to a scientific writer.    It is therefore of much
importance to the science, that such subjects should be re
corded at the time; for, by so doing, extensive materials are
 accumulated to facilitate the labour of any future writer, who
may undertake a general systematic work descriptive of all
the species.
    Impressed with a conviction of the value of such records,
however short, or however unconnected with each other,             I
have drawn up the following specific characters of shells
which appear to me not hitherto described. These notices.
I  intend occasionally to continue, in the same way, by de
scribing such other new shells as may come under my ob
servation.     The genera, unless otherwise expressed, are those
of MM. Cuvier and Lamarck; and I have subjoined an              En
glish version to the Latin characters, that the whole may be
more generally useful.

     Mr. Swainson's Exotic Conchology, the publication of
 which has been long suspended on account of the various acci
 dents to which the state of lithography. in this country had
 subjected the author, is about to be continued, and the Plates
 of the fifth number are now printing by Messrs. Rowney and
  Foster. Mr. Swainson, anxious to attain as near to perfection
 as possible, has, in consequence of improvements in lithogra
 phy, which will do more justice to his excellent drawings,
 re-engraved most of the plates already published; and liberal
 ly offers to give early purchasers of the work the option of
 changing their old plain copies for the new and improved en
 gravings. We have been favoured with a sight of the new plates,

Joseph Parmentier was read, On the Pears cultivated in
France and the Netherlands, in which their qualities and
periods of maturity are pointed out.

Napal to the East India Company, and presented by the Di
rectors to the Horticultural Society. A considerable quantity
of the Rice was distributed to the members present. It is
represented as being perfectly hardy, and will probably be a
valuable acquisition to the occupiers of low swampy lands in
this country.

    A Letter was read from Henry Heuland, Esq. For. Sec. G.S.,
 addressed to the President, On the Matrix of the Diamond.
 In this letter Mr. Heuland describes two specimens, which he
 laid upon the table of the Society. The first of these, from                Ab
 baete in Brazil, was a conglomerate of oxide of iron, with small
waterworn quartz pebbles, containing a diamond. This, which
is called Cascalhao, Mr. Heuland believes to be of alluvial origin.
The other specimen, from Pereira in Brazil, which Mr. Heuland
received from Baron d'Eschwege, was a very small brilliant
dodecahedral diamond, surrounded by skorodite or cupreous
arseniate of iron in a gangue or matrix of massive oxide of iron
(Werner's brown iron-stone). This oxide of iron, according to
Baron d'Eschwege and Alexander Caldcleugh, Esq., forms
veins or beds, 25 feet deep, resting on chlorite schist, in the
mountains near Pereira. That it is the true matrix of at least
the Brazilian diamond, appears confirmed by the locality where
diamonds have not before been discovered, by                its
                                                    being accom
panied   by                 copper, and            by                    of
            the arseniate    in of          the difference     this

 on the results produced by the voyage of M. Leschenault in
  India. Of these results, the most important is the introduction
 of more than 100 different species of plants into the island of
 Bourbon. Among these plants we may mention the cinnamon
 tree; a barberry, which gives a yellow dye; a medlar, which
 bears an esculent fruit about the size of a plum; two species
 of the sugar cane; six of the cotton tree, which have contri
 buted to revive the cultivation of cotton in the colony; the
 poppy from which the best opium has been extracted; a spe
 cies of nettle, Urtica tenacissima, which has been found a valu
 able substitute for hemp; the sago palm; the Illipé, whose
 seeds afford much oil; the Ficus elastica, the milky sap of
 which turns to elastic gum; the Browallia, which yields frank

to preclude the possibility of attributing their structure to or-.
ganization, however strongly some of them may resemble                                               it;
and, after all, it may be that this arrangement is due to more.

spect to Nos. 7, 8 and 9, was the striking similarity to the ova.
rium of an animal, as already stated; but this is a pursuit I.
must leave to the comparative anatomist. He may find in the
threads by which these rounded masses are connected, more
uniformity than could be attributed to the accidental perfora
tions of a worm; nor do I think the elegant and delicate moss
like arrangement of the fibres with which they are surrounded,
seems likely to have accrued from any such operation; and as
an organized connection has been pointed out, extending from
the siphunculus to the apex of the belemnite, perhaps more.
practised eyes may be able to trace it further in these or other

           NATURAL HISTORY COLLECTIox F <U+017F>tom INDIA.
    M. L.  de Latour, king's naturalist at Pondicherry (from the
jº,
 rear  1816,  when the French regained possession of it), has
        returned to Paris.   He has visited successively various
districts of the peninsula of India, including a part of Bengal,
in the island of Ceylon. The fruit of his labours will be of con
siderable utility to the French colonies, and conducive to the
progress of the natural sciences.       To the king's garden at
Paris he early transmitted a zoological collection, considered
as one of the greatest then received. He has since sent a num
ber of live animals to the royal menagerie, and a vast number
of herbs and seeds. Among the former are a young elephant,
an Indian chacal, and different species of land and sea tor                                           º
toises.    With each assortment he has forwarded a descriptive
catalogue, and accompanying memoirs.         He has also brought
with him a considerable collection from the three kingdoms of
nature; and he had previously introduced at Pondicherry,
among other useful plants, that known by the name of the
guinea-herb, which is the more valuable from forage being
scarce on the coast of Coromandel.

ant according to the state of the urine,) found that uric acid is
very easily dissolved by solution of borax.     If the solution is
concentrated, it speedily becomes turbid, and deposits urate of
soda, upon which it will dissolve a new quantity of uric acid.
   Mr. W. proposes borax for trial as a remedy against gravel
and stone, at least as a salutary alterative in tedious cases.
   Uric acid may thus be abstracted in a simple and easy way
from the excrements of birds &c. by boiling them with water,
to which a small proportion of borax is added. The hot filtered
liquor, when saturated with sulphuric acid, precipitates the
uric acid in a pretty pure state.—Wetzlar Beitr. Zur Kentn. des

  “The     scientific department of the Mission, we learn, has
been conducted with the utmost assiduity and zeal.         There is
no finer field in the world, perhaps, for the botanist than the
peninsula of Malacca, and the neighbouring islands, where
the luxuriance of vegetation is said to be truly astonishing.

morning of the 29th, which burnt four villages and buried-
two.   I'ifteen persons lost their lives.

       that there are few who have reduced their speculations to the
       test of experiment, and still fewer whose experiments will sup
       port their speculations. The phaenomena which I have noticed

the ship:—the length of the line between the stern and the log
will be the measure of the apparent velocity of the waves for
the interval of time, to which the rate at which the ship is
sailing being added, the sum is the true velocity of the waves.
The velocity of the waves per hour may be found as follows:
   Let a represent the rate at which the ship is sailing; b the
number of feet between the ship's stern and the log; c the
interval of time in seconds; v the apparent velocity of the
wave in sea miles, and w     true velocity; then

Or the rule may   given        be               as   follows:—
  Multiply the number                        of    feet between               the ship's stern and
the log by 30, and the number      seconds      the interval by
                                                           of                   in

the force and continuance of the wind that puts them in mo

 take. The artist in question was therefore deceived, and la
 boured under a complete mistake, when he said that we
 had brought out a density of the earth nearly coinciding
with the Schehallien experiment and with the more recent
 one which Cavendish obtained by direct attraction.       Not a
word of all this was to be found in our work.    This celebrated
artist informs us again in his very instructive and interesting
paper, that “it is possible that......a result might have been
obtained of an equal quantity contrary to attraction.”    But if
he had properly read or understood our work, he would have
found that not only we had said the same thing, but that we
actually expected this contrary result.
    We extract what we said on this subject (p. 358): “We will
candidly confess that in undertaking this work we were not
without apprehension, that instead of finding the effect of an
attraction we should find that of a repulsion; that is to say,
an absurdity which would have only served to prove the insuf
ficiency of our mechanical and physical means for determining
a quantity so minute.     We were not ignorant that this had
happened to M. Méchain at Barcelona and Montjouy in his
search for a quantity almost double that which we were going
to seek.” And further (p. 359): “We have formally de
clared that, so far from seeking the cause of these anomalies
in local attractions, or in the irregularities of the density of
strata of the earth, we were much more inclined to lay the
º
blame on the instruments, and even on the observations. We
have since seen that Don Rodriguez, in his ingenious exami
nation   of the three  degrees of the meridian measured in En
         held this opinion   in common with us.”                 If
                                                           we had be
 ieved in the reality of our result, and if that belief had been
erroneous, we at least had, as companions in error, Bouguer,
De la Condamine, Maskelyne, Méchain, and Delambre, who
all held the same belief, and even for quantities much smaller
than ours; for M. Delambre,           fact, speaks
                                       in                 0",65 of    of

                                        appears that the inequality

    attraction must          be
                           very small, since the distance from the
tower to the sea        more than 1000 toises.” And here we
                        is
must remark that his observations            of
                                           latitude differ from those
of  Méchain        by
                   0",65; upon which          asks, “Can this small

earth, which we never had the slightest intention of doing,
would have seen, if he had read or understood our work,
which it appears he has not done, that such an instrument
was precisely and absolutely the one which it was necessary
to employ, since our principal object was to try whether such
an instrument would produce again the same phaenomena
which a similar instrument had exhibited at Barcelona.          We
repeat, our project, and our intention in the operation which
we undertook and executed in the environs of Marseilles in
 1810, had nothing to do with the determination of the density,
the magnitude, or the figure of the earth, nor of an invariable
and universal measure deduced from that magnitude and
figure.   These were the objects accomplished in France and
Spain, with the instruments in question, which were also
thought quite sufficient for determining the deviation of plumb
lines or of levels caused by the attraction of mountains. M. Mé
chain asserts this formally in the second volume of the Base
             at (p.
Métrique        491): “We have-taken advantage (says he)                                      in of

the level   ofthese instruments towards the south,        has been             as
conjectured.”      We have seen   above,   that M. Delambre sus
pected that      an
                  effect     of

                                                  this same effect                            of

    the same kind and of the same dimensions, and certainly of a
y   very inferior quality, in operations which involved the most
    serious and important consequences.
       Thus we are neither the first nor the only persons who have
    thought it possible to effect with a small circle what ought
    only to have been undertaken with large instruments. Two
    of the greatest, astronomers and geometricians of Germany,
    not only thought but did the same thing, and even more.
    The celebrated Professor Gauss of Göttingen was of opinion
    not only that whatever could be done with a large repeating
    circle might be done as well with a small one, but was even
    inclined to prefer the results obtained by means of the latter.
    See the 1st vol. of my Correspondance Astronomique, in which
    will be found the following passage (p. 457):
       “The Baron de Lindenau wrote to me some time ago, that
    M. Gauss inclined rather towards the results obtained by
    small circles, than towards those obtained by large ones.            It
    would be not only curious but very instructive to know the
    reasons which have determined this great geometrician, who
    is at the same time an astronomer not of the closet, but of
    the starry heavens, in forming so important a judgement.”
       Professor Gauss did not confine himself merely to thinking
    and saying; he also acted.        In the xxviith vol. of our Cor
    respondance Astronomique Allemande (p. 481) will be found the
    observations of the latitude made by this able astronomer at
    the Observatory of Göttingen in the year 1813 with a Reichen
    bach’s 12-inch repeating circle similar to ours.         It will there
    be seen that the greatest differences, as was the case in our ex
    periment, and in those made with                          all
                                              the large circles, did not
    exceed   2",55.   The mean               of
                                       four latitudes obtained         two                           by
    stars observed above and below the pole, gave difference                        a                      of
2   only 1”,80, and this latitude differed only by 1",6 from that
    which Tobias Mayer had determined with his large and beau
    tiful Bird's 6-foot mural”.      But what will this great English
    artist say when        he
                          sees that M. Besselt        Köningsberg, with at
    one  of  Cary's   18-inch pygmies, also ventured           attack the            to
    8-foot meridian colossus          Greenwich, and affirms that he

     M.Bessel finds that he differs not only from the great me
ridian circle at Greenwich,     but also from those by Ramsden
at Dublin, and at Palermo,      and from a Reichenbach's 8-foot
repeating circle at Milan.      M. Bessel says distinctly (p. 274),
“ that these differences did   not surprise him, since his former
observations made with Cary’s circle had already suggested
them to him.”

might have been better employed with non-repeating instru
ments.  We do not dispute that this charge may be well
founded with regard to the great observatories which are fur
nished with those large non-repeating instruments; but we
 think the general accusation as unjust as it is ill-founded.
 We may reckon in Europe twelve mural quadrants, con
 structed by the first artists of England, by Bird, Sisson,
 Ramsden; without counting the two in the Royal Observatory
at Greenwich, that in the Observatory of Göttingen, and that
in the Observatory at the Ecole Militaire at Paris, which
Bradley, Maskelyne, Mayer, and La Lande, have used with
 so much assiduity;-what has been done with the others?
 Where are the observations and the catalogues of stars which
they have produced?         Repeating circles were not invented
at the time they were constructed; at any rate they were not
in use, and consequently could not prevent the use of other
instruments, nor retard the observations which might have
 been made with them.
    We are acquainted with six of Reichenbach's three-foot
repeating circles distributed among five of the great obser
vatories of Europe, without reckoning that at Milan which
M. Oriani has employed in his labours;–what has been done
F.
with the others? Nothing at all. It follows, then, that these
instruments have not occasioned loss of time, and have not
             stopped or retarded the observations which might
                                                                     º
  ave been made with the twelve mural quadrants, and with
the seven sectors;         constructed    all

determined by the largeness of

  These experiments were repeated in public, as far as time
would allow, on February 27th, and less heat was made use of.
The same sort of oil was decomposed at a low red heat in the
same apparatus.     1-8th in weight was found as residual car
bon; and 83} cubic feet of gas, spec. grav. '902, were produced
per gallon.  If the density had been only '876, as in the last
experiment, the quantity would have been (found by propor
tion) 85-9; it was then 86-9, as near a coincidence as can be
expected. Thus what was gained in density by operating at
a low heat, was lost in quantity.
   A most respectable and scientific company attended the ex
periments on light, &c., and the results were, as before, less

injured, except iron and copper; and the substance in the in
terior of copper tubes I have by analysis found to be sul
phuret of copper and ammonia; and as ammonia acts upon
copper more than any other metal, and copper in this in
stance is more acted on, I think that we may fairly attribute
a principal part of the corrosion to the presence of that gas.
As a preventative, the ammonia might be removed by adding
to the present mode of purifying a vessel containing dilute
acid, or by coating the interior of copper services with some
resinous substance; but the best way would be to give up
copper altogether, and make use of iron, block-tin, or lead.

    Your idea, that               of declinations ought al
                               a new catalogue
ways to be accompanied with a detail of our own investiga
tions  on refraction, perfectly accords with my own; but
Dr.  Brinkley  as well as myself have actually caused such.in
vestigations to accompany our papers; and I therefore cannot
conceive how the author of the paper in Tilloch's Magazine
can still apprehend any considerable error from this circum
Stance.                                                                                  -
    I   certainly am not so fully acquainted with Dr. Brinkley's
 investigations on refraction as with my own: nevertheless it
 appears to me, that, in case both instruments really indicate
 exactly equal zenith distances, an error of 1", 2 in one of the
two determinations for 45° cannot be allowed: but if it be                                         al
lowed for the sake of reconciling both catalogues, then it
proves plainly, that both instruments do not indicate equal
zenith-distances.—I have examined my own very particularly,
as you will see from the seventh section of my Observations,
with regard to the absolute correctness of the reading (Angabe),
and have indeed discovered a trifling bend in the telescope, on
account of which there must be added to the direct reading
(Angabe) u of the circle, +                    1",

nearer    to those       Dr. Brinkley's; but this

my observations, which               do

               M. Bessel   on the Declination         of the Stars.        433
servations might also be thereby obtained.       know, indeed, I
that the refraction cannot be considered rigidly correct, either
by the exterior or by the interior thermometer; but as the
refraction on the outside of the observatory regulates itself
.
according to the exterior thermometer, and can only be altered
    the difference of temperature within the observatory, this
                           .
alteration (sometimes + sometimes —) may be in other re
spects equally as great for stars on the zenith as for stars in
any given altitude, and consequently upon the whole can be
but very trifling; therefore there remains no other method,
but to be guided by the data of the exterior thermometer.                   If
the surface of the warmed air in the observatory were calm
and horizontal, it would be otherwise; but this is not the
CaSe,
     In
      the letter, from which you have given an extract in the
28th Number of your Astronomische Nachrichten,           observe      I
that Mr. Pond's catalogue approximates nearer to mine, if it
be reduced with the               which           I
                                           have derived from my
observations.    But   Ithink that no one should allow himself
to make this alteration, unless he can prove from the Green
wich original observations, that the stars below the pole re
duced by the same refraction, give corresponding results.
This, the author of the account in the Philosophical Magazine
doubts, when he says, that the continued use which Mr. Pond
makes of Bradley's tables of refraction, proves that Mr. Pond's
observations correspond with this table.                   I
                                                  cannot decide
about  this; but I cannot  help observing,  that            I
                                                  have obtained
a greater refraction from Bradley's observations than Bradley
himself: and that this latter appears not to be reconcileable
with the observations of that great astronomer, when examined
with great accuracy. Were         it,   on
                                     the contrary, reconcileable
with the latest Greenwich    observations,  then   would appear
                                                           it
to me
           as
           a   striking coincidence          of
                                         heterogeneous circum
Stances.
     Mr. Pond has had the goodness            to      send me, through the
          Dr. Tiarks,

hands                     still later copy             his catalogue; but
                                                                            of it
                           a
differs very little from that compared    the 28th Number
the Astronomische Nachrichten, and therefore does not alter
materially the result produced from that comparison.

 two boys employed in wheeling the broken ore, &c. to the
 shaft.   Each of these boys has also a candle affixed to his
 wheelbarrow, by the universal subterranean candlestick, a
 piece of clay. A certain band of men (called, however nu                   -
merous, a pair) generally undertake the work of a particular
gallery".      These subdivide themselves into smaller bodies,
 which, by relieving each other at the end of every six or eight
hours, keep up the work uninterruptedly, except on Sunday.
 By means of this subdivision of the pairs, there is in general
not more than one-third of the under-ground labourers below
at any one time.       Notwithstanding this incessant labour, the
progress of the miner in excavating his gallery is in general
very small; one, two, or three feet in a week, or a few inches
ãº,     is often the whole amount of the united operations of
20 or 30 men. . In loose lodes and in killas districts they
often cut more than this, but often they do not cut so much.
It is to be recollected that the lode is very rarely so wide as
the gallery, so that it becomes necessary, in order to continue
this of the proper size, to hew through the solid rock on each
side, which is often very hard, even when the lode is soft. The
Cornish miner never sleeps or eats under ground, but returns
to grass (the technical name of the surface) and to his home,
often many miles distant, at whatever depth he may be work
ing when relieved. . The mode of ascent and descent in mines
is by means of vertical ladders fixed in the shafts.”
    * 3. Any person who calls to mind the manner, object, and
results of the common process of sinking wells, will be pre
pared to expect the presence of water in mines. The quantity
of this varies very much in different mines at the same time, and
in the same mines at different times. Some of the circumstances
that occasion this difference are very obvious; for instance, the
topographical relations of the surface, the nature of the rock
and lode, the number and size of the lodes, cross courses,
&c. Many galleries both on the lode and through the country,                •
   * In a note at the end of the paper Dr. Forbes thus corrects this state
ment respecting the employment of a pair of men:     “It should have been
observed, that only one pair can work in the extremity of a gallery, for
there are in general several pairs, stoping, or working horizontally, both-
over-head and under-foot, in each gallery.”

440             Summary Review    of the late Investigations
discharged by the pumps from many of the Cornish mines is
very considerable: thus Huel Abraham discharges, from the
depth of 1440 feet, about 2,092,320 gallons every 24 hours;
Dolcoath, from nearly the same depth, 535,173 gallons in
the same time; and Huel Wor, from the depth of 950 feet,
                                                                -

   “4. In giving an account of the ventilation of mines, it is
necessary to anticipate, in some degree, the result of our            in
vestigations respecting temperature, and to notice the degree
of heat that is found in the air, water, and earth, at the bot
tom of mines. The precise degree of this temperature will
be hereafter stated; it will suffice here to mention that it ex
ceeds 80° in the deepest mines; that it amounts to 70° at a
less depth than 1000 feet; and that it is 5° or 6° above the
mean temperature of the climate at no greater depth than from
200 to 400 feet.    The existence of this temperature at the
bottom of mines (however produced) will, of itself, necessarily
occasion a constant circulation of air upwards through the
shafts; and, as what ascends must be replaced by the air above,
there will of course be a constant current downwards, through
the same or other shafts.    The extent of ventilation in mines
will depend on many circumstances, more especially on their
depth, the number of shafts, the degree of communication
between the different galleries, and also on the state of the
wind at the surface.      #. cooling effect of high winds is very
perceptible even at the bottom of shallow mines, and it appears              i
that the currents of air in the very deepest mines are consi
derably influenced by the force and direction of these.”
   “For the following observations on this subject, relative to
the magnificent mine of Dolcoath, I am indebted to Mr. John
Rule jun., one of the superintendants.                “I
                                                 have made some
experiments to ascertain the direction of the currents of air in
this mine, and find that in 25 of our principal shafts (the whole
of those open on the main lode) 13 have a strong current of
air downwards, and 12 about the same degree of current up
wards; they differ however with respect to the strength of the
currents, some being very strong, others less so.           neverI
made any experiments to ascertain the currents of air before;
but from common observation, I am enabled to state that

 INearliest
       the last lecture it was inferred from the language of the
               poets, that several of the metals were operated
 upon by means not very dissimilar from those now in use.
 Steel had even an appropriate name among the Romans,           di
 stinguishing it from iron, and this name was said to be derived
 from that of a people distinguished for their skill in the ma
nagement of their iron mines. The discovery of this prepara
tion of the metal would argue considerable advancement
                                                     -           in
 knowledge of this sort.
    We find some of the earliest specimens of weapons to be
 made of an alloy of copper with tin, which forms a metal        al
 most as hard as steel, without however possessing the other
 valuable properties of the latter.      There would be great pro
 bability in this being made before steel, and being applied to
similar uses; but we are not without evidence on this head, as
Hesiod expressly says, that in the early ages the arms and      in
struments of the primitive heroes were composed entirely of
 brass.                -
    Lucretius also, speaking of the weapons of the ancients,
 says that the use of brass was known before that of iron.
    The Phoenicians, a people derived from the Canaanites,
and whose existence as a separate nation ceased 6 or 700 years
before Christ, were famous for many arts, such as weaving fine
linen, making glass, and particularly are recorded as having
extraordinary skill in working the metals.        Their fame was
high for taste, design, and ingenious invention, and their com
merce so extended by their industry and knowledge, that their
ships even reached this country, and visited Cornwall - for the
tin which they purchased there.
    After the Phoenicians, we find the arts which they possessed
principally in the hands of the Egyptians, and that a consi
               º
derable quantity of real chemical knowledge which the pos
session of such arts would indicate, became mixed up, accord
ing to the custom of the country, with fable and hypothesis,
and passed            into the hands of their priests.
… This seems to have been the case even in the time of Pliny:
it was, however, communicated probably to the Alexandrian
Greeks, among the famous mysteries of the time; and as the

 complicated oeconomy of the Egyptian hierarchy declined, by
 the consequences of the Roman conquest and other causes,
 the knowledge of some of their arts became diffused into
 rope, and with it the spirit that pervaded their philosophy.
                                                                                         Eu
    To this we may trace the study of Alchemy, which has been
called “an art without art, the beginning of which is falsehood,
the middle hard labour, and the end beggary.”
    Such a summary condemnation ought not however, perhaps,
to be passed on a pursuit which at any rate has procured for
after times much knowledge, merely because we with superior
knowledge can see the absurdity of many of                pretensions, its
 or   can detect the imposture            of
                                        many                of

they imagined           certain mysterious sympathy between the

metals and the heavenly bodies                 of
                                           our solar system; they de

     With such motives, great ardour, and often with a large
share of real chemical knowledge, it is not to be wondered at
that the adepts, as they were          made many discoveries and
inventions, and that modern times should have benefited by
them. The treatment of the ores, and the reduction and the
processes for refining the metals, have therefore long been con
ducted with expertness; though it may be due to the great
improvements in chemical science of later times, that we are able
to explain satisfactorily the principles on which they depend.
   To come to a complete understanding relative to the pro
cesses of smelting, or the reduction of the ores so as to obtain
the pure metals, we must bear in mind the compound nature
of these substances; observing, First, that           the ores are           all
much mixed with earthy matter even after the operation                                            of
dressing      washing, which has been described,
                or                                       that these                so
earthy parts often bear large proportion

   Secondly, That volatile mineralizers,        substances which       or

used in iron       foundries,    where pig-iron is simply melted for
making various articles of cast-iron; and similar furnaces are
in use in what are called the blowing-houses in Cornwall, for
the finer kind of tin called Grain-tin.          Blast furnaces of a small
kind, called Hearths, are much employed also in Cumber

verberatory furnaces at a moderate red heat. In the copper
works in South Wales, each furnace contains full three tons of
raw ores, which are frequently turned, to expose fresh surfaces,
for twelve hours.                                     -
    Lead ores are treated in the same manner, in the same fur
nace often, which with a higher heat is used to melt them, and
the charge seldom exceeds a ton.
    Tin ores being, as has been explained, simple oxides, and
not decomposable in this way, are roasted or calcined princi
pally to alter the specific gravity of the pyrites with which they
are mixed, which thus may be separated by subsequent dressing
or washing. The furnaces for this purpose in Cornwall are
called burning-houses.
    Iron ores, though commonly oxides, are often mixed with
sulphurets or iron pyrites, and are roasted to free them from
the sulphur; this however is not done in furnaces, but the ore
is stratified with refuse coal and burnt in large heaps in the
open air.
     At the Paris and Mona copper mines in the island of
Anglesea, where the ores are poor in metal, but contain a
large proportion of sulphur, they are treated in the same way,
except that they do not find it necessary to use coal, as a small
quantity of wood is sufficient to set the ore on fire, and com
bustion goes slowly on, owing to the sulphur; a heap of 300
or 400 tons is eight months in burning, and some of the sul
phur is sublimed and is condensed in chambers or vaults to
which the flues are conducted.
     In the process of calcination sulphur is generally inflamed,
and uniting with the oxygen of the atmosphere is converted
into sulphurous acid gas, which mixed as it is with the vapour
 of certain volatile metals, such as arsenic, zinc, antimony or
 lead, forms a dense and suffocating smoke destructive of ve
 getation, but it does not appear so prejudicial to animal life,
 except where lead is prevalent.      Whoever has seen the coun
 try round the copper works at Swansea, will have observed
 the desolating effect of the smoke; and yet it is proved on the
 best evidence that the men are not subject to any peculiar dis
 ease.    One set of works there belonging to Messrs. Vivians,

 degree,_for one calcination does not effect this completely,–

naces at a high degree           of heat, and the slag is raked off in a
fluid state.
   Lead and tin ores are treated in nearly a similar manner.
   Iron smelting is carried on in blast furnaces of very large
dimensions, in which coke is employed as fuel, and limestone
is used as a flux. Copper of the first flowing is in part com
bined with sulphur, so as to require subsequent calcinations
and repeated fusions before it comes to the refining process.
   Lead is generally produced pure in one operation from the
reverberatory furnace, and also from the blast-furnace, where
the sulphur is dissipated partly by the application of heat, and
                                                             -
partly by combining with the lime which is used.
   Tin being produced from an oxide, some carbonaceous
matter, such as smallcoal, is used in mixture with the ores; the
carbon unites with the oxygen and leaves the metal pure, ex
cept as it may happen to be mixed with other metallic sub

  By the operations which have been described, the whole
metallic contents of the ores are produced in a separate state, -
the volatile part being dissipated by calcination, and the earthy
part by being converted into slag, which is easily detached
from the metal: it is evident however, that if more metals than
one exist in the ores, they will                 reducedall    be

 by a heat which melts it out from the copper. This process
 is called Eliquation. The silver is separated from the lead
 afterwards by cupellation, which is a process adapted also to
 procuring gold.
    Where metals in the state of oxide are to be reduced into
 their malleable or proper form, it is done by fusion in con
 tact with carbon, as was described in the case of tin ores; and
  they are therefore mixed with smallcoal, wood, or charcoal.
  The oxygen leaves the metal, and forms, with the carbon, car
  bonic acid, which escapes.       Thus litharge, which is the oxide
  of lead obtained    by cupellation,   is again brought into the state
  of lead: this process is called Reviving.

     This  is a complicated and expensive mode, as it always
  wastes some of the mercury, which is very costly: however, it
  is in very general use, and is conducted with great precision
  in Germany; the process was much improved by Baron Born
  in 1786. The original application of this method seems to
 have been in Mexico, in 1566, by a Spaniard called Don Pe
 dro Fernandez de Velasco.          It is much eulogized by foreign
 writers, but I have often thought it might be superseded with
 advantage by simpler processes of smelting and cupellation,
 as practised in England; and I believe an attempt of this kind
 is now making by English smelters in Peru. A German
 mineralogist of the name of Raspe some time since translated
 Baron Born's works into English, and in a preface strongly
 recommended amalgamation to our copper miners in Corn
 wall.   As the ores now raised there amount to 100,000 tons
 in a year, it is not very likely that we should substitute mer
 cury for coal.
    The metals raised in this country form an important part
of our national wealth: they are exported in considerable quan
tities in their unmanufactured state; but a greater proportion
are worked up into innumerable forms, and thus contribute
much more largely to the general stock, in the employment
and encouragement of industry and ingenuity.
    The most important metals produced in Great Britain are:
                    Iron—Copper—Lead—Tin.
With respect to the first, the iron-works of this country, as is
well known, are of immense extent, and are rapidly increasing
in produce.       By improved methods of manufacture, iron has
of late   years   been much reduced in price, and this has           in
creased the demand both at home and abroad.

    Of the   softer metals Mr. Taylor spoke with more certainty,
as   being  largely  interested in their production from mines in
different   parts  of the kingdom; of these copper is the most
valuable.

    The quantity raised in the last year, he stated, was about
 10,000 tons, which, however, is less by near 1000 tons than
 the preceding year, the falling off being owing to the unfa
 vourable effect of a low price upon some of the deep and ex
 pensive mines.
    About 8000 tons of copper, or 4-5ths, are produced in Corn
 wall, and the remainder in Anglesea, Devon, Ireland, and
 Staffordshire.
    In the year 1800 the quantity of copper raised in the Cornish
 mines was between 5 and 6000 tons; so that there has been an
 increase since that time of from 2 to 3000 tons.

   M. Plana of Turin has just published an excellent memoir
on the theory of astronomical refraction; in which, amongst
other things, he refutes the theory of Dr. Young, and points
out a singular mistake into which he has fallen, in his paper
inserted in vol. 58 of this Magazine.
                  Preparing for Publication.
   Mr. J. F. Daniell, F.R.S., has in the press a volume of Me
teorological Essays, embracing, among others, the following
important subjects: the Constitution of the Atmosphere; the
Radiation of Heat in the Atmosphere; Meteorological Instru
ments; the Climate of London; the Construction and Uses of
                                    —

    We   are very happy to learn that arrangements have been made for se
 curing the regular continuance of that truly national work, the Flor A
 LoNDINENsis. One Number of the new Edition of the OLD SERIEs (or that
 which was edited by Mr. Curtis, but which had long been wholly out of
 print); and one Number of the Continuation, or NEw SERIES, are hence
 forth to appear on the first day of each month, until the Old Series shall
 be completed, which will take place in about nine months; when the Con
 tinuation alone will be regularly carried on as heretofore.
    During Mr. Curtis's lifetime it is well known that he had it in contem
 plation to make the FLORA LoNDINENSIs, notwithstanding                    its

 all the plants of Great  Britain;  and     he
                                             had  already  introduced some plants
 whose habitats were far removed from the environs              the Metropolis.

the present session.   Several valuable presents were received.
The reading of Mr. Baily's paper “On the Mercurial Com

mences his paper with an account of the experiments made for
the purpose of determining the rates of expansion of the va
rious substances used in the construction of such pendulums:
and has given a table, whereby the results of those experi
ments may be readily seen.    He has brought forward upwards
of 30 different values for the expansion of mercury only, as
stated by different authors; and has shown that none of these
can be safely applied to experiments with the compensation

     pendulum, without certain modifications which he has pointed
     out in the paper.    He then investigates the principles of the
     compensation pendulum, and deduces a formula for determin
     ing the height of the quicksilver in the cylinder; the result of
     which is different from those given by preceding writers on
     this subject. After this, he suggests some improvements on
     the usual mode of constructing and regulating this pendulum.
     He proposes the adoption of a slider on the rod, for this latter
     purpose, similar to the mode recommended by Huygens; and
     he has given a table for determining the effect of a slider of
     this kind, which need not be more than 1-1000dth part of the
     weight of the mercury.      By means of such a slider the clock
     can be regulated to a much greater degree of accuracy, than
     by means of the usual fine screw at the bottom of the rod.—
     The author closes his paper by suggesting an oeconomical
     pendulum made of wood and lead, which would cost but a few
     shillings, but which might be made available for many useful
     purposes.

     new method,    of confining the observations to those stars which

      and must not be confounded with the old and inefficient mode

     meridian on the same day. . We know not whether any thin
     of this kind is attempted at the Greenwich Observatory.
     a measure might perhaps have saved much of the expense
     which has been incurred in determining the difference between
     the meridians of Paris and Greenwich: an expense which has

parts of the country, interspersed by a great number of date
trees (Phaenia dactylifera).    At this season (April 1819) the
river was very low, with scarcely any stream, and in many
parts the water had formed large stagnant pools. In the course
 of a walk along the bed of the river,       observed that on the        I
margin of one of the above pools the ground for a considerable
 space appeared beautifully white: on examining it closely,                                                      I
found it covered with a fine pure saline efflorescence, in ge
neral about 2-10ths or 3-10ths of an inch in depth, covering
a soft, wet, and slippery mud; the taste and appearance of this
salt induced me to conclude that it was carbonate of soda,
which I found to be the case on taking some of it to my tent.
I  was naturally anxious to make some search to discover the
extent of this bed, and whether similar beds might not be found
                                                                         j

                   am convinced that with a little care a pound
