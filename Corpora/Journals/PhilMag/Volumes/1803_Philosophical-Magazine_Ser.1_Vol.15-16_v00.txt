  I. On Indian Dogs.        By Dr.     Barton,     of Philadelphia*.
 J.T would     require much observation, many experiments, and
a great deal of time, to collect all the necessary materials for
an exacthistory of the native dogs of North America.               I am
by no means prepared for the ample task. My object, in the
present article, is much more limited — to bring together a
number of scattered facts relative to the origin and manners
of the different kinds of dogs which         were found among the
Indians when the Europeans first took possession of the coun
tries of North America.         In the investigation of this inquiry
I cannot pretend to be very methodical : nor do I expect to
avoid errors.     I aim, however, at correcting some of the er
rors of preceding writers.
    It has been asserted, by many historians and naturalists,
that there were no dogs in America prior to the discovery of
this portion of the world by the Europeans f. Mr. Pennant,
one_of these naturalists, remarks :
                                            " As it is certain that the
dog of North America, or rather its substitute, on its first
dilcovery by the English, was derived from the wolf tamed
and domesticated, so it is reasonable to imagine that of South
America had the same origin J." I do not think it suffi
ciently ascertained that there were not originally in America
any species of dog of the fame stock as thoie of the old world.
It has not yet been proved, that the dog of Newfoundland,
of which I am afterwards to make more particular mention,
was unknown in that island before its discovery by the Eu
ropeans.      But admitting that the Newfoundland species ot
variety originated from an admixture of the European dog
¦with the wolf, or some other native animal of the country,
it will still appear somewhat probable^ that the Indian dogs
in many other parts of America were not specifically different

from those of the old world.       This question is well worthy
of the attention of the naturalist, and is even entitled to the
notice of the civil historian of the new world.
                          Techichi, or Alco.
   Tn Mexico and in South America there was a small species
of dog, which the Mexicans called teebiebi, and the Peruvians
allco, or alco.  This is particularly mentioned by the Jesuit
Joseph   Acosta ", aud other of the earlier visitors of America.
The alco had a melancholy aspect, and was perfectly mute,
or dumb.      Hernandez speaks of it as being similar in nature
and manners to the common dogs of Europe, and not very
different in form f. It is remarkable that Linnæus has taken
no notice of this species, though he so frequently refers to
the work of Hernandez.        Mr. de Bu (Ton has confounded it
with the itaatintepot%otli, or next species, from which, how
ever, it appears to have been distinct        Gmelin, who has
                                               J.
fallen into a similar mistake (though the words of Hernandez
are sufficiently plain), considers the alco as a variety of the
canis familiaris, or taithful dog.       He calls it canis fami
liaris, Americanus.       Although I have little doubt that the
alco was a true canis §, I think it is too slightly mentioned
or described to enable us to determine, with as much cer
tainty as the naturalist could wish, whether it was merely a
variety of the common dog, or an entirely distinct species.
 It is to be resrretted, indeed, that the naturalists who visited
America in the sixteenth century, whilst the alco was still a
common animal, have left us (o much in the dark concern
ing its origin and nature. Owing to their negligence, we
are, at this distance of time, only permitted to (ay, with some
degree of probability, what it was not.       I do not, with Mr.
 Pennant, think it probable that it was derived from the wolf.
 Its entire muteness     is,  think, greatly opposed to this idea;

    § %Independent of the testimony ot Hernandez, there would seem to be
very litile doubt that the aho was     a   true (pecks of canis, and, indeed,
verv similar to some of our small house-dogs.      The Spaniards, according
to Clavigero, gave  it  the name of ftrro, which signifies a dog; and Acosta
observes, that the Indians ca.'led all the doi;s which were brought from
Spain ul 0, fiora the resemblance between them and their native animal.
It   isprobable that the Indians in Ibmc p.rts of South America had after
wards (pcihaps when "the aUo became cither veiy rare, or extinct) adopted
the Spanith word pero for do;.        The Jaioi, in  Guiana, used tins word
.it tcalt as early as 1633.  Dc Liet's Novus Orbis,   p.  643.

 as is also, perhaps, its complete domestication.           If it were
immediately derived from the wolf, we ought, at least, to
allow the Americans some share of merit for the successful
pains they had taken to reclaim this animal from the wild
ferocity of his nature.
    This species or variety of dog appears to have been pretty
extensively diffused through the southern parts of the conti
nent of America, and certainly existed in some of the islands
when they were first discovered by Columbus. Peter Martyr,
and after him other historians, mention the discovery of mute
little dogs in the island of Juanna in the year i4Q3.          Martyr
fays they were deformed in shape, and that the savages ate of
them as the Europeans did of goats».                I cannot find that
this species was discovered among any of the Indian tribes
inhabiting the tract of country now called the United States.'
It is not certain, indeed, that the dogs which Soto found in
Florida were not of the alco kind : I think it highly proba
ble, however, that they were not, but that they were much
more allied to the wolf and fox, like the modern Creek dogs,
which I am afterwards lo mention.
    It would appear from Clavigero, that the alco is now en
tirely extinct.      " After the conquest of Mexico," fays this
author,     "  the Spaniards, having neither large cattle nor slieep,
provided     their markets with this quadruped; by which means
the species was soon extinct, although it had been very nur
merous f ."
                           Itzcuintepotzotli.
    The itzcuintepotzotli was the Mexican name for another
species or variety     of dog, which is figured and described by
Fabri    % ansl" by Clavigero, whose figure is borrowed from that
of    the  Italian naturalist.    If the figure be an accurate one,
the animal must have been of a very deformed aspect ; and
as such, indeed, it is described.          It was about the size of a
Mallesan dog, or rather larger. The head was very small,
the ears pendulous, and the eyes soft and pleasing. The nose
had a considerable prominence in the middle, and its tail was
very small.       But the most striking feature of the animal was
a protuberance upon its back, not unlike that upon the Ara
bian camel. The (kin was varied with white5 tawny, and
black.
    This species particularly abounded in the kingdom of Mi-

chuacan, the most westerly part of the old empire of Ana-
huac. The natives of Michuacan called it abora, or abora.
It is said, by Clavigero, to be almost wholly extinct*.
    Th,e itzcuintepolzotli bears no resemblance whateyer to the
wolf, from which it is not probable that it was derived.            It
has much more the aspect of some of the domesticated dogs;
and Hernandez informs us, that it resembled them in nature
and in manners.            That it was a species of canis is very pro
bable; but that it was a mere variety of the common dog is
much more uncertain.             I rather suspect it was not. We are
not, indeed, permitted to decide this matter with certainty.
One essential difference between the two animals we are able
to collect : the Mexican clog is said to have six teats, whereas
 the common dog has ten.
    Buffon, Pennant, and Gmelin, have confounded this ani
mal with the alco.           Hernandez, however, plainly speaks of
 them as two distinct animals \; as does also the abbe Cla
vigero %.        It is probable, however, that they were considera
 bly  allied   to  each other.
    Either this species or the techichi, perhaps both, were
 brought to the market of the city of Mexico, along with
 deer, rabbits, and many other animals, before the conquest
 of tbe Spaniards. Gage fays these animals were fold either
 " by quarters or whole."            If would appear from the fame
 writer, that these dogs were sometimes castrated for food §.
 These simple facts are calculated, with many others, to show
 that the Mexicans, at the time they were discovered, had
 actually advanced, in many respects, towards the attainment
 of that police, those arts and practices, which are never ob
 served among people in the savage forms of society.           Another
 century, but for the discovery ofColumbus, would have con
 ducted these unfortunate Americans much nearer to the con
 dition of their conquerors; but it is to be seared that many
 centuries would have been requisite to have weaned them from
 their hideous religion, which was the foundation of their
 savage practices and manners.             The history of mankind ex
 hibits abundant proofs of this position, that the arts which
 they practise, and the police winch they observe, are no cer
 tain evidences of a truly civilized state. A mild religion ap
 pears to be absolutely necessary to the attainment and the
 preservation of this happy state of man.

   We know not whether                   the tecbicbi and the itzcuintepotr.otli
fcrere found in any of the countries considerably to ihe north
of Mexico. We are well assured, however, that different
kinds of dogs were very common in many of the countries
of North America, when this continent was first discovered
by the Europeans, in the 16th and 17th centuries. I am
even inclined to think that North America was much better
supplied with dogs (I mean these animals in the domesticated
state) than South America and Mexico.         There seems to be
little doubt that in the northern countries there was a greater
variety than in the southern countries.     Florida abounded in
these animals.    When Fernando de Soto marched his army
through that country, in the year 1540, the Indians supplied
him with great numbers of dogs.          On one occasion, an
Indian cacique sent the Spanish general no less than three
hundred dogs *. These were eaten by the Spaniards, who
deemed them not inferior to the best of slieep \.      But we are
informed that the Indians did not eat them %.             It would
seem that the Spaniards did not always stand upon the cere
mony of waiting to have the dogs presented to them.           The
Portuguese author of Elvas, who accompanied Soto and his
successor in their mad ramble, informs us, that, during the
time the army laboured under a scarcity of meat, " he who
 could catch a dog in any village thought himself a very happy
 man ; for sometimes (he observes) we found thirty in a place;
 but the soldier that killed one, and sent not a quarter to his
 captain, suffered for      paying dear for his incivilities when
                                it,
lie was to go sentinel, or upon any guard of fatigues."
     We are not told what kind of dog was that the Spaniards

not eat their dogs-    The present which Soto received at Ocute, in the
country of the Creek Indians, rather favou is the opinion that they did.
The cacique sent the Spanish general " two thoulanil Indians, with pre       a

dogs."       Relation, &c. p. 55.

whv did they suppose the Spaniards were fond o" them           ?   It   true, there
                                                                        is

supposed that any kind of food would be acceptable to an army of hungry
men.     Besides, it is probable they had many opportunities of seeing the
Spaniards employed        stealing their dogs.

found among these Indians. There do not appear to be good
grounds to suspect that they were of the alco or itzcuintepolz-
etli kinds.     It is certain that neither of these animals is now
known among any of the Floridian Indians ; and it does not
seem likely that the breeds which these Indians at present
possess have been reclaimed from the wild state since the
time of Soto's "mad adventures."
    The dogs which are now in use among the Creeks, Chik-
kasah, and other southern tribes, are of diffeirr.t kinds.                As
far as I have been able to collect information concerning
them, thev, in general, bear a very strong family resemblance
to the wolf.       One kind is very similar to the cants Iycaon, or
black wolf, of which I have already made mention.                       It is
 not, however, always black, but of different colours, com
 monly of a b:y colour, and about one-third less than the
 wild black wolf.         It carries its ears almost erect, and has the
 fame wild and            fly
                         look that the wolf has *.
    The other kind of d:>g            smaller thaiiPthe one just men
                                        is
 tioned, and        more like the common red fox. Both kinds
                    is
 bark, but not         much as the common dogs; and their bark
                         so
is  different from that of our dogs, being more nearly allied
 to the howl of the wolfs.
    I  am unable to fay, with certainty, whether these southern
 dogs differ very essentially from those among the northern In
 dians.   I   rather suppose they do not.              know, at least, that
                                                            I
 among     the latter,  as   well  as  among    the  former, there are two
 species  or  varieties;    one   which    has  generally been considered
 as the wolf merely altered              the domesticated state, and the
                                             by
 other more allied to the fox. But as my information con
 cerning the northern dog             more correct and particular than
                                        is

 speaking principally       of  the   former,    in the following descrip
 tion os the Indian dogs.
    The Indian dog            mean that which
                                (I                        most allied to the

                                        the traders   and  others, the balf-
 wolf   breed.    His     general aspect          much is more   that of the
 wolf than of the common domesticated dogs.                   His body, in
 general,      more slender than that of our dogs.

owing to the greater intercourse which has subsisted between these Indians
and the whites.   The Cherakee themselves are        much mixed with the

He has a long small snout, and very sharp nose *. His bark
ing is more like the howling of the wolf.      When attacked,
and when fighting, he does not shake his antagonist, like our
dogs.     His teeth are very (harp, and his bile sure. When
he snarls, which he is wont to do upon the slightest occasion,
he draws the skin from his mouth back, presenting all his
teeth to view.    Our dogs, when once attacked by these In
dian dogs, always fear and shun them.       It is a very curious
circumstance, that the Indian dog will never attack or pursue
the wolf, which the common dogs so readily do.          This fact
seems to point very strongly to the origin of the American
animal.     For the purposes of hunting, the Indian dogs are
very useful ; but, in other respects, they are by no means so
docile as the common dogs.        They have less fidelity ; for,
though never so well fed, they will steal from their masters f.
 In sliort, every thing shows that the Indian dog is a much
more savage or imperfectly reclaimed animal than the com
mon dog.
    If my information has been correct, this species or breed is
still preserved in the greatest purity among the Six Nations,
from whom the Delawares acknowledge that they received it.
The Delawares call this dosr lenebum, or lemii-cbum, which
signifies
           " the original beast." The Nanticokes call him
ibn-ivallum ; the Mahicans, annun-neen-dee-a-oo, or " the
original dog," to distinguish him from our common dogs,
which they call simply dee-a-oo, or dea-oo.
    These appellations show that the Indians consider their
wolf dog as a native of the country, and that they are not
incapable of discerning the differences between this animal
and the greater number of the varieties of dogs which have
been introduced into America bv the Europeans.
   The origin of the Indian dog is a question of much more
difficulty than some naturalists have imagined        Thus, Mr.
Lawson seems to suppose that the dogs which he saw among
the Indians of North Carolina were merely wolves, •' made
tame with starving and 'beating; J." This is easy natural his
tory. Mr. Pennant, as we have already seen, supposed that
the dog of North America was derived from the wolf, tamed
   • Some
            persons inform me, that many of the Indian digs haie a large
white spot upon the breast.
   + This ;sserti)u, I nv.iA confess,    is opposed by the ti stimony of some

fidelity to their masters; but, bt;ing ill fed !>y them, are very troublesome

and domesticated     *. This opinion has been maintained by
other writers; but it is an opinion which must be admitted
with some limitation.        I am, indeed, much inclined to be
lieve that the Indian dog, in many parts of North America,
was derived from the wolf; but it remains to be proved that                         .
it  is,    any part of the continent, the pure or unmixed wolf,
          in
in state of domestication.
    a                                            It   is,
                                         more probably, an hybrid
animal, begotten between the wolf and some other animal,
perhaps the fox. Mr. Josselyn,           long time ago, considered
                                                       a
the dog of the New-England Indians as the produce of the
wolf and fox f. This           also the opinion of many well-in
                                        is
formed persons who have resided among, or visited, the In
dians.    I believe      the opinion which many of the Indians
                             it   is
themselves entertain concerning the origin of their dog.
    I have already observed that the Indian dog          sometimes   is
called the half-wolf breed.         This plainly fliovvs that those
 who have imposed this name did not view the American dog
 as a mere domesticated wolf.        In other words, mows that       it
 they considered him as an hybrid animal.            may add, that
                                                                 I
 Carver and other writers, who have enjoyed pretty extensive
 opportunities of observing the dogs of the Indians, merely
 speak of their resemblance to the wolf, without pretending
 to assert that they are only domesticated wolves                    \.
    Owing, however, to the great affinity which subsists be
 tween the Indian clog and the wolf, the savages         some parts  in
 of North America bestowed the fame name upon both of these
 animals.     Thus father Hennepin expressly informs us, that
 chonga         dog or wolf, in the language of the Issati and
               is   a
 Naudowessies.      In general, however, the Indians apply dif
 ferent names to the wolf and to the dog, whether           be their      it
 own (or native) dog, or those varieties which they have re
 ceived from the whites.          may add, that the Indians seem
                                             I
 also to have remarked the resemblance of some of their dogs
 to the fox; for the Mohawks "(or at least the Cochnewa-
 goes, who have sprung from the Mohawks) call the red fox
 cheets-hoo.    Now the Tufcaroras, who speak dialect of the     a
 language of the Mohawks,           call   dog cbeetb and cbeetht.
                                                            a
 Much dependence, however, should not be placed upon this
 application of names      for savages sometimes bestow the fame
                                   ;
 names upon species that are unquestionably distinct.

    We are not yet prepared, it is obvious, to give an exact
genealogical history of the Indian dog.                We are compelled
to mix conjecture with fact.               The anatomical structure of
the animal should be examined.                 But, whatever may have
been the origin     of this breed of dogs, I am disposed to think,
with Josselyn, that the savages found it in the woods, and
that it has existed as a distinct species, or breed, for a very
long period of time. Several of the earlier visitors of different
parts of North America speak of the existence of wild dogs
in the country. Renatus Laudonerius invaded Florida in the
year 1564, only a few years after the death of Soto.                    In his
enumeration of the native productions of the country he
mentions wild dogs.         There is no reason to suppose that he
has confounded them with the wolves: for he expressly fays
that the country produced, beside these dogs, some species of
wolves *.
    The discoverers of the island of Cape Breton, in the Gulf
of St. Lawrence, found in that island black dogs, which, we
 are informed, the Indians were very careful to bring up to
 huntings. I think it probable that both these and the does
mentioned by Laudonerius were the fame as the half-wolf
 breed  which    I have described.

 II. An   Account of a new Method of supplying Diving-bells
        tuitb fresh Air,       By Robert Healy, A. B.
     SIR,                  To    Mr.     Tillocb.       Dublin, Jan. 8, 1803,
                                                               James's-street.
     TAKE      the  liberty of communicating an experiment on
 diving, which was made last August by my father, Mr. Sa-
 muelHealy.        Should it appear worthy of holding a pkce in
 your very useful and instructive Magazine, you are at full

    THE    method of supplying            a   diving-bell   with air, which
 has hitherto been generally adopted, renders it almost imprac
 ticable either lo descend in water to any considerable depth,
 or to remain there a length of time sufficient to perform any
 thing useful.     Much inconvenience results from the attention
 which it is necessary to pay in admitting the supply from the
 barrels, which are used as reservoirs of air j much also from

                                of a new Method
  the labour and time which are expended in causing them to
  reach the bell.   The mode of supply which Mr. Healy con
  trived appears much calculated to remedy these inconveni
  ences.    A recital of the circumstances that attended Mr.
  Healy's experiment, it is hoped, will not prove uninteresting.
      Captain Lonfdale, of the Experiment, was employed to
 raise a brig which had foundered, in the year 1 799, in the
 Bay of Dublin, between Dunleary and Howth.              This he
 endeavoured to accomplish by fastening chains round the
 bow and stern of the sunken vessel, and by connecting to
 these a ring on each fide, through which cables pasted, and
 were lashed at low water across the deck of his ship, that
 acted as a buoy.     Consequently, on the tide rising, if the
 fastenings had not given way, the floating vessel must either
 have funk itself, or drawn the other upwards.
     Mr. Healy accompanied captain Lonfdale in this attempt,
 in order to put in practice his mode of supplying a diving-
 bell with air. The bell, which resembled a truncated cone,
 was made of wood, consisting of staves united by cooperage :
 the mouth was two feet and a half in diameter ; the top one
foot and a half: the height was four feet. Windows were
 placed at proper distances round the sides, and one at the
top : there was also an aperture in the top for letting out
foul air.    In the inside was suspended a stage for the purpose
of resting on. On the top was fixed an iron eye, through
which a cable passed for raising or lowering the bell. This
eye was secured to the bell by four iron bars, of an inch
square, that went down the fides and lapped under its edges.
Within six inches of the bottom was fixed a broad iron hoop,
of an inch thickness, from which weights were suspended to
fink the bell.
     On the ship's deck was lashed a forcing or condensing sy
ringe, capable os containing about two quarts, to which were
connected five faihom of iron tube, and to the end of this an
equal length of leathern tube that turned into the bell. When
the piston was depressed, the contained air passed through the
tubes, and was forced into the bell. Thus a constant stream
of air was forced down.
     Four hundred weight and a half being suspended in the
manner described, Mr. Healy was first let down rapidly,
when, on signifying his desire of ascending, his wisli was im
mediately complied with.       He stated, that great uneasiness
was felt, particularly in his ears, from such a sudden descent;
that there was sufficient light in the bell to enable him to
read by light reflected through the mouth of the bell without
removing the {butters of any of the windows; and also that
                                                              he

           of supplying Diving-bells with frejh Air.                II
he could see a good way down in the water. Having rested
a few minutes, and matters being arranged more satisfactorily,
he was lowered gradually, and remained stationary about a
minute at each fathom's depth ; the syringe supplying such a
constant stream of air, that the bell was supercharged, and
the signal of sufficiency was often repeated.           Having been
more than half an hour down, and for some time on the deck
of the sunken vessel, he gave the signal for ascending, and
was drawn up in the fame gradual manner in which he had
been let down.
    He said, that the very instant the mouth of the bell was
immersed a noise struck his ears, which went off upon his
resting at the distance of a fathom from the surface : the next
descent caused the same deafening sensation, the removal of
which    was   effected,  to a considerable degree, by repeated
yawnings.      No inconvenience        was felt by his respiring air
condensed by the pressure of fix or seven fathoms water.             A
slight giddiness remained a few minutes after his emerging,
and the blood-vessels about his face were a little swollen.
    In the night, the lashings having given way at high water,
one of the rings through which the cables passed fell to the
 bottom.     On the following day he descended, in a gradual
manner as before, to the depth of seven fathoms, in order to
raise the ring, and remained below for an hour and some
minutes.     Not the smallest inconvenience was felt in his
breathing.      After coming up he coughed, and a slight tinge
of blood appeared in his Ipittle. The fullness in his face, as
also the giddiness,     occurred as in the last experiment.          In
 this the bell did not appear to admit so much light as in the
former experiment, although the papers explanatory of the
communication of signals bv pulling the ropes (which, for
 precaution, were fixed to the inside ot the bell) were still le
gible.    With the syringe one man supplied seven gallons of
air in a minute, and, it necessary, could have supplied double
 that quantity.
    The following morning the wind rose to such a degree as
 to break both the cables and chains that were attached to the
sunken ship, arid of course interrupted the prosecution of
 further experiments ; which, however, at a future period,
 Mr. Healy hopes to resume. It is to be wished that other
 adventurers will make similar attempts, and improve on the
 hint which this trial affords ; for, to use the words of Seneca,

    Peculiar marks   I hold to be generally, if not always, defects; however
difficult it may be wholly to escape them.                Sir Jo/bua Reynolds.
   1 HE       word manner may be applied to colour, light and
shade,     and  penciling.        It is expressive of certain peculiar
marks that invariably characterize the works of each indi
vidual, as in some a blueness in the colouring prevails, in
others a gray or yellow, while others are distinguished by a
harshness in the shadows ; in one the penciling is round, in
another square or forked. So far is a new manner from being
a mark of genius, as ,some assert, that, could perfection in
painting ever be attained, it would be unaccompanied by any
peculiarity whatever.
     In that part of our education which is to be obtained by
copying, we ought to be particularly careful that the works
we copy, or the master we imitate, have a manner the purest
and the least vicious possible ; for we may rest assured, singu
larity, which in some is glaringly absurd, will be the first
portion we shall inherit.
     He who forms to himself a model in a master will be al
ways inferior to the archetype : the heads of all the great
schools have been superior to their imitators.                   Nature rises
in    the fame     degree over the servile and base.              M. Angelo
was superior       to  his  disciples,   and   that  in proportion to their
dependent       habit    of  thinking.      The    fame   cause placed Ra
phael,     Titian,   the  Caracci,   &c.    at  the  head  of certain classes
of artists, many of whom             have followed their masters limp-
ingly    and awkwardly.          The   fame baneful desire of imitation
is equally detrimental         to poets ; for the arts cannot be called
 liberal in the hands of those who want spirit to think for
 themselves.        Not to acknowledge the favours we receive
 would we illiberal, but to fink under them into a state of
 slavery is base.       The wisdom of the world may inform, but
 we must improve from ourselves; for precept will do but
 little if the mind is not susceptible of it ; the seed must be
 suited to the soil.        The mind, like a fine spring of water,
 will become more productive and clear the more it is used."
      Peculiarity is what chiefly characterizes the different mas
  ters.    We fay, for instance, the manner of Raphael is dry
                                                                          and

and hard, (hereby indicating the too violent display of out
line, the decisions and abrupt divisions in the shadows, with
the parts not sufficiently lost in their grounds.      That of Spa-
gniolet is forcible, with much red in the flesh ; while in that
of Rembrandt we expect little light, with a glow of colour,
that may too often be called rotten-ripe.          We may further
observe the dark manner of Guercino and the silver of Guido,
with many others not necessary to mention. What are those
differences in the various masters, but so many singularities
that characterize and distinguish the individual ?
    As perfection cannot be attained, every artist, of necessity,
will have a manner; but in proportion as he succeeds in ap
 proaching perfection will his manner become the more pure.
This he can only hope to attain by an extensive inquiry, that
 is,    not slavishly tying himself down to the imitation of an
       by
 individual.    He  is   bound to show in his works that he has
 opinions  of  his  own,  and that he dares to think for himself.
     Raphael's  first manner  was like that of his master Perugino   ;
 but this he soon quitted for sweeter mode of colour, which he
                              a
 caught from Da Vinci and Bartolomeo, and for more noble
                                                       a
 and elevated style, which he acquired from M. Angelo. Julio
 Romano imbibed much of the sire of his master, as did Rosso
 and Prematicio of theirs.      The Caracci adopted     a  most libe
 ral manner of imitation, founded on          a  combination of the
 excellences of all the great schools, and ultimately produced
 one entirely new.        Domenichino, Guido, Guercino, and
 Schidone, exhibit in their works but slight traces of the
 school they were formed in. Van Dyck             is
                                                   perfectly original.
  Our countryman Reynolds      is  an example of this liberal man
  ner of imitation;    we fee in his works the grace of Corregio
  and Parmegiano combined with the beauty and richness of
  Venetian colouring, accompanied with the cbiaro-scuro of
  the Flemish and Dutch. Le Sueur's first manner resembled
  his master Vouet, which he soon quitted, and made himself
               every part of the art.     Le Brun was influenced
  superior   in
  by the fame spirit of independence, and left his master far
  behind.
     Of those who have been destitute of the pride of independ
  ence, and have fallen into   a  narrow, confined, and illiberal

   to every one's recollection, whose works pass with the igno
   rant for those of their masters. Perhaps this difference in the
  works of artists may arise from the external objects and their
  images painted in the eye of some, not agreeing ; which may
  also account for the variation we observe between the bulk or
  altitude of bodies and their representations by various artists.
  This peculiar habit of seeing may constitute what we call
  manner.
      It is certain too much copying, or too great a devotion to
  the works of some favourite master, brings on a habit of see
  ing even nature with his imperfections.               Hence it   is,  that
  what    is termed the schools have in the end proved the ruin
  of art not because they were bad, but because weak men
        ;
  have been content with nature at second-hand            :   some author
  calls such people not nature's sons, but her grandsons.
     Before we quit this part of our essay we will just touch on
 the manner of penciling, also called handling. The use of the
  pencil    isdistinguished     into the smooth or mellow, and the
 expeditious or bold. The application of those manners must,
 in a    great degree, depend on the size of the picture to be
 painted, also its situation and subject.           As far as subject    is
 concerned, the former method best applies to objects in
 themselves beautiful        ;as elegant female figures, young and.
 sleek animals, pastoral, and all objects intended to delight.
 The latter manner will best associate with aged, broken, and
 irregular objects, and such scenes as are intended to excite
 terrible emotions.        The bold pencil of Rubens       is  highly ad
 mirable, and    is    a great beauty      in   his pictures; while the
 pencil   of Van   Dyck       more
                             is      soft and   mellow.     Claude had   a
 smooth pencil suiting his choice of subject          ; on the contrary,
 Salvator Rosa    is  bold, and well impasted with colour.             The
 pencil   of Titian is   a fine  example    for the  heroic in  landscape,
or what may be termed the historical style, and which, as
mentioned in our first essay, derives its name from the dig
nity of the objects of which the picture         is   composed.      Those
are mistaken who imagine          itderives its character from flight-
ness and indecision, and who dignify their own crude and
undistinguishable masses with that noble appellation.                  The
pencil of Titian    is  firm, bold, and at the fame time decisive,
and, in the higher style of landscape, may be offered as an
example worthy of our attention.              We sliall find numberless
examples in the Dutch school to direct our hand in the pas
toral and the pencil of young Teniers
      ;                                          is,  perhaps, the finest
in that part of the art. The pencil         is    not a mere vehicle for
laying on the colour, but its motion must express the cha
racter of the various objects           may be employed on.
                                       it                            As in

tle, in representing hair and wool ; the character and folds of

    As well as the manual practice, painting requires, 1. A
boldness of hand in the dead-colouring : a. In the second co
louring, more circumspection and labour : and, 3. Thorough
patience and attention in the retouching and finishing of the
picture.      These qualities can no more be separated than
Venus    and   the Graces.
    He who wishes to insure himself a good manner of pencil
ing should avoid copying such pictures as are imperfect in
 that respect; for, if we begin with a slovenly or bad one,
 every step will plunge us deeper in error.        But all attempts
 at painting will be vain if we do not possess the power to
 determine the form at once, which can only be acquired
 through a previous practice in drawing ; for on this the clear
 ness as well as the firmness of the penciling depends.
     There are two methods of preparing our picture : one                     is,
 to draw in the objects with their ground colour, carefully
 laying in the sliadows, dead-colouring the lights solid, and
 preserving the shadows transparent throughout the work in               ;
 the second stage, to correct the forms, and add to the darks
 where wanted        and, thirdly, after oiling out the parts, bring
                       ;
 ing the whole into harmony                glazing, scumbling, and
                                                by
 finishing with the extreme lights and darks. This direction
is   general   ;for, after the lights and darks are added, parts
  may require to be kept down, enriched, &c, as practice must
  direct. The second method          to dead-colour solidly through
                                         is
  out, and to finish the shadows         glazing. The latter method
                                               by
  admits of greater changes being made in the work during its
  progress than the former.

  J.  HESE experiments were made with foliated molybdena
 of Altenberg, in Saxony, prepared in the following manner:
   After having separated the metal from all quartzy parts,                       it
 was reduced into an acid                by
                              long exposure to    red heat in      a
 an open crucible.  This acid was then dissolved in hoiling

 tS          On the Colouring and Mordant Property
  water, and saturated with potash.     The molybdate of potash
  being soluble in a much larger quantity of cold water than
  the free molybdic acid, this acid was united to potash with
  a view that a more concentrated solution of it might be ap
 plied to the stuff, which, in regard to linen and cotton, is a
  matter of great importance.
     A. One part of this solution was diluted with ten or twelve
 parts of rain water; and a shred of raw white woollen (tuts,
 and another of white Saxon kerseymere, were boiled in it for
 half an hour. The two shreds assumed a grayish green co
 lour.    Both of them were then cut into small bits, for the
 purpose of subjecting them to the following experiments :
     These bits of cloth were put, ist, Into a boiling so
 lution of sulphate ef zinc very much diluted : 2d, A similar
 solution of acetite of lead : 3d, Another of sulphate of cop
 per : 4th, Another of tin in the sulphuric and muriatic acids:
 5th, Another of sulphate of iron : 6th, Of tin in simple mu
 riatic acid: 7th, Another of tin in acetous acid : 8th, An
 other of tin in nitro-muriatic acid by muriate of ammonia :
 9th, Into one of cobalt in nitric acid, rendered slightly mu
 riatic by muriate of soda : 10th, And into aqueous tincture
 of gall-nuts prepared cold, which communicated to woollen
 stun boiled in it a russet colour.
    The different pieces, after being boiled for a quarter of an
 hour in solution of molybdena, when washed and dried ex
 hibited different shades.
    B. A shred of white cotton cloth was immersed, cold, for
twelve hours, in a part of the solution of molybdate of potash
much diluted ; and it was then removed to a diluted solution
of tin in a mixture of the sulphuric and muriatic acids. The
stuff, which had not changed its colsur in the solution of
molybdena, assumed a bright blue colour somewhat dirty.
    The above two pieces of cloth which were treated with the
solutions of tin exhibited this peculiar phænomenon, that
on the edge, when cut, they were of a darker and purer blue
than externally.    Another circumstance, no less remarkable,
is, that these colours experienced from the light an effect con
trary to that produced on vegetable colours, which lose their
colour  by  exposure to the sun;    while that of molybdena ac
quiresa   double degree of intensity.    The green shades gene
rally passed to blue; but after some time resumed in the shade,
or when exposed to the moist atmosphere, their primitive
colour.
    However satisfactory these results nvght be, M. Jaeger
carried his researches still further, and endeavoured to obtain
colours better defined, and brighter ;    and particularly pure
                                                            blue

                    vs the Oxide  of Molybdena.                If
blue and green solutions of tin were those which seemed most
likely to accomplish that end.
     C. The solution of molybdate of potash was mixed, in
certain proportions, with pure solutions of tin in muriatic
acid, diluted in cold rain water.      Shreds of raw white wool
len stuff, moistened with boiling water, were boiled for half
an hour in this mixture.       The liquor was decomposed, de
posited    the tin under the form   of a gravish powder, and the
residuum assumed an agreeable blue colour, which was com
municated also to the Muss, but with a shade less pure.
     D. Not satisfied with this result, M. Jaeger tried to pre
 pare the stuff, before it was immersed in the bath of molyb
 dena, with different mordants ; such as sulphate and acetite
of alumine, diluted sulphuric and muriatic acid, acidulous tar-
 trite of potash, and others : but the result did not answer the
 object he had in view. He then thought it necessary to
 employ other means.
     E. A solution in excess of molybdate of potasti was then
 mixed with a saturated solution of tin ; the mixture was boiled
 for half an hour in a retort, and was afterwards left at rest
 for eight or ten days.     After this time, the liquid, which at
 first was of a grayish blue colour, was found changed into a
 bright dark blue, and had deposited a large quantity of gray
 oxide of tin. The liquid was decanted, and filtered through
 double paper.
      ist, This tincture communicated a bright blue colour to a
  shred of muslin, which had been left in it for a quarter of an
  hour after it had been diluted in two parts of water.
      2d, A shred of raw white woollen stuff was so strongly co
  loured by this tincture, that after ebullition for half an hour
  it came out dyed of a pure saturated blue colour.
      As the tincture did not appear to be exhausted of colour,
  there were boiled in it for half an hour, each after the other,
      3d, A slired of woollen stuff.
     4th, A shred of the same kind.       The two slireds acquired
  a blue colour, decreasing in intensity.
      To ascertain how far the blue colour of the woollen cloth
  could be fixed, a shred of stuff was boiled for an hour in one
   part of blue tincture diluted with half a part of water. Its
   colour was not darker than that of No. 2.
       The dyed slired was then cut into two parts, and one of
   them was boiled for a quarter of an hour in the fame tinc
   ture, to which a little of the solution of tin had been added.
   Its colour this time was more intense.
       The colour in these experiments had distributed iiself per
   fectly, and had united iu so intimate a manner with the siLrvs

of  the woo!, that the stuff had all the appearance of wool dyed
with indigo.      After this success, M. Jaeger endeavoured to
unite the colour of molybdena with other vegetable colours,
and to transport it in that state to stuffs.    The results of this
labour were as follow :
    F. Different slireds of woollen cloth, to which a greater or
less blue colour had been communicated by tincture of mo
lybdena, were boiled for half an hour in a cold aqueous in
fusion of quercitron bark.      They acquired different shades of
green, but which did not possess all the purity and uniformity
which could have been wished.           He therefore thought that
it would be necessary to change a little his process.
    G. Different stireds of woollen stuff were boiled for a longer
or stiorter time in an infusion of quercitron bark, with a view
to communicate to them different shades of yellow.            The
quantity of blue tincture necessary for each shade of yellow,
beginning with the weakest, was added to the infusion, which
was in a great part exhausted.        In this manner, shades of
green,   not  inferior in beauty  to Saxon  green, were obtained
by   an ebullition  of half an hour.
    H. In other experiments, sometimes the blue tincture and
sometimes the molybdate of potash was tried, either by com
bination with vegetable colours, or alone, as mordants or mo
difiers. The results in general were very satisfactory. Several
of the colours thus obtained were so fixed and unalterable in
the fun and air, and by strong acids, that no other colour
could be compared with them in this respect.
   M. Jaeger terminates his interesting labour by announcing
a black colour, furnished to him by a composition of molyb
date of potast), acetite of alumine, aiid logwood.     This black
having been tried, in regard to durability, as compared with
common black, by boiling both for a quarter of an hour in
diluted sulphuric acid, that of molybdena was scarcely changed,
while the other lost its colour entirely, and passed to a burnt
yellow.
   The author adds also, that the blue tincture of molybdena,
evaporated in a gentle heat, furnished a very sine blue, solu
ble in water, which might be used for writinsr, and even for
painting, in the same manner as anv other colouring juice.
   It appears from these experiments that molybdena may be
come a very valuable colouring matter in the art of dyeing.

  1   HE     machine being constructed, it only remains to sill
it with inflammable air (hydrogen              gas).    The usual method
of procuring inflammable air is oy the solution of iron in sul
phuric acid or common oil of vitriol : for this purpose a
number* of air-tight casks are disposed in circles of ten or
twelve in each circle.           The casks composing one circle com
municate, by their individual tubes, to one centre cask con
taining water, whose height must be such as that the orifice
of each tin tube should be some inches under the fluid f . The
centre casks (or coolers, as they are technically termed) are
the only ones immediately connected with the balloon, and
 that by varnished silken tubes proceeding from their sum
mits : there must also be a second orifice in the head of each
 cask composing the circles; each such orifice being for the
purpose of introducing the ingredients, and provided also with
 an air-tight plug. The iron (of which the turnings from the
boring of cannon are reckoned the best) being placed in the
 casks, the diluted acid         J  (having been previously well mixed
 in a separate vessel purposely provided) is to be poured upon
it, stopping up the orifice with the plug as soon as the smell
of the gas is perceived : the quantity of acid first put into
each cask must be half the requisite proportion for the weight
of iron therein contained; and this rule must be observed
throughout the whole number of casks, so that on the second
 subsequent addition the aggregate quantity of gas fliall be
 produced §.
                                                                          The
    s This was the method adopted
                                        by Mr. Garnerin ; but its complexity
renders it very exceptionable, as in other experiments two or three calks
hive been made to answer all that he effects with thirty, and in much less
time.
    t  Without this precaution the inflammable air is liable to carry along
"with it some of the acid in a vaporous state, which in on'- instance became
gradually condensed       in the balloon when arrived to a colder region, de
luging the aeronaut with some quarts cf this acidulous liquor.
    \ It is necessary to dilute the acid in a separate vessel, not merely on
 account of the great difference in the respective gravities of the acid and
water, which renders stirring neceffarv, but also on account of the great
quantity of heat liberated, which is sufficient to occasion ebullition in lome
instances, and might derange the apparatus.
   § This is the method adopted by some cxptriincnrers; but a more ex
pedient one deserves to supersede it; especially as by nearly the like and
undermentioned       process Messrs. Baldwin, Sadler, and Lunardi, success
fully inflated their machine in two hours.

    The iron      must be particularly attended to to insure suc

ally injurious, by generating hydro-carbonate, a gas specifi
                                                                            cally
    The quantity of hydrogen gas developed during the action of diluted
sulphuric acid upon iron, varies not only according to the strength of the
acid, but the quality of the iron employed.         Dr. Priestley (Experiments
and Observations on Air, vol. vi.) found that annealed cast iron invariably
afforded more inflammable air than iron which had not undergone that
process; the difference being nearly i-8th. Thus iron turnings, as being
in some degree annealed, gave considerably more air than only cast iron,
yet less than iron nails perfectly annealed.      Mr. Cavendish also obtained
from an ounce of zinc 356 ounce measures of inflammable air; from the
fame quantity of iron 412 measures; while tin afforded him only half the
quantity yielded by iron.       Supposing then we are about to inflate a bal
loon of 30 feet diameter, it will require, agreeably to Mr. Cavendish's ex
periments, about two ounces and a half of iron for each cubic foot of in
flammable air, or 2100 pounds of iron to be dissolved in order to com
pletely fill the machine ; and to produce this solution there will altogether
be required an equal weight of concentrated oil of vitriol, and six times
this weight of water.     But completely filling a balloon before its ascension
is useless; because the density of the surrounding medium, immediately
decreasing, will cause an equally premature expansion of the gas, and re
quire its escape even before it attains 1000 yards height: the proportional
product, therefore, of 2000 pounds of metal will be as much as may with
propriety be applied to a machine of 30 feet diameter.
    Having proceeded according to the rules hereafter laid down for ascer
taining the requisite quantity of materials agreeably to their respective
purity, provide next two large cylindrical wooden vessels open at the top,
and shaped as inverted truncated cones, each vessel capable of containing
about 1000 gallons, so that the two may hold in the sequel the whole
quantity of materials.      In each of these vessels dispose planes of lattice or
basket-work,     at intervals of six or eight inches above each other (their
diameters corresponding to the diameter of the part of the vessel each
plane is to rest upon), adding a sufficient number' of them till within a
foot of the surface at which the diluted acid will stand when the whole
quantity shall have been added.       The use of these planes h for dividing
the iron into many portions, so as to expose as large a surface as possible to
tiie action of the acid : the weight of iron, supposing the vessel to contain
tL-n of these planes, will be 100 pounds upon each ; which weight will
suffice for keeping them steadv, without having recourse to other methods
of fixing them to the vessel itself; while the gas will easily find a passage
for itself from the lower through the superior planes by the interstices in
the basket- work.
    Having thus disposed of the iron so as that the two vessels shall contain
their specific proportion, amounting together to the whole of the required
quantity, provide for each vtfsel an appropriate head, of somewhat left
diameter than its upper rim, that when t'nced therein it may rest an inch
or two below the level of the fame, in order that a thin stratum of water
may lie over the whole surface, and render the head completely tight.
From the centre of the head must proceed a cylindrical tube ot tin six
inches in diameter and one foot in height ; whence forming a right angle
it should proceed about six feet, and then descend by an obtuse angle whose
cxtiemity should terminate in an ascending nook, converging      *    till its cx-

devoid of grease, as the smallest stratum of greasy matter will

as easily to be placed under, and six or eight inches below, the bale of the
inverted funnel of the reservoir.     Besides this central tube there must be
a lateral one of an inch diameter and six inches in height, provided with
an air-tight wooden stopper.    Th:out;li the head must also be fixed a glass
or pewter tube bent to form an inverted syphon, the shorter leg of which
must be placed so as to be included in the vessel, while the longer leg
(of two feet in length) will remain on the outside. A third vessel must
also be provided, as a reservoir or cooler, capable of holding from 200 to
300 gallons, open at top, yet not more than three feet deep.        Across its
diameter, and eight or ten inches below its upper rim, fix two strong
wooden bars as supports, to which fix an inverted wooden funnel (the
base of which must not be less than two feet diameter) whose upper part
should end in a tube, round which the varnished silken tube immediately
connected with the balloon is to be fastened.       After properly fixing the
inverted funnel, provide a square wooden tube, and six it to the inside of
the reservoir so as to reach within six inches of its bottom, while its upper
orifice should stand at least a foot higher than the surface of the water
therein. This being done, and the extremities of the large tin tubes being
properly placed under the inverted funnel, begin with pouring several
gallons of cream of lime (made by slaking quicklime in water, a gallon of
fluid to two pounds of lime) into the reservoir; then gradually sill the
same with water till within an inch or two of the top.       In the next place,
pour through the inverted syphon of each tub a mixture of one part acid
and six of water, while an assistant standing over the small lateral tin tube
(now open) replaces the plug in the fame as soon as the smell of the hy
drogen gas is perceived, indicating that the atmospheric air is now all ex
pelled from the tub.      And thus must the workmen proceed, pouring the
diluted acid into the tubs through the syphons till such time as the required
quantity for each vessel    (;'. e. 1000 pounds of acid, and 6000 pounds, or
750 gallons, of water) has been added; the column of fluid retained in
the shorter leg of the syphon forming   a   stopper, whereby any escape of gis
at this aperture   is prevented.
    A  separate assistant must in the mean time attend the pneumatic cooler
to renew the water therein, which will be at intervals saturated with all
the matter    it can absorb from the gasi he must therefore occasionally dis
place this water    by  pouring fresh quantities down the square wooden tube
 for the purpose, which will cause the saturated fluid to flow over the top
 of the vessel, and in doing the lame must, for every fresh addition of water,
 add 3  propor.'ionate quantity of the cream of lime.     During the whole of
 the experiment the water in the cooler must be stirred with    a  wooden rod,
 that the unsaturated lime (continually tending to precipitate itself may)
 be perpetually brought into contact with the gas  ;   while, the more frequent
 the renewal of the water in the reservoir, and the larger the proportion of
 fresh cream of lime, the lighter will the gas be obtained.      Also, to facih-

To   provide against these two circumstances, the aeronaut
ought not to omit subjecting the iron turnings to the action
of a strong 6re amidst carbonaceous matters, for at least an
hour, a day or two before his proposed use of them. The
thickness of the iron must be also noticed, as, under the most-
favourable circumstances, the acid never penetrates it more
than half an inch: therefore all the weight of iron that re
mains over and above a surface of half an inch depth every
¦way, becomes useless ; the coat of newly formed oxide of iron
effectually guarding the remaining metal from solution: for
want of attending to this circumstance, the quantity of metal
ha? frequently proved deficient to the end proposed, to the
great disappointment of the experimenter.
   Also where the public have to rely on the good faith of the
exhibiter, he ought to try the strength of his acid previous to
employing it; and this, not by the ordinary methods of spe
cific gravity, nor the quantity of alkali it will saturate*, but
by the actual process, in the small way, of what he proposes
to perform on the day of ascent : by these means he cannot
fail of succeeding.
    But the above is not the only method of procuring inflam
mable airs: the pasting of wateT over red-hot metals is fol-
tate the entrance  of the inflammable air into the balloon, the varnished
silken tube, proceeding from the inverted funnel, must rather ascend than
otherwise in its course to the balloon, which may be easily managed by
supporting it along a ladder having a gentle inclination upwards, I appre
hend the cost of the larger tubs of 1000 gallons each will be Id's expensive
than to have recourse to twenty or thirty butts for the purpose; which, by
dividing the process, causes greater apprehensions for failure with respc t
to the lightness of so many vessels and tubes; besides the inconvenience of
having to procure so great a number of casks for every frefli voyage, when
undertaken as a public exhibition in places far distant from each other.
    The sulphate of iron, the product of the mutual action of the acid and
iron, is a substarxe much uled in the arts under the name of green cop
peras : the chemist, dyer, cal'co-prinycr, ink-maker, refiner, &c, have great
demand for this article. It may therefore be either dilposed of, cr distilled

     sr-                ;   while the residuum,    byfurther calcination, may
 be converted into that species of oxide known   by a  the name of colcothar,
 an article much employed for poiiihing glass and metals, and also as         a
pigment.

from the decompolition of the water ; but the metal is apt to
run to a flag resembling finery cinder, preventing its further
action upon the water, and that before any considerable pro
portion is decomposed.
    The distillation of pit-coal also affords this gas, but not
above one-fourth lighter than atmospheric air. In obtaining
it in this way, a number of receivers must be interposed be
tween the retort and the balloon, to condense the volatile,
aqueous, and oleaginous products of this distillation*.
    If a parachute is required, it should be constructed so as
when distended to form but a small segment of a sphere, and
not a complete hemisphere; as the weight of this machine
is otherwise considerably increased, without gaining much
in the opposing surface. The parachute of Mr. Garnerin is
particularly defective in a too great extension of its diameter;
an unnecessary addition to its weight of a lining of paper both
withinside and without ; the too near approximation of the
basket to the body of the parachute; and especially in the
want of a perpendicular cord passing from the car to the centre
of the concave of the umbrella, by the absence of which
the velocity of the descent is certain to be very rapid before
the machine becomes at all distended ; whereas, if a cord were
thus disposed, the centre of the parachute would be the por
tion first drawn downwards by the appended weight, and the
machine would be almost immediately at its full extension.
     Having found, by experiment, the diameter required for
insuring safety f, the further the basket or car is from the
umbrella, the less fear (hall we have of an inversion of the
whole from violent oscillations ; yet the longer the space be
 tween the car and the head of the machine, the longer will
be the space run through in each vibration when once begun,
yet by so much the more will they be steadier; and this
ought to be attended to, as when by the violence of the oscil-

      During tilt distillation of pit-coal,  water and carbonate of ammonia
are afforded, together with a pitchy oil resembling tar : these will be con

 mixture of hydrogen with azotic and carbonic acid gales) will proceed on
 ward; and which if made to pass through lime-water will be rendered
 more pure: a pound of coal will afford about three cubic feet of inflam
 mable air, and prove the cheapest method of inflation.       Dr. Priestley also
 found that tlie product of inflammable air, in all operations in the dry way,
 was always greater in proportion     as the fire had been suddenly raised.
    +  Mr. Baldwin    advises   the diameter 15 feet; by which means, " the
 man weighing 140 pounds and the parachute 10 pounds, with a surface of
 150 square feet, lie would seel no greater lhock than if he had fallen from
 the height of six feet."     At the Pantheon, Mr. Garnevin's parachute wt»

with the horizontal axis of the machine, (or, in other words,
the point of suspension,) the force of gravity, or the gravitating
power of th"e weight in the car, on the umbrella, being at that
 crisis reduced to nothing, the slightest cause might have car

 bag, and the whole have descended confusedly together *.

     •  The umbrella being acted upon in a perpendicular direction from the
car, if by any, the most trivial cause, the latter vibrates from the perpendi
cular it will draw the machine in the fame inclined direction ; the car also
with its cords of suspension, now acting the part of a pendulum, will con
tinue to oscillate to each side till a perfect equilibrium is restored.          The
space of the arc dtscribed in each vibration will depend upon the distance
between the car and the parachute conjunctly with the resistance afforded
by the latter to the air, whereby on decreasing the resistance (or, which
is the fame thing, the surface of the umbrella,) the weight in the car will
sooner draw the machine into the perpendicular, and the oscillations con»
sequently cease : thus a parachute whole surface is small enough to obviate
oscillations in the middle regions (/'. e. the half of the uiuai heights sur
mounted in aerostatic experiments, or about 5000 sect), would be defec
tive for want of surface to moderate the velocity of descent when near the
 ground, and -vireverfai     if, therefore, we can augment or diminish at plea
sure the surface and consequent resistance of the parachute during its de
scent ,wc shall have attained the perfection of the machine.
     Thus in Mr. Garnerin's experiment the oscillations did not commence
 till the machine felt the increased resistance of           more dense zone of the

 gradually diminishing the arc of the fame to nothing, this also being as

                                                        which means the weight of

     I  stiould  propose the parachute to be constructed of var
nished cambric muslin (or light linen), covered externally
with a netting, the meshes of which should converge smaller
as thev approach the central portion of the machine ; observ
ing also to six the netting on the surface by sewing it down
upon various parts of the fame.              The diameter of the para
chute (forming only a small segment of a sphere), when ex
tended, not to exceed twenty feet.                 The central aperture of
the umbrella (to allow the escape of the air through, as the
machine descends), not less than three feet in diameter, and
provided with a shutter moving upon a hinge and opening
inwards * ; furnished also with a cord sliding over a single
pulley to shut the aperture, and a second cord to open the
(ame (each cord reaching to#the car), thus subjecting the
shutter to the will of the aeronaut. By this mechanism the
 stupefying vibrations of the car may be moderated, if not
 wholly prevented, by drawing down the fliutter so as to fully
 expose the aperture, whereby the resistance of the parachute
 to the atmosphere being lessened by all this diminution of its
 opposing surface, the gravitating power of the appended weight
 (tending to draw the body of the machine continually in the
 perpendicular) will have proportionally a greater effect : the
 descent in the interim will be also relatively more rapid; but
 this may be checked in a moment by closing the orifice, espe
  cially when near the surface of the earth t.
      A strong cord should proceed perpendicularly from the
  centre of the car to a point formed by the convergence of a
  number of cords proceeding from the second ring of wicker
  work, the effect of which would be an immediate extension
  of the parachute to its full diameter at the instant of descent,
  as before adverted to.            Also, and lastly, a third hoop of
  wicker-work,        of  fix  or  eight feet diameter, fixed in the in
  ternal concave of the umbrella, to secure against any acci
  dental collapse of the sides before the machine has become
  diatcly restored the machine to its perpendicular situation, but for which
  he could not account.       An attempt to obviate these inconveniences is the
  object of the valve of the parachute mentioned hereafter.
      • This
               aperture, or, more properly, valve, of the parachute, may be
  constructed either of close wicker-work, or varnished linen strengthened
   by a piece of netting externally, and fixed to a ring of wicker-work adapted
   to close the diameter of the second ring of wicker-work, to which are fixed
   the pieces of varnished linen composing the concave umbrella.     This latter
   circle is independent of the third hoop of wicker-work of six or eight feet
   diameter, afterwards mentioned, whose use is to prevent a collapse of the
   fides of the machine.
       t  By an enlargement of the diameter of the valve, this diminution of
   surface might be carried to such extent as to insure a safe descent by the
    parachute even in the most tempestuous weather,
                                                                     distended

   distended by its pressure on the cylinder of air immediately
   beneath it.
      With respect to the probability of directing aerostatic ma
   chines*, we may infer it to be possible, although the methods
   hitherto tried have been inadequate ; perhaps because they
  were not sufficiently powerful; as, to expect to make so large
   a body as a balloon to vary from the wind by the impulsion
  of an oar of fix or eight feet in length and one or two in
  breadth (and that by only endeavouring to draw the car out
  of the perpendicular), is to expect, by means of a boat's oar,
  to impel a ship of burthen. Oars are doubtless the most likely
  means to effect this purpose, if they were of dimensions pro
  portionate to the effects they are wished to produce f. The
  addition of sails, where any variation from the wind is de-
  fired, will prove injurious till we have attained a method
  (perhaps only to be accomplished by oars) of keeping the
  fame point of the balloon continually in a given direction.
  Yet I doubt not but these also might prove of great service in
  quick dispatches by water; as, for instance, where it is re
  quired to pass a fortress or fleet for the succour of a besieged
 town, or convey dispatches thereto : a small balloon, of ten or
 twelve feet diameter, provided with sails to expose a large sur-
     * "Tis a matter of surprise, that the various hints for directing balloons
 appear to lie dormant with their projectors, who seem indisposed to make
 any attempts to carry their plans into execution : thus the inventions ef
 professor Danzel (Philosophical Magazine, vol. iv.), also of Martin, and
 the proposals for performing the fame by means of eagles trained for the
 purpose; or by a rev'rsed parachute to retard the direct progress of the
 balloon, whereby less power will be necessary to impel it in a lateral di
 rection; all these plans remain obsolete and unpractised from the time of
 their suggestion.
     + According to the present mode of rowing balloons from the car,
whatever deviation is made may be compared to the lee-way of a ship at
sea; the power being applied so as merely to prevent at a certain instant
 the car from following the balloon, which will therefore be impelled,
during that short interval, in a barely diagonal direction amounting per
haps, in the end of the voyage, to scarcely half a point from the wind.
For oars to produce their full effect they should be not less than twenty
feet long, and three in width at their extremities ; while the rowers should
be seated one on each side of the machine in appropriate cars attached to the
body of the balloon, and nearly on a line with its equator : this might easily
be practised with a balloon capable ef carrying four persons and ballast ;
the greater weight in the car below the machine, containing two travellers
with ballast, being sufficient to keep the whole apparatus in a steady posi
tion, and that more especially if the same be suspended at a considerable
distance beneath the balloon. The oars recommended (being made of only
varnished linen stretched over netting fixed to arms of pliable wood) might
be easily worked, isa projecting staff of wood were attached to each lateral
oar, so as to form at its extremity a fulcrum whereon to rest the oar at eight
or ten feet distance from the rower.
                                                                          face

face      to the wind, being attached by a long rope to a boat,
would outstrip the quickest vessel, and might also be made to
•deviate from the course of the wind ; as the water would form
a counter- resisting medium, the want of which in air-balloons
occasions the difficulty of steering them. A fail-balloon similar
to the above might also be advantageously attached to a land-
 carriage ; namelv, by increasing the capacity of the balloon so
that its power of ascension being nearly equal to the weight of
the appended carnage, the latter would be drawn along by
 the impulsion of the wind against the balloon and sails, while
 the friction over the ground, by the small overplus weight,
 may be reasonably expected to afford a resistance sufficient to
 guide the machine, and allow os a deviation in the carriage of
 at least eight points from the course of the wind *.
      To whatever degree of perfection aerial navigation may
 attain, the limits to which a traveller might soar will for ever
  be confined to but a small distance, even supposing that man
 could exist in any station of the aerial regions however ele
 vated.        The density of the atmosphere decreasing in a geo
 metrical proportion, it will be found that, isa sphere of sheet
  copper t. of half a pound to the square foot, were constructed
  of equal diameter with our earth ( 7920 miles), and totally
  exhausted of its inclosed air, such a globe would attain its
  equilibrium at 70*047346 miles distance from the surface of
  the earth ; nor would it attain a greater elevation, although
 its power of ascension at the instant of departure would oe
  equal to 2871691637967270771712 pounds.
       The application ot aerostatic machines to the advancement
  of our knowledge of the various phænomena in meteorology,
  stands prominent, as the, perhaps, only means of maturing
  our acquaintance with causes yet known only by their effects.
  Their use will also be indicated in many urgent cases where
  other means of conveyance might fall sliort.                       At the fame
   time I conclude with remarking, that the hitherto unsuccefs
     -'*   A land carriage to be moved by the wind is not a new contri"ancc :
   a machine    of this kind, rigged in zl\ respects like a stoop, used occasionally
   to be experimented upon on Barham Downs, near Canterbury : the car
   riage being of a light construction, and containing two persons, ivis found
   capable of running a mile in three minutes and a half, upon level ground
   and with a fair wind.        Whether it could surmount the occasional n regu
   larities of a common road, or deviate in any measure from the wind, I do
   not now recollect,
       t  If metallic aerostats were ever to be constructed agreeably to the scheme
   of the Jesuit Francis Lana, means might be found to exhaust then : but
   to prevent their being crushed together by the pressure of the atn.oipliere
    would be more difficult to accomplish !

 ful attempts to render aerial navigation of service to man-
 mind, ought to be no argument for causing it to be discoun
 tenanced by men of sense, or prohibited by civil authority;
 as experiments in any art, however multiplied, if not well
 advised and conducted, cannot be expected to fulfil the erro
neous expectations of their projectors.
    To assist the artist in constructing his aerostatic apparatus,
it may not be amiss to subjoin the following data : — The dia
 meter is to the circumference of a sphere as i to 3', or as
 1 to
       3-1416.       The circumference multiplied by the diameter
gives   the  surface   of the sphere in square dimensions, and i-6th
of the surface multiplied by the diameter, or the cube of the
diameter multiplied by 0-5236, gives the capacity or solid
 contents in cubic measure.            By the weight of a square foot
of the envelope may be found the weight of the whole bag,
 allowing for the seams ; and to find the power of ascension,
subtract the weight of the bag and inclosed air from the
¦weight of an equal bulk of atmospheric air *, and the quo
tient will give the power which the balloon will exert to rise,
¦which (during its ascent) will decrease till the equilibrium
between the two is~ restored ; and this point may be nearly
 ascertained by recollecting that the density of the atmosphere
 decreases in the geometrical ratio, and is reduced to half an
 atmosphere at three miles and a half from the earth's sur
 face f. If a balloon with its annexed apparatus weighs there
fore, at the insiant of ascent, but half an equal bulk of com
mon air, it will rise to three miles and a half perpendicular
height ; but, as the density of the inflammable air decreases
also in the ratio of the diminishing pressure of the surround-
   * A cubic foot of water weighs 1000 ounces avoirdupoise : and as the
density of air to water is as 1 to Soo, this will be 1 ' ounce for every cubic
foot of atmospheric air : the weight of inflammable air varies according to
its putity, so as to be even 17 times lighter than common air; but in the
gross way, for aciostatic purposes we must not expect to obtain it more
than eight or ten times lighter than atmospheric air.

    So long as the vibration of pendulums is performed in a
medium of varying density, we must not look for an accurate
time-piece for ascertaining the longitude, &c; unless a self-
correcting mercurial pendulum could be contrived, adapted
to counteract the smallest variations effected by the ambient
air. The errors of a time-piece are but half corrected by
the fabrication of pendulums adapted to obviate the expansion
of metals by increase of temperature, is the works themselves
still remain constructed of such expansible materials. A cor
rect time-piece, therefore, will be that of which not only the
works and pendulum are constructed of the least expansible
materials, but the pendulum itself shall vibrate in a medium
of unalterable density ; a desideratum only to be obtained by
causing the vibrations to be performed in vacuo, or by a self-
correcting pendulum, as above alluded to.          I know of no
substance so well adapted to compose the works of such a
machine as ivory, or the horn of the narwhal or sea unicorn
(nearly entirely composed of enamel, and used in the fabrica
tion of artificial teeth), especially if we had a means of in
creasing their hardness so as to vie with the metals (a subject
on which I propose to make some experiments) : but for the
pendulum itself, the common gridiron pendulum is allowed
to be the most accurate in use, provided its vibrations were
not obstructed by unequal resistance from the air : but for a
mercurial pendulum to move in open space, glass will be in
dicated as the least expansible and most proper substance for
this purpose. I add, that the most perfect time-piece hither
to constructed, has been so only in as far as the works have
been most exactly accurate, and the expansion of the pen
dulum been counteracted (as in the gridiron pendulum) by
opposing expansion to expansion.       The exact concordance of
such a machine, on its return to the first place of observation,
will have depended on the nature of the voyage performed in
the interim.     As, if such voyage has been performed across
the equator and back (as to the East Indies), the aggregate
number of anomalies in the pendulum in the voyage out,
will in the return be nearly balanced by the number of ano
malies in the voyage home, so that the whole difference shall
at last, perhaps, not amount to 100".        But if (some weeks
after the sailing of the vessel) we had it in our power to know
at a certain instant the precise moment indicated by an equally
accurate chronometer left at the place of departure, we should
find a greater variation between the two, owing to the differ
ence in the densities of the media in which the pendulum at

brated. I say then,
    1. That the concordance (although exact) of two chrono
meters, after a voyage on the part of one of them, is no proof
of their accuracy.
    2. That this concordance will depend on the nature of the
voyage that has been performed in the interim.                And,
    3.  That  we  must    not   expect    an  exact  instrument   till the
expansions by     heat,   and    the   varying density    of  the  atmo
sphere,   are counteracted     in  the  same   machine.
    For although the difference of an inch barometrical pres
sure may not cause an obstruction in the arc of vibration
equal to the two millionth part of the whole, yet this small
difference (which, perhaps, may have prevented its hitherto
due observance,) will, in the space of some months, amount
to something considerable, especially as a variation of not only
one, but two or even three inches increase or diminution of
pressure will frequently ensue in less than 34 hours.

river Sungen ; by the kingdom of Laos, and by a range of
mountains, which divides it from Cambodia, on the west ;
and by that part of the Eastern Ocean generally called the
China Sea, on the south and east.

     The breadth of the country bears no proportion            to its
 length.    Few of the provinces extend further than a degree
from east to west, some less than twenty miles: Donai, which
is properly a province of Cambodia, is much larger.
    The whole country is intersected by rivers, which, although
not large enough to admit of vessels of great burthen, yet
are exceedingly well calculated for promoting inland com
merce.
    The climate is healthy, the violent heat of the summer
months being tempered by regular breezes from the sea. Sep
tember, October, and November, are the season of the rains;
the low lands are then suddenly overflowed        by immense tor
rents of water which fall from the mountains.         The inunda
tions happen generally once a fortnight, and last for three or
four days.     In December, January, and February, there are
frequently rains brought by cold northerly winds, which di
stinguish this country with a winter different from any other
in the east. The inundations have the fame effe£t here as the
overflowings of the Nile in Egypt, and render the country
one of the most fruitful in the world.          In many parts the
land produces three crops of grain in the year. Ail the fruits
of India are found here in the greatest perfection, with many
of   those of China.
    No country    in the east produces richer or a greater variety
of articles  proper for carrying on an advantageous commerce ;
cinnamon, pepper, cardemoms, silk, cotton, sugar, Agula
wood, Japan wood, ivory, &c. Gold is taken almost pure
 from the mines; and, before the troubles, great quantities
 were brought from the hills in dust, and bartered by the rude
 inhabitants of them for rice, cloths, and iron.       It was from
 them alio the Asrula and Calambae woods were procured,
 with quantities of wax, honey, and ivorv.
     The animals of Cochin China are bullocks, goats, swine,
 buffaloes, elephants, camels, and horses.       In the woods are
 found the wild boar, tiger, and rhinoceros, with plenty of
 deer; the poultry is excellent, and the fish caught on the
 coast abundant and delicious.      The flesh of the elephant is
  accounted a great dainty by the Cochin Chinese. The breed
 ing of bullocks is little attended to; their flesh is not esteemed
  as food, and they are made no use of in tilling the land, which
  is performed by buffaloes.       They are totally unacquainted
  with the art of milking their cattle.
     The aborigines of Cochin China are called Moys, and are
  the people which inhabit the chain of mountains which se
  parate it from Cambodia.        To these strong-holds

driven when the present      possessors invaded   the country.    They
are a savage race of people, very black, and resemble in their
features the Caffrees.
    It was about the year 1280 of the Christian æra that the
first Tartar prince became possessed of the throne of China.
This revolution afforded an opportunity to the western pro
vinces to throw off their dependence ; and they were formed
into a kingdom, under a prince whose descendant now reigns
in Tonquin, and is called Knaw-Whang. About the begin
ning of the fifteenth century a large body of people from these
provinces, being disaffected to the government, joined under
 a leader of abilities ; they soon became masters of the coast
 of Cochin China as far as Cape Aurilla, which lies in lati
 tude 12° 30' north.        The Moys, the original inhabitants,
 retired to the hills bordering their country to the westward ;
 where they have ever since remained. The emigrants, under
 their conductor, founded the kingdom of Cochin China.
 The continual wars they were engaged in with the Tonqui-
nese, induced them to build a wall on the southern extremity
 of the province of Ding-noi, to prevent their irruptions.
Every communication by sea was strictly forbidden.               In the
 year 1764     the  country  of Cochin    China   was   in  a flourish
 ing condition, and governed by a prince of abilities : soon
 after his son succeeded to the throne, and anarchy and con
 fusion ensued.
    The Cochin Chinese       bear evident marks of their being de
 rived  from the fame stock as the Chinese.            They resemble
 them in their features, and most of their manners and cus
 toms.     Their religion is the fame : their oral language,
 though different, seems formed upon the fame principles;
 and they use the same characters in writing.              They are a
 courteous, affable, inoffensive race, rather inclined to indo
 lence. The ladies are by far the most active sex ; they usu
 ally do all the business, while their lazy lords fit upon their
 haunches, smoking, chewing beetle, or sipping tea.               Con
trary to the custom of China, the ladies arc not (hut up; and,
if unmarried, a temporary connection with strangers who ar
 rive in the country is deemed no dishonour. Merchants often
employ them as their factors and broker*, and, 'tis said, the
firmest reliance may be placed en their fidelity.
    The ha!)it of the men and women is cut after the fame fa
shion.     It is a loose robe, buttoning with a small robe round
the   neck,  .and folding over the breast like a banyan gown,
with large long fleeves which cover the hands. People of
rank, and especially the ladies, wear several of these gowns
                                                                   one

one over the other ; the undermost one reaches to the ground,
the succeeding ones are each shorter than the other, so that
the display of the different colours makes a gaudy appearance
as they walk along.
    Such are the few particulars relative to Cochin China.
It   now remains to (how how            a  connection with Cochin
China may      prove beneficial to this country.        The drain of
specie from the company's settlements in India is become a
matter of such serious import, that any plan which may be
offered to remedv so growing an evil, I have no doubt, will
be deemed worthy of observation.            I am sanguine in my ex
pectations, that     a settlement in Cochin China would conduce
to that desirable end, as well as be productive of many other
advantages.
    Our two    little vessels brought from Cochin China to the
amount of 60,000 rupees in gold and silver bullion.              The
Rumbold, the year before, also brought bullion to a consi
derable amount, on account of sales of Bengal and Madras
cloths, opium, iron, copper, lead, hardware, and glass.
    The situation of Cochin China is excellently well adapted
to commerce.        Its vicinity to China, Tonquin, Japan, Cam
 bodia,  Siam,    the Malay coast, the Philippines, Borneo, the
 Moluccas, &c. renders the intercourse with all these countries
 short and easy.      The commodious harbours formed on the
 coast, particularly that of Turon, afford a safe retreat for
 ships of any burthen during the most tempestuous seasons of
 the year.
    The nations of Europe, having hitherto found it        impossible
 to provide  cargoes sufficiently valuable to barter for the com
 modities of China, are obliged to make up the deficiency by
 sending thither immense quantities of bullion ; by which
 means it has, for a number of years past, drained the eastern
 and western worlds of their specie.           The number of junks
 annually resorting to Cochin China, plainly proves how much
 the productions of it are in demand amongst the Chinese.
 These productions, had we a settlement and a confirmed in
 fluence in the country, might with ease be brought to centre
 with us, purchased with the staples of India and of Europe.
 Turon would become the emporium for them, where our
 ships bound to Canton, from whence it is only five days fail,
 might call and receive them.         It would prove a saving of so
 much specie to Great Britain or India as the value of the
 commodities amounted to in China.              In a few years, there
 is every reason to believe a very considerable investment might
 be provided.
     Our trade to China has ever been burthened with enor-
                                  D 3                           mous

mous imposts and exactions : these, under various pretences,
are annual Iv increasing, and in process of time may become
insupportable.          It is an opinion, latterly grown current, that
the Chinese are desirous of totally excluding all Europeans
from their country.            May we not hazard a conjecture, that
 the vexations they oblige them to suffer are the premeditated
 schemes of this politic people to effect it? Were such an
 event to happen, the want of a settlement to the eastward
 would be severely felt ; the Chinese would export their own
 commodities, and Java or the Philippines, as the nearest
 ports, would become the marts for them. As there is no
 reason to suppose that our inability to procure them from the
 first land would hinder their consumption, we must buy them
 either from the Dutch or from the Spaniards.               A settlement-
 in Cochin China will give us a superior advantage to either,
  both as its situation is nearer, and the Chinese are more ac
  customed to resort thither : at all events there is reason to
  suppose it will enable us to procure the commodities of China
  at a much more reasonable rate than now purchased by our
  factors at Canton, and certainly on less humiliating terms to
  the nation at large.         Colonies of Chinese have from time to
  time emigrated from the parent country, and fixed their abode
  in different parts of Cochin China. These have their corre
  spondence in every sea-purt of the empire.             Through their
  means, teas, china ware, and the various other articles, the
  objects of our commerce with China, might be imported in
 junks to our own settlements, equally good in quality, and
  cheaper, as the Chinese are exempted from the exorbitant
  duties levied on foreigners. Some of the best workmen might
  be encouraged to fettle in Cochin China, and, under direction,
  manufactories carried to as great a degree of perfection as in.
   China   itself.
      The   intercourse      between Japan and Cochin China might
  be renewed,       and    we might participate in a trade for many
   years monopolized by the Dutch.              An advantageous trade
   might be carried on with the Philippine islands, and Madras
   aud Bengal goods introduced amongst them, by means of
   the junks, for the consumption of Spanisli America.               The
   Siamese and Cambodians would bring the produce of their
   respective countries, and barter or fell them for such articles-
   as they wanted from Cochin China.                 Amongst them it is
   probable    a sale  might   be found  for quantities of Bengal cloths.
   The lower     class of people in Cochin China are, for the most
   part,  clothed     in cangas, a coarse cotton cloth brought from
   China ; but the preference, which I had an opportunity of
   observing, they gave to Bengal cloths, on account of their
                                                                    being

being wider and cheaper, would soon induce them to adopt
the use of them. The demand for opium, already in some
measure become a necessary of life to the Chinese, would in
crease in proportion to the facility of procuring it.              The im
portation  of     it,
                   no longer   confined     to  Canton,    but   carried   by
the junks to every sea-port in the country, would spread the
demand for this drug to the remotest parts of the empire.
    But what inspires the most flattering hopes from an esta

    Great as the commercial advantages are, the political ones

 people, groaning under the weight of the most cruel oppres
 sion, would be an act worthy of the British nation.                    Fifty
 European infantry, half that number of artillery, and two
 hundred sepoys, would be sufficient for this and every other
 purpose.    The natives of Cochin China are infinitely below

  acquire to the eastward, as    the   sepoys    do  to our   territories   in

      1 HE First Consul, in a letter to Chaptal, in which he
   announced to that minister the two prizes he had founded
   to encourage philosophers to make new researches in regard
   to Galvanism, says, " Galvanism, in my opinion, will lead
   to great discoveries."      This observation was just and pro
   found : great discoveries have already been made; Galvani
   and Volta have immortalized their names, and several cele
   brated philosophers and physiologists       have rendered them
    selves illustrious in this branch of science, so abundant in
    astonishing phænomena : yet it is only in its infancy, and
    there can be no doubt that many important discoveries still
    remain to be made.
        Vaflali, Rossi, and myself, have for several years been em
    ployed in researches on this subject. While the first examined
    the Galvanic fluid in every point of view, for the purpose of
    illustrating its nature by means of a great number of inge
    nious experiments, performed with that care and exactness
    which are peculiar to him, Rossi and myself attempted to
    explain the action of the Galvanic fluid on the different or
    gans of the animal economy.
         Sometimes I was obliged to interrupt my researches by un
    fortunate circumstances, and at others by my administrative
    functions : but I have now resumed them ; and though suc
     cess has not yet crowned my efforts by any brilliant disco
    very, we trust, and with confidence, that we fliall be able to
     add some valuable facts to the history of the animal econo

                           Galvanic Experiments.                                     39
 to extend the domain of an inexhaustible agent fertile in
 wonders.
    Volta had announced that the involuntary organs, such as
the heart, the stomach, the intestines, the bladder and ves
sels, are insensible to the Galvanic action *: but we have fully
refuted this great physiological error.     Unfortunately, how
ever, the Latin memoir containing the decisive experiments
which we made on cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals
in 1792, presented to the Academy soon after, and which,
according to Sue, in his History of Galvanism t5
                                                        " are cu
rious, and contain very interesting observations," did not ap
pear till i8or, when it was printed in the last volume of the
Transactions of the Academy.
    In that interval Grapengiesser found, as we had done, that
Galvanism, by means of zinc and silvers, has an influence
on the peristaltic motion.       Humboldt ascertained the Gal
vanic action on the hearts of frogs, lizards, toads, and fishes.
Smuch observed the excitability of the heart by the Galvanic
fluid ; and Fowler changed the pulsations of the heart with
out the immediate application to it of armatures, and only by
adapting them in warm-blooded animals to the recurrent
nerve by means of the sympathetic §.
    It is chiefly in regard to the experiments of these learned
Germans that the historian of Galvanism states           that the         ||,
involuntary vermicular motion of the intestines, according to
the acknowledgment of all physiologists,     obeys metallic irri
tation whence
        ;             follows, fays he, that the Italian philoso
                      it
phers have advanced an error when they said that Galvanism
exercises no action but on the muscles, which depend on the
will. As an accurate and impartial historian, how can Sue
accuse the Italian philosophers indiscriminately of such an
error, since he had our memoir before him when employed
on the second volume of his History of Galvanism, and since
he gave     a short account of my experiments in his first vo
lume   ?  Nay, gave an aceount of my experiments in small

work published in Italian           in
                                 1792.  But as Italian works are
                                               ¦
not much read in France, and were less so at that period,                           I
should not have reproached C. Sue with this act of injustice,

40        Repert on  Vajsali-Eandi, Giulio, and Roffi's
and his incorrectness     in regard to the Italian philosophers,
had not my Latin memoir been known to him, as it had
appeared in the Transactions of the Academy.
   Though we made a great many experiments before we at
tempted to combat a philosopher so justly celebrated as Volta,
and to establish the influence of Galvanism on the involun
tary organs; and though Grapengiesscr,        Humboldt; Smuch,
Fowler, &c. ascertained this influence in certain cold-blooded
and even warm-blooded animals; an object of so much im
portance to physiology required to be extended and confirmed,
especially in man, by new experiments.         We have been the
more sensible of the necessity of establishing this fact in an
incontestable manner, either in regard to the involuntary or-
       in general, or more particularly the heart, as the cele-
  rated Aklini, professor of Bologna, in an Italian work re
fans
plete with new facts and valuable experiments made on the,
bodies of decapitated criminals, has been obliged to acknow
ledge that he was not able to obtain any contraction in that
organ by means of the electro-motor of Volta, which is so
powerful.
   We fliall give an account, in particular memoirs, of the
experiments we have already made, and of those which we
propose to execute.       In regard to the stomach, the large
and the small intestines,    and the bladder, we shall say only,
in a general manner, that by armature of the different nervous
branches we obtained contractions analogous to those de
scribed in regard to animals.         The Galvanic action on the
heart   and arteries is the   object of the present paper, as it is
of the utmost importance to physiology, and deserves, under
every point of view, to excite our attention and occupy our
reflections.
   Our experiments on the different parts of the head and.
trunk of the decapitated criminals were begun, on the ioth-
of August, in a hall of the large hospital of St. John, and
resumed and continued yesterday in the anatomical theatre
of the university, before a great number of spectators.
   We tried the influence of Galvanism on the heart in three
different ways :
   lit, In arming the spinal marrow by means of a cylinder
of lead introduced into the canal of the cervical vertebrae, and
then conveying one extremity of a silver arc over the surface
of the heart, and the other to the arming of the spinal mar
row.     The heart of the first individual subjected to our expe
riments immediately exhibited very visible and very strong
contractions.     These experiments, as seen, were made with

                      Galvanic Experiments.                    41
out any intervention of the pile, and without any armature
applied ^to the heart. It is very remarkable, that when the
former is touched first, and then the arming and spinal mar
row, the contractions of the heart which follow are more in
stantaneous, and stronger, than when the arming of the spinal
marrow is first touched, and then the heart. In a memoir
on Galvanism, read in the last public fitting of the academy,
I  gave an account of a great number of experiments, made
especially on frogs, which exhibited a similar phænomenon.
In these animals I observed, a great number of times, that
when the arming of the crural nerves was touched first, and
then the muscles of the thigh, there were no contractions,
or the contractions were exceedingly weak ; and, on the other
hand, that when the muscles of the thighs were first touched,
and then the arming of the crural nerves, as long as the least
vitality remained in the organs the contractions of the mus
cles were constant and violent. In the memoir already men
tioned I have endeavoured to account for this phænomenon,
to which I shall recur when, by a great number of trials, we
(hall have ascertained that it is as general in men as I found
it in frogs and other cold-blooded animals.
    The second manner in which we tried the influence of
 Galvanism on the heart was by arming the nervi vagi and
the large sympathetic. The object of these experiments will
be readily comprehended by anatomists acquainted with the
details of neurology.      In these, as well as in the first and
other experiments where we armed the cardiac nerves them
selves, we obtained contractions in the heart.      In this, as in
the former cafe, the contractions obtained when the heart
was first touched, and then the arming of the nerves, were
much stronger than when the arming of the nerves was
 touched first, and then the heart. In this method we even
observed that the Galvanic experiments sometimes failed.
    The third kind of experiments on the heart were performed
by means of the pile. The pile we employed on the 10th
of August, for the experiments on, the first decapitated cri
minal, was composed of fifty plates of silver and as many of
zinc, with pasteboard moistened with a strong solution of
 muriate of soda. The silver was mixed with a tenth part of
 copper. This is the proportion which we found most favour
 able to the intensity of the signs of Galvanism :

   By making the negative extremity of the pile to commu
nicate, by means of respective conductors, with the spinal
marrow, or merely with the muscles of the back or breast,
laid bare, and the positive extremity immediately with the
heart, instantaneous and violent contractions were obtained ;
and the contractions were produced also when the heart was
made to communicate with the negative extremity of the
pile, and the spinal marrow with the positive extremity.
   We shall observe, in regard to contractions of the heart,
that of all its parts the apex is the most susceptible of motion,
and the most sensible to the Galvanic influence : we must
observe also, that the contractions produced by communica
tion with the pile were not only strong, but that they conti
nued a long time even after all the communication was re
moved.
   A very remarkable circumstance          is,
                                           that the heart, whicW
of all the muscles retains longest, in general, its contractility
in regard to mechanical stimulants,       the first to become in
                                           is
sensible to the Galvanic influence. The muscles of the arms,
and those of the back and breast, continue to be excitable         by
Galvanism for whole hours and the heart had lost its ex
                                   ;
citability about forty minutes after death.
   The experiments made yesterday in the anatomical theatre
exhibited nearly the fame results in regard to the heart as
those already mentioned.        The great arteries, such as the
aorta and some of its branches, being injected with water
raised nearly to the same temperament as that of the blood
in the living individual, when subjected to the Galvanic ac
tion exhibited contractions.       But     itprobable that they
                                                 is
will appear stronger when trials of this kind stiall be made
on bodies endowed with        higher degree of vitality than those
                               a
of yesterday, and when the interval between the period of
                                                      decapitation

decapitation and that of the experiments (hall be less. With
this view, indeed, we have provided a hall much nearer to
the place of execution ; for the results which we obtained in
the man decapitated on the 10th of August, in which cafe
the experiments were begun five minutes after the decapita
tion, were all comparatively more striking, and stronger, than
those obtained        in the experiments of yesterday, which were
begun       more    than   twenty minutes after decapitation, and
which were performed, as appears, on bodies endowed with
a much weaker degree of vitality.
      In the experiments made on the arteries, we armed the
 nervous plexus, which envelop the trunks of the cceliac and
mesenteric arteries, several branches of which are even inter
woven around the aorta : a communication was established
 between the positive or negative extremity of the pile and the
 aortic artery itself.       It was by these means that we obtained
 risible contractions.
      If the effects of Galvanism on arterial contractions are con
 stant, as I presume, all those discussions which have been
 agitated so long, and with so much violence, in regard to the
 irritability of the arteries, which does not manifest itself by
 the action of different mechanical and chemical stimulants,
 will at length be terminated in a positive and irrefragable
 manner ; all doubts will at length be removed ; and we shall
 be indebted to the Galvanic fluid, which is the most ener
 getic of all agents applied to the animal fibre, for having fixed
 the opinions of physiologists on a point of so much importance
  to the animal economy.
       Whence comes it that Aldini, even with the help of the
  most powerful electro-motors, was not able to obtain con
  tractions in the heart of man, which we so evidently obtained
  by the fame means which always withstood his efforts? How
  happens it that we obtained contractions by means much
  weaker ?
       The first experiments of Aldini on the human heart were
  begun an hour and a half after death *. The trunk had been
   exposed a long time to the open air, the temperature of which
   was no more than + 2.              It is probable that the cold, and
   the long interval between the period of death and that of the
   experiment, had already annihilated the irritability of the
   hearts.       In the fifty-third experiment, the heart of another
                                                                      executed

 44 Vajsali-Eandi, Giulio, and Roffl't Galvanic Experiments
 executed criminal constantly remained motionless and insen
 sible to the Galvanic current.         But in this experiment, be
fore trying the heart, a considerable time was employed in
making trials on the voluntary organs, the sensibility of which
to Galvanism had already been acknowledged. But the very
reverse of this method ought to be followed ; for I will here
repeat, that excitability, by means of the Galvanic fluid, is
extinguished in the heart a long time before it becomes ex
tinct in the voluntary muscles. This is so certain, that while
no part of the heart, tried externally and internally, presented
any sign of contractions, the diaphragm, and the muscles of
the upper and lower extremities, gave very strong ones.
    In our experiments which were begun five minutes after
death, the heart ceased to be sensible to the Galvanic agent
about the fortieth minute ; and this was the cafe in the tem
perature of + 25 ; while the voluntary muscles retained their
Galvanic excitability for whole hours. In other experiments
made by Aldini, the contractility of the voluntary muscles
existed three hours, and even five hours, after death.
    In the oxen subjected to Galvanic experiments by Aldini,
the excitability of the heart must have been extinguished
sooner, since the action of the Galvanic fluid of the pile
produced no contractions, though applied immediately after
death.
    If contractions were observed in the voluntary muscles
under the fame circumstances, it was because these muscles,
which lose much sooner than the heart their excitability in
regard to mechanical stimulants, retain it much longer than
that orjian in resrard to the Galvanic agent.              What then is
the cause of this diversity, which seems contrary to every ana
logy, and which, however, is proved by facts? It is still in
volved in much obscurity : but it is not yet time to tear the
dark veil which conceals it ; we are not yet enlightened by a
sufficient number of facts; and the few scattered data which
we have been able to collect, cannot yet be connected in a
manner capable of encouraging us to attempt to rend the
veil at present.
    We shall not here speak of the astonishment wilh which
the spectators were struck when they saw the contractions of
peraturc was cold, and the interval between the time of execution and that
of the experiment too lon^.       I
                                " was authorized," savs Bicliat, " in the
winter of the vear 7, to make various trials on the bodies of unfortun; te
persons who hail been guiilo;ined.    I had them at my disposal from thirty
lo fortv minute* after execution.   It was always impossible for me to pro
duce the least motion by arming either the spinal marrow and the heart,
or the latter organ and the nerves which it receives from the ganglioi.s
by the sympathetic, or from the brain by the par vagum.

 the muscles of the arms, the breast, and of the back, which
 raised the trunk some inches from the table ; the contractions
of the pectoral muscles, and the exterior and interior inter
costal muscles, which diminkhed the intervals between all
 the ribs, and made them approach each other with violence,
 raising the inferior ones towards the superior, and the latter
 towards the first rib and the clavicle ; the contractions of the
 arms, which, when the uncovered biceps muscle was touched,
 as well as its tendon, were so speedy and violent, that com
 plete flexion of the fore- arm on the arm took place, and that
 the hand raised weights of some pounds fifty minutes after
 decapitation.        Similar experiments may be seen in the work
 of Aldini : our object in this report was merely to speak of
  the Galvanic influence on the heart and arteries of man,
  which had not yet been observed.
      These new and important results, which we obtained in
  regard to the heart and arteries of man, will be confirmed by
  other trials.      We shall repeat our experiments as soon as an
  opportunity     occurs,    and we (hall take care to give you an
  early account of the most remarkable observations we shall
  make.
  VIII. A      Review of some Experiments which have                 been, sup
      posed to disprove the Materiality of Heat.             By   William
      Henrv*.
     X HE      following remarks on the subject of heat were writ
   ten soon after the publication of Count Rumford's Inquiry
   concerning the Source of the Heat evolved by Friction ; and
   of the interesting Essays of Mr. Davy, which appeared in
   Dr. Beddoes's West Country Contributions.                       They were
   transmitted to Dr. Beddoes, for publication, about the close
   of the year 1799; but circumstances, with which I am un
   acquainted, have,       I  believe, induced the doctor to decline
   the continuation of his periodical work.                   These circum
   stances I deem it necessary to state; because, had the essay
   been written nearer the period of its publication, it would
    probably have assumed a very different form.                 At present,   I
    nave not leisure to review the subject, or to attempt any ma
    terial alteration ; and still less to examine whether I have
    been anticipated by any of the authors whose essays have
    been published during the two last years.
           * From   the Manchester Society's Traiisailions, vol. v. pan z.
                                                                     A   Review

 46                  On the Materiality of Heat.
 A   Review   of some Experiments wbicb have I ten  supposed to
                 disprove the Materiality of Heat.
    It has long been a question among philosophers, whether
 the sensation of heat, and the class of phænomena arising
 from the fame cause, be produced by a peculiar kind of mat
 ter, or by motion of the particles of bodies in general.  The
 former of these opinions, though far from being universally
 admitted, is now most generally received ; and the peculiar
 body, to which the phænomena of heat are referred, has
been denominated by M. Lavoisier caloric.          Against the
doctrine of the French school, some forcible arguments have
lately been advanced by Count Rumford and by Mr. Davy,
both of whom have adopted that theory respecting heat,
which assigns as its cause a motion among the particles of
bodies.
    The method of reasoning employed by Mr. Davy in prov
ing the immateriality of the cause of heat, is the redu3io ad
tibsurdum, i. e. the oppugned theory is assumed as true, to
gether with its applications ; and facts are adduced directly
contradictory of the assumed principles : I sliall take the li
berty of offering a statement of the argument, rather different
from that of Mr. Davy, though, I trust, without misrepre
sentation, or any material omission.
    Let heat be considered as matter; and let it be granted,
that the temperature of bodies depends on the presence of
uncombined caloric.        Now, if the temperature of a body
be increased, the free caloric, occasioning that elevation,
must proceed from one of two sources : either, istly, It may
be communicated by surrounding substances ; or, 2dly, It
may proceed from an internal source, i. e. from a disengage
ment of what before existed in the body, latent or combined.
But the temperature of bodies is uniformly increased by fric
tion and percussion, and necessarily in one of the foregoing
modes.
    I. Mr. Davy found, by experiment, that a thin metallic
plate was heated, by friction in the exhausted receiver of
an air-pump, even when the apparatus was insulated, from
bodies capable of supplying caloric, by being placed on ice.
This experiment he considers as demonstrating, that the
evolved caloric could not be communicated by surrounding
bodies.
   To the inference deduced from this experiment it may be
objected, that the mode of insulation was by no means per
fect.   Admitting the vacuum, produced by the air-pump,
to have been complete, still the supply of caloric could not
                                                           thus

                       On       the   Materiality of Heat.                                47"
thus be entirely cut off, since it has been shown by Count
Kumford that caloric passes even through a torricellian va
cuum.      If,
           therefore, friction produce in bodies some change,
which enables them to attract caloric from surrounding sub
stances, this attraction may be equally efficient in an ex
hausted receiver as in one containing an atmosphere of mean
density.     would be an interesting subject of experiment to
            It
determine the influence of atmospheres of various densities as
conductors of caloric      for, since effects are proportionate to
                                ;
their causes, and          ascertained that common air conducts
                           it   is
caloric (better than            conveyed through a vacuum) as
                                it    is
 1000 is  to 702,      it
                       may  be expected that the ratio will hold
in all intermediate degrees*
   In Count Rumford's masterly experiment, the metal sub
mitted to friction was encompassed               water, and air was
                                                               by
carefully excluded from the surfaces           motion: yet the water
                                                              in
became hot, and was kept boiling             considerable time.
                                                          a           In
this cafe, the only obvious source of caloric, from without, was
through the borer employed            producing the friction
                                                in                                    ;   if
                                                                                           it
be true, as the Count has observed, that the water could not,
at the same instant, be in the act of giving out and receiving
heat. The same objection to the communication of heat,
from an external source, exists also in thus explaining Mr.
Davy's experiment         but
                            :    cannot admit that the argument
                                      I
is demonstrative in proving the evolved caloric not to be de
rived from external substances; for no absurdity            implied in      is
supposing that       body may be receiving caloric in one state,
                       a
and giving       out in another.
                 it                    We have an example of the
simultaneous admission and extrication of            subtile fluid, the
                                                                    a
materiality of which        admitted bv Mr. Davy, in an excited
                                 is
electric, which, at the very lame instant, receives the electric
fluid from without, and transfers          to the neighbouring con
                                                      it
ductors.     In an ignited body, also, the two processes of ab
sorption and irradiation of light are, perhaps, taking place
at the fame moment.
   II. Another cause os the increase of temperature             bodies,          in
is the liberation of their combined caloric; and              this be       if
source of temperature,      the absolute quantity of caloric                               a a
                                                                                          in
body must be diminilhed            friction.
                                           by   That no such dimi
nution really lakes place, we have the evidence of two expe
riments, — the one of Mr. Davy, the other of Count Rumford.
Mr. Davy,         rubbing together two pieces of ice, converted
                  by
them into water.         Now water, ex bypotbeji, contains more
caloric than the ice from which           was formed it   and, on the   ;
fame hypothesis, the absolute quantity of caloric                 ice             in       is
diminished         friction and liquefaction;
                  by                                which       absurd.          is
                                                                                       Count

  48                On the Materiality os Heat.
  Count Rumford also ascertained that the specific heat of iron
 was not diminished when converted by a borer into turnings,
 and consequently when it had been the source of much tem
 perature. In explanation of these facts we may be allowed
 to assume the communication of caloric from surrounding
 bodies, till this communication has been demonstrated to be
 impossible. But even were the impossibility establissied, it
 would yet remain to be proved, that the evolved caloric does
 not proceed from an internal source; and this can only be
 done by an accurate comparison of the quantity of caloric in
 bodies before and after friction.       Now, in instituting this
 comparison, it is implied that we possess means of determin
 ing the absolute quantity of caloric in bodies, and that we
 can compare quantities of caloric with as much certainty as
 we can obtain from an appreciation by weight or by measure.
 Such perfection, however, does not, I apprehend, belong t»
 the present state of our knowledge respecting heat ; for I have
 always been distrustful of that part of the doctrine which as
 signs the ratio of heat latent in bodies.     The grounds of this
distrust I shall state pretty fully ; for, if it can be proved that
we have no accurate conceptions of quantity, as appertaining
 to heat, all arguments against its materiality, derived from
supposed determinations of its quantity, must be inconclusive.
    The only clear conceptions which the mind has of quan
tity, are derived either from a comparison of the magnitude
or of the gravity of bodies. In the instance of caloric, both
these modes of mensuration fail us. We cannot estimate the
bulk of a substance which eludes our grasp and our vision ;
nor have we vet succeeded in comparing its gravity with that
of the grosser kinds of matter, which it surpasses in tenuity
beyond all comparison.       Our notions of the quantity of ca
loric are derived, not from such simple judgments, but from
complicated processes of reasoning,        in the steps of which,
errors fatal to the whole may perhaps sometimes appear.
    Whatever be the nature of caloric, whether it he a body
sui generis, or a quality of other bodies, its effects are pecu
liar and appropriate; and, like all other effects, bear a pro
portion to the energy of their cause. Expansion, for example,
it is proved by experiment, keeps pace with the actual incre
ments of heat ; and on this principle is founded the thermo
meter, the great agent in the acquirement of all our ideas re
specting heat, both absolute and relative. The competency of
this instrument, however, to afford information of the quantity
of caloric, is limited by the following circumstances :
    ist, The mercury of the thermometer indicates only the
quantity of heal which it has itself acquired, aud by no means
                                                               that

              Mr.  Henry on the Materiality    of Heat.          49
that contained in surrounding       bodies,    adly, The scale of
expansion is wholly arbitrary,       commencing far from the
absolute privation of heat, and falling far short of its maxi
mum.       3dly, The caloric latent in bodies, or chemically
combined with them* has no effect on the thermometer.
4thly, The experiments of Dr. Crawford, though sufficient
to show that the expansion of the mercury of the thermo
meter bears a ratio to the actual increments of heat in any
temperature    between the boiling and freezing points of wa
ter, by no means prove that this proportion holds univer
sally.
    Equal weights of heterogeneous bodies, it is presumed,
contain unequal quantities of caloric ; and the ratio of these
quantities is approximated in the following manner :
    Equal weights of the fame body, at different tempera
tures, give, on admixture, the arithmetical mean; but equal
weights of different bodies, at different temperatures, afford a
temperature which varies considerably from the mean. Thus
a pound of water at 100°, and a pound at 300 ', give the
temperature of 1500 ; but a pound of water at 200% and
a pound of mercury at ioo°, afford, not the mean, but a
temperature considerably higher.        Hence it follows, that a
pound of mercury has not the power of fixing and retaining
so much caloric as a pound of water; an dthe fixation of
more heat by the water than by the mercury, is ascribed to
the superior energy of a power inherent in both, and termed
capacity for caloric.
    From an extensive series of experiments Dr. Crawford in
fers, that the capacities of bodies are permanent so long as
they retain their form.       Thus, the capacity of water has to
that of mercury the ratio of 28 to 1, at any temperature be
tween 33J and 21 1°.      The difference of capacities of bodies,
it is inferred, therefore, would continue the fame down to the
absolute privation of temperature.     Imagine, then, two bodies
at this point of privation : they may still contain unequal quan
tities of combined caloric; for, when chemically combined, ca
loric does not produce temperature.     On Dr. Crawford's hypo
thesis these comparative quantities of combined caloric in the
two bodies may be learned by observing the ratio of tempe
rature produced by the addition to each of similar quantities
of heat. This supposition, however, is manifestly gratuitous;
and the contrary might be maintained with equator greater
probability ; for it may be supposed that at this assumed ne
gation of temperature one bpdy renders latent more caloric
 than another, because it actually contains less, as certain dry
salts attract more water from the atmosphere          than others

50         Mr.   Henry on the Materiality       of Heat.
containing much water of crystallization.               The commonly
employed      mode   of  ascertaining    the  specific caloric  of bodies
is founded, therefore, on an assumption which is deficient in
the character of a datum, and which itself requires proof.
    If these objections be valid, they will apply also to show
the fallacy of the theorem for finding the absolute zero of
bodies. By this term some philosophers appear to under
stand the point of absolute privation of caloric, both free and
combined.       I apprehend, however, that in strict propriety it
can only be used to signify the negation of uncombined caloric,
or, as Dr. Crawford expresses himself, the point of absolute
cold. As applied, however, to water, it is evident that the
whole quantity of heat is understood.                In ascertaining the
zero, say these calculators, the capacity of ice to that of water
is as 9 to 10.     It is plain, therefore, that when water freezes
it must give out i-ioth of its whole heat; and this tenth part
is found to answer to 1460 of Fahr.             Consequently its whole
heat is ten times 146, or 1460 ; and hence the natural zero
is 1460 — 53, or I4a8:i. Now of this estimate it is a datum,
 that the capacities of iee and water have precisely the above
ratio. But if the general formula for ascertaining the specific
caloric of bodies be founded on erroneous principles, it can
not serve as the ground-work of any solid conclusions.
    The materiality of caloric may, I apprehend, be main
 tained, without admitting that we have made any steps to
 wards determining its quantity in bodies; and the arguments
 of Count Rumford and Mr. Davy are not demonstrative,
 because they assume that this part of the doctrine of caloric
 cannot be relinquished without abandoning it in toto.                   I
 may be permitted, therefore, to state my reasons for believing
 caloric to be matter ; which would have been unnecessary
 had the contrary been proved with all the force of mathe
 matical demonstration.
     Avoiding all metaphysical reasoning on th« nature of mat
 ter, and assuming the generally received definition as suffi
 ciently characterizing      it,
                               I   shall examine how far this ge
 neral character of matter applies to the individual — caloric.
 Caloric occupies space, or         extended, because
                                   is                    it   enlarges the
 dimensions of other bodies        ; and, for the fame reason,      it   is
 impenetrable, since    if   it could exist at the fame time in the
  fame place with    other   bodies, their volume would never be
 enlarged bv the addition of heat.           Of form or figure, as only
a   mode of exteusion,   it   is unnecessary to prove that caloric       is
  possessed
          ;   and, indeed, there        is   perhaps only one general
 quality   of matter  that  will  not  be  allowed it,    viz. attraction.
 That caloric   is influenced      bythe attraction    of  gravitation, or
                                                                       by

               Mr. Henry     on the Materiality of Heat.          51
by cohefive attraction,       has never   yet been proved : yet the
various experiments of Buffon, Whitehurst, Fordyce, Pictet,
&c. cannot be alleged as proofs that it is actually devoid of
this property ; since they only decide, that the small quanti
ties which can be artificially collected, are not to be set in
the balance against the grosser kinds of matter.           One kind
of attraction, that which has lately been termed chemical
affinity, may, s think, aster a full survey of phænomena, be
fairly predicated of caloric ; and if its possession of this quality
be rendered probable, we stiall thence derive a powerful ar
gument in favour of its materiality.
     That chemical affinity has a considerable share in producing
the phænomena of heat, appears probable from the following
considerations :
     1. All the characters distinguishing caloric when separate,
cease to be apparent when it has contributed to a change of
form in other bodies ; and the properties of the substances
so changed are also materially altered.         Now this is the only
unequivocal     mark   of  chemical   union   that we can apply in
any    instance  ; and  chemical    union  implies the existence and
efficiency of chemical affinity.
     2. The relation of caloric to different substances appears to
observe that peculiar law, which, in other instances, is termed
elective affinity.     If a compound of two or more principles,
a metallic oxide for instance, be exposed in a high tempera
 ture, the caloric forms a permanent union with the one, but
not with the other.         In certain instances, caloric is evolved,
 when two substances, attracting each other more powerfully
than they attract caloric, produce, on admixture, an elevation
 of temperature.      In other instances, caloric is absorbed when
 it is attracted by the new compound, more strongly than by
the separate components.          Such facts warrant the deduction,
 that caloric is subject to the laws of chemical affinity.       But
 the precise order ot its affinities remains to be decided by fu
 ture experiments.
     3. Caloric seems also, on some occasions, to bear a part
 in the operation of double elective affinities.         In this way
 it produces decompositions, which, by single affinity, it is
 incapable of effecting. Thus a most intense fire does not
 expel entirely the carbonic acid from alkalies: but, when
 the affinity of an acid for an alkali concurs with that of car-
 fa .<nic acid for caloric, a decomposition ensues. Again: water
 may be submitted to the highest temperature without impart
 ing a gaseous form to the hydrogen which it contains; but
 the conspiring affinity of a metal for oxygen occasions the
 production of hydrogenous gas.             On this principle many
                                   E 3                       chemical

52               Mr. Henry     on the Materiality of Heat.
chemical facts          are resolved into the law of double affinity,
which   are at         present explained by that of single elective at
traction.
   4. Caloric acts sometimes as an intermedium in combin
ing bodies which, without its aid, are not susceptible of com
bination.    Thus carbon and oxygen do not evince any ten
dency to combination at the ordinary temperature of the at
mosphere; but caloric brings them into union, and consti
tutes itself part of the resulting compound.       This, and a va
riety of other instances, have a striking resemblance to what
is called intermediate affinity.
    In the theory of Dr. Crawford, no influence is allowed to
chemical affinity over the phænomena of heat ; and, indeed,
that philosopher expresses a decided opinion that elementary
heat is not capable of uniting chemically with bodies. Hence
it appears, that the difference between the terms affinity and
capacity is not merely a verbal one, but that they are actually
expressive of different powers or causes; and the question,
therefore, which of these terms shall be adopted in the de
scription of facts, is one involving the determination of causes.
    The term capacity for heat is employed, by Dr. Crawford
and others, to denote, in the abstract, that power by which
different kinds of matter acquire different quantities of caloric.
But in the various applications that are made of this theory,
a more precise meaning is often affixed to it; and the term
is applied in much the fame fense which it has in common
language.      When thus understood, a difference of capacity
necessarily implies a difference in the extent of the spaces
between the minute particles of bodies ; and that these dif
ferences occasion the varieties observed in the acquirement of
heat by different bodies.        On this theory there is no active
principle   or  power    inherent  in bodies, and more active in
some than in others, — no tendency in the matter of heat to
attach itself, in preference, to auv one substance.        The as
signed   cause of  the phænomena     of heat  is not, I apprehend,
adequate to produce the effects ascribed to it.
    On the theory of capacities, a change of form           is,cerin
tain instances, antecedent to the absorption of caloric. Thus,
when ether       converted into gas, on removing the pressure
                  is
of the atmosphere, according to this hypothesis, the capacity
of the ether      increased
                  is             by
                                its volatilization; and the change
of form      prior to, and the cause of, the absorption of calo
            is
ric. The order of events, then, in the volatilization of ether
js  first an alteration of form; next,         change of capacity
                                               a                        ;
and, lastly, an absorption of caloric.         On this hypothesis,
ether may exist in the state of gas without containing                  a
                                                                  greater

              Mr.      Henry on the Materiality       of Heat.     53
greater absolute quantity of caloric than in a liquid form.
But such an interpretation of phænomena is directly con
tradictory to an established principle, admitted even by those
who prefer the doctrine of capacities, viz. that all bodies,
during their conversion from a fluid to a vaporous state, ab
sorb caloric.      It is at variance also with observed facts : for,
if a thermometer be immersed in a portion of ether, confined
under the receiver of an air-pump, the temperature of the
ether will be found to sink gradually during the exhaustion
of the air ; and the evaporation becomes proportionally
flower, till, at last, it is scarcely perceptible. We may there
fore infer, that, at a certain point of diminished temperature,
the volatilization of ether would entirely cease, if the supply
of caloric from surrounding bodies could be completely inter
cepted.      But, on the theory of capacities, the evaporation
should proceed as rapidly at the close as at the commence
ment of the process ; or, in other words, evaporation should
be wholly independent of temperature, which every one
knows is contrary to fact.
     It may be considered, therefore, as extremely probable,
 that the tendency of ether to assume a gaseous form depends
 on its chemical affinity for caloric.         But, it may be asked,
 how is this affinity counteracted by an increased pressure, and
 augmented by a diminished one?
     A circumstance absolutely essential to the formation of
 gases is,  that free space shall be allowed for their expansion..
 Mechanical pressure acts as          counteracting force to this ex
                                            a
 pansion, and either prevents            completely or partially, ac
                                             it
 cording to the degree of its application.           But from this fact
 no argument can be drawn against the existence of chemical
 affinity as an attribute of caloric.          Two opposite forces in
 physics may be          sobalanced, that neither shall 'produce its
 appropriate effect. Thus,          body impelled
                                        a                contrary direc
                                                        in
 tions may remain at rest         yet the operation of the opposing
                                    ;
 forces, in this case} cannot be denied. Even in chemistry,
 we have unequivocal examples in which the action of the
 affinities  issuppressed        more powerful causes. Thus, bodies
                                   by
 that have   a  strong chemical affinity are kept perfectly distinct
  even when placed           contact
                              in           the affinity of aggregation.
                                                 by
 The only inference, then, that can fairly be deduced from
 the effects of pressure in preventing the formation of gases,
 is, thatit   is   a power sometimes superior in energy to that of
  chemical affinity.
      Since, therefore, caloric      characterized by all the proper
                                        is
  ties, except gravity, that enter into the definition of matter,
  we may venture to consider           as    distinct and peculiar body.
                                            it    a
                                            E3                     No.

54                Mr. Henry      on the  Materiality of Heat.
Nor      is its deficiency of gravity sufficient to exclude it from
the    class   of material substances. Such nicety of arrangement
might,      with     equal propriety, lead us to deny the materiality
of light,' the gravity of which has never yet been proved;
for, besides the experiments of Mr. Michell, which failed in
ascertaining this property of light, we have several chemical
facts tending to the fame conclusion.                 Thus Mr. Cavendish,
after firing a mixture of hydrogenous and oxygenous gases in
a close vessel, a process during which much light is always
 emitted, found not the smallest diminution of weight.
     To have completed this defence of the material nature of
 heat, it would have been proper to have pointed out the cir
 cumstances in which the phænomena of heat differ from the
known and acknowledged phænomena of motion.                            At pre
sent, however, I have not leisure to pursue the subject at much
length; and though several points of disagreement would
 doubtless be found,          I  (hall mention only one of the most
marked and decisive.
     Motion is an attribute of matter, independently of which
 it cannot poflibly subsist. If, therefore, the phænomena of
 heat can be shown to take place where matter is not present,
 we (hall derive from the fact a conclusive argument against
 that theory of heat which assigns motion as its cause. Now,
 in the experiment of Count Rumford, before alluded to, heat
passed through a torricellian vacuum, in which, it need hardly
be observed, nothing could be present to transport or propa
gate motion.            This experiment, in my opinion, decidedly
proves that heat can subsist independently of other matter,
and consequently of motion ; in other words, that beat is a
Jijlincl and peculiar body *.
    * The argument at p. 49, which is the basis of my objections to the
cnnimoiiiy employed mode of ascertaining specific caloric, I fear, is not lo
fully and cle.irly stated as the abltruse nature of the subject requires.
    Assuming two bodies, A and B, to be at the point of privation of tem
perature, or to possess no free caloric whatsoever, the quantity of combined
caluiic in e;ich, according to Dr. Crawford's theory, is dircilly proportional
to the quantities of heat necessary to produce equal elevations of tempera
ture in the two bodies.       Thus, if to aitain a given temperature, A require
cleric as 20. and B only as 10, the combined caloric of A, before this
addition,     is inferred to have borne to that of B the ratio of 1 to 1.  But it
might, with equal or pei haps greater probability,      have been aflumed that
the combined caloric of A and B is i/rjnfcfy proportional to the quantities
of hear required to produce a given temperature;         that A, for example, to

     of  Senna used in Commerce.        By C. Dessessartz and
     Ventenat.
  V>< • NECTOUX, one of the scientific men whom the go
  vernment had made choice of to form part of the commission
  of the sciences and arts which accompanied general Bona
  parte to Egypt, being appointed to observe the agricultural
 system of the country, by examining its plants as well as
 other objects of natural history, embraced that opportunity
 of acquiring some more certain information in regard to the
 senna which Alexandria supplies to all Europe, and particu
 larly to France.
    The magazines of Alexandria and Cairo were the first
 sources which he minutely inspected.        All the bales of senna
 were opened to him, and he found not only the two kinds
 already known, but also a third plant added to them, the
 leaves   of which    have a great resemblance to those of the real
 senna.      But fearing,   and with reason, that the information
 he mould thus obtain would be as imperfect and incomplete
as that before publislied, he resolved to examine the different
species in the places where they are cultivated, and in the
different states of growth, that the description he intended to
give might be as full and accurate as possible.
    With this view he visited and examined, with great care,
the environs of Alexandria, Rosetta, Damielta, and Cairo ;
but without success : he did not find a single plant of senna
in the whole space inclosed in the Delta. The senna, there
fore, is called the senna of Alexandria merely because that
city is the general entrepot from which it is transported to
Europe ; and senna de la palthe, because such entrep6ts are
called paltbe, which signifies a farm : the managers are called
palthiers.
    By the information obtained from the different palthiers,
among whom he mentions, with gratitude, C. Rosetty, and
from the inhabitants of the country, he learned that senna
plants were to be found in the valleys of Sienne. He there
fore proceeded thither, and had the satisfaction of meeting
with some, and of collecting several loaded with flowers and
fruit. Encouraged by this success, nothing was able to re
strain the ardour of his curiosity ; neither the violence of the
heat, nor the difficulty of a long journey through parched
                                  E4                            and

«(5                 On a Tour through Egypt,
and rugged mountains, nor the dread of the ferocious Arabs,
among whom it was impossible to travel without imminent
danger.      He dispatched some of the natives, who brought
him    specimens of the different plants they met with.      But
being supported by the civil and military authorities, whom
the example and wishes of the commander in chief had in
spired with the same zeal for the promotion of every thing that
could contribute to the progress of the sciences, he penetrated
to every place where he had been told or suspected that he
should find1 senna.
    It was in the desert in the environs of Baffa-Tine, two
leagues from Cairo, that he collected the first plants of senna
belled v : on the left bank of the Nile, opposite to Hermantis
or Fallach, he met with a greater abundance, as well as in the
neighbourhood of Darao.
    The good senna and arguel, a kind of cynanchum, of the
best quality, and in the highest state of pefrection, grow in
great abundance in the valley of Basabras, or of Nubia, from
which it is brought by the caravans to Darao and Sienne;
and it is thence transmitted, at least in the greater part, to
Alexandria.       In the mountains, three days journey above
Sienne, the guebelly, the senna of the Thebaid, and the ar
guel, are found ; the last mentioned in pretty large quantity
in a valley which runs to the east of Sienne turning towards
Egypt.
     In these places, whether valleys, hills, or mountains, the
 good senna guebelly and the arguel receive no more culture
 than the belled v, which is considered as wild.      The plants
 grow spontaneously in groups. There are two crops, the
 abundance of which depends on the duration of the rains,
 which take place periodically every year. The first, which is
 the most plentiful, takes place at the end of the rains, which
 begin at the summer solstice and terminate towards the mid
 dle of September.     The second takes place about the middle
 of March.
     The preparation   consists merely in cutting the plants, and
 exposing them to the fun on the rocks till they are brought
 to a state of perfect desiccation. The two kinds are mixed
 sometimes in Nubia, but the belledy is never found in that
 part of the country.     It is only in the entrep6ts of Sienne
 and Cairo that it is added.    The accounts given of the quan
 tities collected and deposited in the magazines, and of those
 fold, justify the fear of great and dangerous adulteration by
 the addition of foreign plants.       For, according to the ac
 knowledgment of the palthier, the product of the two crops
 varies from 700 quintals to 1 iocs or more, a third of which is
                                                           argnel,

arguel, and the sale is 1400 or 1500 quintals.             Among that
received by our merchants are leaves of the cohitea and box.
     Unfortunately such instances of fraud, which are too com
mon in commerce, ar* attended with more serious consc-
             than that practised in regard to various kinds of
    rugs. They occasion much trouble to our druggists, who
3uences
are obliged to pick the senna with the utmost care.
     The antient botanists distinguished these two kinds of sen
 na, and the terms they employed for that purpose, foliis acu-
 tis and foliis obtujis, expressed with sufficient clearness and
 precision the differences         they exhibit.    Linnæus, however,
 thought it necessary to unite them, and to consider them as
 varieties. C. Lamarck notices in his dictionary, under the
 head cajjia, the error into which this celebrated botanist has
 fallen.     He distinguishes two kinds of senna which grow in
 Egypt. One, the leaves of which are acute, is announced
 under the name given to it by Forstcal, cajjia lanceolata; and
•the other, the leaves of which are obtuse, under that of cajjia
senna. -The observations presented to the class on these two
 plants by C. Delisle, and afterwards by C. Nectoux, esta
 blish also several other differences.       The cajjiasennn is distin-
              from the cajjia lanceolata, not only by the obtuse
  f;uished
    eaves, but also by the stipulæ, which are longer and shaped
  like a lance, and by its bent pod having on the middle of
 each face projecting ridges.
      The description given by C. Nectoux, when compared with
 that of C. Delisle, gives a resemblance of characters, which
 facilitates a distinct knowledge of the classification of these
 plants, which have been long valued on account of their me
  dical qualities.       It is under this point  of view   we shall con
  sider them.
      In  the    year  6, C. Bouillon-Lagrange publiflied a che
  mical analysis     of  the senna of the palthe of Alexandria, which
  is used  in   commerce.       We conceived that, by delivering to
  him the. three kinds of plains, an ample provision of which had
  been entrusted to us by C. Nectoux, we should be able to
  present to the class at the fame time a knowledge of the
  principles contained in the senna and arguel, compared with
   that already obtained in regard to the senna of commerce.
  Our wish has been fully gratified by the zeal and ability of
   C   Lagrange.        It will not appear astonishing to you, that
   the two analyses of the years 6 and 10 present the same re
   sults, with the exception of such small differences that they
   can have no influence on the opinion which physicians ought
   |o form of the action of the two kinds of senna, since the senna
                                                                       of

  58              On the Senna used in Commerce.
  of commerce is nothing else than a compound of the three
 kinds, which C. Nectoux collected and preserved separately.
    The two old kinds were subjected separately to examina
 tion, and their products without much impropriety may be
 ranked in the fame class.      It remained therefore to subject
 to the same researches the plant argucl, called senna of Mecca,
placed in the class of the cynanchum by C. Nectoux, who
 has given an ample description of it. The following is the
 result of the chemical experiments made with it by Bouillon-
 Lagrange.
    " It appeared to me," fays he, " that this substance con
tained a smaller quantity of extractive matter. Infusion, either
cold or hot, decoction, and evaporation of the liquors gave
only a small quantity of extract, and this extract in regard to
 its principles was always analogous to the extracts of the two
old kinds of senna.      The same effects therefore, but in a
weaker degree, are to be expected from it. But this differ
 ence is of great importance in the practice of medicine, and
ought to be attended to, as well as the form under which the
remedy is administered.
    The researches made at the fame time by our colleague
Vauquelin and Bouillon-Lagrange on a constituent part of
senna, which has been considered as resinous, and conse
quently as the most active, will establish more certain ideas
respecting this kind of purgative.
    C. Nectoux sent with the leaves, small twigs and pods of
the senna guebelly, and the flowers which he gathered from
that plant.     These flowers, according to the researches of
Bouillon-Lagrange, give the fame results, only that they do
not communicate so much colour to the liquor in which they
are infused or boiled.    They have not so saline and bitter a
taste as the leaves ; their odour also is different, and every
thing announces that they contain less of the purgative prin
ciples.
    This memoir appears to us particularly important in an
economical point of view, as the author proposes to transplant
the Egyptian and Nubian senna to St. Domingo, where it
may be cultivated in districts abandoned by the planters. C.
Nectoux assures us that these plants would succeed equally
well in the Isles of France and Reunion, and also in Cayenne.

 X.   Biographical Account of Matthew          Boulton,     Esq.*
JlF genius and indefatigable industry, directed by the purest
patriotism, have any claim to the notice of our readers, an
authentic account of this gentleman cannot but be highly
acceptable to them. When we contemplate the enlarged
extent of his views, the wide and rapid circulation of his im
provements and discoveries in the most important branches
of art, and the numerous and honourable connections which
he has formed in every part of the civilized world, we shall
be obliged to admit that few men possess greater claims to
the attention and gratitude of their country.
    Matthew Boulton, son of Matthew Boulton, by Christian,
daughter of Mr. Peers, of Chester, was born at Birmingham
the 14th of September 1738. He received the chief part of
his education at a private grammar-school              kept by the
Rev. Mr. Ansted, who officiated at St. John's Chapel, De-
ritend.
    So early, we believe, as the year 1745, Mr. Boulton,
having lost his father, who left him in flouristiing circum
stances, distinguished himself by the invention of a new and
most ingenious method of inlaying steel. Buckles, watch-
chains, and a great variety of other articles wrought at his
manufactory, were exported in large quantities to France,
where they were eagerly purchased by the English, who af
fected to have no taste for the productions of their own coun
 try.
    The confinement of a populous town was but ill suited to
 such an establishment as soon became necessary for Mr. Boul-
 ton's further experiments.     Accordingly, in the year 1 7 62,
 he purchased those extensive tracts of common, at that time
 a barren heath, with only a small house and mill, on which
 the Soho manufactory now stands.           He laid the foundation
 of his present extensive works at the expense of nine thou
 sand pounds.     To this spot his liberal patronage soon at
 tracted great numbers of ingenious men from all parts ; and
 by their aid he so eminently succeeded in imitating the or
 moulu,that the most splendid apartments in this and in many
 foreign countries received their ornaments from Soho. Here,
 too, the works of the greatest masters in oil colours were me
 chanically taken off, with such ease and exactness that the
 original could scarcely be distinguished from the copy. This
 mode of copying was invented, we believe, by Mr. Egging-

ton, whose performances in stained glass have since intro
duced his name to the public.
   The utmost power of the water-mill, which Mr. Boulton
had hitherto employed, fell infinitely short, even with the
aid of horses, of that immense force which was soon found
necessary to the completion of his designs.     Recourse was
therefore had, about the year 1767, to that chef-d'oeuvre of
human ingenuity, the steam engine.       In speaking of that
wonderful machine, we shall adopt the animated language of
a late excellent Review : — The steam engine, approaching to
the nature of a perpeluum mobile, or rather an animal, is
incapable of lassitude or sensation, produces coals, works
metals, moves machines, and is certainly the noblest drudge
that was ever employed by the hand of art. Thus we " put
a hook in the nose of the Leviathan :" thus we " play with
him as a child, and take him for a servant for ever •;" thus
"  we subdue nature, and derive aid and comfort from the
elements     of earthquakest."
     The first engine that Mr. Boulton constructed was on
M.   Savary 's plan, of which the reader will find one of the most
satisfactory accounts in Professor Bradley's
                                                        "
                                                   New Improve
ments of Planting and Gardening!," &c. But the machine
was yet, as it were, in its infancy, and by no means an
swered Mr. Boulton's expectations.         In the year 1769 Mr.
James Watt, of Glasgow, obtained a patent for such a pro
digious improvement of            that Mr. Boulton immediately
                                  it,
sought his acquaintance, and induced him to settle at Soho.
At this place, the facility of its application to variety of    a
concerns, wherein great force was requisite, soon manifested
its superior utility and vast advantages to the public      Parlia  :
ment, therefore, in 1775, cheerfully granted          prolongation

of Mr. Watt's patent for twenty-five years.          A partnership
now commenced between Messrs. Boulton and Watt; and                       a
manufactory of steam-engines, on their improved plan, was
established at Soho, which still supplies the chief mines and
manufactories throughout the kingdom.
   Aided      by
               such talents, and commanding such unlimited
mechanical powers, Mr. Boulton's views soon expanded, and
Soho began to exhibit fxmptoms of the extraordinary advan
tages  ithad acquired.      The art of coining had long stood in
need of simplification and arrangement        and to this art Mr.

and struck a gold medal     of the full weight of a guinea, and
of  the same form as that   of his new copper coinage lately put
into circulation.    The superior advantages of that form are
obvious. The impression     is far less liable to friction ; and by
means    of a steel gauge  of equal diameter, money coined on
that principle    may  be examined     by measure as well as by
weight, the rim being exactly circular.         Moreover, the in
trinsic is so nearly equal to the current value of every piece,
that, without a steam-engine and adequate apparatus, every
attempt to counterfeit the Soho coinage must be made with
less.   The fabrication of base money seems likely, by these
means, to be speedily checked, and, it is to be hoped, en
tirely defeated.    The reason why Mr. Boulton has not yet
been employed by government in the coinage of gold and
silver, wehavenst been able to learn.
    The mill at Soho works eight machines, each of which
receives, stamps, and delivers out, by the aid of only a little
 hoy, from seventy to ninety pieces of copper in one minute.     Ei
 ther of them is stopped without the smallest interruption to
 the motion of the others. In adjoining apartments all the
 preparatory processes are carried on with equal facility and
 dispatch ; such as rolling the copper into sheets, dividing
 them into blanks, and shaking them into bags clean and
 ready for the die.       Without any personal communication
 between the different classes of workmen, &c. the blanks are
 conveyed to the room where they are shaken, and from thence
 to the coining-room, in boxes moving with immense velocity
 on an inclined plane, and accompanied by a ticket of their
 weight.
    The Sierra Leone company have employed Mr. Boulton's
 mint in the coinage of silver, and the East India company
 in that of copper. Two complete mints have likewise been
 lately sent to Petersburgh.
    Since the demise of the late empress Catharine, Mr. Boul
 ton presented her successor, the late emperor Paul I., with
 some of the most curious articles of his manufactory, and in
 return received a polite letter of thanks and approbation, to
 gether with a splendid collection of medals, minerals from
 Siberia, and specimens of all the modern money of Russia.
 Among the medals, which for elegance of design and beauty
 of execution have never yet been equalled in this or any
 other country, is a massy one of gold, impressed with a strik
 ing likeness, it is said, of that monarch.        Our readers will
 be surprised, when they are told that this unrivalled piece
 was struck from a die engraved by the present empress dow

  6z      Biographical Account of Matthew Boulton, Esq.
 ager,   who has from her youth taken great delight in the art
 of engraving on steel.
     With the view of still further improving and facilitating
 the manufactory of steam-engines, Messrs. Boulton and
 Watt have lately, in conjunction with their sons, established
a foundery at Smethwick, a short distance fromSoho. Here
 that powerful agent is employed, as it were, to multiply
 itself, and its various parts are fabricated and adapted toge
 ther with the fame regularity, neatness, and expedition,
which distinguish all the operations of their manufactory.
Those engines are afterwards distributed to all parts of the
kingdom ay the Birmingham               canal, which communicates
 with a wet dock belonging to the foundery.
     To such amazing perfection has the steam-engine at length
been brought, that the consumption of one bushel of New
castle coals will raise nearly six thousand hogsheads of water
ten feet high, and will do the work of ten horses for one
hour.      This remarkable abridgement of human labour, and
                   diminution of expense, are, in a great mea-
  ure, the result of trials made under the auspices of Mr.
f>roportionate
Boulton. But for a more complete account of these ma
chines, their power, &c. we must refer the reader to Dr.
Darwin's Botanic Garden*.
    It could scarcely be expected that envy would view with
indifference such singular merit, and such unexampled suc
cess.    The inventions and improvements of Messrs. Boulton
and Watt were first imitated, and then either decried or dis
puted. Reason laboured in vain to silence the clamours of
injustice, and to defeat the stratagems of fraud. At length,
in the year 1792, a solemn decision of parliament, and,
about the same time, the concurrent opinion of the court of
king's bench, forbad any further encroachment.
     Whoever contemplates the merit and utility of a long life
devoted to such valuable pursuits, as we have here briefly and
very imperfectly described, and recollects without emotion,
that the spot whereon so much has been done, and is still
doing ; where hundreds of women and children easily earn
a comfortable subsistence f; where population is rapidly in
creasing, and the means of national prosperity increasing in

XI.   On the EffeSs of Elder in preserving Plants from InfeSt
        and Flies. By M. Christophe                   Gullet     *
\->iOMMON         elder has appeared        to me useful,   ist, for pre
venting cabbage     plants     from    being   devoured  or damaged    by
caterpillars : 2d, to prevent blights, and their effects on fruit-
and other trees : 3d, to preserve corn from yellow flies and
other insects : 4th, to secure turnips from the ravage of flies,
&c.
   ist, The   strong and fetid odour of a bunch of elder leaves
induced me to think that different kinds of butterflies might
be incommoded by it in proportion to their delicacy. I there
fore took some young twigs of elder, at the period when but
terflies began to appear, and whipped well with them some
cabbage plants, but in such a manner as not to damage them.
Since that time, during two summers, though the butterflies
hovered round the plants, I never saw one of them settle on
them ; and I do not think that a single butterfly was hatched
on the cabbages treated in this manner, though a neigh
bouring board was dirtied by them in the usual manner.
    2d, After a short reflection on the effects here mentioned,
and on blights, which, in my opinion, are chiefly occasioned
by small fnes and small insects whose organs are still more
delicate than those of the former, I was induced to whip in

 from at least six inches above to the top of the tree the re.st
 of the leaves were blighted, wrinkled, and full of worms. It
 is here to be observed that the tree was in full flower when I
 whipped         therefore much too late for this operation, which

fore I  could attempt it. Next morning, however, at break of
day, two servants having drawn bundles of elder over the ears
of wheat on each side of the furrow, backwards and forwards,
in places where the wheat was not so far advanced,                hoped I
that the fetid effluvia of the elder would prevent the flies from
remaining on the ears that were covered with them                  and,     :
indeed,   I  was not entirely disappointed          for, on examining

                                       I
been beaten with elder was much less damaged than that which
had not been treated in the fame manner.                have no doubt,

that, had     I employed this precaution sooner, the corn would
have been completely preserved.            Should this be the cafe, the

    Another fact which tends to support this idea            that      is,
when my neighbourhood, about eight or nine years ago, was
 so infested with caterpillars that they devoured all the vege
tables, leaving scarcely      green leaf untouched, they spared
                              a
the elder-trees amidst this general devastation,     and never
molested them.      In reflecting on these circumstances, am               [
of opinion that the elder might be introduced with advantage
into our gardens, as the means of preserving fruit-trees and
various plants from the rapacity of insects.                           »

be preferred      making experiments on this subject.

 the misrepresentations of Mr. Henry Clarke, and of the wri

more serious concerns, which will demand my whole atten

66                  Dr. Dicison's Reply          to   Mr. Clarte.
mistook the sense of my very acute and ingenious author ; for
which      I
          am ready to make him and my readers any reasona
ble apology*.    But it is also true, as Mr. Clarke himself
confesses, that I          "
                     have endeavoured   to do justice to my
author," and,         " on     the whole, have properly appreciated       his
merit." Yet it is no less apparent, that both Mr. Clarke
and the Monthly Critic, not contented, as the Critical Re
viewer has been, with correcting my error, have, without the
smallest provocation, treated me with the greatest harshness
 and contempt. Their motives will appear hereafter, from
 the internal evidence of their own writings, compared with
 my notes on C. Carnot ; and from strong collateral circum
 stances.      Among other things, it will appear, that Mr.
 Clarke, as well as the Monthly Censor, is in some degree, a
 critic by trade ; that both are in the habit of emitting their
 decisions, with an air of despotic authority, which ill becomes
 men whose abilities, considerable as they are, cannot hide
 their infirmities, far less justify their insolence; and that, in
 many instances, they ought rather to implore pardon, than
  to provoke recrimination.          Mr. Clarke has already been
  taxed with " nensen/e" in correcting my errors; and the
  " injurious assertions" of the Monthly Critic have lately
 obliged the justly celebrated Dr. Hutton, of Woolwich, to
 drag the
              " concealed tyrant" out of his hole, and to expose
  him publicly by name.
      I lhall be justified by the evidence before me, to consider
 my censors (especially the Monthly one) in certain other
 lights than those of self-conceited and unjust critics, and
  illogical, new-fangled, mathematicians. — But my chief ob
 ject at present         is,

   In the first place, I solemnly declare that                                this charge is
false and groundless in every possible respect.
   Secondly y I deny that          I
                            have there    shown              "                a generalme
thod of finding the fluxions of quantities."                              I   have only in
serted in a note,             "
                      a specimen" — a slight            "
                                                     and imperfect
general      outline" — of a
                           very easy, and in some measure new,
manner of treating the fundamental processes of fluxions,
which I long ago mentioned to yourself; and which, with
some thoughts on Prime and Ultimate Ratios, I intended
to offer you for publication," &c*           The substance of the
paper    here   alluded to,   which   you may recollect my men
tioning,    I submitted to  a  certain Gentleman whose education
does honour to the University of Cambridge.          But the paper
itself, owing to my indisposition and avocations, is not yet
finished; and, owing to the treatment I have received, is
likely never to be printed, any more than some analogous
pieces of more consequence,         which I intended for the press.
This, Mr. Clarke will fay, perhaps very truly, is no loss to
the public. But unless he can divine the contents of a piece,
 which has no public existence, his charge of plagiarism must
become impotent, or can only affect it's fabricator.
     Thirdly, Whether even the " specimen" of the method
 which I promised, be, or be not, " the very same" with Mr.
 Clarke's, is a matter ossacl, of which those persons who
 compare them can judge; and such I leave to determine,
 Whether they know any book from which that "specimen"
 differs so widely as it does from that of Mr. Clarke.
     I pretended not to a method entirely, or even in a great
 measure, new.        My principal object was facility, which is
 but too much neglected by great mathematicians. I thought,
 however, that my first way of sinding the fluxion of a fraction
 was my own, as I still think the second is. Certainly, I never
 received either of them from any man, or from any book.
 The first is as follows :
   "    The fluxion of a fraction may be found by considering
 it as the product of the numerator and denominator, giving
                          I                        X                                     — 1

 those who read the critiques of which I complain, must ac

 To such personal provocation,          I have hitherto been an utter
Jlranger   ;  though, you know, that for six years, I laboured
 to promote, by all the fair, honest and legal means in my
 power, the Abolition of the nefarious African Slave-trade. I
 do not even except the unprovoked piece of invective which
 first contributed to "drag me into that controversy *" — one
 of the most angry, and voluminous, which ever agitated this
 nation.        In what I have farther to write, s shall endea

XIII. A general         View os the Coal Mines ivorledin France, of
     tbe'vr different  ProduSs, and the Means of circulating them.
    By C. Lefebvre, Member of tb* Council of Mines, of
     the Pbilomatic Society, &lc. &c*
I      HAD proposed for several years to exhibit a view of the
resources of France in regard to combustible fossils.                   I was
desirous of making known, at the fame time, the principal
places of consumption, the grand merallurgic establishments,
where these substances are, or might be, employed ; and to
add to this labour an indication             of the localities proper for
the creation of new manufactories, according to the union
presented by nature of mineral substances, capable of being
worked, and of abundance of fuel.
      It appeared to me also, that, to fill up this sketch, it would
be necessary to include pretty certain data, in regard to the
nature and quantity of the resources which the forests and
woods might furnish for consumption in different parts
of the French territory, and particularly in regard to those
most interesting to be considered               under the view of large
manufactories f.
      The information collected by the council of mines for
 seven or eight years, furnished a variety of details and in
 teresting facts in regard to the mineral substances known
 and dug up in our territory.                  The notes respecting coal
 mines in particular were the most numerous, because the ad
 ministration of mines, feeling the necessity of supplying the
 diminution of the products of our forests, and the importance
 of ensuring constant activity to our manufactories, by means
 of coals, had paid the most serious attention to this object.
      A great many indications, however, required further con-
      * From
                Journal des Mines, No. 7 x .
      +  A good map of the communications, both by land and by water,
 pointing out the forests, coal mines, the turf mosses, and the large manu
 factories, would be of great value to commerce.        It would certainly con
 tribute to give more activity to internal commerce.       A map of this kind
  is -wanted, and the construction of it appears to be an object worthy the
 attention of the present government.
      The councl of mine* sketched out, in the year 4, a part of this opera
  tion on the navigation chart by Dupain-Triel.      It contained marks which
  pointed out the position of the coal mines, turf mosses, forges, great foun-
  deries, salt works, and some other large manufactories, respecting which,
  accurate information had been obtained ; but this labour is now very im
  perfect, because the new departments are not included in this chart, which,
 on account of the new information obtained since that period, ought to be
 added.
                 6                                                 firmation,

                  On the Coal Mines worked in France.                   71
formation, and whole districts of France, which were supposed
to be highly interesting,        were still imperfectly known in re
gard to mineralogy.           The council had not been able for se
veral years to fend out many engineers to explore the country;
many of the departments earnestly requested that researches
might be made in this manner; and the distribution of
these functionaries in the places where their presence was so
necessary, could not fail to be one of the first measures of a
government whose attention was so zealously occupied with
the prosperity of the state *.
    As   I  had the strongest reason to hope that the results of
the   researches and observations           of the engineers of mines
would furnisti the most valuable materials for the proposed
view of our mineral resources, I resolved to wait until their
residence in the different departments should have enriched
the administration of mines with new information proper
for rendering more perfect my proposed labour.
    I was besides persuaded that, during that period, the so
licitude and enlightened alacrity of the magistrates who com
pose the general administration os forests, would give more
extent and correctness to our knowledge respecting the con
sistence and products of our woods; that, perhaps, we should
even have a map of the forests ; and that the work which I
projected might still be completed in this very important de
partment.
    I confined myself, therefore, to the collecting of notes ; to
verifying as far as possible, and to extending the first data
in the possession of the administration of mines, and to
making researches in regard to the existing means of circu
lation, and those which it would be proper to create, in order
to take as much advantage as possible of the materials which
were the object of my labour.
    But at the moment when peace, restored to Europe, in
spired a desire of renewing our commercial intercourse with
the neighbouring nations, we endeavoured to examine what
really were our Wants, and what advantages would arise to
us from the reciprocal exchanges which might take place.
    Our attention was directed in particular to mineral sub
stances : we knew that before the war they had been a con
siderable object of importation ; coals in particular had been
    * In               of measures taken this year (an. 10) by Chaptal, th<
           consequence
minister of the interior, sixty depattments are to be visited and carefully
examined by engineers, who will concur with the præfects in the im rove,
ments to be made in thole parts, and who will give an account of them to
government.       This is all that could be done with the present number of
engineers who can be spared for that purpose.
                                     F  4                         brought

si                   A general   View of the
brought in great abundance into our territory, though the
use of that kind of fuel was less frequent at that period than
at present, and much less, no doubt, than it will become in
consequence of the deterioration of the wood.       It was, there
fore, of more importance than ever to appreciate properly
our new situation in this respect, after our increase of terri
tory, the fruit of the conquests of our armies.        It was ne
cessary to determine whether we ought to admit among us
the products of foreign coal mines ; considering on one hand
the quantity of money exported,, and the decrease or even
stagnation of industry which might ensue in our national
mines ; and on the other, whatever was proper for the secu
rity and improvement of our manufactures.
    All the data proper for the solution of this question were
subjected to government.        The different opinions pro and
contra were defended with that warmth which is alwavs ex
cited by objects of great national importance, among men
strongly attached to their country, and deeply affected by
every thing which ought to have an influence on their des
tiny.
    Whatever may be the determination of government, we
 must rely with confidence on the wisdom of its views, and
be assured, that it will not decide without being fully in
 formed on the subject.
    In publishing at present this view of the resources presented
by our coal mines, I have no intention of entering into a
discussion of the question already mentioned : but several per
 sons having urged me to make known, as far as possible, our
 riches in this department, I thought that by complying
 with their request I should render my labour important in se
 veral points of view ; first, as supplying information useful to
 statesmen, who might be desirous of details on this subject,
 and to the different consumers and to the workers of mines.
    I have followed the alphabetical order of the departments;
 each of them has been reviewed; and from the information
 obtained   I have enumerated all the known mines now
 worked, those susceptible of being worked, and those indi
 cations not yet verified which seem to deserve an attentive
 examination.
    I have exhibited as far as possible the mass of the pro
  ductions of the coal mines in each department where they
 are worked, and the mean price of the coals, both at the
 mines and in the principal places of consumption.
    I must however    observe,   that there  are some departments
 whtre the mines are worked in so irregular a manner, that it
  was impossible for me to obtain data sufficiently satisfactory,
                                                              either

cither in regard to the quantity of coals extracted, or to their
value.     In that cafe I have only made known the_ districts
where the coals are found.
    To the means of circulation which exist, or those which
ought to be established, I have paid particular attention. I
have indicated these means as far as possible ; and under this
point of view in particular I hope my labour may be useful,
because, by making known the means of circulation, the
public attention may be directed to the transportation and
use of our combustible fossils, in places where it has hitherto
been supposed that they could not be employed with advan
tage.     With this view I have added to this work a chart,
where the means of circulation may be-traced out, by corre
sponding numbers placed in the margin, and by lines drawn
or dotted with red, which mark the existing modes of cir
culation, and those projected, or which it may appear of ad
vantage to establish.
    The departments in which no fossil combustibles are dug
up have nevertheless been presented in their order ; and          I
have announced whence these substances may be extracted,
 and the means by which they may be transported.
     I have exhibited also a general view of the various con
 siderations in regard to public advantage and economy which
 result from the present state, as far as it is known, of our
 resources of mineral fuel.
                         Department   ofAvn.
    This department exhibits no strata of coals worked at
  present.     At Surjoux, in the canton of Seyssel, on the banks
 of the Rhine, asphaltes or mineral bitumen is found. It
 is extracted from beds of coarse granitic freestone, ana
 logous to that which covers certain strata of coal, or
 which is found in alternate strata with it. Several banks of
 this bituminous freestone are found all round the commune
 of Surjoux. They have very little consistence, on account of
 the abundance of liquid bituminous matter with which they
  are mixed.
      C. Suretan, an inhabitant of Seyssel, who has a grant of a
  part of those districts, extracts and prepares this mineral bi
  tumen. The products extracted amount annually to about
  ten thousand myriagrammes.          This substance may be em
  ployed   for daubing   over cordage and wood, to defend them
  from water and from the attack of worms.         It is useful also
  for greasing the axle-trees of carriages, and different parts of
  machines, to facilitate their rolling.
     The means of circulation of these productions are the

  This country contains no   coal mines (i) * worked at pre
sent : a substance known under the name of coal earth is com
monly found in              it,
                     forming beds of greater or less thickness,
and generally placed at no great depth beneath the cultivated
lands.    It   is
               a fort of exceedingly pyritous turf.      It burns
badly,  and  cannot  be employed for the fame purposes as real
coal :    would be very bad for healing apartments, or for
         it
working iron. A great deal of this substance, however,                                  is
dug up   ;    it   is
                employed                 by
                                the fanners, who spread       out,                it

   The abundance of pyrites dispersed throughout the strata of
turf render them susceptible, perhaps, of yielding,         proper           by
treatment, sulphate of iron (green copperas). The coal pits
of the northern departments will easily furnish coal for the
consumption of that of Aisne, when the junction canal be
tween the Scheldt and the river Oise shall be terminated.

    There are coal mines worked at Noyant, (2) in the com
mune of the fame name, situated six leagues south-west of
Moulin.-, on the edge of the road from that town to Mont-

towards the latter place, there     another coal mine now
                                                is

                   Coal Mines worked in France.               Jj
•f the coals seem to promise.    The product of these mines
is consumed in the neighbouring glass-houses, and the coals
are transported by water down the Allier, on the Loire, the
canal of Briare, and the Seine.
   A plan has been long in agitation to employ the small
river of Quenne to facilitate the transportation os' these coals
as far as the Allier.  If this project be susceptible of execu
tion, there can be no doubt that this mode of communica
tion with the river Allier will be of great importance ; for
the expense of land-carriage as far as Moulins already dou
bles the price of the C03I.  It varies in these mines from six
to ten per cent, the myriagramme : it has already risen
at Moulins from twelve to twenty per cent.; aud when de
livered at Paris from twenty-four to forty per cent.
    This department exhibits also, in the commune of Com-
mentry, considerable strata of coal of excellent quality, and
might be worked with advantage, if a consumption be created
for them : this at present is absolutely wanting, and for this
reason these mines are very little worked.     The engineers of
mines who have visited this country have pointed out several
new strata not before observed.
   The mines of Plaveret and de Bouije furnished in the year
3, a hundred thousand myriagrammes, which is far below the
quantity that might easily be extracted. The price at the mine
is about four cents per myriagramme.
    If the Cher were rendered navigable from Montlucon to
Vierzon, where it is so at present, the mines in the neigh
 bourhood of Commentry would soon give rife to enterprises
 which would enliven that country.      It is probable that they
 would have a very happy influence on the activity of the nu
 merous forges situated on the borders of the Cher, and at a
 small distance from     it, the application of
                               by                   fuel

    There are indications of coal in several parts of this coun
 try which deserve to be examined,         if
                                         there were easier means
 of disposing of them, or     consumption could be found for

 been made in regard to those of the Lower Alps.         They have
however a more certain and an easier sale, in consequence of
 the neighbourhood of the town of Briangon, where the con
sumption is very considerable, as wood is exceedingly scarce
in that canton.

    A grant was  passed in the year 9, of the coal mine (5) in the
neighbourhod     of Roquebrune.        The grantee has lately an
nounced that the first attempts were not successful.             It,
however, appears that some of this fuel is dug up in several
places in the neighbourhood of Monaco. These mines might
acquire a certain degree of importance, if the coals were of a
good quality, and it they were exported through the port of
Monaco, or if manufactories of iron articles were established
in that department, or in the environs of the mines.
    If the iron ore of the mines of Elba was treated in this de
partment, or in that of Var, the iron obtained might give
rife to manufactories of this kind ; but these considerations
require further information, which will no doubt excite the
attention of government.
                     Department    of Ardeche.
    Coals are found (6) in several cantons of this department,
and particularly in the environs of Jaujac, Privas, Aubenas,
Vallon, and Saint Marcel d'Ardeche. These mines, in gene
ral, are badly worked. They are interesting, however, in
different points of view ; first, on account of the consumption
occasioned by the numerous manufactories of the country ;
and in the second place of the facility of carriage down the
Rhone.
    No data sufficiently exact have yet been obtained in regard
to the products of these mines: they are certainly considerable,
and would become much more productive and profitable, if
the works were better conducted.             The common price of
coals in that country is about 8 cents per myriagramme.
    An engineer of mines, if settled in this department, might
introduce improvements in the working of thuse coal mines,
which are exceedingly desirable.         He could employ himself
also on other objects useful to   the  industry of the inhabitants.

    XIV.    O/i Canals.            By Thomas                 Telford,   Esq.*
 I NLAND         navigation has now been so long and extensively
 practised    in Great Britain, that the benefits arising from it
 are generally felt and acknowledged ; and it is difficult to sav,
 whether the improvements in agriculture, manufacture!;, or
 commerce, are most indebted to the numerous canals which
 now intersect the country in all directions, or to other causes.
    It is not my intention at present to trace the rise and pro
 gress of this great national improvement, nor to enter deeply
 into the general principles of it : what I chiefly aim at in this
 slight sketch   is, to draw the attention of the people who are
 concerned  in    laying out new canals, to some circumstances
 which appear to me to be very material to the interests of canal
 companies and to the country at large.
     In considering the subject,        shall beg leave to state, that
                                          I
 canals are chiefly for the purpose of,
 I   ft,  Carrying fuel and raw materials to some manufactur
 ing towns or districts, and for exporting manufactured goods.
     2dly, Carrying fuel lor domestic purposes manure for the   ;
 purposes of agriculture     ;transporting the produce of the                   di
 stricts through which the canal pastes to the different mar
 kets; and promoting agricultural purposes in general.
    3dly, Carrying the produce of mines to the fea-stiores.
    These appear to be the leading points                      by
                                                      which our views
 ought   to  be  guided  in planning    new   canals.  The supplying
 the district through which the canal passes with groceries
 and merchant goods         is very secondary consideration
                                 a                               expe    ;
 rience has taught this lesson to the persons who are concerned
 in the canals already made         and
                                     ;          proper this source of
                                                it      is
 disappointment should be made generally known, in order to
 prevent future misapplication of talents and capital.
    In planning   a   new canal,      should be carefully considered
                                         it
 under which of the foregoipg heads the uses of the canal
 ought to be classed. Cases will sometimes, no doubt, occur,
 where the several purposes above mentioned will in some
 measure be combined          but they will rarely be          equally  so
 balanced, as to create      a ;
                              difficulty in discovering the predo
 minant features.       The general purposes of the canal being
judiciously determined, all the following steps should be taken
 with a   view to promote the principal end.
    If the canal        for the purpose of carrying fuel and raw
                       is
materials to some manufacturing town or district, and export-

ing   the manufactured goods from thence, or for carrying the
   rod uce of mines to the sea-shores, — the line of canal should
E e made in as short a direction as the nature of the country
will admit of, even if this line should be atttended with some
extraordinary expense ; and that mode of conveyance should
be adopted which is least liable to be interrupted, because in
those cases much depends upon a constant and regular supply.
    If  the canal is chiefly for the purposes of agriculture, those
lines are to be fought for which will accommodate the country
most perfectly at the least possible expense.       This will not,
in general, be effected by short and direct, but, on the con
trary, by circuitous and level lines, such as will visit many
parts of the country, carry fuel and manure into every quar
ter, and take off the produce of the land for back carriage.
Merchandize, although a very inferior consideration, will, Dy
the same means, be extensively and equally distributed. When
the carriage of those heavy but necessary articles is rendered
cheap, and the supply convenient, the consumption will in
 crease.    The very use of lime as a manure is in general suf
ficient to create a considerable revenue upon a canal, when
the coal and limestone can be carried along the canal at a
 moderate expense. As improvements in agriculture must in
 crease the wealth of the inhabitants, more articles are required
to supply their multiplied wants; the possession of capital
 prompts them to enter upon new employments, and the de
 mands of all create an addition of business upon the canal.
     Many other advantages attend circuitous and level canals.
 If there are upland countries above the level of the canal,
 some cheap and convenient situations may be selected where
 the waste water of the uplands can be collected into reservoirs
 to be formed for this purpose. From those reservoirs the water
 may be taken into the canals. At various points of the ca
 nal, where there are falls immediately on the lower fide, mills
 may be erected for grinding corn, or for the purposes of ma
 nufactures : in many parts, two or three overshot wheels, of
 sufficient diameter, may be placed below each other: when
 the water has performed those useful offices, it will fall into
 the brooks, and prove a plentiful and regular supply to other
 works in the course of each stream.
     Improvements in agriculture may also be greatly promoted
 by using a part of the waste water for the purpose of irriga
  tion.    For a canal carried over a country upon a high level
  would prove an extensive top drain. Not only the land ad-
   oining the banks of the canal, but all which lies below the
 i rvrl, may enjoy the use of the water for irrigation ; and the
 1"
  brooks and rivers will be the tail drains of the country.

    Collecting    the waste water in winter,   and in heavy rains,
will prove advantageous in every respect : it will be the means
of preventing high and rapid floods; it will be converting to
useful purposes that which flows off to idle waste, and, not
unfrequently, to positive mischief.
    The useful purposes to which brooks and rivers are now
applied, will not be injured, but improved; as there will be
a more plentiful supply in summer, and a better regulated one
during the winter months.
    Parliament would not hesitate to grant canal companies the
power of making reservoirs, and receiving a reasonable re
compense for the water supplied from the canal for the pur
 poses of agriculture and manufactures, because it would in
jure no person, and accommodate all : it will be furnishing
 additional powers to British industry, and creating permanent
 wealth to the nation.
     I understand that this mode of managing water has long
 been practised in Italy, especially in the Milanese, where a
 considerable revenue is derived by the waste water of canals ;
 and the regulations respecting it have long engaged the at
 tention of the legislature of that country.
     If I am right in the foregoing statements, it will be easy to
 apply them to different dillricts of country, and, by a careful
 and impartial judgment, to decide upon the character of each
 canal.
     It is probably not sufficiently known what quantity of rain
 water falls in the course of a year in various parts of the king
 dom ; it therefore may not be improper to add the following
  statement, which will be some guide with regard to this sub
 ject; and if along with this we take the accounts of persons
  accustomed to make observations, a tolerably conect estimate
  may be formed of the average quantity of water which can
  be collected in each district : it will, in general, be found to
  exceed the expectations of persons who have not paid atten

  It  appears by a memoir presented to the Antiquarian So
ciety on the 3d of February by Dr. Raine, that the inscrip
tion on the pillar near Alexandria, so long considered ille
gible, has been decyphered.    The discovery was made by
captain Leake of the artillery, and captain Squire of the
engineers.   The impression was taken in sulphur ; and it
seems that it was only when the fun shone on that fide of
the pillar where the inscription         is,
                                       that any traces of     it
could be distinguished.   By the inscription   appears that

 establishing the new inoculation by the evidence of practice.
    Dr. Pearson then took the opportunity, after thanking the
 company for their honourable testimony, to inform them of
 many particulars concerning the conduct and objects of the
 institution, which could not be noticed in the report, and
 gave a most pleasing view of the advantages which individuals
had already derived from the cow-pock : but he anticipated
the momentous consequences of universal inoculation through
out the united kingdom in two respects.

and, adly, In  a     few years exterminating the small-pox.    To
 accomplish   these  views, he contended that laws for the ino
culation of every subject within       certain period after birth
                                         a
were essentially necessary, as well as immediate prohibition
of the inoculation of the sinall-pox      that the latter measure
                                             ;
alone would be quite inadequate        and he maintained that
                                         ;                             it
was not more an infringement on the liberty of the subject, to
render the cow-pock inoculation universal, than to prohibit,
as already proposed, the small-pox inoculation.      He observed
that the number lost          inoculation for the small-pox was
                              by
not an object of national importance, as        amounted to no

dered, that one could hardly fay there was more danger from
the inoculation of the cow-pock than from          puncture with
                                                          a
a  clean lancet, and that the symptoms were usually very
much flighter than      in the small-pox inoculation,    and that
by universal cow-pock inoculation,         the infection of the
small-pox must be extinguished, which end was obvious                  by
even the universal inoculation of the final -pox     I  remained
                                                              ;   it
only to institute the cow-pock inoculation as proposed, uni
versally.
   Dr. Pearson combated the objections against increasing
the population,   showing that the resources of agriculture
                   by
and animal food were not understood.   That the augmenta
tion of the population in France required, as   measure of    a
safety, attention to the means of increasing this kind of na
tional wealth; — that the mere waste in feeding of animals,
and  in  preparing food for man,      taken care of, would be
                                         if
sufficient to support   considerably greater than the present
                        a
population.

                        Tbt Triple Inscription.
     In the fitting of September 4th 1803, professor Heyne read
  a memoir on the Egyptian monument with three inscriptions,
  of which the following is the substance:
                                                               The

         Egyptian Monument ivitb tbt triple Inscription.              83
     The inscription contains a decree of the assembly of the
priests   of Memphis, by which they confer on king Ptolemy
t   piphanes new divine honours, out of gratitude for the ser
vices rendered by him to religion, to us ministers, to the
people, and to the state in general.          To determine the time
and occasion of this decree, is the first point in question, and
therefore is the first object treated of in the memoir. Ptolemy
Philopator left at his death (Olymp. 140. 1.26 years before the
birth of Christ) a son about five years of age. The most con
temptible persons, who, under the preceding government, had
ministered to the pleasures of Philopator, Agathocles, Aga-
thoclea, aud her mother Œnanthe, seized on the government
and the guardianstiip of the young prince : they were fol
lowed by Tlepolemus, and afterwards by Aristomenes.                   In
the year 200 before Christ the Egyptians intrusted to the
 Romans the tutelage of the young king, to protect the empire
from the projects of king Philip, and of Antiochus of Syria.
This measure produced internal troubles and revolts.             When
Thoas and the Ætolians had been crushed, it was thought
most proper for the public repose to declare the prince, who
was then fourteen years of age, major, and to suffer him to
govern his affairs himself. The ceremony of the coronation,
 which is known under the name of Anacleteria, Olymp. 145.
4. 197 years before the birth of Jesus Christ, and nine years
after the death of Philopator, was celebrated at Memphis.
The ninth year is expressly named in thedecree. All theEgyp-
 tian priests were invited to this ceremony.            It appears that
during     the   last years of  the  king's minority attempts had
 been made to gain over the people and the priests. Govern
 ment had granted to the priests in particular a great number
ot privileges and immunities, and had also been at great ex
 pense for their worship and temples.          Out of gratitude, the
 assembly of priests decreed, that in crowning the king (the
 day even is indicated in the text of the decree, the 4th of the
 Macedonian month Xantichus, the i8ih of the Egyptian
 month Mechir, in the first half of our March, in the second
 half of the Olympic year) they sliould offer their homages to
 the king, according to the manner usual at that time, by giv
 ing him titles, and paying him honours, borrowed from the
 divine worstiip.      The decree contains an account of all the
  services which the king had rendered to the empire and the
  Egyptian priests, and then the new titles of honour decreed
  to  him.
     The titles found in     the decree are: the lord of kings, the
  glorious, the pious towards the god3,         the conqueror of his
  enemies,     the repairer of  the pleasures  of life,   the lord of the
                                G  %                               cycles

cycles    of thirty    years (Kvpiof tbv rpiaxovra rnpiuv). He is styled
also the descendant of the gods, (txyovo; ®sui <bi*.oTraTcptnv)
a title by which is understood his father Ptolemv Philopator,
and perhaps his mother. The titles properly so called, which
are repeated several times with the name, are : the enjoyer
of long life, aiuvoSi ¦;, the favourite of Phtha, the visible god,
tmparns, (and not illustrious, as is usually translated) the be
neficent, Fi/x«,nrof, according to the meaning given to this word
at that period.
    The titles and names of the priests, which are at the head
of the decree of the assembly, are: t<p hptuf Actou, tS Astou,
AteZavdpov xai 0£uv Xuripuv, xai &tav A&Xp*n>, xai ©luv F.vtpyt-

evident that these were priests of Alexander, of Ptolemy
Soter, of Philadelphus Euergetes, of Philopator, of Epipha-
nes, and therefore of the royal family raised to the rank of
deities. The name Aetoj, eagle, gives reason to believe,
that the case was the fame here as with other kinds of priest
hood mentioned in antiquity, that the family name was en
tirely abandoned, and could no longer be named; and that
the rank was indicated by a general name. Here a sym
bolic name, viz. the eagle, seems to have indicated the high
priest'.     A priestess of Berenice, no doubt the spouse of
 Soter, has the second rank ; her name of honour is ax^opofoj.
The third place, under the title of a Cancpbora, is given to the
 priestess of Arsinoe, the wife of Philadelphus.              The fourth is
 occupied by the priestess of Arsinoe, the sister and wife of
 Philopator.       Then comes apx'tptiu npofrnat, xai 01 fi{ to aou-

 Jablonski will give some explanations, as well as the learned
 who make further researches in regard to the explanation of
 the inscription.        In regard to the word irtipoipopai, one of the
 members remembered a passage in Clemens of Alexandria,

    An account of the benefits conferred by the prince on the
 priests affords several notices respecting             the different kinds
 of taxes; but it would require too much room to detail the
 whole of them. They consist partly in pecuniary impositions,

»nd partly in contributions in kind. We shall however men
tion those benefits which are connected with history. Among
the services rendered        by the king, is the             siege and capture        of
Lycopolis.     The    insurgents         of       the    last years      had thrown,
themselves   into this place, and had fortified it ; so that the
siege  was attended with difficulties, especially in the eighth
year (of the government).      The Nile had increased in an
extraordinary degree, and the king was obliged to oppose
dykes to the water, in order that the siege might be continued
with advantage.     Polybins speaks of the siege of Lycopolis *;
but he places it in the 4th year of the 148th Olympiad, 185
       before the birth of Jesus Christ, and therefore 12 years
  ater. Vaillant also places it in this year.
i'ears                                           The inscription
evidently contradicts this opinion; but we need only exa
mine with attention the words of Polybins, who speaks of'
the siege of Lycopolis as an event that took place some years
before.
   The honours decreed to the king consist partly in a confir
mation of the antient honourable titles, and partly in the
addition of a new one, that of protector (or avenger) of
Egypt.       IlToXeftxiou tS £7rattuvovTz;     AiyuirTu, which was to

statue was to be erected in all the temples.            The statue was
to be placed in such     a   manner, that the statue of the deity of
the temple should present to           victorious arms. The priests
                                        it
were to adore the statue three times           day, in the sacred pro

with small images of the gods.             The image of the king was
to be carried about      in   asimilar facellum.
   Some other circumstances, which require further explana
tion, the author has reserved for another opportunity.             Un
fortunately the inscription has suffered in the lower part. It

a trifling dispute with one of his friends, laid a bet that he
would decypher one of the Persepolitan inscriptions.                   He
succeeded beyond his expectation, and in a few weeks was
able to explain the greater part of the inscriptions, and
to communicate details respecting the manner in which he
proceeded, and concerning his results.
    The author first speaks of the cuneiform -writing in general,
and lays down the following principles : ist, The wedge-
formed characters are really letters.            On the monuments of
Persepolis there are three forts of them, which, for the most;
part, correspond with each other, as has been remarked by
Niebuhr and Munter, and which may be called the first,
second, and third kinds of writing.              The whole three may
be clearly observed on the vase of Caylus *, provided two
signs only be corrected from similar inscriptions found in
Niebuhr and Le Bruyn.            2d. The wedge-formed figures are
alphabetic     letters, and not  syllables or signs.      In the first fort
of letters the end of a word is indicated by a wedge placed
obliquely, and in the second, by a perpendicular wedge.                  If
the groupes of figures were syllables, we ought to have here
words of ten syllables, for very often there are so many signs
between tw'o separations of words.            In each of these kinds of
writing there are distinguished about forty figures, a number
which would be too small for writing in signs.               3d. All the
wedge-formed inscriptions proceed from left to right, in a
horizontal direction, and not vertically or in bullrophedon
characters, as may be seen by comparing the inscriptions B,
D, C, in Niebuhr. It is thence seen that this principle, ex-*
 pressed perhaps too generally, can be applied only to the in
scriptions of Persepolis.
     In the second section, which relates to inscriptions of the
 first fort in particular, the author observes, that this writing
 has need of marks proper for the long and short vowels, as in
 the antient Persian writing called the Zendic : hence the
 quantity of forty letters w hich Niebuhr has already collected.
 In a word, all the inscriptions which the author has been
 hitherto able to explain, relate to Darius the son of Hystaspes,
 and to Xerxes; a circumstance to which new researches have
 already given a high degree of probability.
     In the third section the author describes the manner in
 which he proceeded, and gives his explanations.              The suppo
 sitions already mentioned,       as  well  as   the  analogy of the in
 scription   of  the Sassanides, gave    reason    to expect in particular
 the name of king, and titles particularly for Darius and

 Xerxes.      The words on which accents are found ought to be
 titles. By different combinations the author obtained the
 words Kbschercbe and Darbeuscb ; by help of the words
 found, read the other words of the inscription on the urn of
 Caylus, and those of B and G of Niebuhr, which he explains
 according to the Zendic.          The dictionaries and grammatical
 remarks of Anquetil were of great service to him in this
 labour.
     The author has given, as the results of his researches, an ex
 planation of the inscriptions on the urn already mentioned,
 and those of Niebuhr, pi. 24, B, G.           He read thus the B of
 Niebuhr : Darbeuscb Klscb, hiib egbre. Kbscbehioh Kbscbe-
 biobetcbuo.      Kbfchibiob.     Dabutcbao.      Goscblajpbœbe,      bun

 rius rex fortis, rex region, rex dabarum           sjiliusj   Hjsiaspys.
Jiirps mundi reSoris, in conjlellatione mafculd tm Moro, - tou
 Ized.      Moro is one of the twenty-eight constellations ; the
 author refers the word governor of the world to Giemshid,
 from whom the Persian kings, the Achemenides, derived their
 origin.
     He    read   thus the    inscription   marked    G of Niebuhr:
  Kbschercbe    Kbscbihiib egbre. Kbscbihiob. Khschshiobetcbdo.
 Darbeuscb Kbfcbebiobebe.          bun. akbeotebosebib, that is to fay,
 Xerxes rex fortis, rexregum (filius) Darii, regis Jiirps omnium
 retloris.    It is in this manner that the author explains the in
 scription found in Le Bruyn, p. 273, No. 133, on the mantle
 of   the  king :  he even proposes corrections.         He thinks also
 that he can    restore and correct the inscription on the window,
  (see in the   same place No. 134.)         What has been here said
 may enable      the reader to form some opinion of his labour.
     However      unexpected     this discovery may be, it seems to
  deserve some attention : we have reason indeed to be on our
 guard against discoveries of this kind, because one may be
  easily deceived by possible combinations, and by certain sup
  positions which       may originate in chance ; especially when
  the   language    affords no certain means of judging of their
  correctness, and when, on the other hand, the language itself
  must in some measure be discovered.               As the author has
  not made known his alphabet, and as he has not mentioned
  whether it be complete for all the inscriptions of the first fort
  of writing, and how far he has made researches in regard to
  the other kinds ; no opinion can yet be formed of the cer
  tainty and extent of the discovery. It appears that the author
  hitherto has employed himself chiefly with the inscriptions of
  Persepolis, and we must confine to these inscriptions some
  principles too generally expressed ; namely, that each sort oi
                                    G 4                            writing

88              On the Persepolitan    Inscriptions.
writing exhibits forty    signs, that all the wedge-formed writ
ing has a horizontal direction, and that they are all alpha
betic. There is something also to be rectified in the expla
nation : rev dabarutn, for example, as a title of Darius, is
not very probable : in regard to retlor murnli, it might be re
ferred perhaps with more reason to Ormuzd.            But what may
give us a prepossession in savour of the author's hypothesis       is,
that it   isfounded on what the researches and observations
hitherto made, give as the mostprobab'e result.           From these
indeed we can admit that the buildings of Persepolis belong
to the time of the successors of Cyrus.           We may even go
further, and conclude that the greater part of the monuments
 were finished under Darius and the following kings       ;   because
the short duration of the reign of Cambvses would not
 have been sufficient for the execution of such works.
    As the inscriptions arc as old as the monuments, they must
be referred to the time of these princes. In      a  word, it
                                                           is    seen
 that the wedge-formed writing on those monuments, and in
 general where  it has a  horizontal direction, proceeds from left
to right. This circumstance, which was observed by Niebuhr,
is  incontestably proved    by   similar inscription on stone found
                                 a
in the French national museum at Paris, and which C. Millin
has given in the first number of Monument Antiques, plates          8
 and q.    The artist  in   this inscription has placed insulated
 wedges,   or groupes,  or  whole letters, for which there was no
 room, above the lines, or in the second column, and alwavs to
 the right, where the end of the line ousht consequently to
 be.    The author's explanation agrees with these observations.
 He reads from left to right, and find?     in the inscriptions allu
 sions to Darius, Xerxes, and certain points respecting            the
 worship of the magi.        The legends which the author has
 found are consistent and probable, when considered histori
 cally.   They have allo the greatest analogy with the inscrip
 tions of the Sastanides,   a  dynasty descended from the antient
 Persian kings, and who endeavoured to re-establisti the empire
 and its religion.    As these princes on antient coins and mo
 numents are styled kings of the kings of Izan, of divine ori
 gin, &c. similar titles, but more simple, are found in these
 inscriptions. Time alone can show whether the continuation
 of the author's researches will justify these explanations.
    If the learned should succeed deevphering the wedge-
                                       in
 formed writing, their discoveries would throw great light on
 many points of the Asiatic antiquities, because more monu
 ments of this writing are daily discovered.          They may be
 divided into three classes.        ist, The Babylonian, among

of Dr. Lichtenstein do not assign to them another period.
This writing has a peculiar character, which may be distin
guished by the name of the nail-writing*. 2d, The Persian :
the monuments of Persepolis, some gems and vases, the stone
of which C. Millin speaks, and several others. The writing
of the latter has more resemblance to the point of a dart. It
might be called dart-writing.            3d, The Egypto-Perfian : to
this kind, in all probability, belong the cylindric amulets of
hæmatites with wedge-formed letters and figures ; and, in
particular, a fragment of a stone found near Suez, which ex
hibits wedge-formed letters ; and a Persian head, having on
it   a hawk's wing.      An engraving of it may be seen in De-
non, from a drawing by general Dugua.                     This variety of
monuments, which is daily becoming more numerous, proves
how" widely diffused the use of such letters was at a certain
 period.
          XVI.    Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
                             ANTIGUITIES.
 OOME curious and valuable remains of antiquity were lately
discovered in Istria, Dalmatia, and Albania, and have been
sent to Vienna by M. de Carnea Stephaneo, his imperial
majesty's commissary        in  these provinces.      The articles found
iire:
     1st, A torso of Parian marble, found among the ruins of
Salona, in Dalmatia, a league north-east from Spalatro. It is
seven feet and a half in height, and represents a naked warrior
seated on the trunk of a tree, on which is placed his wardress.
This statue is in the most sublime Grecian style. The expression
and beauty of the form ssiow that it is the work of one of the
 first masters of antiquity.       The belt exhibits a peculiarity not
generally met with in statues of this kind.             It is much to be
regretted that it is mutilated nearly in the fame manner as
 the torso of the Vatican at Rome.
     2d, A Minerva, of Corinthian brass, found in Dalmatia,
near Xa-Ostrogs, three leagues and a half from the mouth
of the Narenta.        It is eight feet in height, and perfectly
 entire. This Minerva is in the Greek costume, with a hel
met, an ægis, and a Medusa's head on the breast : stie holds
a lance in the left hand, which is somewhat elevated, and a
 pup in the right.      The hair is arranged in the fame manner

ot Dalmatia, and among those os Kamtschatka and on the
 banks of the Anadir.
    3d, A Madona with infant Jesus asleep, painted by Aloys
Vivarinus, of Murano, on a platter ground.         This painting,
which was finished in 1489, is five feet two inches in height
and one foot eleven inches in breadth. It was executed at
the time when the art of painting in oil was first carried from
Flanders to Italy.     It proves that Vivarinus, by his delicate
and expressive pencil, had already carried to a high degree of
excellence the art of painting, which was not brought to a
state of perfection till the time of Charles V.
   4th, A naval battle painted in oil, eleven feet in height
and twenty-one in breadth.        It is a master-piece of Tinto
retto. He composed it at the request of the senate of Venice,
who presented it to the city of Pisano. It represents the battle
said to have taken place in 1 177 between the Germans and
the Venetian fleet near Cape de Salvora,in Istria, and which
was first mentioned by Andrew Dandolo, in his Chronicle,
two centuries after.
   5th, A bust, painted on marble, of Sanctorius, a cele
brated professor of Padua, who died in 1639, and who formed
an epoch in the philosophical history of medicine.
                          EARTHQUAKE.
    Some observations have lately been published in the Ger
man journals in regard to the curious circumstances which
accompanied the earthquake that took place in the province
of the Seven Mountains towards the end of October.         It was
in the low meadows lying towards the north that the phæno-
mena were most sensible, where deep fissures two or three feet
in breadth and thirty- five fathoms in length, which divided
into several branches, were formed in a direction from welt to
east.    A great deal of very fine sand of an ash-gray colour,
which emitted a sulphureous odour, was thrown up from these
fissures.    The principal fissure, after extending throughout a
long space, separated into several branches, which bent them
selves into semicircles towards the west, and traversed a house
and a stable, aster piercing the walls at the foundation.     The
whole country was covered with one or more inches of sand
in the direction of the fissures: and persons who were wit
nesses to these phenomena alien, that at the time of the last
shock the earth opened with a noise like that of a musket
mot; that a black and strong smelling vapour issued from the
fissires, as well as a great deal of water, which spouted up with
a loud noise ; and thai these jets were followed by a great
                                                         quantity

quantity of sulphureous sand.           The ground also sunk down
in a sensible fnanner. The water which issued from the fis
sures was exceedingly sulphureous, cold, and limpid.
   Chemists observed, that a pound of this sand diluted in
eight pints of water produced no effervescence, and even gave
no precipitate on being mixed with vitriolic acid. The ni
trous acid gave the fame result.          It was only after its decom
position,   and  after   gall-nuts   were  able to produce no change
m the colour, that the water became turbid, in such a
manner as to show the presence of the vitriolic acid.                   By
decoction and evaporation signs of crystallization were ob
served at the surface; and, when the evaporation was com
plete, there remained about eight grains of alkaline matters,
two parts of which were Glauber's salt, one earthy salt, and
the other gypsum.

    Mechain saw the planet very well terminated without any
 aureola, though he always followed its progress on th6 fun
 with a telescope of three object glasses 4^- inches in diameter
 and 7 feet focus, with which he took 45 distances.               He had
 observed in the same manner the transits in the years 1782,
 1786, 1789, and 1799.
                               CHEMISTRY.
    1. Brugnatelli     has lately observed,      that by treating paper
 with the nitric acid, a large       quantity of    suberic acid mixed
 with oxalic acid is obtained. This         seems to prove     thatFour-
 croy was right in classing cork among the immediate prin
 ciples of the vegetable kingdom.
    2. The fame chemist in a letter fays, that after a particular
 examination of wheat, he thinks he has found that vegeta
 ble gluten is nothing else than animal fibrous matter.                   It
 differs indeed from animal gluten or glue, by its insolubility
 in cold water, and by the contraction it experiences in warm
 water.     When treated with the nitric acid it swells, pro
                                                                     duces

duces a foamy effervescence, gives out nitrous gas, and dis
solves.      This solution is decomposed by water, like that of
animal fibrous matter, and the white precipitate thence re
sulting dissolves in ammonia, assuming a dark yellow co
lour.
   3. A discovery of two new principles in sulphureous wa
ters has lately been made by Counsellor Westrumb, of
Hammeln, who gives the following details :
   " For six years I have been exclusively employed in the
analysis of sulphureous waters. I have found an easy and en
tirely new method of determining what they contain of
sulphurated hvdrogen and carbonic acid gas ; and 1 have
discovered a principle hitherto unknown                in these waters,
namelv, bitumen in combination with sulphurated hydro
gen gas and hydro-sulphurated lime., I communicated the
detail of this discovery to M. Wurzer. Counsellor Von Crell
and Professor Schaub of Cassel saw at my house these new
products.        These principles are found in the waters of
Neuwdorf,        Limmcn, Rehburg, and Eylse.                  In the last
place,    five sulphureous   springs, altogether    different   from each
other, a spring of carbonic gaseous water, and one of fresh
water, are found in an extent of less than a thousand square
sect.    Near Buckembourg, the capital of the small country
of Leppe, to which Eylse belongs, are found two other sul
phureous springs perfectly similar, one of which we sounded
to the depth of eighty feet without finding its reservoir.
Baths of mud similar to those of St. Amand have been con
structed at Eylse : a very considerable quantity of hydro-sul
phurated mud, which may furnish baths for several cen
turies, has been found there."
   4. A new gas, sulphurated azotic gas, has been discovered
in the mineral waters of Aix-la-Cliapelle by M. C. Gim-
bernat, sub director of the museum of natural history at
Madrid, who gives the following account of it :
    " I have just finished my labour on the analysis of the
sulphureous waters us Aix-la-Chapelle.              I have found that
the excipient     of  the sulphur  in  these waters     is not hydrogen,
as has hitherto     been  supposed  and   asserted,  but   azote.   These
waters contain      no sulphurated hvdrogen.
    " Sulphurated azotic sras is a chemical body, the ex
istence of which has never been suspected.                   Nature pre
sents  it   in abundance   in the mineral   waters   of   this country.
    " Besides sulphurated azote, these waters contain a great
deal of pure and free azote interposed,              and in the semi-
caseous      Hate."
h
                                                                   5- We

                        jfnimal Galvanism.                     93
    5. We are informed by Mr. Paul of Geneva (now in Lon
don) that water holding sulphate of lime in solution, and
impregnated under pressure with hydrogen gas, of which it
can talce up about one-fourth of its volume, after standing
stopped up for about three months, on being opened was
found to contain sulphurized hydrogen gas.         This has been
repeated several times with the fame result.          In distilled
water not impregnated       with sulphate  of lime, the hydrogen
ga3 undergoes      no change.
    How    is the sulphurized hydrogen ga* produced ? There is
plainly   a  decomposition effected, not merely of the sulphate
 of lime, but of the sulphuric acid, which parts with a portion
 of its sulphur. — What becomes of the oxygen ? Does it
join the hydrogen, and form water ?
    The hydrogen gas made use of in the above experiments
 was procured from the decomposition of water, by applying
 it to iron exposed to a high temperature.      When obtained by
 means of sulphuric acid, water, and iron, in the humid way,
 it has a different flavour, somewhat hepatic.
    6. Mr. Paul has mentioned to us another circumstance,
 which deserves to be made known.         Water impregnated with
 hydrogen gas is extremely injurious in dropsical complaints.
 A gentleman      labouring under the dropsy was cured by drink
 ing water impregnated with oxygen gas ; but during the
 cure his servant Dy mistake had purchased some hydrogen
 water.     In less than 24 hours his malady returned : on find
 ing out the cause, and having recourse to the oxygenated
 water, the mischief was speedily remedied.
                        ANIMAL GALVANISM.
     Some curious Galvanic experiments were made on Febru
 ary 18, by professor Aldini, in Dr. Pearson's lecture-rooms.
 They were by far more interesting and satisfactory than any
 we have yet noticed on animals, owing to the pains taken to
 procure the fittest subjects for the operations. They were
 instituted in the presence of his excellency the ambassador of
 France general Andreoffi, lord Pelham, lord Roxburgh, lord
 Castlereagh, lord Hervey, the honourable Mr. Upton, Mr.
 Cholmondely, Mr. Anchora, Mr. Elliot, and several other
 gentlemen of rank. The professor was assisted ably, as on
 former occasions, by Mr. Carpue, Mr. Cuthbertson, and Mr.
 Hutchins.
     Among other important facts, it was decisively shown,
     I. That a vital attraction subsists between a nerve and
 muscle : for the suspended sciatic nerves of a frog, after de
                                                          taching

taching the spine, being brought near the intercostal muscles
of a dog, while the assistant who held the frog did, with his
other hand, touch the muscles of the thigh of the dog, (thus
forming a circle) ; in this situation, the nerves suspended ap
proached, and came into contact with the muscle, as evidently
as a silken thread is attracted by sealing-wax.
    3. The heart of a rabbit was excited to action in a little
time after the animal was killed ; but vitality disappeared
much sooner than in the other muscles : so that this organ is
the primum, and not, as Harvey asserted, the ultimum tnoriens.
The lungs, liver, and spleen could not be excited to action,
even immediately after the animal was killed.
    3. The most important fact of all was that of exciting
contractions by making a circle of nerves and muscles of dif
ferent animals, without any metallic exciter or conductors.
     4. The head of an ox, recently decapitated, exhibited
astonishing effects : for, the tongue being drawn out by a
hook fixed into     it,on applying the exciters, in spite of the
strength  of the  assistant the tongue was retracted,   so
                                                         as to de
tach itself,  by tearing itself, from the hook :at the same   time
a  loud noise issued from the mouth by the absorption of air,
attended     by
              violent contortions of the whole head and eyes.
    After the exhibition of these phænomena of Galvanism,
which, among other philosophers, particularly occupy the
 attention of the First Consul, the company partook of an ele
gant dejeune and       conversazione in Dr. Pearson's house.

     XVII.   Description    of   Mr. Pepys's   large    Galvanic
                              Apparatus.
Mi   [R. PEPYS jun. has lately constructed the most powerful
Galvanic apparatus that has, we believe, been yet produced,
of which we shall endeavour to give our readers some idea.
It consists of 60 pairs of zinc and copper plates disposed in
two troughs constructed on Mr. Cruickihank's plan, but
with some accompanying arrangements which are extremely
convenient and useful. That our description may be the bet
ter understood, we refer to   view of the apparatus, Plate
                                 a                             I.
   A A. The two troughs, each consisting of 30 pairs of plates.
The plates are cemented into troughs made of mahogany,
properly varnished to stand the action of the fluids which
may be introduced into the cells between the plates.       The
plates are each    inches square, or contain
                    6                           square inches
                                                   36
of surface on each side; and that they may be able to conti
             6                                                 u-ie

               Mr. Pepjs's Galvanic Apparatus.                 05
nue in use for a considerable     time even with the application
of llrong acidulous liquors, they    are made of such a thickness
that each pair weighs four pounds. The troughs are furnished
with pivots at each end, by which they rest on the bar B of
the table into which the whole apparatus is framed : on
these pivots, which are so placed as to throw the centre of
gravity of the troughs below them, the troughs revolve when
it is necessary to empty the cells.
     C. A japanned iron tray or receiver, capabse of hold
ing the contents of the cells of the troughs when they are
 emptied.
     D. A range of six funnels made of tin, the distances of
 the tubes of which are so adjusted that they enter six of the
 cells of the troughs at once.
     E. A tin veflel having six distinct cells with spouts, each
 capable of containing the exact quantity of fluid necessary to
 fill a cell of the trough.
      By means of the funnel D and vessel E, the troughs
 are filled with very little trouble, no more being necessary
 than to fill the vessel E by dipping it into the fluid or acid,
  and then emptying    it,   by the spouts corresponding with the
  divisions in the funnel D, into the latter, the pipes of which
  are placed in the corresponding cells of the troughs.
      FF the two prime conductors, being two brass rods with
  shoulders.     They pass through holes in the top of the table
   (which, to show the arrangement of the troughs, appears
  elevated in the engraving) into the end cell of each trough.
   G     G two metallic conductors, each consisting of two parts
  joined by    sockets, and each having a    socket which sits upon
   the prime conductors FF.          Bv this contrivance they are
   movable in any direction required in the experiments.
       H II two shallow vessels made of tin, with tubes under
   neath, by   means of which they can be placed on the tops of
   the conductors. When filled with water they are found con
   venient for giving the Galvanic (hock in   a    very perfect man
   ner, and for other experiments.
    I,    an arch of metal to unite the troughs at their further
   ends.
       When the cells are filled, the troughs connected      by   the
    metallic arch, the top or lid (hut down, and the prime con
    ductors put in their places, the apparatus forms    a    Galvanic
    table free from any incumbrance, and extremely well adapted
    for every experiment in Galvanism.
       On the alst of February, with a.number of scientific gen
    tlemen, we witnessed a    trial of this apparatus.   The experi

ments made by Mr. Pepys on the deflagration of metals were
the most brilliant and splendid we ever beheld.
  The troughs were filled with 33 pounds of water mixed
with two pounds of concentrated nitrous acid. With this
charge-
   Iron wires of ?iv to rv of an inch in diameter were defla
grated with great splendour.    A number of the small ones
twisted together produced somewhat like a little brulh : a
pleasing appearance in deflagration.
   Charcoal of box wood was not only deflagrated at the
place of contact, but remained permanently red hot for near
two inches in length.
  Lead foil burnt with great vividness, becoming red hot,
and emitting a small volcano or adjutage of red sparks along
with the flame.
  Tin foil burnt with great splendour, with smoke and
sparks.

 XVIIL       An Essay on the Method of determining the Difference
     of Longitude between Places at Land, from the observed
     Transits of the Moon over their Meridians; with a De-

 ./ALTHOUGH              the method of determining the difference
of longitude      at sea from the lunar observations has been ac
 curately laid down by Dr. Maskelyne and other able nautical
 astronomers,      it has, however, happened that several writers
on longitude and astronomy have, in the course of the last
twenty years, given rules for finding the difference of longi
tude at land from the moon's transits, either so erroneous or
imperfect, that the adoption thereof might do a serious injury*
both to navigation and geography : they have given exam
ples, but no demonstrations ; or at least such obscure and im
perfect ones, as prove that they had not a clear conception
of the matter.
     It is for these reasons that the following demonstration           of
a rule both easy and accurate for finding the difference                of
longitude, is now proposed.           The data are the observed in
 crease of the moon's right ascension in passing from the first
to the second meridian, and the increase of the sun's and
 moon's right ascension in twelve hours apparent time, which,
 may be had from the Nautical Almanac.
                           DEMONSTRATION.
     Let  the circle   ABC     represent the equator, P its pole, and
 A PD      the first meridian, as that of Greenwich. Suppose that
 the centres of the fun, the moon, and a fixed star are on that
meridian at the fame moment of time as represented at A,
 and that they move from thence to the westward with their
 respective velocities, the earth being considered as at rest.
Then, after twelve hours apparent time, the fun will be at D,
 the opposite point to A, or i8o° distant from it ; but the fixed
 star, moving in appearance over a greater space than 1800 in
 twelve hours apparent time, will be at E; while the moon,
 with a motion apparently flower than the fun and the star,
 will appear after twelve hours at the point B, or on a meri
 dian B P. But E D is the distance of the fun from the star

98                         longitude    determined
after an interval of twelve hours apparent time, and EB the
distance of the moon, or, in other words, the increase of theit
respective right ascensions : and since ED and EB are known
from the Nautical Almanac, if we subtract the first from the
last, we have D B, equal to the difference between the in
crease  of the sun's and moon's right ascension in twelve
hours apparent time. Now the difference of longitude be
tween the two meridians A P and B P is the arc A gB, equal
to A£D less the arc D B ; that               is,
                                       equal to 1800 less the dif
ference between the increase of the sun's and moon's right
ascension in twelve hours         and, since the increase of the

moon's right ascension in twelve hours apparent time            to                   is
1800 or 12" less the difference between the increase of the
sun's and moon's right ascension in that time            so   any       :   :,   is

                     :                                 Q. E. D.*
    If the increase of the moon's right ascension in twelve hours
were uniform, or such that equal parts of           would be pro
                                                               it
duced in equal times, the above rule would be strictly accu
rate; but as that increase arises from        motion continually
                                                      a
accelerated or retarded, and seldom uniform but for           short              a
space   of  time,    will
                      it  therefore be necessary to find  the mean
increase of the moon's right ascension when           at the inter
                                                               it   is
mediate point between A and          in order to determine their
                                            0,
difference of longitude with the greatest precision         and for          ;
that purpose, Taylor's Tables of Second Difference are very
useful.
                                   EXAMPLE.
  April the 8th, 1800, the transit of the moon's first limb
was observed at the royal observatory (A)       and, allowance ;
being made   for the  error of the clock, its   right ascension
was        -                                  I21' 35m i8*22'

     On a meridian (3 *) far to the westward
the transit of the moon's first limb was ob
served the same day, and being reduced to
the centre, its right ascension was               -      la    47     567
    Increase    of right     ascension   between      A
and 3                       -         -          -         011        30-1
    The   increase of the moon's right ascension
in twelve hours apparent time per the Nauti

    And ia hours minus this difference is = nh 35m ^6'6^s;
therefore,     As a6m 3* : n'1 35m 46-65* : : ura 30- 13 to jh 7™
13s, the correct difference of longitude between A and |3.
    By reducing the three terms to seconds, and using loga
rithms, the operation is much shortened.
     In a book published by Mr. Mackay on longitude about
fifteen or sixteen years ago, there is a rule given, and also an
example, for finding the difference of longitude at land from,
the transits of the moon, but no demonstration.                  The rule,
when divested of its high-sounding enunciation, runs thus:
    As the increase of the moon s right ascension in twelve
hours apparent time : is to 1800 : :, so is anv other observed
increase between two meridians : to their difference of longi
tude.      It follows from this, that the moon as weH as the
fun would, in twelve hours apparent time, pass over an arc
of i8oD, although the apparent motion of the moon to the
w.estward in twelve hours, or i8o'J of space, be less than that
of the fun by six or seven degrees ; and so much error would
this method produce, if the two places differed about 180*
in longitude.
    The above example, wrought according to Mackay's rule,
would come out thus :
    As a6m3s : iah :: nm 30'is to                 -      5h I7m 53"7*
    But the correct difference as above is - 5                 71a       1 ¦
                                                                     1

which amounts to more than 3j°, or 150 miles, in                    a differ
ence of longitude little exceeding five hours.

100                      Longitude determined
    Mr. Edward Pigott        adopts  the very    fame   rule for deter
mining the difference of longitude between Greenwich and
York, and states the result in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1786,      p. 417.
    Mr. Vince      has inserted this rule and example in his Trea
tise of Practical Astronomy ; but we have to regret that they
were not accompanied with a strict demonstration.
    The Rev. Mr. Wollaston, in the appendix to his Fasciculus
Astronomicus, published two or three years ago, has given
a rule, without demonstration or example, for finding the
difference of longitude from the moon's transits, which pro
duces the fame error as Mackay's and Pigott's, although
worded differently from theirs. Mr. Wollaston makes the
first term of his proportion apparent, and the third mean
 time; this renders the result erroneous.             Since the motion
of the fun, moon, and planets are computed for apparent
time, and given so in the Nautical Almanac, mean time is
not at all requisite for resolving the difference of longitude
either at sea or at land. We shall therefore endeavour ta
apply Mr. Wollaston's rule, according to its literal meaning,
 for finding the difference of longitude from the above ob
servations.
    The right ascension of the moon's centre on the meridian
of Greenwich being known, we can easily deduce the mean
and apparent time corresponding to it; and in like manner
the mean and apparent time at the distant meridian 0*. The
apparent and mean time of the transits of the moon's centre
over the meridians of       A  and 0, when strictly computed, were
as follows     :                   Apparent  Time.         Mean Time.

   If    should be thought easier to employ sidereal time in
          it

Aj3B, equal to the difference of longitude. By proportion
we can therefore fay, As EB, the increase of the moon's right

                         of the thirty-six stars, whose right as

   In order to put the above method to the test of experiment,
a  number of transits of the moon's first limb were observed
many years ago at    a place 26 seconds of time west from the
royal observatory, with    a small portable transit instrument
made    bythat eminent artist Mr. Edward Troughton, of Fleet-
street.  It had  a telescope 20 inches long,      treble object-
                                                  a
glass, and the price only 20 guineas. When the observations
at Greenwich were published, all those that were made on
the same days at both places were employed to determine the
difference of longitude, and the mean result of four or five
corresponding observations gave     true to two seconds of time.

   We expect soon to have the lunar tables brought to a
greater degree of perfection, by applying certain equations
that have been lately discovered, and by which those pur
poses will, of course, be more successfully promoted.     It is
also much to be wished that the moon's transits were as afli-.
duoufly observed by public and private astronomers in every
country as they are at the royal observatory in this, and from
time to time communicated to the public at large.
   It sometimes, but not very frequently, happens, that fa
vourable weather will permit one astronomer to observe four
transits of the moon over his meridian in the fame number
of succeeding days. If another, or indeed a hundred others,
should observe only one or two on any of those days, whether
at the nearest or remotest stations from the first meridian ;
such observations        are of great value, and afford the very best
means      of finding     the difference of longitude with accuracy,
because the errors           of   the lunar tables are thereby   completely
obviated.

     comment   Blue-Bell,          as a Substitute for Gum-Arabic.            By
     Mr. Thomas              Willis,     of Lime-Street, London*.
J.N  the year 1794, whilst collecting plants in a wood for
botanical specimens,   I observed that the root of the hyacin
thus non scriptus, the plant commonly called blue-bells, or
hare-bells, was extremely mucilaginous ; and, on tasting                       it,
I discovered only   very flight pungency.
                         a                   collected

of the bulbs, and, after slicing and drying them before    sire,         a
thev yielded about four ounces of powder.         thoughtI
                                                         _that,
    keeping the powder some time, the little acridness might
 o by
     off, as  does in the arum-root powder.

fix months after, and found             perfectly insipid.
                                        it                       Iconcluded
it  might be rendered useful for food or nourishment, but at
that time pursued the matter no further.
    In the spring of 1800, gum-arabic having been                        long
                                                                         a
time very dear, and likely to continue so,                   Ithought this
mucilaginous root might answer some of its purposes for ex
ternal use.     Itherefore procured seven pounds and                 half of
                                                                     a

the bulbs, which, when sliced and dried, produced two pounds
of powder.       Being soon afterwards in company with Mr.
Charles Taylor, secretary to the Society of Arts, &c. I men
tioned to him that I had discovered a root which grew in
great plenty in this kingdom, yielded a very strong mucilage,
and which I imagined would answer the purposes of gum-
arabic in some of the manufactories.        He said, if I pleased,
he would send some of it down to Manchester, to be tried by
the calico-printers.
    Three or four ounces of the powder were given him, and
sent down there : he was informed, upon trial, that it an
swered the purposes of fixing the calico-printers* colours
equally as well as gum-arabic; and in the fame proportion,
or an ounce and a half of the powder to four ounces of the
mordant.      Mr. Taylor received the samples of the printed
cottons on which it had been used.
    On the 15th of January 1801 I furnished Mr. Taylor with
eight ounces more of the powder; but have not since heard
the result.
    As this root can be easily procured, and used at a less price
than gum-arabic has been sold for several years past, I think
it may be rendered of great utility ; and the Society of Arts,
&c, by patronizing      it, may be the means of making              it   a
public   benefit.
    Care should be taken, and advice given, that the woods
should not be left destitute of the roots    and
                                             ;      would be ad-
                                                      it
viseable to offer premiums for cultivating the roots and off
sets, as they are very increasing.    By such means       constant
                                                           a
supply may be had,   if  the roots answer the intended purposes.
 I    do not presume to offer any thing respecting the mode in
which the society may think proper to divulge the discovery,
and promote the use of these roots       ; but   imagine, that
                                                  I                  if
the roots are bruised and used fresh, they would answer the
 purpose better than when dried and powdered; and as                it   is
 now  a  proper time of the year for taking them up, and will
 continue to be so for two months,      I wish that the discovery
may be made known as- soon as possible.
 I    have sent you specimens both of the dried roots and pow
 der, that they may be seen at the society's rooms         by

     applicable.
 A     HAT    the foetid smell of fisli-oil is chiefly owing to pu

the extracting       from the blubber of the larger fish, and

smell, but remains sometimes very prevalent after that                                is
taken away.
    In order to the perfect edulcoration of oils there are con
sequently two kinds of fœtor or stink to be removed; viz. the
putrid, and the empyreumatic          and the fame means do not
                                           :
always equally    avail  against both.
    The putrid smell of fish-oil         of two kinds the rancid,
                                                is               !

    Fish-oil has not only rancidity, or the first kind of putrid
smells peculiar to oils, but also the second or general kinds                         ;
as the oil, for the most part,      commixed with the gelatinous

humour common to all animals, and some kinds with               pro           a
portion of the bile likewise; and those humours putrefying
combine their putrid scent with the rancidity of the oil, and,
in cases where great heat has been used, with that and the
empyreuma also.

                                both from the original saponaceous

    This holds good particularly of the cod-oil, or common
train, brought from Newfoundland, which, from its high
yellow colour, viscid consistence, and repugnance to burning
well in lamps, manifests sensibly the presence of bile and the
gelatinous fluid      which latter,

    A tendency to putrefy, or at most but an extremely flow          in
manner,       not an absolute property of perfect oils in simple
                  is                                                                    a

                                      it   is    a
their accidental     contact    or   commixture with the aqueous
fluid.    This    evident
                        is  from    the  cafe of oils concreted into                          a
sebaceous   form     which   ;being perfectly oleaginous and un-
combined     with  any  water,    except such as enters into their
component parts,      will not   putrefy unless water, or something
containing          brought
                       it,   isin  contact with them. But the fluid
animal and most vegetable oils being compounded of perfect
oils with other mixed substances, either sub-oleaginous or ge
latinous, have always           putrescence per se, or tendency to
                                           a
putrefy,   without  further   admixture     of aqueous moisture. This

manufacture, as the heat through which this is in some cases
employed causes this matter to contract a most disagreeable
empyreuma.        It also prevents its burning in lamps, as well
from its viscidity as from the repugnance which the presence
of water gives to all oleaginous matter. It is therefore ne
cessary to free the oil from this heterogeneous matter ; after
which it can be subject only to the rancid putrescence, or
that which is proper to oils as such.
    The substances which have been or may be applied to the
removing or preventing the effects of putrescence, are, acids,
alkalies, metallic calces, neutral salts, ethereal and essential
oils, vinous spirits, water, and air. With respect to acids,
though they may be applied with effect to the removal or
prevention of putrefaction in mixed animal and vegetable sub
 stances, yet they have not the samfe efficacy when employed
in the case of oils ; for in a small proportion, without the sub
 sequent aid of alkalies, they rather increase than diminish the
fœtor, and in a large proportion they coagulate the oils, and
change their other properties as well as their consistence.
 Though they might therefore be employed with the assist
 ance of alkalies, yet, requiring a more expensive and complex
 process, and not being moreover necessary, as the fame end
 may be obtained by the use of alkalies only, they may be
 deemed improper for the purification of animal oils for com
 mercial purposes. Alkaline substances, both salts and earths,
 are the most powerful instruments in the edulcoration of oils;
 but as their action on putrid oils, and the method of apply
 ing them to this end, are not the fame in both, it is proper
 to consider them distinctly.
     Of alkaline salts it is the fixed kind only which are proper
 to be used for the edulcoration of oils.     Fixed alkaline salts,
 in a dissolved state, being commixed with putrefying animal
 substances, appear to combine with the putrid matter, and,
  mixing with some of the principles, form instantly volatile
  alkaline salts. On the less putrid they seem to act, after their
  combination, by an acceleration of the putrescent action, till
  they attain the degree which produces volatile salts.       This
  is evident by the sensible putrid ferment and smell which
  appear after their commixture ; but which gradually abating,
  the oil is rendered sweeter, much lighter coloured, and
  thinner.
     Their great use in the edulcoration of fish-oil arises there
  fore from their converting such parts of the gelatinous fluid
  and bile as are highly putrefied instantly into volatile salts,
  and causing a rapid putrefaction of the other parts ; by which
   means the oil is freed from them by their dissipation.    They
                                                                 do

 do not, however, equally act on the parts of the oil on which
 the empyreumatic scent depends, unless by the assistance of
 heat; for when they are commixed with the oils without
 heat, in proportion as the putrid smell diminishes, that be
comes more sensibly prevalent.       The ultimate action of lixi
viate salts on animal oils, except with respect to the empy-
reuma, seems to be the fame either with or without the me
dium of heat; for the fame itrinous and putrid smell, gra
dual diminution of the colour, and foetid scent, happens in
one cafe as in the other, except with regard to the accelera
tion of the changes ; and such salts, where the purification
is required to be made in a great degree, are a necessary
means, as they are more effectual than any other substance
that can be employed.
    The use of lixiviate salts alone is not, however, the most
expedient method that can be pursued for the edulcoration of
oils, for several reasons.   If they be used alone, cold, in the
requisite proportions, they coagulate a considerable part of the
oil, which will not again separate from them under a very
great length of time; and when they have destroyed the pu
trid scent, a strong bitter empyreumatic smell remains. The
fame inconvenience, with relation to the coagulation of part
of the oil, results when they are used alone with heat. The
super-addition of common salt (which resolves the coagulum
and counteracts the saponaceous power of the lixiviate salt,
by which the oil and water are made to combine) is there
fore necessary ; and the expense arising from the larger pro
portion of lixiviate salt requires it to be employed if no other
alkali be taken in aid, and renders the junction of alkaline
earths with it extremely proper in the edulcoration of oils for
commercial uses. Lime has also an edulcorative power on
animai oils; but it has also so strong a coagulative action,
that the addition of a large proportion of alkaline salts be
comes, when it is used, necessary to reduce the concreted oil
to a fluid state ; and therefore this substance alone is not
proper for that purpose. The combination of lixiviate salt
with lime, or the solution commonly called soap- lye, has an
effectual edulcorative action on foetid oils ; but it makes a
troublesome coagulation of part of the oil if no common salt
be employed, and must be used in such large proportion, if
no alkaline earth be added, as renders the method too ex
pensive.
    Lime has a power of combining with and absorbing the
putrid parts of the gelatinous fluid and bile when commixed
with oil, and effects, either with or without heat, a consi
derable edulcoration of foetid oils; but it combines so strongly
                                                           with

with them, either cold or hot, that the separation is difficult
to be effected even with the addition of brine; and the oil,
when a large proportion of it is used, can scarcely be at all
brought from its concreted to a fluid state but by an equiva
lent large proportion of lixiviate fait: the use of lime, there
fore, alone is improper, or even in a great proportion with
other ingredients.       But when only a lesser degree of edulco-
ration is required, a moderate quantity, conjoined with an
equal or greater weight of chalk, which assists its separation
from the oil, may, on account of its great cheapness, be em
ployed very advantageously : it will in this cafe admit of pre
cipitation from the oil by the addition of brine.          It may be
also expediently used when lixiviate salt is employed with
heat for the most perfect purification of oils; for it will in
 that cafe give room for the diminishing of the quantity of lix
 iviate salt, though the proportion be nevertheless so restrained
 as not to exceed what the proportion of lixiviate salt (just re
quisite for the edulcoration) can separate from the oil.
    Chalk has an absorbing power similar to lime, but in a less
degree, on the putrid substance of oil : it does not, however,
 combine so strongly with the oil as to resist separation in the
 same manner, and is therefore very proper to be conjoined
 either with lixiviate salts or lime, as it renders a less quantity
 •f either sufficient, and indeed contributes to the separation
 of the oil from them.
     Magnesia alba, or the alkaline earth, which is the basis of
 the sal catharticus, and the singular earth which is the basis
 of alum, both have an edulcorating power on foetid oils, but,
 like lime, have too strong an attraction with them to be se
 parated so as to admit of the reduction of the oil from the
 concreted    (late to which they reduce it; and therefore, as
  they are not superior in efficacy to lime and chalk, but much
 dearer or more difficult to be obtained, they may be rejected
 from the number of ingredients lhat are proper for the puri
 fying of oils, with a view to commercial advantages.
     Sea salt has an antiseptic power on the mixed solid parts of
 animals; but used alone, or dissolved in water, it does not
  appear to lessen the putrid fœtor of oils, but, on the contrary,
  rather increases it. If after their commixture with it they
  are subjected to heat, it rather depraves than improves the
  oils; but though by its own immediate action on them it
  conduces so little to the edulcoration of oils, yet it is a me
  dium for the separation of water and the alkaline substances
  requisite to be employed to that end.      It is of great utility in
  the  edulcorative   processes ; for when  alkaline  salts or earths
  combine    with   the water necessary to their action on the oils,
                                                                     or

 so  that the oil being separated will float on the aqueous fluid,
 while the earth,       any be in the mixture, will be precipitated
                          if
 and sink close together to the bottom of the containing vessel.
    Sal catharticus, glauber salt, nitrum vitriotatum, tartar,
 and other neutral salts, though they counteract putrefaction
 in the mixed or solid parts of animals, seem to have little
 effect on oils with respect to their edulcoration, and cannot
 therefore be ranked amongst the substances proper to be used
for that purpose.

                                        little Expense.
    Take an ounce of chalk in powder, and half an ounce of
 lime slaked              by
                  exposure to the air; put them into   gallon            a

 stirring, add half a pint of water, and mix that also with
 them by the same means. When they have stood an hour
 or two, repeat the stirring, and continue the fame treatment
 at convenient intervals for two or three days ; after which
 superadd a pint and a half of water in which an Ounce of salt
is dissolved, and mix them a3 the other ingredients, repeat
ing the stirring, a9 before, for a day or two. Let the whole
then stand at rest, and the water will fink below the oil, and
the chalk subside in it to the bottom of the vessel.      The oil
will become clear, be of a lighter colour, and have consider
ably less smell, but will not oe purified in a manner equal to
what is effected by the other processes below given ; though,
as this is done with the expense of only one ounce of salt, it
may be practised advantageously for many purposes, especially
as a preparation for the next method, the operation of which
will be thereby facilitated.

    Take   a gallon of crude stinking oil, or rather such as has
been prepared       as above mentioned, and add to it an ounce
of powdered chalk ; stir them well together several times, as
in the preceding process, and, after they have been mixed
some hours, or a whole day, add an ounce of pearl-ashes
dissolved in four ounces of water, and repeat the stirring as
before.     After they have been so treated for some hours, put
in a pint of water in which two ounces of fait are dissolved,
and proceed as before : the oil and brine will separate on
standing some days, and the oil will be greatly improved both
in smell and colour. Where a greater puritt is required, the
            of pearl-ashes must be increased, and the time before
Quantity
  le addition of the salt and water prolonged.
    If the same operation is repeated several times, diminishing
each time the quantity of ingredients one-half, the oil may
be brought to a very light colour, and rendered equally sweet
in smell with the common spermaceti oil.
    By this process the cod- oil may be made to burn ; and,
when it is so putrid as not to be fit for any use, either alone
or mixed, it may be so corrected by the first part of the pro
cess as to be equal to that commonly sold : but where this
process is practised in the case of such putrid oil, use half an
ounce of chalk and half an ounce of lime.

 To purify   Fi/b-Oil -with the Assistance of Heat, where the

   Take a gallon of crude stinking oil, and mix with it a
quarter of an ounce of powdered chalk, a quarter of an ouuce
of lime slaked in the air, and half a pint of water; stir them
together, and, when they have stood some hours, add a pint
of water and two ounces of pearl-ashes, and place them over
a fire that will just keep them simmering, till the oil appears
of a light amber colour, and has lost all smell, except a hot,
greasy, soap-like scent.       Then superadd half a pint of water
in which an ounct of salt has been dissolved; and having
boiled them half an hour, pour them into a proper vessel,
and let them stand till the separation of the oil, water, and
lime be made, as in the preceding process. Where this ope
ration is performed to prepare 01) for the woollen manufac
ture, the salt may be omitted ; but the separation of the lime
from the oil will be slower, and a longer boiling will be ne

      This      process maybe performed on any kind offish or seal-

Vol. XV. No.            58.             I                         Observations

114                 On the Edulcoralion of           Fi/b-Oil.
                    Ohstrvations   on Process the       Third.
    First, This is most advantageously performed on train-oil,
called vicious whale-oil ; and the more putrid and foul it may
be, the greater will be the proportionable improvement, espe
cially if there be no mixture of the other kinds of fish-oils,
particularly the seal, which do not admit of being edulco
rated perfectly bv means of heat, but require other methods :
but when the vicious oil is pure-from admixture of others,
however stinking it mav be, the bad smell will be removed
by this process duly executed, and the brown colour changed
to a very light amber ; and these qualities will be much more
permanent in this than in anv crude oil, as it will not, from
the degree of purity to which it is brought, be subject to
putrefy again under a great length of time, whether it be
kept open or in close vessels.
    The oil in this state will burn away without leaving the
least remains of foulness in the lamp ; and, being rendered
more fluid than before, will go further, when used in the
woollen manufacture, than anv other kind, and will be much
 more easily scoured from the wool.
   If,   nevertheless, there be any branches of the woollen ma
 nufacture which require the use of more thick and unctuous
                                                 a
 nil, this may be rendered         so   by
                                       the addition of     proper quan
                                                                 a
 tity of tallow or fat, of which         certain proportion will per
                                         a
 fectly incorporate with the oil, the fluidity and transparency
 being still preserved, as well as all the other qualities that
 render  it  suitable to the intended purpose. This may be most
 beneficially done       byadding      proper quantity of the refuse
                                        a
 grease   of families, commonly     called  kitchen stuff, which being
 put   to the  oil, when   moderately    heated, will immediately dis
 solve in     it, and let fall also its impurities or foulness to the
 bottom of the vessel, and render the purified admixture                        a
  considerable saving to the manufacturers.
     Secondly, The different qualities and dispositions of dif
  ferent parcels of vicious oil with respect to edulcoration render
 various proportions necessary of the ingredients to be used.
 The quantities stated in the above process are the least which
  will effect the end in general, and frequently greater will be
  required;    but this may always be first tried           and  :   if
                                                                     be   it
  found, after fix or eight hours simmering of the mixture,
  that no gradual improvement             making in the smell and co
                                            is
  lour, but that the oil continues the fame in those particulars,
  and remains also mixed with the chalk and lime, and in                         a
  thick turbid state,    a fourth or third part of the first quantity
  of pearl-ashes mould be added, and the simmering continued
                                                                               till

 sened by the evaporation, it is necessary to make fresh addi
 tions from lime to time, that there may be always nearly the
original proportion.
    Thirdly, If it be inconvenient to give the whole time of
boiling at once, the sire may be suffered to go out and be re
kindled at anv distance of time; and
                                                       if,
                                             such case,in  small         a
proportion of pearl-ashes dissolved in water be added, and the
mixture several times stirred betwixt the times of boiling,                       it
will facilitate the operation. The time of boiling may be
also much shortened,      the chalk, lime, and pearl-asties, be
                               if
added for some days before, and the mixture frequently stirred.

faults will ever be the most perfect work. Hence the found
ation of a rational inquiry after excellence in art ; for he w ho
wislies to examine a picture nicelv or criticallv, mull make
himself acquainted with the first idea, or general intention of
the whole, then of each part separately, considering them in
themselves as relative to each other and to the whole.
      An inquiry after the different styles of painting would na
 turally lead to a history of the art itself; but as that is a sub
ject that has been so frequently handled, we shall only touch
 lo far on it as may immediately answer our purpose.
      The so much boasted criticisms on the works of the an-
 tients, which are to be found in various authors, can be but
 little depended on, though often dressed up in the technical
 phrases of art; because the strongest language will always be
 used on the most extraordinary occasion, but the advantage
 resulting to the. reader will depend on the capacity of the
 writer.
      All discussion at present on works that have ceased to exist
  for near 2000 years would be only loss of time, as, from
  want of reference, they could not tend to illustrate any one
  rule of art. Such inquiries may serve to amuse the idle, but
                                                           '
 will not tend in the least to benefit the ariist.
      No one can denv, however humiliating the thought may
  be, that we are indebted to the Greeks for some, of the
  finest forms at present in art.            Many have attributed their
  superior powers     to  the climate    : but  we ought rather to ascribe
  them to the freedom they enjoyed, and the wisdom of their
  legislators ; not forgetting their enthusiasm for beautv, which
  they considered as a gift of the gods; and that with them
  men were more valued for their personal merit than for the
  wealth they possessed.        The happy Grecian might sit himself
  down contented in his poverty, knowing it was not thought
  disreputable, and that his abilities would prove a sufficient
  passport to society and to the highest honours.              The modern
  artist is solicitous of making money, knowing it is now the
  first test of his abilities in the opinion of the world, and a
   stronger recommendation than wisdom.                  Hence the nobler
   energies of the foul are weakened ; and from want of the
   stronger motive, honour, the love of fame sinks into the base
   and lelsisti desire of wealth.       This has induced the weak and
   pusillanimous    to  apply   to  the  arts ; and as they aspire after
   nothing but interest, they         are  unacquainted with those sub
   lime conceptions     the  arts  require.
       The Phœnicians are believed not to have carried the arts
   to any great degree of perfection.            To be sufficiently well for
    the purpose  of  exportation     would     be  the utmost that would
                                                                         be

be required ; and perhaps their merchants would not be in
clined to risk much on articles the buyers of which would be
the wealthy, and often the ignorant. What might be requi
site for the purpose of ornament would be more likely to be
fliovvy than just.
    The Romans appear to have encouraged the arts as a means
of adding to their pride, and of feeding their vanity. As a
people, they are rather to be viewed at a distance ; their cha
racter is too sclsifli and oppressive to invite to an intimacy.
The best works produced among the Romans from Augustus
to Trajan are justly held to be of Grecian workmanship.
     It is always more easy to imitate the style than the reason
ings and science of the original : hence those who succeeded
the early Greeks failed bv degrees in the most essential parts;
which may account tor that fort of mechanical hardiness, and
often want of elegance, observable in some of the works called
Roman.                          -                                   «
     We have no risrht to look for true taste among a people
who could drag their captives at their chariot wheels, or
slaughter them in theatres.          They appear to have preferred
pomp and (bow, " barbaric pearl and gold," to true taste;
and exhibit a picture of gaudy and well-disciplined barbari
ans.      A nation which places the first reputation on arms or
war, will never have a higher esteem for the peaceable pro
fessor of design than a Spartan or Roman.                  Many of their
most renowned works are recommended                    more to notice on
account of their richness than beauty, as Nero's golden pa
laces, he.       Pomp and luxury was their object ; and they fell
into the common error of ignorance, that of augmenting the
matter instead of improving the form *.
     Among the moderns, every country that has formed- a
school appears to have had a cause for its style in its national
character. The gravity of the Florentines and Romans might
require that justness and truth of form which they saw in the
antique statues.       The Venetians, a wealthy and gay people,
would delisht in magnificence from their commerce with the
 Halt; and painting for the rich and luxurious would neces
sarily introduce splendour and brilliancy of colour, with pro
cessions, feasts, he.        The Flemish and Dutch were content
with superficial or general representations of things.               Of the
 French, the bell masters have sought perfection in the Roman
 school ; while others, complying with the national love for
splendour, have sought perfection by bustle and show.                    Of
our own nation, the love of locality and portraiture may bo

said flrongly to mark the amor patrue,      and to exhibit their
 charity and love for each other.
    A knowledge of the different styles is absolutely necessary
to enable us to think deeply and freely. No man, however
 great his powers, was ever capable of subsisting on his own
 stock : the more wide the field of inquiry, the more we in
 crease our knowledge, and quicken and enlarge our ideas.
We cannot doubt that M. Angelo^and Raphael possessed all
 the knowledge of art discovered in their time.      'Tis our duty
 to live, as it were, amidst the great works of art, that, by
 enriching our minds, we may be able to produce something
 great and noble of our own. This is the true spirit of imita
 tion, and which we may continue, without fear of its doing
 us an injury, from infancy till we arrive at the fullest state of
 vigour.
    By style as well as manner we are enabled to judge isa
 picture be the work of a certain master ; for, should we re
 main doubtful from the former, a reference to the penciling
 may determine the point.        For, as in writing or speaking
 we shall generally discover in persons a fondness for certain
 phrases, or a peculiar turn or connection of their sentences,
 by which their style may be known : so in painting we shall
discover some favourite part forced on the eye ; or thought,
 attitude, or habit occur, which stamps the master's style.
Every one will possess more or less of the style and manner of
the master or school from which he comes.         Raphael, in his
oil pictures, never wholly got riJ of that littleness of style de
rived from Perugino.
    To insure a good style we must earlv habituate ourselves to
contemplate noble works of imagination. This, if connected
with a vigorous mind, a lively fancy, a strong memory, and
good judgment, will be attended with success.           That those
qualities are necessary to enable us to form a good style, is
certain; for bv the imagination we conceive images, and if
the impressions be clear the stvle will be so too. But should
the images be faint and imperfect, the style will partake of
these defects.     For it cannot be denied that, as the painter
is affected himself, in the same degree will he move the spec
tator.    Hence, if the mind be dull, and indisposed to receive
clear  and  distinct ideas of things, the style will be stiff and
heavy;    or,  if the images be irregular and disordered, the
work will be perplexed and confused.         It appears to follow
of course, that a lively fancy will be accompanied with a
happy memory : through this we are supplied with the vast
treasures of art and nature ; for without a large stock of images
we dial! never be able to diversify our works in the way va

riety demands, and they would appear insipid from the too
frequent   return of the fame ideas. But, unless all this be ac
companied by a good judgment, the imaginition will riot at
the expense of reason, and we shall never possess a found and
accurate style.     Hence it is that we often confound genius
with an a6tive imagination, not recollecting that excess is
not its character, and that the more we crowd with incidents
the more we weaken j and that, like great talkers, we may
be bad orators.
   We (hall now proceed to describe, in the best way we can,
the characters of the various styles. Taste and style differ fron*
each other; the former applying to our choice of objects,
while the latter appears to arise from our mode of treating
them, or the augmenting certain parts and depressing others,
as in the figure* of M. Angelo, in which we fee the convex
lines raised so much as to give them a muscular and gigantic
air; by attempting which many of his imitators have often
lost the essential character of the object. We fay " the great
style of Raphael's drapery," not merely on account of the
casting of the folds, which shows tajie, but from his drop
ping the minute parts, and taking only those essential to the
great character in painting. The artills who have sought the
great style have pursued the above conduct; that      is, have at
tended to the great and essential character, while those who
have forced the trifling parts on the eye have formed       amean
or little one.   The great style requires the human face, the
other includes the wrinkles and other marks of the infirmi
ties of nature.
                         Sublime Style.
  The sublime style     is    by many connected with     acertain
degree of intemperance        and excess. The attempts of such
may    justly be termed      the hobgoblin style; for with them
 nothing   is sublime but what will scare         man out of his
                                                  a
 fenses.   But scenes terrible or mocking, however admissible
in poetry, or where an orator may have occasion to work on
 the feelings of his audience, do not associate happily with
 painting  ; and, when attempted without the greatest care
 and circumspection, become either ridiculous or disgusting.
 Brueghel (called hellish), as also Callot, in their whimsical
 scenes intended to affect us seriously.       And Rubens, out of
 the number of representations       he has left of the fall of the
 damned, has rather shown          warmth of imagination than
                                   a
judgment in their treatment:            ittrue, the machinery he

 us laugh.    Scenes of horror require great           delicacy of treat
 ment, as the mind cannot dwell without                disgust on repre
 sentations brought home in that determined            way which paint
 ing demands. Pilkington relates, from Sandrart, that Spa-
 guoletto represented an Ixion on the wheel so full of pain,
 and agony, that the wife of Mr. Uffel, the possessor, from
 looking on it when with child, was so affected bv
                                                                     " that

 feet cut off; and has most injudiciously, nay, most insensibly

 bull-bait, than either Titian or Rubens have done in the
above compositions.         Justice must allow that       a want of deli
cacy   is  not often chargeable on the Italians.

we (hall derive credit      in proportion as we display more or less
mental energy. For though we may not possess the power
of colouring, or such other excellences as would captivate
the eye, vet we may exert the vigour of the foul in the rea
soning and science of the work         ;  and this energy       it   in our

grandeur of our thoughts, and the elevation of the loul.                   A

dazzled with a gaudy appearance, or suffer our admiration to
dwell on what the wise would contemn ; or we may be led
away after pageantry and pomp, mistaking them for true ho
nour and clory . By exerting the mind we may raiGe our work
into the sublime, from a judicious introduction of such acces
sory circumstances as may add dignity or contribute to the
illustration of the story; particularly if they have a skilful con
nection, and affect the imagination.        We have noticed some
such instances already in our Eflav en Invention, as in Ra
phael's Paul at Lystra, Barry's picture of Elysium, &c. These
accessory circumstances occur frequently in the works of the
poets, and contribute much to heighten the scene ; as in
Lear, the thunder storm makes the heart bleed for the suf
ferings of the old king : and how sublime does the vision of
the 5agger render Macbeth by its judicious introduction!
Vastneis is productive of the sublime, bv considering any ob-
       that takes up much room in the fancy. But we must

ness of bulk for nobleness in works of art        :one of Lyfippus's
statues of Alexander, though no bigger than the life, might
give the mind more noble ideas than Mount Athos had                   it
 been cut into the figure of that hero.      This subject has been
in some measure amplified already in our Essays on Invention
and Composition     :   itmay therefore be scarcely necessary to
mention, that the sublime requires that the subject of our
picture should be   a   great one, and,      possible, carry with
                                            if                        it
a   universal interest.    In the composition, simplicity and gra
vity are essential to produce grandeur: we cannot wish for
better examples than are offered to our view in the Cartoons
of Raphael; particularly the Paul at Lystra, his Preaching at
Athens, and in the Death of Ananias.               We fliall observe
great grandeur in those fine compositions               Well, of the

fine chiaro-scuro, add an effect of sublimity.      Some of Ru-
bens's pictures strike wonderfully on that account, and Rey-
nolds's Infant Hercules receives an uncommon air of gran
deur from the broad and judicious disposition of the masses.
Though this style does not require the soft harmonious glow
of Venetian colouring, which agrees best with the beautiful,
yet it by no means follows, that it authorizes a disregard of
the grouping of the colours, to the total neglect of the general
harmony of the picture.      The colouring should be sober and
dignified ; we do not mean black and heavy, but composed of
such colours as are full, rich, glowing, and rather deep than
light. The penciling should be firm and decisive, with the
parts well defined.      We should particularly guard against
trifling events, poor   or mean thoughts, and whatever is low
and vulgar: such things mar a good whole, and appear worse
by contrast, like the blemishes on beautiful bodies. The
most esteemed masters have carefully avoided introducing in
their works things sordid and base : in the higher style there
should never appear any thing insignificant or unnecessary,
as dogs, cats, parrots, &c. : such things as these often add a
grace to the picturesque, but destroy grandeur.      Neither will
theatrical splendour or gaudy apparel suit the sublime : the
Teason    is,
            they affect not beyond the eye; and that which
leaves no impression on the mind, we may rest assured,          not      is
the thing we seek.      A work truly sublime does not merely
please:   that  isthe province of inferior excellence.    A grand
work will confound, astonish, and, with the impetuosity of
a  hurricane, bear down all before it. The sublime appears
sounded on      union of the most noble and elevated parts of
                a
nature joined to the most profound efforts of the imagina
tion. Its qualities appear to be simplicity, with           certaina
uniformity united with solemnity and gravity. Simplicity                      is
necessary to nobleness,     as ornament destroys greatness of
manner.      So the parts should be ample, as          effected by
                                                             is

  In this Raphael stands a shining example, and appears to
have touched the extreme point of excellence.  Happily we
have many of his finest works at hand in the Cartoons at
Windsor Castle.   Witness his Elymas the sorcerer, whose
figure is most justly expressive of the punishment of blindness
which had befallen him; and the astonishment of the spec
tators is depicted with great judgment.       But let us contrast
the above with the Death of Ananias, and observe the con
sternation and terror in the spectators at a punishment so
much more terrible. There we behold with what a masterly
hand the artist has raised the feelings in proportion to the
exciting cause, without the least waste of force in the expres
sion.   In the first picture is more repose ; in the second, a
greater degree of action corresponding with the interest ex
cited by the event.    In the first picture we see the surprise of
an earthly judge at an event beyond the power of his under
standing; in the other, a calm and dignified set of beings,
conscious of the interposition of a Divine Power.      Much has
been said of the Cartoons ; every one speaks of the dignity
of the Paul in the picture representing his " preaching at
Athens," which for simplicity and dignity reaches the sub
lime.    History is the walk that ennobles the art. This calls
forth exertions that elevate and dignify our nature. It might
be doubted if the Greek ever arrived to that degree of per
fection in expression which Raphael has sliown in his works:
they certainly sacrificed it to the beauty of appearance.     Still
we (hall look with delight on the Laocoon, the dying Alex
ander, the Niobes, &c. Raphael, to assist the expression in
his figures, appears to have marked the tendons ; those who
have sought beauty have attended more to the            fleshy parts   of
the muscles.  His style of drapery is simply       grand, in the
extreme of perfection, and well worthy of         being studied.
Even Poussin, who is said to excel in     in it,   his best works
                                                   is
inferior. Raphael   is  more judicious and select; Poussin more
natural.   Justice must allow that the former took the hint
for this great style of drapery from M. Angelo.          Raphael
sometimes reached the graceful, and but seldom the beauti
ful, and never exquisitely. We have selected the works of
the above artist, esteeming them the first for expression     but
                                                                ;
we (hall find admirable traits of the fame kind in those of
the Caracci, Domenichino,         Poussin, &c.   Some who have
attempted   the  expressive style, imagining the whole merit lay
in excess and violence, have writhed their figures into con
vulsions, when the occasion would not require more exertion
                                                             than

. than  would be necessary to take a pinch of snuff or raise a
  straw ; nay, they will not let them even sleep in peace. Such
  bombastic stuff may amuse the weak, as fashion in art will
  please for a time even at the expense of truth ; but the tri
  umph will be transitory as a fun-beam on a winter's day.
                             Beautiful Style
     Requires that the objects be elegant, void of superfluitv,
  and soft in the execution.         Perhaps the truly beautiful style
 must be sought in the works of the antients.              The Apollo
 Belvidere approaches the sublime, and forms, of its kind, a
 point of perfection : some of the Niobes exhibit exquisite
 female beauty, but in the Venus de Medicis and Apollo we
 fee it united with grace.         It is certain that in the antique
 statues we must seek the beauty of symmetry, and that we
 cannot study them too often to fix the impression of their ex
 cellencies on our minds ; for it is next to impossible but that
 every reconsideration      must unsold new beauties.        The true
 mode of study is to impress their beauties so strongly on the
 imagination as never to be forgotten, and not to stand in need
of their presence as a pattern. Boys are too often put to draw
after the living model before they have imbibed a proper no
tion of, or relish for, beautiful proportion. There is no danger
of such studies injuring, as we are surrounded by fine exam
ples in cb'utro-scuro and colour; and of the two, decision is
more commendable than that slovenly manner which pre
sents the mere idea of a thing like a dream : the former dis
plays knowledge, the latter ignorance.            There is great dif
ference in painting, between taking the ideas of natural
things without giving them form, and that determined me
thod arising from a positive knowledge.             Guido's heads are
beautiful ; nut his choice was often injudicious, many of his
objects requiring strong expression, which he lost for fear of
destroying beauty. Albano's females are delicately beautiful;
and we are surrounded by beauty in the portraits of Reynolds
and others.
                             Graceful Style.
    To form this style the motions of the figures should be
moderate, easy, agreeable, and unaccompanied by violence*.
The antique statues will assuredly assord the most perfect ex
amples, because, on a comparison with the antients, the mo
derns appear to have become a little assected, and too often
to have sought grace in difficult attitudes, with forced and
conceited turns in their figures.         There are few of the Greek

statues    in which     grace does not abound ; for, as they sought
beauty      in  their works,   they cultivated grace as its inseparable
companion.          Wry graceful are the Apollo and the Venus de
Medicis ; so are the Meleager and Hermaphrodite, The Her
cules is also truly graceful and easy, as is the Antinoiis, See.
Raphael understood the grace of motion ; but he had it less
in the contours of his figures ; and his dry manner of execu
tion contributed much to destroy beauty.             Corregio appears
the most perfect modern, Parmegiano being sometimes too
 forced, and bordering on affectation.          Reynolds's female por
traits appear to have been touched by the Graces themselves.
 Among the works of our sculptors, the females of Nollekens
 possess such a combiiration of grace and beauty as the Greeks
 might have acknowledged for their own without a blusti.
                                 Florid  Style.
      This style must be sought amongst the Venetians, also in
  Rubens, and those Flemings who have followed him. Those
  who have practised it have been content to please the eye by
  a brilliant display of colour, contrast in their groups, and op
  position in light and shade.           They appear to have admitted
  every description of objects in their picture, provided they
  contributed to the bustle or pleasure of the whole.             If this
  is not the most just style, experience teaches every one that
  it is the most popular, and perhaps we may add the most pro
  fitable.
      The above masters must not be confounded with those who
  have practised a style sufficiently easy, but who have been
   content wiih giving such an idea of a thing in their works as
   would serve to distinguish one from another without regard
   ing their perfection.         At the head of this latter class stand
   P. Cortona and L. Giordano.
                                 Natural Style.
       This    style is called natural, from the artists practising it
   wanting the power to improve on the original, or of choosing
   the best of the kind.          It is to be seen in the Dutch school
   in the works of Rembrandt, G. Dow, Mcris, young Teniers,
    &c. This school has improved the aerial perspective, and
    possesses great excellence of colour and cbiaro-scuro, to which
    it has joined great truth, as far as a simple representation
    would permit.         It has excelled in what may be termed the
    mechanical part of the art ; and those who wish to seek after
    an elegant power of penciling will be highly gratified in the
    admirable works of Teniers, Cuyp, Berghem, &c. &c.
       As each of the above styles has its peculiar beauties, we
                                                                     mult

   ia5    Comparative Anatomy      of the Eleilric Organs of the
  must cautiously guard against falling into the opposite ex
  treme. For the sublime is nearly allied to the extravagant ;
  the expressive may be easily rendered bombastic or pedantic ;
  and the beautiful, smirking or coquettish. The graceful, with
  the ignorant, may easily become the affected : perhaps there
  is but a slight partition between that affectation of grace in
  the works of Watteau, Bouche, and Le Moine, and the pure
  representations of Corregio, or those of Parmegiano.           The
  florid may be mistaken for the showy and tawdry. This is
  most likely to happen from a cold lifeless imitation.
      Works of genius are ever the result of feeling, to which
  we must be directed by spirit and judgment.           A painter, a
         or player, that imitates closely, will never excel.      To
    e tamely alive in our works is not enough ; spirit, vivacity,
 Eoet,
  and vigour, are required.       Whatever comes short of this is
 but one remove from imbecility.
 XXII.     Memoir on the comparative Anatomy of the Eleilric
      Organs of the Torpedo, the Gymnotus electricus and the
     Silurus electricus.     By E. Geoffrov *.
 OlNCE       philosophers have applied with so much success to
 researches respecting the Galvanic phænomena, it is of more
 importance than ever that a correct description should be given
 of the particular organs of' certain fishes which are found to
possess   electric properties.
     Analogy gives us reason to believe, that beings which pos
sess faculties so extraordinary are indebted for them to an or-
               almost entirely similar; consequently, that these
fanizalion
    eings approach very near to each other, or rather, that they
form only one family.          But by the examination we are ena
bled to make, this is not observed to be the case : on the con
trary, we are surprised to find that the electric fishes belong
to genera exceedingly different, and that they are placed in
these genera without violating in any manner the order of
natural relations. An electric species, therefore, is known
in each of the genera, of ray, tetrodon, trichiurus, gymnotus,
and silurus.
     To account for the great dissimilarity of the fishes which
are distinguished from others of the fame genera by the pre
sence of electric organs, we must admit that the latter are
not essentially connected with organs of the first importance,
and that they belong at most to the common integuments,

seem to conduct ; for, if we adopt the opinion of most ana
tomists, it will be found that the electric organ in the tor
pedo is very extensive, exceedingly complex, and particularly
remarkable in this respect, that nothing analogous to it has
ever been observed. The Italian school, at the head of which
 were Redi and his pupil Lorenzini, for a long time consi
dered the numerous tubes of which that organ is formed as
 so many peculiar small muscles, musculi falcati; and this
opinion was generally adopted till the late John Hunter pub
 lished his excellent Anatomical Description of the Torpedo.
     During my travels I have also had an opportunity of seeing
 torpedoes, and I soon distinguistied the electric batteries with
 which they are abundantly furnished. As it was by touch
 ing these kinds of apparatus that I experienced the strongest
 shocks, and as the other rays exhibited nothing of the fame
 kind, I entertained no doubt that I had before my eyes those
 organs by means of which the torpedo renders itself so for
 midable in the bosom of the water, and can at pleasure strike
 with numbness those animals which it wishes to make its
  prey. But at that time 1 was ignorant whether others before
 me had examined this organization; and, in that cafe, what
  addition to the observations already made it would be neces
  sary for me to make.      Being shut up in Alexandria during
  the time of the siege, and deprived of the use of my library,
  I consoled myself tor not being immediately able to clear up
  my doubts, by entertaining a hope that these organs were not
  known, at least in regard to their relation with general phy
  siology. To obtain that knowledge I endeavoured to find
  something analogous in the other rays, being persuaded that
  it was not so much the presence of this organ, as a dispo
  sition peculiar toit,  that gave the torpedoes alone of all the
  rays the astonishing faculty of fulminating, as we may fay, the
  small inhabitants of the sea. Those who have compared only
a    few animals mult know that few new organs are found
  among them, and particularly in species which resemble
  each other   so much as the rays.   It   was natural therefore to
  believe, that the tubes containing  a    gelatinous substance in
   the torpedo existed in  a    state of concealment  in the other
  rays
     ;    and
            it  will here  be seen  that
                                    I    indeed found in the Iatte»
  an analogous organization, with differences to which we must
   refer the different modes of existence and action of each
   siecies.
                                                             Rays,

    128   Comparative Anatomy of the EhElric Organs      of the
       Rays, as is well known, are flat fish, the pectoral fin of
   which is prolonged anteriorly on the sides of the head by
   means of a cartilage that borders its circumference.         The
   torpedo differs from other fishes of the fame genus by a very
   considerable   interval between this cartilage and the head.
   All this large vacuity is silled up by prisms of six, five, and
   sometimes four planes.     These prisms adhere by their bases
  to the skin above and to that below.         They are arranged
  parallel to each other, follow the projecting and irregular
  contours of the head and branchiæ, and externally form a
  semi-elliptic stratum.    When the skin is removed, all these
  prisms, the bases of which are then observed, exhibit the ap
  pearance of a honey-comb.        They are so many small tubes
  filled with a substance which by chemical analysis I found to
  be a compound of gelatin and albumen.           The texture of
  these tubes is aponeurotic, and they are united to each other
 by a kind of lax reticulation formed of tendinous fibres which
 envelop them in every direction : in the last place, they are
 covered and slmt by an aponeurotic membrane, and above
 these coverings the skin is applied.     This apparatus is fur
 nished with nerves remarkable for their large size.         There
 are distinguislied four principal trunks, which are distributed
 to all the tubes, and which at length penetrate into their
 substance and expand in it.
      Though rays, in which the cartilage of the pectoral fin im
mediately borders the contours of the head, were not, like the
torpedo, in a condition to exhibit prisms or vertical tubes,
 they did not differ from them so much as might be expected.
 In the rays, as well as in the torpedoes, there issues from the
cranium, a little before the ear, a nerve so large that it sur
passes the volume of that which proceeds to the eye.          This
nerve proceeds laterally, creeps ove"r the superior face of the
masseter, and expands below, between that muscle and the
first branchia, in a mass which on the first view might be taken
for a gland, but which is really the focus from which pro
ceed, in several bundles, a great number of tubes analogous
to those of the torpedo.         A bundle proceeds towards the
nose, another spreads over the belly, a third ascends on the
masseter and terminates behind the occiput, and a fourth ex
tends over the muscles of the pectoral fin.       In this respect
there are some differences according to the species : but these
tubes, in the ray as well as in the torpedo, always adhere to
the (kin above and to that below ; only, instead of being ver
tical, which is impossible, for want of room, they follow the
contour of the head, extend over the most exterior muscles,
and are longer according as they have a larger circuit to
                                                             make

  seem to be of the same nature as those of the
                                                             torpedo, and
  contain a gelatinous and albuminous substance entirely simi
  lar. Hitherto we observe in this respect no other differences
  between the common rays and the torpedo, except that the
  tubes in the latter are very short, vertical, close to each other,
  and parallel ; while in the other rays they are much longer,
  bend around the principal muscles of the electric machines,
  and divide into several bundles formed of divergent radii.
      But if these organs do not vary in each species but by a
 different arrangement of parts, is it not to be apprehended
 that we may fall into a consequence contrary to the facts ob
  served, and ought we not to suppose that all rays are more
 or less endowed with the electric properties of the torpedo?
 Such, indeed, would be the opinion which we ought to form,
 if these organs were not distinguished by a character on which
 depend, in part, the astonishing properties of the torpedo.
 The tubes in the common rays open on the outside of the
 skin by orifices peculiar to them, and are so many excretory
 organs of the gelatinous matter which they contain.               In the
 torpedo all these tubes are completely sliut, not only by the
 skin, which has no perforations, but also bv aponeuroses which
 extend over the whole surface of the electric organ. As the
 gelatinous matter cannot then escape, it is forced to be accu
 mulated in these tubes : hence, no doubt, the greatness of
 their diameter, and on this account also their number in
 creases at the different periods of life.            Valll and Hunter,
 indeed, found this progrestive augmentation.              They counted
 more than two hundred of these tubes in young subjects,
 from four to five hundred in adult torpedoes, and even twelve
 hundred in m\ individual of a large size.
     It is to John Hunter, as already said, that we are indebted
for the best description of the electric organs of the torpedo*.
Monro, in his Physiology of Fishes, has also described the
corresponding apparatus found in the other rays; but I flatter
myself that I am the first who compared these organs, who
proved their identity, and reduced them to the fame system
of organization.         The elettric organ of the torpedo is really
an organ of touching, furnished with an apparatus 3; exten
sive as that of seeing or smelling.           The nerves which pro
ceed thither are so large that their volume appeared to Hunter
as extraordinary as the phænomena to which they give rise.
They suddenly expand in a gelatinous mucus, and nothing
impedes       their free communication with external bodies,

There can be no doubt that they perform a very considerable
part in the electric phænomena. Hunter was ot opinion that
they are destined to form; collect, and direct the nervous
fluid.    Their influence however is proved, since it is known
that the concurrence of the will of the animal is indispen
sably necessary for giving shocks. This evidently results from
the observations of M. Valst, and from those which I had
occasion    to repeat myself.
    However, since these nerves are found in other rays distri
buted nearly in the fame manner as in the torpedo, it must
be allowed that they are not alone sufficient for the produc
tion of electricity, and that for this purpose they must also
be in a certain relation with the surrounding parts.       Do the
apertures of the tubes in the rays favour the issue of the
nervous fluid ? Or, as in the torpedo, do the nerves require
a larger quantity of gelatinous substance to enable them to
expand in numerous runii, and to become proper for acting
with more energy ?
    In order that we may ascertain how far these conjectures
may be founded in truth, let us compare the electric organs
of the torpedo, those described bv Hunter in the gymnotus
eletiriais, and those which I discovered in the Jilurus eleSri-
cus.    These two fishes are so different from the torpedo, that
they   afford   reason to hope that this comparison will throw
 considerable light on the present question.
    The gymnotus belongs to that order of fishes distinguistied
 by the name of apoda : it is the genus which approaches
 nearest to that of the murenæ and eels ; consequently they
 have a very long body, almost cylindric, and similar to that
 of serpents. Separated from the murenæ because they have
 no fins on the back or tail, they are diltinguistied from them
 also by the great shortness of the abdomen.        The anus, in
 deed, is so near the head that it opens before the pectoral
 fins.   But, on the other hand, the gymnoti have the tail of
 a most extraordinary length : it is an organ to which all the
 rest seem to have been sacrificed, and it is rendered lighter
 by a disposition peculiar to this kind of rilh. The aftr-bladder,
 instead of being inclosed in the abdominal cavity, extends to
 the inside of the tail, and is continued to its extremity.      It
 is above this bladder that there is found in the gymnotus
 electricus a very singular apparatus still more astonishing by
 its enormous size than by its structure ; an apparatus of which
  there is no vestige in the other species of this genus, and
  which may be easily known to be the electric organ of the
  gymnotus.
     This organ is formed by the union of a very great number
                                                                  of

of   aponeuroses, which extend in the direction of the length of
  the fish, forming so many horizontal strata, parallel, and di
 stant from each other about a millimetre: other vertical la-
 minæ, of the same nature, and much more numerous, inter
 sect them almost at right angles ; which produces a large
              reticulation composed of numerous cells of rhom-
   oidal planes. The interior of these cells is silled with an
 Erofound
 unctuous substance of a gelatinous appearance.
    The electric batteries are divided into four distinct masses,
 two of which are large and two small. Hunter gives to each
 pair the name of large and small electric organs.
    The large organs are situated immediately below the air-
 bladder and the vertebral muscles. They are of such a thicks
 ness that they form alone more than half the volume of the
tail.    They are divided by a broad partition, which fumisties
them with points, to which they are strongly attached. They
adhere superiorly to the air-bladder, and to trie muscles which
accompany       it,   byvery compact cellular tissue, and they ter
                           a

                               a
osseous pieces which support the radii of the sin of the anus.
    The small organs occupy the lower region of the tail.
They begin and end nearly at the fame points as the large
organs are situated below them, and on each fide of the os

two long triangular pyramids.         The two lateral faces of these
pyramids are covered             muscular fibres, the aggregate of
                                   by
which produces the different motions of the sin.            In this re
spect  these  small  organs  differ essentially   from  the  large ones
which are attached immediately to the ilein, and which, hav
ing  a  more -intimate connection with external bodies, are ca
pable of producing more energetic effects.
    The horizontal laminæ of the small organs, instead of be
ing parallel throughout their whole length, are undulated at
intervals.     Hunter counted 24            larjic organ, and 14 in
                                             in   a                                 a

found    large nerve, which proceeds in
         a                                straight line from the

 only distributes branches to the muscles of the tail, but fends
 some also to the electric organs.       The different rami of this
 nerve creep first over the surfaces of these orsrans, and spread
 and expand in their aheoli.          It is thus that the vertebral
 nerves, by means of this deviation from their usual route,
 and of an augmentation of volume, become in the gvmnotus
 electricus so many instruments capable of sinking with death,
 or al least with torpor, all those animals which thev touch.
     The electric organ of this filh being placed under the tail,
 and in a part which consequently is removed from the prin
 cipal systems of life, it was difficult to conceive what were the
 nerves which could proceed thither.         The simplest combina
 tion was to deduce them immediately from the spinal marrow ;
 and this, indeed, is that which we fee realized in the gym-
 notus electricus.
      The simplicity of the means employed by nature is ob
 served in a manner still more particular in the filurus elec
 tricus.      This fish differs almost as much from the gvmnoti
 as from the rays, and therefore we must expect a quite dif
 ferent organization.
      It is, indeed, neither on the sides of the head, as in the
 torpedo, nor below the tail, as in the species we have de
  scribed, that the electric organ of the filurus electricus is
 found.       It is extended all round the animal; it exists im
 mediately below the skin, and is formed by a considerable
  collection of cellular tissue, so thick and compact, that on the
"first view ii might be taken for a stratum of lard: but when
 closely inspected it is observed that this organ is composed
 of real tendinous or aponeurotic fibres interwoven with each
 other, and which by their different crostings form a reticu
 lation the mesties of which are not distinctly visible without
 the help of a magnifying glass.        The small cells or alveoli of
  this reticulation are silled with an albumins-gelatinous mat
  ter. Thev are prevented from communicating in the inside
 by a very strong aponeurosis, which extends over the whole
  electric reticulation, and which adheres to it so closely that
  it cannot be separated without tearing it. This aponeurosis
 in other respects adheres to the muleles only by a thin cel
  lular tiffue of little consistence.
      The nervous system, which completes this electric organ, has
 no more relation with the nervous branches which we exa
 mined in the torpedo and the svmnotus than the tubes of
 the latter have with the peculiar covering of the filurus elec
 tricus.      These nerves proceed from the brain ; they are the
 fame as those which mv friend Cuvier has observed in all
  fithes to proceed under the lateral line: but these two nerv< a

of the eighth pair in the silurus electricus have a direction and
volume which are peculiar to that species : they descend, ap
proaching each other on their issuing from the cranium to
wards the hodv of the first vertebra, which they traverse.
They first introduce themselves through an orifice peculiar
to each of them, and then issue on the opposite fide by one
aperture : aster rcascend'mg thev suddenly separate, and pro
ceed under each of the lateral lines.    Thev are then found
lodged between the abdominal muscles and the general apo-
neurosis which extends over the electric reticulation.     In
the last place, thev penetrate beneath the lkin by means of
large branches, which proceed to the right and left of the
principal nerve. These branches are in number 12 or 15 on
each side ; they pierce the aponeurosis which lines the inte
rior surface of the reticular tissue, penetrate to the centre of
the reticulation, and at last expand in it.
    The examination of the three electric organs, which I have
compared with each other, necessarilv conducts us to some
interesting results respecting the kind of modification which
organs common lo all fishes ought to undergo to develop in
some species electric properties.     We find, 1st, That the part
 where the electric batteries are lodged is a matter of indiffe
 rence, as they are diffused all around the silurus electricus,
collected in the tail of the gymnotus, and united on the fides
 of the head in the torpedo.      2d, That no branch of the ner
 vous system is particularly set apart for these organs, since the
 nerves distributed thither are all different. 3d, That the form
 of the cells is also of little importance, as this form varies in
 each species; but in other respects it is found also that the
 electrie batteries, which on the first view we might be tempted
 to believe to be so different, have however a great many re
 lations with each other, and may be reduced to the fame
 system of organization.      This will appear evident, when it is
 considered that the electric fislies are the only ones in which
 we find aponeuroses so extensive and so multiplied in their
 surfaces, with so considerable an accumulation of gelatine and
 albumen in the cells formed bv these aponeuroses, and ner
 vous rami so large and of such a length.       It is by the union,
 indeed, of these simple instruments that the electric organ is
 constituted; and in this state, according to the judicious re
 mark of my colleague Lacepede *, it may be compared to
 the Levden flask, or an electric picture, since it is alternately
 composed of bodies which conduct the electric fluid (the
  nerves, and the albumino-gelatinous pulp to which the action

 I 34    Comparative Anatomy of the ElcBric Organs of the
 of the nerves is continued), and of non-conducting bodies,
 such as the aponeurotic laminae, extended through this mass
 of albumen and gelatine. What proves that it is on the
 mechanical arrangement of these idio-electric and non-elec
 tric elements that the properties of the torpedo depend, is the
 existence of the fame parts in other ravs, though these fishes
 are not capable of producing the fame effects.        These parts,
 similar in regard to their intimate nature and texture, are
 disposed in a manner entirely different.        The nerve of the
 fifth pair in the rays and fquali is of a considerable vo
lume, and expands in a medium from which flows a great
quantity of albumino-gelatinous serofilv: but this gelatine
 either is lost on the outside by tubes which open without the
skin, or is accumulated in a mnss on the sides of the bones of
the nose.     In the latter cafe, the celatine, whatever be its
quantity, is of no use for the production of electricity. This,
no doubt, must he ascribed to the want of aponeuroscs, which
divide it into small insulated portion? — in the same manner
as the Leyden flask, or the electric picture, would fail of their
effect  if deprived of  the glass laminae interposed   between  the
metallic coatings.
     The electric organ, being formed of nerves and aponeurotic
laminae, interlarded, if I may use the expression, with albu
men and gelatine, we ought not to be astonished at meeting
with it in families altogether different. All animals have
nerves which are lost under the skin; all those immediately
below it are more or leO provided with cellular tissue : all
then have, in some measure, the rudiments of an electric or
gan. If we now suppose that nourishing vessels deposit al
bumen and gelatine between the leaves of the cellular tilsuo
which fixes the stein to the exterior muscles, we shall easily
form an idea of the manner in which this deposition may give
rife to the existence of an electric organ.      All this may take
place without the influence,    at least in an immediate manner,
of the other organs effential to life. It is a development
which takes place almost without the animal, and which has
no action but on the skin and parts which depend on it ; and
hence the reason why species which exhibit alone a develop
ment so extraordinary belong, however, to a numerous genus
without presenting any striking anomaly.
     I have thought it necessajy, for the benefit of naturalists
who apply to the study of natural relations, to insist on this
remark ; and I (hall terminate this memoir by another, which
in my opinion must prove interesting to the learned.

cess,   had approached nearly to the theory of electricity ; it is
at least probable that they referred to the fame cause the
fulminating effects of the torpedo, and those, much more ter
rible, of celestial electricity.    We can form no opinion of
their knowledge in natural history but by the names which
they have given to most of the productions of nature. These
names have been preserved without alteration; for it is only
to the æra when the sciences flourished in the East that we
must refer the rational nomenclature still employed by the
rude inhabitants of Egypt.          Every animal in that coun
try, as well as in books of natural history, has two names,
that of the genus and that of the species.          There is no ex
ception but in favour of the torpedo and the silurus electri-
cus. Every thing which related to the form of these fishes
has been neglected, and nothing has been attended to but
their astonishing faculty of striking with torpor all the small
marine and fresh water fiflies. Though very different, they
have been distinguished by the same name; and, what is very
remarkable, this name, rdad or raaj'ch, is that used to express
thunder.       In giving this denomination to the torpedo and
the silurus electricus, did the Arabs think of referring thg
phænomena of animal electricity to celestial electricity?

XXIII.        On Indian Dogs. By        Dr. Barton, of Philadelphia.
                             [Concluded from  p. 9.]
AT      is   highly probable that the Indian dog flill exists, in a
wild    state, in the woods of many parts or North America.
It is likely that when seen he has been sometimes mistaken
for the wolf.
    A very intelligent Indian informed me, that in the year
1792, when travelling towards the head waters of the river
Miami, which empties into lake Erie, he had met with
wolves which barked like does, though in other respects
they appeared to be little different from wolves. Perhaps
future researches will stiow that these were the real Indian
dogs in their wild stale.             The subject is worthy of further
inquiry.         If the Indian     dog be an hybrid animal, we ought
to suppose       that  he is  less  common in the woods than the ani
mals from whom he is sprung.                   Hybrids arc, in general,
more rare than original species.               This observation applies
 both to the animal and to the vegetable world.
     The late Mr. Peter Kalm informed Mr. John Bartram that
the dogs which he saw among the Indians of Canada " were
just like the dogs in Sweden, and that they had ears stiarp-
 pointed, and standing up like a wolf's. I can remember per
 fectly well (continues Mr. Bartram) that when I was a boy
 the Indians came frequently to our house.               Their dogs had
 sharp-pointed upright ears, and we used to think that they
 were of the wolf breed. Now, whether the Indians had their
 dogs from the Swedes, who fettled in Pennsylvania long before
 the Ei.giilu settled there, or whether the Indian dogs were
 natives of North America, and the fame kind as those in the
 north of Europe and Asia, is well worth inquiring*."
     The fact mentioned by Kalm, and the hint suggested by
 Mr. Bartram, have sometimes, for a moment, led me to be
 lieve that the wolf-like dog of the northern Indians may
 have been received from the Swedes, who formed a fettle-

ment in Pennsylvania early in the 17th century. But a little
consideration has compelled me to relinquish this idea : for it
is certain that the Indians were in possession of this breed of
dogs long before the arrival of the Swedes in America.
      We have already seen that the Spaniards found domesti
cated dogs among the Indians of Florida before the middle
of the 16th century, almost one hundred years earlier than
 the Swedish settlement in Pennsylvania.                 It is not, indeed,
 certain that these dogs were of the half- wolf breed ; but it
is probable that they were. In the year 1585 the celebrated
 navigator captain John Davis observed dogs
                                                            " with pricked
 cars" in the lands about Hudson's Bay*.                  It is highly pro
 bable that these dogs were a variety of the half-wolf breed of
 the Indians.          Captain John Smith, who arrived in Virginia
 in 1607, a few years before the Swedish settlement, expressly
 mentions the affinity of the Indian dogs in that country to
 wolves.        I might easily adduce other instances. These are
 sufficient for my purpose.           They evidently (how that the In
 dian dog existed in America before the Swedes planted their
  first colony in Pennsylvania: consequently, we have no diffi
  culty in answering Mr. Bartram's first question, which I have
  stated.
       Still, however, Kalm's observation is interesting. It leads
  us to suspect that the dog of the Indians is common to North
  America and to the northern parts of Europe. Neither should
  this circumstance, in whatever light we may view the original
  of the Indian dog, excite our surprise.              If, as very many of
   the traders and others suppose, this dog is the produce of the
   wolf and the common fox, his parents existed in the old as
   well as in the new world.            He may have been formed in
   America by the union of these two animals ; or he may have
   migrated into America from Europe along with many other
   animals, which, it is highly probable, owe their original to
   that portion of the globe, or to Asia.           For that America has
   received some of its animals (beside its human inhabitants)
   from Asia and from Europe, I have very little doubts.
       I conjecture it will be found that the dog of the Green-
                                          J

   variety of the Indian dog. And, perhaps, the dogs of the

 to the jackal, or schakal, will also prove to be of the same
 breed.    But with me these must remain, for some time, mere
conjectures.       For I am incapable of giving such a minute
description of the external and internal appearance of the
 Indian dog as would enable the naturalists or Europe to de
cide a question not the least curious in the zoology of the new
world.       In another work I hope to be able to give a much
more complete account of this animal than that which I now
communicate to the public.
    I have said that the Indian dog is a much more savage or
unreclaimed animal than the common dog which has been
Introduced into America from Europe *. This circumstance
has not escaped the notice of some preceding writers.               But  I
know    of    no writer who   has   deduced    from    it  so important a
conclusion as Mr. Zimmermann has done. This truly learned
naturalist, after remarking that the Europeans who have vi
nted America have considered the Indian dogs merely as
tamed wolves, proceeds to deduce the conclusion, that nei
ther America itself, nor its inhabitants, are so antient as the
countries or the people of other parts of the world t«
    This conclusion proceeds upon the notion, so ingeniously
defended by Mr. Zimmermann, that the dog of the old world
is merely the wolf reduced to a state of domestication, and
varied, both as to his external aspect and as to his essential
qualities or manners, by the influence of climate and other
physical causes, during the term of some thousand years %.
This subject is worthy of some of our attention. I regret,
however, that in this place I can only touch it in the most
superficial manner. This I shall do under the following seven
heads.
    I. I may observe, in the first place, that it is by no means
probable that the wolf is the sole parent or original stock
from whence have proceeded all the numerous varieties of
animals which go under the general appellation of dogs. I
think it much more probable that these varieties are derived
from several different stocks or sources beside the wolf; such
as the jackal, the hyæna, different kinds of foxes, he. &c.
In their inquiries into the genealogical history of the dog
kind, naturalists, by aiming at simplicity, have only tended
to involve the subject in confusion.            A comparative view of
the internal structure of the supposed parents of the dog kind,
and the dogs, has been too much neglected.               Some attention,

                        6                                       however,

                         On Indian Dogs.                            139
however, has been paid to this subject.          Essential differences
between the structure of the wolf and the dogs (I mean the
common dogs of the old world, for I know hot that any ana
tomist has hitherto inspected the structure of the Indian dog
of America) have been discovered; differences so essential,
that I think they forbid the idea that the wolf and the dog
are one and the same species.        I do not, however, deny that
the pure unmixed wolf has, in some countries, been reduced
to the domestic state of the dog.         But I think it more pro
bable, that even those dogs, which are most nearly allied to
the wolf, are hybrids, begotten between this animal and some
other species of the genus.
   II. From their agreement in internal structure, it is much
more probable that the jackal or schakal (the canis aureus) is
one of the principal original stocks of the dogs of the old
world. Professor Gueldenstaedt has remarked, that the cæcum
of the jackal " entirely agrees in form with that of a dog,
and differs from that of the wolf and fox."              " I may add
(fays  Mr.  Pennant,     whose  words      I have  been using), that
there is the fame agreement in the teeth with those of a dog,
and the same variation in them from those of the two other
animals *."     Moreover, in his manners the common dog is
much more allied to the jackal than he is to the wolf, or to
any other animal with which we are acquainted. If then
this animal, and not the wolf, be the principal parent of the
dog kind, the speculations of Mr. Zimmermann ought to
have little weight in establishing the position, that the con
tinents of America are a new creation, and their inhabitants
new possessors of the soil. For, I think the form of the In
dian dog is very considerably remote from that of the jackal,
which is not known to exist in any part of America.
   III. In order completely to establisli his opinion Mr. Zim
mermann should have proved that the dog is certainly derived
from the wolf.      I have just endeavoured to render it probable
that the wolf is not the parent of the dogs of the old world ;
and I formerly! gave some reasons for believing that the Indian
dog of America, notwithstanding the conjectures of Lawibn,
and other writers, is not the pure unmixed wolf, but an hy
brid, begotten between this and some other animal.
   IV. But in the old world there are dogs not perhaps
more completely domesticated,          or, in other words, nol more
thoroughly deprived of their savage aspect and manners, than
are the dogs of North America.            Such are the dogs of the
Kalmuck Tartars.        And who that attentively considers the
      *

  I+O                       On Indian Dogs.
  history of the country in which the Kalmuck? reside will be
  lieve that that country is a new creation ? Who will venture
  to conjecture that the Kalmucks themselves are a new people?
  Moreover, Kalm's observation would lead us to believe tl;?t
  the Indian dogs are the fame (and of course not more savage)
. as form: of the dogs in the north of Europe.
      V. Some animals are very easily brought into the domes
  ticated state.   Others are domesticated with great difficulty.
  Perhaps there are some incapable of domestication. If the
  Indian dog be the offspring of the wolf and the fox, or anv
  other animal, we ought not, perhaps, to wonder that he is still
  more an animal fjlvejlre than the generality of the dog? of
  the old world ; for both the wolf ancl the fox are with diffi
  culty tamed. In this inquiry we ought also to remember that
  the master of tlie Indian dog is a savage.         It may readily be
  conceived that this circumstan9e will influence the genius of
  our animal.     Living in the woods, and too frequently badly
  treated by his master, the dog must often leave the huts of
  the Indians, and, perhaps, imbibe from his parents, in the
  woods, a new tincture of theij aspect and their manners.
  Kven in our cultivated towns, how much do the manners of
  the dogs seem to depend upon the calling of their masters !
  It is a fact, that the dogs of our frontier settlere have a much
  more savage aspect than the dogs (the fame variety) in the
  villages and populous towns.
      VI. In America there were found some kinds of does
  which were not less domesticated than the dogs of the old
  world. Such were the alco and the itzcuintt-potiotli, of which
   I have already given some account. I think it very impro
  bable that these two species or varieties were derived from the
  wolf. Nor is it certain that they were not a species of canis
  essentially distinct from those of the old world.         In whatever
  light  we  view  them,  they  seem  to oppose   an  objection to Mr.
  Zimmermann's notion concerning the recent creation of
  America, and the recent population of this great portion of
  the globe. Could it be proved that the alco and the ilzai-
  intepotmtli have sprung from the wolf, it wou'd be natural to
  infer that an immense period of time had elapsed before these
  animals could have been brought into the mild, domesticated
  state in which the discoverers of America found them.
      VII. and lastly. This is not the place to inquire into the
  period of the population of America.           I have touched upon
  this question in another work * , and shall examine it more
   fully in a work in which I have long been engaged.              Here,

however,      I may observe, that many circumstances forbid the
idea that America is a new creation, recently emerged from
the influence of the ocean.               And circumstances, impressive
in their nature, render it extremely probable that many of
the nations of America have resided in this portion of the
world for some thousand years.               Trying them by their lan
guages,     the  Americans       will  appear to be children of the ear
liest human families of which history or the traditions of
mankind have preserved any memorials.
     Among the almost innumerable charges which have been
brought against the Indian inhabitants of America, there is
one which it becomes the historian of Indian dogs to take
some notice of.          The Indians are accused of great severity or
cruelty in the treatment of their dogs.                Mr. Lawson savs the
savages are the
                       " worst dog-masters in the world, so that it
is an infallible cure for fore eyes ever to fee an Indian's dog
fat *."      I have already made mention of this respectable tra
veller's notion of the process by which he supposed wolves are
turned into dogst.            The faithful father Charlevoix fays, the
 Indians feed their dogs " but poorlv, and never fondle
 them J." Carver, who so frequently borrows from Charle
 voix, fays nearly the fame thing §.                 It is even said, that,
 owing to their scanty allowance of food, the Indian dogs are
often so weak, that they are obliged to lean against a tree, or
 some other prop, whilst they bark.
     It is well known how much ingenuity, eloquence, and sci
ence, have, within the last fihy years, been employed to rc-
prelent the Americans as the degenerated, or imperfectly or
ganized, children of the earth. To complete the large vo
lume of calumny against these poor people, even the manner
in which they treat their dogs is not suffered to pass unnoticed
by the historians of the new world.
                                                     " Prior to their inter
course    with    the    people of Europe," says the eloquent Dr.
Robertson,       "   the   North Americans had some || tame dogs,
which accompanied them in their hunting excursions, and
served them wjth all the ardour and fidelity U peculiar to the
species.      But, instead of that fond attachment which the
hunter naturally feels towards those useful companions of his

 toils, they requite their services with neglect, seldom              seed  and
 never caress them      *."
     It would, I    believe, be a much easier task to prove that
 Dr. Robertson      was unqualified to write the history of Ame
 rica ; to prove that the Indian Americans are not the infe
 riors of the people of the old world in the measure of their
 intellectual endowments ; and to sliow that more than one-
 half of  the charges which have               been    brought against these
 people   are charges resulting from            ignorance or from system
 atic zeal, than to prove that the              Indians arc peculiarly en
 titled to the character of kind and            tender dog-masters. After"
 some attention to this subject, I must candidly confess that I
 possess not materials for a satisfying defence of the Indian.
 The charges which have been brought against him by the
 writers whom I have mentioned will be convictive.                          But
 why, in this inquiry, if the historian will condescend to
mention the fact, and to interweave it with his eloquence,
 should he forget the hardstiips of the savage life ? Where the
master labours under a scarcity of food, his servants, the ani
mals which depend upon him for their subsistence, must stiare
in the hardstiips and the evils of his state. The miserable
condition of the Indian dogs is a necessary result of the mi
serable condition of the Indians themselves.                 This is certain ;
though    the  Indians    tell  us that   they    keep  their  dogs poor that
they may     be  light  and    nimble,     and    therefore   thehetter  fitted
for the purposes of hunting.
     Dr. Robertson, however, might have found, in the writings
of some of the authors whom he has repeatedly quoted, men
tion made of the tenderness which the Indians manifested to
wards their does in some parts of America. The following
passage in Acotta sliould not have escaped the historian's no
tice. Speaking of the alco, the learned Jesuit says: " The
Indians doe so love these little dogges that they will spare
their meate to feede them, so as when they travell in the'
countrie they carric them with them upon their shoulders or
in their bosomes, and when they are ficke they keepe them
with them, without any use, but only for company f."
Hence it appears, that of one species or variety of their
dogs, the Indians, in some parts of the new world, were pe
culiarly careful, and even solicitously tender.

      If the affinity between the'Wunaumeeh words, mo-e-kan-
  neb, me-kan-ne, and the Latin canis, the Italian cane, the
  Neapolitan caw, be not accidental, and who, attentively con
  sidering the very many affinities that subsist between the lan
  guages of the old and new world, will imagine that it is acci
  dental?), we have probably arrived at the knowledge of the
   real meaning of the Latin word canis. Mekanne, in the lan
  guage of the Delawares, signifies "the barking beast."            It
  appears from Dr. Pallas's great work (Vocabularia Corns ara-
   tiva) that certain tribes of Semoyads call a dog kanang, ka~
  nak, and konak j and that the Karaslini call it iannak.
   XXIV. A Jbort          Account of the Improvement in Circular  Ar
                   chitecture made by Colonel     Tat ham.
    s OR        this invention, which appears to be ingenious, and
   applicable to many important uses, a patent has been takea
   out by Messrs. John Scott, James Clarkson, William Ta-
   tham, and Samuel Mellish. The invention consists in the
'
   form given to the bricks or stones to be employed in circular
    buildings, which is such as to make them lock, as it were,
    into each other, and that so effectually as to preclude the pos
    sibility of their parting joint by any accident whatever when
    laid down properly.
       Two os the vertical sides of each piece employed in such cir
    cular structures answer to two radii from a common centre ;
    a circle from the same centre forms the third vertical side ;
    and the fourth side is formed by another circle of a radius as
                                                                 much

 144
              ji Jbort Account of the Improvement
 much shorter than the last, whatever that may be, as the
  thickness intended for the wall : they are, in fact, wedge-
 formed.      This is so precisely the case, that where the pieces
  (to  which   the patentees have given the name of Tatbam's
 clumps) are intended to form solid pillars, or the like, they
 exhibit only the three first-mentioned vertical sides.
     The horizontal, or under and upper fides of the clumps,
 have a kind of stiouldering or protruding part, and a corre
 sponding hollow or depressed part to sit the similar parts of
 the next course, and these are at the same time so adjusted
 that each course will break joint with the one before laid ;
 that  is, the vertical joinings of every row fall on the middle
of the clumps which form the one below and the one above it.
     The form given to the shoulderings or joggelings    is   soin
geniously contrived, that, were      a   cylinder formed of these
dumps, with the two extreme circles tied together        by  means
of long bolts pasting up the centre, secured      byscrews or other
fastenings,  it  might be laid upon its side and employed as       a
garden roller, without the possibility of any one of the clumps
falling out of its place.
    It is easy to see that" this contrivance applicable to va
                                             is               a

 on the side in view ; b is one with the female point inwards
 on the reverse of the same clump.

 female point outwards.        Each of these figures, 1 and 2, re
 present different kinds of clumps, which being laid, one kind
 at a time, in a circular form, with the fame sides uppermost,
 will make one course : see fig. 5. for an example of one course
of clumps, fig. t, a. Then add one course of fig. 2, fitted in
male and female (or joggled) ; and so on alternate circles,
 fig. t and fig. 2, to the end of the length designed, termi
nating the fame with a cast iron plate, staunch piece, or key
 clump, with two male fides so as to admit of taking down
for repairs, fee. This method will form a broken joint, such
as the one exhibited in perspective view fig. 9.
     Fig. 3. is an elongated clump for forming solid columns,
colonnades, fee.; a having its male point inwards, and b hav
ing its female point inwards.
     Fig. 4. a clump- elongated as in fig. 3. a sliows the view
with the male point outwards : b the reverse of the fame
clump, with the female point outwards.           These clumps are
to be laid into each other in the fame manner as fig. 1 and 2,
to form a column of solid work, of which a section is repre
sented in fig. 8. 1/ it is intended to construct a circular stair
case with dome-light,       fee. on this principle, one or more
clumps in each course of work (be the fame of brick, earth,
stone, or other material, acebrding to the design and extent,)
must be of the long kind, to form the Jlep of the stairs; all
the rest of short clumps, fig. 1 and 2, to admit light and ac
cess through the aperture of a spiral ascent.
     Fig. 5. a, a, a, shows the position of clumps a, sig. 1, ac
cording to the mode of laying them, with the male point in
wards : b, b, b, shows the reverse of the same clump with the
female point inward. The bottom circle in this and the next
figure shows merely the position which a continuation of the
clumps would take.

M'.creTy for laving the first course on the ground, or, in some
 instances, for saving the expense of a cast iron rim next the
Haunch of a branch piece.         Their reverse must be always in
dented, or joggled, to fit the next course of clumps.        If it is

 required to form a flush edge, such as the cheek of a window
 or door, it can be done by cutting down the clumps into half
 clumps, as represented by the dotted line X,X, fig. 9.          Ra-
 viels, rabbits, grooves, &c, and returns of corners, elliptics,
 &c. must be specifically moulded on the same principle ; or
girders, ties, &c, may secure any variation by means of suit
able cast iron clamps, modified according to the particular
contingency.

can be fitted to blank fides next the flaunch, and the opposite
end of the bolt can be counter-funk into perforated clumps,
having the prominent ends fitted with a male and female
screw, in order to slide the flaunch piece in or out as occasion
demands.

XXV.  On the Freezing Point of Tin, and the Boiling Point
   of Mercury; -with a Description of a Self- registering Ther
  mometer invented by Mr. James Crichton,               of Glas
  gow*.
OOME       time aeo, having made some high ranged thermo
meters,    Iwished" to try their correspondence    at nigh tempe
ratures.   I procured for this purpose 1^ pound of the best
essayed tin (block),   and, after suspending two thermometers
upon a sliding support, I melted the tin in a heat of from 200
to 300 above the melting point : I then lowered my thermo
meters down into the metal, and observed the mercury to sink
gradually in both till it arrived at 44a0; then it instantly sunk
to 4390, and as instantaneously      rose to 4420.   At this tem
perature the mercury remained perfectly stationary for five
minutes, at which time the metal became solid to the centre
of the crucible.    After observing this fact, which to me was
new, [ waited upon Dr. Mickleham, and requested that he
would be present when 1 should repeat the experiment, to
assist me in discovering the fallacy, if there was any.       We
then procured, from another work, the fame quantity of tin
as before, and repeated the experiment several times with the
fame result.
   Another accurate standard point, that of 4420, for adjust
ing thermometers, has thus been ascertained ; a circumstance
which, judging by the use it will be of to myself in construct
ing high ranged thermometers, I think too important 10 be
withheld from chemists and others who may wish to avail
themselves of it.
   Before [ quit the subject of mercurial thermometers I beg
to state another fact which may also be of use to the philoso
phical world.    Quicksilver does not boil at 600", but at 6^^3
at the lowest.   The precise point I have not yet found leisure
enough     to ascertain.
   I (hall now     describe
                          a registering  thermometer fit for me
teorological purposes,   which   I have  lately  invented and con
structed, and which some of inv friends have requested me to
make public.     Its action depends on the different degrees of
expansibility of different metals when exposed to a change of
temperature. (See Plate III.)
   The length of the instrument is about 13 inches. Fig. t.

ters   of   reference are the fame in both, where they can be ap
plied.
   The bar A, of which the side BC is of iron, and the other
DE   of zinc, is about one inch broad, a quarter of an inch
thick, and eight inches in length. It is firmly fixed, at the
lower extremity I, to a board «,b,c,d, made or mahogany.
   On the application of heat, this bar, by the superior ex
pansion of the zinc, is inclined at the top towards B. In the
upper end of the bar there is a pin (seen at A, fig. a.) which
goes into the fork-like opening L of the index LM (fig. 1.),
and carries the short end of this index along with it; conse
quently the long end is carried along the scale from o° to
wards ioo3.
    When the instrument is exposed to a lower temperature,
the movement is exactly the reverse of what I have been de
scribing.
    Beneath the index LM are two others on the fame axis G,
one of which can be carried towards the right, and the other
towards the left, by means of a pin which goes through the
first-mentioned index at H. By this means, the greatest and
lowest degree of temperature that occurs from the time the
thermometer is set or adjusted till it be again consulted, is
accurately marked.
    In adjusting the thermometer for observation, all that is
necessary is to bring the two small indexes immediately be
low the broad one.       As the last-mentioned one is moved
backwards or forwards by variations of temperature, it carries
one or other of the small ones along with                  by
                                                    means of the
                                                     it,

the lowest degree that may have occurred from the last time
 of adjustment.

1st.   So  much has been alreadv said in regard to ants and
their at id, that appears nothing more remains to be added

                   On the Chemical Nature     of Ants.           149
on the subject.        Since the time that Samuel Fislier first de
scribed this acid in 1670, and taught a method of obtaining
it by distillation, till ciyzen Deyeux confirmed by exact ex
periments the identity of the acid of ants with the acetous
acid, (an identity first announced in 1749 by Margraff,         then
in   1777 by    A rd vision and Oehrn,    and afterwards   by Berg
man,) all that chemists have done on this subject seems merely
to be, that some of them have maintained the supposed ana
logy; while others have wished that this analogy should be
only apparent, and that the formic acid should be considered
as    a  peculiar acid Ju'i generis.     I do -not speak here of the
opinion     of Thouvenel,    who   pretended that the acid of ants
was the phosphoric acid, because this opinion was supported
by no positive fact : I thought it might be still useful to re
sume the analysis of ants ; and the reader will find that, hav
 ing been employed in this research with C. Vauquelin, it pre
sented to us some facts which had escaped our predecessors.
     2d. Having cleaned the ants which were collected in the
Wood of Boulogne, and of that kind called by Linnæus fir-
mica rufa, they were bruised in a marble mortar.              During
this operation a vapour was disengaged of an odour so sharp
 and pungent that it hurt the eyes, and could be compared to
 nothing but the acetic acid or radical vinegar.
     3d. The ants thus bruised were put to macerate in alcohol
 for several days, and in a temperature of about 68 or 70 de
 grees the alcohol assumed a yellow colour.
    4th. The alcoholic infusion of ants subjected to distillation
 furnished an inflammable liquor slightly acid. During the
 distillation there was formed in the liquor a brownish deposit
  which was collected on a filter.
     5th. The acid liquor which remained after distillation,
  when filtered and separated from the deposit, was saturated
  with lime.     It then became brown, thick, and acquired a
  nauseous and pungent savour.          By blowing through a tube
  into the thick liquor there was formed a multitude of bub
  bles, which exhibited the fame prismatic colours as soap
   bubbles.
     6th. This combination of the acid of ants with lime, when
  subjected to the test of different re-agents, exhibited the fol
  lowing phænomena :
     a. Mixed with concentrated sulphuric acid it exhaled the
  odour of vinegar.
      b. With nitrate of lead it gave an abundant white precipi
  tate.
     c.  With nitrate of silver a yellowish precipitate.
      d.  With muriate of barytes there was nothing sensible.

  1,5°      >         On  the Chemical Nature of Ants.
      e. Ammonia produced no change in it.
     f. Alcohol formed a ropy and ductile precipitate.
      7th. A part of the thick liquor being; mixed with half a
  part of concentrated sulphuric acid tnd two parts and a half
  of water, there was immediately formed a very thick magma.
  This mixture was subjected to distillation, and the products-
  was divided into three parts.              They were all clear and co
  lourless : they had an empyreurnatic odour, and a very strong
  acid taste.
      The' residuum of this distillation had acquired a very dark
  brown colour, and a disagreeable burnt taste, though it had
  not been carried to dryness.
      The first product tried with acetitc of lead gave no signs
  of the presence of the sulphuric acid : the second and third
  gave the same result ; which proves that they contained no
  sulphuric acid.
      This acid distilled and combined with potafli furnistied real
  acetite of potash which attracted the moisture of the air; ex
  haled, bv the addition of concentrated sulphuric acid, a strong
  vapour like that of radical vinegar; and in a solution of ni
  trate of mercury formed a flaky precipitate like common ace
  tite of potash.
      The greater     part then of the acid of ants is acetous acidj as
  C. Deyeux has already proved by a careful analysis and expe
  riments*.
      8th, The calcareous combination of the acid of ants, ob
 tained by infusing them in alcohol, exhibited to us a very
  remarkable character.            In a solution of acetite of lead it
  formed    a   very abundant deposit, which was redissolved by
     * Bergman had found in it some resemblance to the acid of vinegar;

  the solution above described, No. 7.
      As this experiment shows that the acid taken from the ants
  hy alcohol, and combined with lime, contained something
  else than acetous acid, since this calcareous           salt precipi
 tated acetite of lead ; and as this different matter was not vo
 latile, since the product of the distillation with sulphuric acid
 did not produce the same effect, we tried to find it again in
 the residuum of the distillation : but this residuum contained
 so much sulphuric acid that it was impossible for us to suc
 ceed ; we therefore had recourse to the following experiment.
      9th. A part of the combination of the formic acid with
 lime was mixed with a solution of nitrate of lead, and there
 was immediately formed a very abundant precipitate of a yel
 lowish colour, which when put upon burning coals, after hav
 ing been well washed and dried, became immediately black,
 exhaled an animal and ammoniacal odour, while the lead was
 reduced to a metallic state.
     Sulphuric acid diluted with about six parts of water was
 poured over this precipitate reduced to fine powder.          At the
moment of mixture the powder remained at the surface of
the liquor as if it had been a fat substance, and it did not be
 come mixed with sulphuric acid till aster long agitation.
      When the mixture was well made the volume of the pre
 cipitate was diminished : it became heavier and whiter. The
liquor then had a flight acid and saccharine savour, which
was destroyed by the addition of the sulphuric acid, and was
soon succeeded by a nauseous savour.           It precipitated slightly
muriate of barvtes, which indicates some traces of sulphuric
acid.       It precipitated lime water only very weakly; but at
the end of some hours there were formed a great many crys
tals at the surface of the liquor, and on the sides of the glass
containing the mixture.
     It precipitated in abundance nitrate of mercury, and those
of    silver and lead.
     Combined with barvtes it gave a reddish solution of a saline
and pungent savour.           This combination reduced to a small
volume did not crystallize ; a slight pellicle only was formed
at its surface.        Potash did not separate the barytes from this
combination, but the alkaline carbonate produced a precipi
tation. The oxalic acid formed in it a very abundant deposit,
but the tartarous and citric acids produced in it no change.
     loth. The facts here detailed indicate to us that the matter
combined with lime along with the acetous acid was of the
nature of the malic acid ; but to be more certain we exa
mined it comparatively with the latter, combining1 both of

them with the fame substances.           Without here entering into
a tiresome account of these comparative experiments, we shall
content ourselves with saying that these two compounds ex
hibited phænomena absolutely similar.
    Ants contain then, and consequently form, malic acid, like
vegetables.      It is no doubt the presence of this acid which
had misted the chemists whp preceded us in this labour.
While they acknowledged in the acid of ants a great analogy
with vinegar, they however found differences which induced
them to consider it as a particular acid; and these differences
arose from the presence of the malic acid in the acetous acid
of   ants.
    Distillation  of  the Vrodud     of Ants treated -with Alcohol.
     nth. The ants, exhausted by alcohol, furnished a limpid
and slightly alkaline water, a reddisti brown oil, thick and
exceedingly foetid.       The first liquor, -diluted with water, and
filtered to separate the oil, produced a slight effervescence
with acids.
    As it emitted at the fame time an odour of vinegar, easily
distinguished amidst the fœtidness by which it was accom
panied, a certain quantity of it mixed with sulphuric acid was
distilled, and we obtained a colourless acid product of an em-
pyreumatic odour, which contained a small quantity of ace
tous acid.      Was this acetous acid completely formed in the
¦nts exhausted by alcohol, or was it formed by the action of
the fire   ?
    The product of      the distillation of the exhausted ants con
tained then a foetid empyreumatic oil, carbonate of ammo
nia, and acetite of ammonia, all dissolved in a large mass of
water.
Examination of the Matter which separated from the Alcohol
             during the Dijiillati'M mentioned in No. 4.
     12th. The reader will remember that the alcoholic infusion
subjected to distillation suffered to be deposited a brown sub
 stance which had been separated from it by the filter.          This
substance was of so dark a red colour that when seen in a largt
mass it appeared to be black: when dried it was brittle, its
 fracture was smooth and brilliant like that of resin, it had no
 sensible savour, it was not soluble in water; and this may
 serve to explain its precipitation in proportion as the alcohol
 evaporated.      Though insoluble in water, when macerated a
 Ions; time in that fluid it communicated to it a slight fawn
 colour, owing, in all probability, to a small quantity of ex-
 tr*ilive«matter interposed between its parts.

     Alcohol (lightly    heated over this substance dissolved the
           part  ofit.  It  assumed a pretty dark red colour : there
   owever remained a brownish matter, which did not com
freater
bine with that liquid whatever quantity of it was added. This
alcoholic solution became milky by the addition of water, and
at the end of some days there was separated a resin-like de
posit soft and ropv, of a reddish colour and a very disagree
able nauseous taste, slightly soluble in water, since it commu
nicated to it a little ot the colour and of the nauseous taste.
This deposit is a fat matter of a peculiar nature.
     The brownish matter not dissolved by alcohol, already men
 tioned, appeared to us lo be albumen, which the moisture,
 and perhaps the acid contained in the ants, contributed to
 render soluble in alcohol.       This albumen was coagulated by
 the heat, and precipitated with the fat matter in proportion
 as the alcohol was volatilized.         When placed on burning
 coals it decrepitated,      became corneous, swelled, and puffed
 up, emitting white foetid ammoniacal fumes : it left on the
 support a large and light charcoal.          It was in no manner
 soluble in water; it contained a little hydrogenated carbon,
  which gave it a brownisli colour.
      13th. A portion of the ants exhausted by the action of al
  cohol was subjected to distillation in an open fire. There re
  mained a charcoal, which, like all those of animal substances,
  burnt with difficulty, and left, after long combustion, white
  ashes, which contained nothing but phosphate of lime.
      This was proved by treating it with nitric acid, which dis
  solved the greater part of it without effervescence, and by add
  ing to the solution ammonia, which formed in it a white ge
  latinous deposit which exhibited all the properties of phos
  phate of lime.
      The portion of ashes which did not dissolve in the acid was
  silex ; but as the incineration had taken place in an earth
  crucible, this substance arose, in all probability, from that
  vessel.    However, to ascertain whether this earth had been
   really furnished by the crucible, some of this charcoal was
   burnt in small portions in a crucible of platina until we ob
   tained a quantity of ashes sufficient to be subjected to exa
   mination, and the following result was obtained : — 150 parts
   of charcoal of ants were reduced in an ignited platina cruci
   ble, at the end of several hours, to a 2 parts of alhes j 14 parts
   of these ashes were dissolved by nitric acid; the eight parts
   not dissolved were sand mixed at first with the ants.
       It results from this experiment that the osseous skeleton of
    ants is formed, like that of warm-blooded animals, of phos»
   phate of lime.      It is not improbable that the long and strong

      14th.    results from this analysis that ants are formed of
              It

 pound    is  mixed with phosphate of lime, which constitutes
 the solid part or the skeleton of the insect.             Ants, besides the
 preceding compound, contain             pretty large
                                              a            quantity  of resin,

 appears, exist in them in          very alarge     quantity   and in    very-                 a

that acetous acid continually exudes and distills, as we may
 fay, from these animals; for they leave traces of                    on the          it

    15th, In regard to the malic acid which in ants accompa
nies the acetous acid. We (hall terminate this memoir by
a general remark on the existence of this acid in organic
 compounds.
    Few vegetable acids are so generally and so abundantly
diffused throughout nature as the malic acid ; and, though it
has not been long known in comparison of many others, it
has been discovered in a multitude of substances, and its
properties have been carefully studied.
    It has been found in fruits with feeds, with stones, and in
a great number of berries.
    It exists in a multitude of plants in the state of malate of
lime. The joubarbes, crassula, and cotyledons, mesembryan-
themum, sedum, and even aloes, contain more or less consi
derable quantities of            it,
                              according to the analysis made by
C. Vauquelin, and inserted in the Annales de Cbimie.
     It   found in abundance in the liquor which
          is                                                     is

     It  not vegetables only that continually give birth to the

malic acid: animals are equally susceptible of producing                       it:
it    in the class of insects in particular that this property
     is                                                                         is

     It appears that the malic acid         in some measure the

less oxygen than they do.        Tt is that of all the vegetable or
animal acids which retains in the fullest manner the nature
of the animal or vegetable substance from which it has been
formed ; it is that which is decomposed with the greatest ease
by the action of the fire.      Preceding all the vegetable acids,
by ulterior and successive elaborations it produces the tarta-
reous, citric, oxalic, and acetous acids : it is by losing a part
of its radicals, which are converted into water and carbonic
acid by atmospheric oxygen, that it passes itself to the state
of these other acids ; ana though none of the latter but the
acetous acid has yet been found in animals, there is reason
to believe that all the rest will be found.
    The malic acid is then formed bv living plants : it often
exists in them in its full purity : sometimes it is found in
them united to lime, and no doubt to potash, according to
the nature of the circumstances which accompany its forma
tion.    It is also farmed during the life of certain animals,
particularly in ants, and certainly in many other insects : in
a word, it is produced by the action of the nitric and the oxy
genated muriatic acids on animal and vegetable compounds.
    Nature then, every time it can dispose of the necessary
principles, tends to form malic acid ; and there is no reason
to doubt, that if plants were examined when very young, at
which lime they are all acid, the malic acid would always
be found present in them.          These successive changes after
wards give birth to the other acids already mentioned, and
which may be found by further analyses in animals, as it has
been, found in vegetables*

on you and on your readers a subject which may appear, on
first view, to have little claim to general attention.        If the
rights and privileges of an individual were alone involved on
this occasion, I mould not have requested a place in your
Magazine for the following statement.         But it is surely mat
ter of general concern, that the appropriation of inventions
and improvements (hould be dealt, with strict justice, to their
authors : for the prospect of this distribution of " honour
where it is due" is one of the most animating principles of
action ; and the extinction of this motive would certainly fol

low an indifference, on the part of the public, to the claims
of inventors.
    More than fifteen years ago, during the delivery of a course
of lectures, by my father, in thi- town, he had occasion to
notice a property of the radical vinegar, or acetic acid, which
had not, to his knowledge, been before observed ; viz. its pro
perty of dissolving camphor and various essential oils.     The
compound was found to possess a most pungent and agreeable
odour, and as the vinaigre des quatre voleurs had gained
much reputation in obviating infection, it occurred to him.
 that the newly discovered solution would have still more
 powerful effects in consequence of its high state of concen
 tration.   A bottle of this preparation he gave to a late active
 magistrate and philanthropist (J. B. Bayley, Esq. F.R.S.),
 who, in the course of an unwearied and undaunted exercise
 of hi? public function, was frequently exposed to the danger
 of foul and infected air. Mr. Bayley was highly gratified
 with its effects, and not only made constant use of the aro
 matic vinegar on the bench, and on his visits to the prison,
 but introduced it to the adoption of several os the judges and
  principal gentlemen at the bar. He also first suggested to
  my father the propriety of benefiting by his discovery, and
  was the medium or a connection with Mr. Bayley, perfumer,
  in Cockfpur-llreet, London, which has continued to the pre
sent day.
   The aromatic vinegar, like every other article in general
demand, has been a frequent subject of imitation.        But it is
not of this that I complain; for, in consequence of unremit
ting attention, our preparation has maintained a decided su
periority over all others, both as to quality and extent of sale.
The occasion of this appeal to your readers          is,
                                                      that one of
these imitations has lately been sanctioned     bythe name of               a
respectable physician, who, though not expressly, yet          im    by
plication,  has conferred   on another the credit of that  inven
tion, which,     injustice, belongs to my father. (See       letter

 dent that he was ignorant of any prior claim        ;and he was
 therefore made acquainted    by my father, in the most respect
 ful terms, with the facts which have already been laid before
 you. To this letter the doctor has made no reply, though he
declared verbally to   a  medical gentleman, that my father's
 preparation  had  never  happened to fall in his way; but that,
ifit  had, he should with equal readiness have given testimony
                                                                            in

behalf of a man who has imitated the original only in copy

by myself.
    I believe there are few of your readers who will not agree
with me, that the ordinary forms of civility required that
Dr. Trotter should have taken further notice of the letter
addressed to him ; that such an attention ought to have been
paid to one of the oldest practitioners of medicine in this
country ; and that more respect was due to a man (whom I
 trust it is not unbecoming in me to characterize, in terms al

                       Department    of Ardennes.
  A.  HERE       are no coal mines known in this department.
    Researches have been made at Etion, but without success.
They were begun in schistous strata, which exhibited no in
dication sufficient to cause the labour to be continued ; and
the manner in which they were conducted was calculated
only to produce loss, since those who directed it followed the
course of the schistous strata, instead of traversing them to
discover the changes, if there were any, in the order of the
strata.
    This department receives coals from that of Ourthe, which
are conveyed to it up the Meuse.
                        Department    of Arriege.
    This country (7), abundant in metallic substance?, and
particularly in iron mines of an excellent quality, possesses no
coal mines worked.

                    Coal Mines woried in France.               159
tleflos,  distinguished by his knowledge and his zeal for im
proving the iron manufactory, has announced indications of
coal at Montesquieu near Foix ; and Duhamel, the engineer,
has found some also at Mas-'dAzil.
                         Department    of Aube.
   No coal mines are worked in Aube : the general composi
tion of the strata of the earth, which exhibit only chalk or
beds of shells, affords no reason to conceive any hope of dis
covering collections of this combustible mineral, unless it be
at great denhs, and after having traversed the whole thick
ness of the beds of chalk and shells.
    It receives no coals but those which are conveyed on the
Seine, or which are carried up by La Marne and the river
Aube.
                         Department of Aude.
    Coals are found in the neighbourhood of Cascastel (8),
Quintillan, Ruchan, and the mountains of Fabrezan.
    The mines worked near Cascastel, Quintillan, and Segur,
furnish about 14000 myriagrammes of fuel per annum.
    The products of the other mines are not known, nor do
we possess any certain information respecting the price at
which the coals are fold.         It is probably very low, because
there is very little consumption for these mines.
    The proprietors complain loudly of the roads, and wish
they were repaired ; which would facilitate the transportation
of coals to Perpignan.
    It would be useful also, if it were possible, to provide
 means for conveying the products of the mines of Fabresan
 to the banks of the Aude.
                        Department of Aveyron.
    This department (9) is one of the most abundant in coal
mines.       It is interesting also on account of several other mi
 neral substances, and particularly of those proper for supply
 ing sulphates of alumine and of iron (common alum and
 green copperas), which are found there in great plenty in the
 cantons of Milhau, Saint- Affrique, and several others.
    The collections of coal known near Cranfac, Vialarets,
 Livignac, and Montignac, and the neighbouring places on
the ^orders or at a little distance from the river Lot, are inex
 haustible, and for the most part can be very easily extracted.
     In the year 3 these mines produced above 500,000 myria
 grammes, and the price was not more than five cents per
                                                             myria

   160                A general   View of the
  myriagramme.      At present it is no more than one cent for
  the fame quantity delivered at the mine, but delivered at
  Villefranche they cost from la to 15 cents.
     These coal mines can furnish a long time for an immense
 consumption, especially if more care were taken in working
 them. The proprietors of the superficial foil attack them on
 all sides, and with the greater ease, as the strata and collec
 tions of the coal are uncovered, or are generally met with at
 a small depth ; so that the whole of this country presents a
 multitude of pits begun at the surface, and abandoned when
 t he water or shaking of the ground excites a fear of some ac
 cident.
     Besides the waste which results from this bad method
 of working, and the obstacles it creates for the future, the
 carelessness and negligence of the workmen have given rife in
 this country to a destructive scourge which daily increases its
 ravages.
    Strata of coal have been set on fire at Fontaignes, Moitot,
 and in several other places.   The conflagration spreads, and
is fed even in the bosom of the earth. The calcined sur
face of the ground for a considerable extent exhibits nothing
but the arid and distressing picture of the absence of all ve
getation and of the existence of all life.
    The places already mentioned in the neighbourhood of
Lot, and in the canton of Cransac, are not the only ones in
this department where coal mines are found ; some are known
also in the neighbourhood of Milhaud, on the borders of the
Dourbie; at Megamel and Lavergne in the county of Seve-
rac; at Bertholene, and at Senfac in the environs of Rhodez.
A new mine has been opened in the last-mentioned place
this year by the care of the prefect.
    The annual product of the coals worked in these different
places amounts to 220,000 mvriagrammes, and might be
tendered much more considerable.
    C. Saint-Thorent, prefect of Aveyron, has been convinced
of the importance of turning to advantage the different kinds
of mineral riches with which this country abounds, and he has
consequently resolved to carry thither that knowledge and ac
tivity, by the help of which this department may become one
of the most interesting in regard to the products of national in
dustry. This magistrate had requested that an engineer might
be sent thither j and C. Blavier, the person employed for,that
purpose, soon discovered, not only the existence of several
mineral substances never before found in these countrie.1:, but
the speedy means of working them, and of giving rife to very

obtained permission, for this engineer to be settled at Avey-
ron, charged merely with the direction of this department.
   C. Saint-Thorent has already taken measures to facilitate
the communications and to increase the number of the high
ways in this country, which is in want of sufficient means of
circulation.     The utility of rendering the Lot navigable for
boats above Cahors has not escaped him.                 The indifference
which has been shown, and the delay which has taken
place in the execution of this project, must surprise all those
who are acquainted with the immense collections of excel
lent coal which might be dug up on the banks of that river
towards Aubin, Livinhac, and Bousquet, and who consider
the valuable advantages which might result from establishing
an easy mode of conveyance for these coals to the departments
of Lot, Lot and Garonne, and as far as Rochelle and Bour-
dcaux, where the products of these rich mines would banish
the use of foreign coals, or at least render the introduction
of  them unnecessary.
              Department of the Mouths of the Rhone.
   The only part of this department (10) which has hitherto
given rife to the extraction of coal is that of the south-east,
near to the department of Var.            The coal mines are situated
in particular in the environs of the communes of Gardanne,
Fureau, Tretz, Peynier, Belcodene, Saint-Savournin, Auriac,
Roquevaire, and Gemenas.
   The greater part of these mines are badly worked, by the
proprietors of the ground, or by renters who enter into an en
gagement with them for permission to dig in their lands. The
pits are never carried to a great depth : they are abandoned
on the least obstacle which occurs in the course of the labour,
which in general is not very safe for the workmen.
   These coal mines are found in ground covered by calca
reous strata, which are even often mixed with carbonate of
lime.     The coals are of a moderate quality, especially for the
purpose os forges. They do not cake, and form a hollow fire.
It appears, however, that the iron masters of the country find
means to employ them ; but it is only with difficulty.
   The quantity of the coal extracted in this country is esti-
   * C. BUritr has discovered mines of
                                         copper and of lead, new indication*
of coal, and, in paicicular, a very rich and very abundant iion mine, dif
fused over an extent of more than two chiliomerers, in the neighbourhood
of the coal mine of Senfac, near Rhodez. This discovery willgive rise to
the establishment of founderics, for which the coals will be employed.    He
hat found also considerable dep6ts of turf tu several parts of this departs
ment.

mated at about 330,000 myriagrammes annually. The mean
price is from 8 to 10 cents per myrisgranime delivered at the
pits. The principal places of consumption are Aix, Mar
seilles, and the neighbourhood.         They are transported by
land carriage in carts.
   These coals easily pulverise.       They must not be long left
exposed    to the air.   When    they have been totallv reduced
to dust by the action of the atmosphere, or the effect of car
riage, they lose almost entirely their combustible property.
   The very high price of wood in this country ought to pro
duce much greater care in the working of these coal mines.
It  is probable that better products would be obtained ; and
even in cafe the lower strata sliould not present coal of the
best quality, the longer continuance of the extraction might
be ensured.
   Subterranean fires have already destroyed a part of the
strata of the coals of this country, and particularly at a place
called la Galere; at another mine not far distant the strata took
sire, and have been burning for several years.
                       Department of Calvados.
   A coal mine (11) is worked in the commune of Litry, in
the canton of Baynes. It furnishes from four to five millions
of myriagrammes of coal of the best quality, the greater part
of which is consumed in the country. A considerable quan
tity, however, is exported by the port of Isigny ; and this
mine, during the war, was a valuable resource to the ports of
Cherhourg, Havre, and Honrleur at the mouth of the Seine;
and for the manufactories of arms which were put in a state
of activity at Saint-Valery-fur-Somme. The price of coals
at the mine varies from 12 to 25 cents, according to its
quality.
    Great praise is due to the renters of the mine of Litry, who
use every exertion to give proper activity to this enterprise.
In the year 9 they erected there a steam-engine, which ex
hausts the water and at the fame time draws up the coals.
This machine was constructed by C. Perrier. Ii answers the
 purpose exceedingly well.        It saves at this mine eighteen
 horses daily ; and consumes         about 50 myriagrammes of
 coals. It is much to be wished that the useful example set
 by the renters of the mine of Litry were imitated in other
 enterprises of a similar kind.     I have been assured that the
 renters of the mines of Anzin, in the department of the
 North, are going to erect similar engines at their works.
    The coal mine of Litry is the only one now worked in the
 department of Calvados. Searches have been made in several
                                                          place?,

    The Vezere, which begins to be navigable at Uzerche,
and La Correze at Tulles, furnish some means of transporta

I  some time since troubled you *, a more extended view of
the subject from the hands of an ingenious friend.              If the
insertion of either the former or the present in your valuable
work shall ever draw to the subject the attention of those
who are able, in different districts, to enlarge our knowledge

    IT gratifies the curiosity, and proves sufficiently amusing,
to trace the origin and delineate the progress ot any thing
which occupies our thoughts or engages our attention ; but
when such an inquiry is connected with any important art or
science, it surely must be more worthy the prosecution, as
being calculated to afford some useful information as well as
agreeable entertainment.        Such are the effects that seem
JiKely lo result from the history of the rise and progress of
the art of mining; and it is hoped that the reader may meet
at least with the latter of these effects in this humble attempt
to collect into a short compass what may perhaps convey
some general idea of the antiquity of the art of working
mines, and its gradual advancement to its present dignified
and important station.
    When we consider the many improvements and important
discoveries that have been made in chemistry within these
few years, and compare the increase of chemical knowledge
in the present age with that of former periods, it may per
haps be thought that we cannot receive any advantages from
old authors, and that histories of this kind scarcely deserve
notice, because they are not absolutely necessary to the know
ledge of mining, nor to the just performance of the several
operations belonging to it. Yet, as nothing is more interest
ing to an artist than the rife and fate of his art, and nothing
 more useful to him than the labours and experience of his
 predecessors, it appears incumbent upon us to receive with
 acknowledgment, and study with attention, the works of
 those wise and enlightened men in the middle ages who di
 rected their attention to the improvement of the arts, and,
being free from the prejudices ofhostile feels and attached to
 the love of truth, contemplated with steady zeal the opera
 tions and productions of nature, and described appearances
 as they existed, without any mixture of theory or hypothesis.
    The art of discovering metals in the mine, and rendering
 them fit for use by chemical processes, is of the most remote
 antiquity. Moses, the oldest of all authors, mentions the use
 of brass and iron, which could only have arisen from some
 acquaintance with the metallurgic art; and this account is
 confirmed by the most antient historians and fabulists. Dio-
 dorus Siculus relates that the Egyptians adored Vulcan as a
 god, and esteemed him the first inventor of all arts and ope
 rations relating to metals; and all the profane authors coin-

 cide   in this belief of Vulcan being the first: inventor of the
 use   of metals,   and that in the earliest ages of the world.
 Greece, the first enlightened nation of Europe, received the
 rudiments of her arts and knowledge from Asia and Egypt,
 and probably transmitted her knowledge of working mines
 to the Romans.         The antient Greeks and Romans were not
 deficient in the mathematical parts of mining, as some of
 their subterraneous works still remain objects of admiration ;
and we may conclude from their accounts that they were
good metallurgists and smelters, though they have left but
 few traditional practices and processes, and these vague and
not to be depended upon.
     It seems probable that mines were objects of attention and
inquiry among the Romans, as we find that the historian
Tacitus, in his account of Germany, remarks that the inha
 bitants were not acquainted with their present valuable mines
 of gold, silver, &c; but doubts whether treasures might not
 be discovered upon searching for them.        " Argentum et au-
 rum propitii an irati Dei negaverint, dubito. Nee tamen af-
 firmaverim nullam Gernianiæ venam argentum aurumve gig-
 nerei     Quis enim scrutatus eft ? PolTcsiione et usu baud
perinde afficiuntur.        (De morilus German.)
     And it seems probable also that the Romans were ac-
             with the processes of digging, separating, and puri-
   ying, metals; as the mines in Transylvania are generally
 ?[uainted
 supposed to be Roman works ; and some mines on the Rhine
 and the Danube, in Lorrain, Alsace, Suevia, and Noricum,
 appear to have been worked in the decline of the antient
 Roman empire.
     After the destruction of the western empire, when all
 learning, books, arts, and sciences, were overwhelmed in the
 general wreck, we have no account of any mincralogical pur
 suits until the middle of the tenth century, when the mines
 in the Rammelsburg, near Goslar, and some of the adjacent
 ones in the Hartz mountains were discovered, and worked to
 advantage.      The metallurgical processes at Gostar were pro
 bably conducted upon traditional processes either Roman or
 German ; and we may suppose the knowledge of the Germans
 was not considerable if we judge from their operations, which,
 on account of the irony and zincous refractory mixtures,
 were various, compound, and tedious.         The commencement
 of the sixteenth century may be looked upon as one of the
 most remarkable and splendid epochs in the annals of mining,
 as well as in the annals of the world.     Arts and sciences then
 began to be prosecuted with ardour and success, and from
this æra the productions of nature were studied and unfolded
                                                                to

 XXX.       On the Conversion of Grafs Land into Tillage,              &c,*
            To the Editor     of the Philosophical Magazine,
  WSIR,   ITHOUT            offering you any apology for intruding
 upon your time, I take the liberty of fending you an abstract
 of a paper to which the utmost consequence is attached from
 its subject, and written by a man whose name is too well
 known amongst those skilled in agriculture to need any com
  mendation.
      The essay is divided into three chapters, and each chapter
  is divided into sections.        The present communication is an
  abstract of the first chapter.
      Mr. Close sets out in this chapter by saying (which is an
  undoubted truth) that agriculture is the parent of commerce,
  but that it has made a very slow progress, considering its uti
  lity and the advantages we derive from such a beautiful sci
  ence. The obstacles which are supposed (and justly too,                    I
  firmly believe) by Mr. Close to the improvement of agricul
  ture, are tithes : the difficulty and expense of inclosing waste
  lands : expensive and injudicious leases : want of knowledge
  in the practical farmers : the great increase of the poor-rates j
  and a want of that energy which formerly characterized the
   agricultural labours of this island.
      Mr. Close conceives it would be much more to the advan
   tage of the farmer, and not in the least injurious to the clergy,
   if some mode of paying the latter were devised instead of
   taking their income as it is done at present, which is one
   great check to the improvement of agriculture.
      The tithes should be valued throughout the kingdom by
   some able person or persons, and, after a proper valuation has
      * From   a paper on the subject by the Rev. H.  Close, of Hot-die,  nenr
   Lymington    ; published in the Communications  to the Board  of .Agricul
   ture, vol. iii, part  i.
                                      M4                                 been

1  68                     On the Conversion        of
been set upon them, to be offered to the owner at that valua-t
tion *. When the tithes are sold, the money stiould be in
vested in the funds ; and Mr. Close calculates, that half, or
at most three-fourths, of the interest arising from this capital
would pay the clergy their present incomes, and the surplus
to accumulate for their benefit should provisions, &c. advance.
 In order that the annuitants should receive an adequate com
pensation if any such advance took place, the average price
of wheat should be taken once in four or five years, and a
                    addition be made to their incomes as the corn
 Eroportionate
    ad advanced.       This measure is proposed by Mr. Close to
 originate with the crown.              He calculates that the livings
 now in the patronage of his majesty amount to about
 IiO,oool. per annum, to which should be added at least
 one-third to make their full value, which would come to
 about 146,000!. per annum.                 If  these tithes were sold at
 only twenty-six years purchase, it would produce a capital of
 3,796,000!., which, at only sour per cent., would secure to
 the clergy holding such preferment their full income, and
 leave above 40,0001. a year to accumulate for their benefit
 should any unforeseen accident arise.               By this scheme, nei
 ther his majesty nor any other patron of a living would bo
 deprived of their patronage.
     To obviate the difficulties attending an inclosure of waste
 land, Mr. Close proposes, instead of a bill being brought
 into parliament, that there should be an act " to empower
 the magistrates at quarter sestions to judge of the expediency
 or inexpediency ot such inclosure," and that the usual no
 tices should be given of such a measure in the countv papers,
 &c. — The bench of magistrates stiould appoint five acting
 magistrates who are entirely disinterested in the inclosure;
  these five to appoint two commissioners, who shall be sworn
  to do justice to all parties in adjudging the claims.                These
  commissioners stiould have a certain sum (first agreed upon)
  paid them, and by no means to be paid by the day or mile ;
  and not to act upon more than one inclosure at the same
  time.      Should anv dispute arise, the magistrates to decide,
  and the party against whom such a decision is made, to pay
  all costs f. Mr. Close observes, that as this is empowering
                                                                           the
     • There are few proprietors,   I  believe, in this country, from all I am
  able tc. learn, who would not jump at such a proposal, were the tithes va
  lued at a price worth his attention.   •
     t  It is with great deference I beg leave to differ with Mr. Close re
  specting his mode of deciding dispute* by mag. straits : however impartial
  they are supposed to be, and whatever may be ihe opinion of the
                                                                     " highest
  lttal authority," it putting the propeity of individuals into the power

the magistrates to decide upon law and fact, he would re
commend that a statement be made for the opinion of the
"    highest legal authority."           No right should be preserved to
render this inclosure null and void; and should any portion
of land be allotted to a person who is the ostensible owner of
the estate, and should afterwards be evicted, the common
then to be given to the owner. Mr. Close believes that there
is great want of skill, and not, as many suppose, capital.
      Of leases, the following sketch he recommends * : —The
landlord covenants to give quiet possession of the house and
 out-houses, and to put and keep the fame in repair ; also to
 put the gates, stiles, and every fort of fence in repair ; to in
sure quiet possession of the above, and of                         nu mber of
 acres of lands situated         in  the parish   of             , for
 number of years ; to pay the land-tax, and allow the tenant
 to hold certain part of the buildings and lands for a specified
 term after the expiration of his lease. The tenant covenants
 to take the premises, to pay his rent in two equal half-yearly
 payments ; to cart all materials for repairs gratis ; to find the
 workmen, when employed in such repairs, the usual allow
  ance of wholesome beer ; to keep and leave the gates, posts,
  rails, and every fort offence in repair; to allow the landlord
  or his agents free ingress and regress to shoot, fish, or hunt,
  over the lands; to warn off every one, and to bring actions,
  if necessary, at the landlord's expense, against all persons who
  may trespass upon the premises ; not to break up certain por
  tions of meadow and pasture lands ; to keep the ditches and
  water courses open ; to crop the lands according to the rota
  tion recommended in the table at the end of this essays*
  having respect to the different soils : to pay all parochial
  taxes ; to expend the hay, straw, haulm, and other fodder,
  produced from the lands, upon the premises; and to use all
   the dung, foil, and compost, arising from the fame, upon the
   fame lands belonging to the premises hereby demised; ex
   cept the produce of such dung and compost, &c. arising
   from the two last years' crops previous to the expiration of
   the lease ; all of which shall be left, in a farmer-like man
   ner, in the farm-yards, or other convenient place, for the use
   of  a set of men whom the old common law of England did never authorize
   to decide upon such questions, and wresting that invaluable bulwark of our
   liberties, the trial by jury, from our hands, which the constitution does au
    thorize to determine.     This blessing is too much curtailed already, and I
   trust we shall never Ice it laid aside upon such an important case as the one
    in question.
       •  This sketch appeared to me so important, that   I  thought it would be
    better to give it complete, instead of abridging it.
       f  This will be given 111a subsequent paper.
                                                                              of

170                        On the Conversion     of
of the landlord or in-coming tenant: to leave all the straw
of   the last year's crop to the in-coming tenant, he carting
the corn to any market within the distance of ten miles* ;
to pay five pounds an acre additional rent for everv acre of
meadow or pasture land, specified as not to be broken up,
should he plough or till the fame ; to pay five pounds an
acre additional rent for every acre cropped contrary to cove
nant 5 to preserve timbers ; not to cut, lop, or top, any pol
lard trees, underwoods, or hedge rows, under eight or ten
years growth, according to the productiveness or sterility of
the foil : to allow landlord or his agents to cut or fell timber,
and to cart the fame off the land, at seasonable times.
    For the want of knowledge amongst practical farmers,
which Mr. Close thinks very great, he proposes that an ex
perimental farm should be taken by the Board of Agriculture,
and to allow a certain number of pupils, on paying a certain
sum of money, to be instructed in every branch of agricul
ture, and also those sciences more immediately connected
with it. This farm to be supplied with proper persons as
instructors, and particular rules for the conduct ef the pupils
to be laid down and strictly observed.                  There is a great
want of communication (observes Mr. Close) with respect to
approved facts in agriculture ; and being generally known
in Norfolk and Suffolk, he proposes that noblemen and
gentlemen should take a proper person as a tenant from
either of these counties, and place them upon a centrical part
of their estates, lyinc in a county where the management
and improvement of^grass lands and stock are well under
stood.      He then gives his opinion from what part of Suffolk
or Norfolk these men should be taken, according to the na
ture of the land upon which they are to be placed.
    The poor rates justly come under Mr. Close's censure. He
conceives that the enormous rates lately levied are owing to
the inadequate price of labour in proportion to the price of
provisions t- This not only burthens the farmer with a con
                                                                       stant

   f  The following curi ^us circumstance deserves to be mentioned :—
When the ministers and their friends in the house of commons were |>ro-
posing substitutes for brend, and bounties upon different articles, Mr.
Home Tooke, in one of the debates upon a potatoc bili, threw out to the
house this very idea of the price of labour being inadequate to the price of
provisions, and that the poor nun's one pound was not worth or.e-fcurth
to him now, when compared with its former value: he recommended to
¦unifiers to diop this method of relieving them, as. it never would answer,
                                                                       •

slant load upon his operations, but falls extremely heavy upon
the poor mechanic, whose profession will not permit him to
make that advance on his articles the heavy taxes he pays
would justify him in doing. It likewise ultimately falls upon
the land owner, who, when he lets his farm, the valuation is
laways taken according to taxes, rates, &c, which the farm
pays, and of course a deduction is made in favour of the te
nant.      It has likewise destroyed a very valuable class of so
ciety, viz. the industrious and labouring people, whose honest
pride was to boast that they never were beholden to their
paristi for assistance.      The plan of relieving these industrious
people is likewise bad ; not that it can be altered, but by
ascertaining what a man earns, and paying him accordingly:
he who is strong and able, and gets a tolerable maintenance,
seeing the man who is not able, by reason of his weakness or
ill health, receive more, thinks that by slackening his work
he shall receive more ; and this is absolutely the case almost
every where: and he adds,
                                    " I am fully persuaded, that by
the aggregate body of agricultural labourers not more than
three-fourths of the fame work is performed as was done ten
years back by the fame number of hands."                 Mr. Close then
goes on to propose a plan for the relief of what is called
" second poor;" viz. those labourers who have never received
parisli relief, but are entitled to a relief from charities left to
 jarislies. As there are but few who have not had paristi re-
Iief, and consequently not entitled to these charities, an act
of parliament should be passed entitling this class of people
to these charities, notwithstanding having received parish re
lief. To guard against this valuable part of the community
being again degraded, he proposes that
                                                   " the price of labour
should be regulated by the price of bread corn."                Mr. Close
also proposes that those who do receive parisli relief after such
a regulation as this, should be badged *.

for they only increased the price instead of lowering it.     They saw the
wisdom of this remark, and they never propoled any more bounties to
lower the price of provisions.
   • Here too,
                again, I big leave to differ from Mr. Close with respect' to
bodying the poor.    It is making a distinction to which the lowest of man
kind only will submit, and making a distinction to a class of people who
probably may be obliged to leek parochial relief owing to misfortunes,
and not to deamess of provisions.

 XXXI.     History of Astronomy for the Year 1802.     Read in tie
  Alberueum of Paris December 30, by Jerome           Lalande.
 XF we were astonished last year to see the History os Astro
 nomy begin with the discovery of a ninth planet, we ought
to be much more so to find this year also a discover)' of the
like kind, which we did not expect.          It was also by a for
 tunate chance that the tenth planet was found ; but it was
necessary that chance should savour an assiduous and intelli
gent astronomer.
    At nine in the evening on the 28th of March 1802, Dr.
Olbers observed at Bremen Piazzi's planet, which had af
forded occupation to astronomers for a year.         He was exa
mining with his telescope all the small stars in the Virgin's
wing to ascertain their positions; and that he might be en
abled to determine with more ease the places of the planet,
he had arrived at the twentieth star of Virgo, near which he
had observed the planet in the month of January, and was
surprised to see near this star, which is of the sixth magnitude,
another small one of the seventh. He was certain that it had
not been there at the time of his first observations : he there
fore hastened to determine its position ; and having continued
to view it for two hours, he perceived that in this interval it
had changed its position. The two following nights afforded
him the means of determining its motion, which was io' per
day. As soon as he had made public this curious observa
tion, astronomers took the earliest opportunity of observing
this new star, and of calculating its orbit.        Dr. Gauss, an
able geometrician of Brunswick, calculated the elements, and
C. Burckhardt employed himself on similar calculations.
    On the 4th of June C. Burckhardt finished his calculations
in regard to this star of Olbers. We expected them with
great impatience, being desirous to know whether it was a
planet or a comet.      He found its revolution to be 4 years
7  months    and 27  days ; its distance 2785, or 96 millions of

calculated    also the perturbations of Olbers's planet, which

C. Burckhardt, when he has finished his calculation of the
perturbations, will give us elements still more certain".
    In the beginning of January Dr. Olbers found again Piaz-
zi's planet, which had disappeared for a long time ; and astro
nomers continued to observe it till the month of July. Aster
 the 15th of February Dr. Gauss calculated the new ele
 ments ; but C. Burckhardt undertook to calculate the per
 turbations which that planet experiences by the attraction
 of Jupiter, and found more exact elements. We afterwards
 received the perturbations calculated by M. Oriani of Milan,
 and which Dr. Gauss took into account that he might.better
 obtain the elements of its orbit.   Those given in Von Zach's

   The king of Naples has made an addition of 1200 francs
to Piazzi's salary, in consequence of his discovery of the new
planet, and the homage he has rendered to his majesty by
naming it in his writings Ceres Ferdinandea.
   This year we have had also a comet, and though very small
it was discovered in three places : at Marseilles, on the 24th
of August, by Louis Pons, keeper of the observatory ; on the
28th, by C. Mechain, one of our most celebrated astrono
mers, to whom we are already indebted for a great number;
at Bremen, on September 2d, by Dr. Olbers, who discovered
the tenth planet. This comet was in Serpentarius, very faint
and  ill denned, having   very sensible nucleus.
                             a
    C. Mechain and C. Messier at Paris, and C. Vidal at
Mirepoix, observed     with care till the
                       it                    of October; and
                                              3d
 C. Mechain calculated its elements in the following manner
 from his own observations: Node 10' io° 17'; inclination
 570 o'; perihelion u* z" 8'; distance 1*0942; passage of the
 perihelion, September 9th, 20'' 43' 15" direct motion. The
 elements calculated    Or. Olbers, as well as his observations,
                        by
 have been inserted in Von Zach's journal.
   It may here be seen that this comet        among the small
                                              is

  are further distant  than the earth  : it is the 93d the orbits of
  which are known.
     C. Lalande junior has had the satisfaction of furnishing
  exact positions of stars, before unknown, with which astrono
 mers had often been obliged to compare this comet; and the
  fame thing has happened to him these fifteen years.
     The new tables of the moon by M. Burg form a very im
 portant epoch in the history of astronomy for this year.          I
 was informed by Dr. Von Zach that M. Burg had been em
 ployed at Vienna, amidst poverty and obscurity, in calculating
 observations of the moon made at Greenwich, with the hope
 of improving the tables of the moon : and on the 19th of
 March 1798 the commissioners of the Institute, being assem
 bled at the Board of Longitude to determine on the subject
 for a prize, I proposed to them to require the establissiment
 of the epochs of the moon by a great number of observations.
 I knew that M. Burg had calculated a great many, and I
judged that this would give him an opportunity of publishing
 them, and at the same time afford us the means of rewarding
 his labour. When the prize came to be adjudged, as C. Bou-
 vard made a great many interesting researches also, it was
 thought proper to divide it. But general Bonaparte, who
 that day presided, proposed to double the prize, in order that
 each might have 3400 francs : and this was agreed to.
    C. Laplace, finding that this sum was too small for so im
 mense a labour as that of C. Burg, and that he could deduce
from these calculations all the moon's equations with a pre
 cision never before obtained, induced the Board of Longitude
to propose a prize of 6oco francs, and prevailed on the mi
nister of the marine and of the interior to furnish each the
half of this sum. The question was published on the aoth
of June 1800, and by the commencement of November 1801
we received the tables so much wished for ; and then several
supplements. On the 26th of January C. Laplace announced
to the Institute, that he had found in the theory of the moon
an equation the period of which is 180 years, and which
amounts to 16"; so that it will serve to explain the disagree
ment observed between the mean motion of the moon 100
years ago and that given by the last observations.     This equa
tion is composed of two terms, of which, for the moment,
we can have only the sum; but it has served to establish in
the motion of the moon, at different periods, a regularity
which before could not be obtained.
    On the 25th of July a deputation from the Board of Lon
gitude went to give in its report to the first consul on the la
bours of Burg, and the prize of 6000 francs.          I  reminded
         6                                                   him.

           History of Astronomy     for   the Year 1802.            175
him, that he had caused the first prize to be doubled, and
that it would be worthy of his character to double the present
one. He instantly complied.       The minister Chaptal, who
was present, proposed to me to induce Burg to come to Paris,
where he should have a pension of 3000 francs. He would be
an excellent co-operator in improving astronomy in France,
where it is already so much cultivated : but this worthy astro
nomer preferred his own country with less advantage.       His
tables of the moon are about to be printed, as well as the
new tables of the fun by Delambre; and we have already
communicated them to Dr. Maskelyne, the astronomer royal
of England, who will be enabled by them to improve the
Nautical Almanac, which since 1767 has been of the greatest
utility to navigators.
  The report of C. Delambre will          be published in the Con-
fioijsance des Temps   for the year 13, which is about to appear.
    The Arabic text of all the oblervations in the manuscript
oflbn lunis, lent to us by the Batavian republic, with a
translation by C. Cauffin, and an extract from the part which
it was not judged necessary to translate and to print, has been
finished at the printing-office of the republic.      C. Cauffin is
the first of all the professors of Arabic who has rendered his
knowledge really useful.        I reproached them fifty years ago,
on account of their translating nothing but romances.
    The observation of the eighteenth transit of Mercury over

into account the correction to be made in the tables of the
fun, which         my nephew Lalande was observed to be —
                  by
 10" 4; the geocentric latitude in conjunction 56".             Ihave
had the most satisfactory confirmation of the theory of Mer
cury, which  I   gave  in  the first memoir, read in the first sitting
of the first class of the Institute on the 1st of January 1796.
More details on this subject will be found in the Memoirs of
 the Institute.
    M. Casclla, physician to the king of Naples, and M. Bygge,
 astronomer royal of Copenhagen, 8cc. have sent me exact ob
 servations of this transit.
    The solstice was exactly observed with whole circles              by
 C. Delambre, aud       by   C. Burckhardt and Lalande junior.
                                                                    The

 The   mean of four hundred observations gives 230 28' 7", or
Jfl   more  than in my tables : last year it was only 6"; We
ought to be satisfied with this agreement.
    Duc-la-Chapelle has published, in the fourth volume of
the Memoirs of the Institute, solstitial observations which
give him 31" for the secular diminution of the obliquity of
the ecliptic.    C. Mechain has still found 10 seconds less for
the obliquity of the winter solstice.
    C. Vidal has sent in his observations of the new planets
and a great many others : he has even had the complaisance
to terminate some zones of circumpolar stars which were not
complete in the Htstoire Celeste Frangoise published in 1801.
    The inferior conjunction of Venus, observed in the end of
December by C. Burckhardt and Lalande, gave us for the
correction of my tables + 29', which do not make 10 in
the longitude seen from the sun.
    But as the tables of Venus had not yet been calculated with
the perturbations, and as C. Lalande junior proposed to un
dertake this labour, C. Chabrol furnislied him with a table
of the equation calculated to tenths of seconds, which was an
essential preliminary. It is time it should be begun. We have
40 years exact observations of Venus ; and these 40 years ob
servations, from 1761 to 1 801, will give us the motion of
Venus as exact as the Babylonian observation made 2072
years ago, and respecting which there is some doubt, as        I
have already explained. (See Mimoires de I'Academie 1785,
p. 250.)
    The opposition of Mars, which took      place on the 24th of
December, could not be observed ; but the observations of
that night gave a correction in the tables of Lalande junior
— 5"; which make only two in the heliocentric longitude.
    The disappearance of Saturn's ring, which will take place
in 1803, has been preceded by a singular phænomenon. The
arises were on the point of disappearing, and it was with dif
ficulty that C. Mechain discovered them on the morning of
December 20. C. Flaguergues also lost sight of them on the
16th. But we shall soon see them re-appear, as the earth will
return on the 28th of June : the fun pasting through the plane
of the ring, we sliall lose fight of them till the 23d or Au
gust, at which time the earth will pass to the north of the
ring, and permit us to see the surface of it illuminated by the
sun.     Dusejour, Traite analytique des Mouvemens Cdejles,

    C. Chabrol and C. Flaguergues have calculated a great
number of tables of aberrations and nutations for 600 stars
of the fundamental catalogue which Lalande junior inserts

    C. Lalande, my nephew, continues to observe the right
ascensions and declination of a great number of star's not well
known; and madame de Lalande continues the reductions,
which she promised, for the 50,000 stars : 1500 will be found
in the Connoljsance des Temps for the year 13, which will
soon appear; and M. Bode has published more than 10,000
in the catalogue of 17,000 stars which accompany the large
and beautiful atlas in twenty meets which 1 have already
announced.
   Last year I gave an account of the labour undertaken by
the Swedisti astronomers Svanbcrcr, Ofverbom, Olmquist, and
Palander, to verify the degree of the meridian under the polar
circle.    M. Melanderhielm, though 76 years of age, set on
foot and directed this enterprise.    In 1801 they had already
discovered   the stations, ^elevated the signals, and built two
observatories.    They set out in the month of January 180a,
and measured the base on the ice of the river Tornec between
the 6th of February and the 8th of April, though the cold
was 24°. At the beginning of September they had completed
the measurement of the angles of their triangles, and set out
to proceed northwards to Pathavara to commence their astro
nomical observations.      We mail therefore soon have the cu
rious result of this new measurement.
   On the other hand, C. Mechain, in consequence os the
consular decree of September 17, is about to resume the mea
surement of the meridian as far as the ifland of Cabrera,
which is 40 leagues south of Barcelona, agreeably to his
wish, which I announced in the Conno'iffance des Tempt for
the year 10.     By these means the 45th degree, which it is
particularly interesting for us to be well acquainted with, will
be a mean of the whole interval.
   The Portuguese, whose silence we regretted, begin to di-
stinguisti themselves.   M. Demonfort has sent us calculations
of eclipses of the son visible at Lisbon during this century :
M. Monteira de Rocha, new tables of Mars, with all the per
turbations. The equation is io1 41' 39", greater only by 4"
than in the tables of      C   Lalande junior.    M. Damoifeau,
captain-lieutenant of the royal brigade of the marine at Lis
bon, has written to me that he is employed on the Nautical
Ephemerides of 1806. Those of 1805 were calculated di
rectly, without employing the Nautical Almanac. I have
requested him to wait for the new tables of the son and moon,
which are about to be printed.
   We have received also a description of the observatory of

     We have received the Astronomical Ephemerides of father
 Cossali, of Parma : they are not destined for astronomers such
 as those of Berlin, Vienna, Milan, Bologna, and Paris; but
 the author has added a very minute history of the two new
 planets, and he follows my example in giving them the names
 of Piazzi and Olbers; he also employs that of Herfchel, as a
 mark of homage due to them by astronomers.
    On the 32a of June 1802, M. Van Swinden sent us a
Dutch memoir on the new measures, which engaged him a
 long time ; and he has obtained a decree for establishing the
new measures in the Batavlan republic.
    Mr. Mackay has published a curious work, in England, on
the longitude.
    M. Van Swinden has sent us the fourth edition of his Dis
sertation, in Dutch, on the Determination of the Longitude
by the Observation of the Moon's Distance from the Stars ;
with a dissertation, which he published in 1788 conjointly
with M. Nieuwland, on the Use of Sextants and Octants. He
proposes to publish also a memoir on reflecting circles, which
lie wishes to introduce into the Dutch navy ; and also on ma
rine time-keepers. So early as the year 1774 I went to Hol
land to solicit the introduction of astronomy into navigation,
and obtained a promise for that purpose from the stadtholder
and the grand pensionary. My Astronomy was even trans
lated into Dutch : but this circumstance was attended with
little advantage at that time, notwithstanding the need which
navigators had of it. At present, since the navy resumes new
activity in the Batavian republic, and that the learned pro
fessor enjoys there a well merited influence, we have reason
to believe that astronomy will be employed there in an effec
tual manner.
    M. Van Swinden explains in this work all the methods, by
calculation, bv graphic operations, and by instruments; the
corrections made by Mr. Mackay to the methods of Borda
and Dunthorn ; those of Kraft and of Douwes de Stiinstra.
He has added a collection of such tables as are necessary in
navigation.
    M. Mendoza has already published two large collections of
tables for navigation : he has added a new method of deter
mining the latitude by two altitudes taken out of the meri
dian, the calculation of which is shorter than the first approx
imation, which is only the commencement of the method of
Douaes.

                                            :
from  it,   which show with what patience and minuteness this
able astronomer has examined the surface of the moon.
    These new observations were made with the fame care for
twelve years, and with optical instruments of the greatest
power, (two telescopes, one of 13 and the other of 27 feet.)
They entitle him to the gratitude of astronomers, as they will
serve them as     a base and term os comparison in their future
 researches respecting the changes that may take place at the
 surface of the moon.      He has observed mountains which rife
 to the height of 4000 toise3, and others to the height of 2400.
 M. Schroeter has also determined, that the part of the lunar
 atmosphere which         sufficiently dense to produce the crepus-
                         is
 cula, is 300 toises in height.     ,
     The author has also seen objects which he did not fee in
 the course of his preceding observations,        and which on the
 first view might be ascribed to changes that have taken place
 at the surface of the moon     :  but he remarks, with the reserve
 of an able observer, that the particular state of the lunar
 atmosphere may have concealed these objects at the time of
 his first observations.
     Dr. Henzcnberg, of Hamburgh, between the months of
 July and October 1802, made thirty-one experiments on the
 fall of bodies from the steeple of St. Michael, which              is
                                                                    235

justly observes, has in this country been usually left to men
of inferior endowments, as a piece of drudgery below the
dignity of a philosopher; while in France, excellent system
atic treatises have appeared on almost every part of science by
men of the first abilities.         Though we can rank several di
stinguished       names    among our authors of elementary works,
it is certain that " we have more frequently satisfied ourselves
with translating the systematic works of foreigners, even w hen
the discoveries of our own philosophers had furnished a con
siderable portion of the material* of these works.              The con
sequence       has   been,   what   was   naturally to be  expected, the:
labours of our philosophers have been frequently overlooked,
and their discoveries claimed by others to whom they did not
belong; while these claims, constantly inculcated in all the
elementary treatises of chemistry, have been received as first
principles by the greater number of readers.              It is incontro-
\'ertible, that, for the rapid progress which chemistry has
lately made, the science is deeply' indebted to the philoso
phers of this country.          Much, indeed, has been done by the
illustrious body of French chemists; but these gentlemen,
not satisfied with a part, have laid claim to the whole."
    The author states his work to have for its object the giving
a full detail of the vast number of facts which constitute che
mistry, blended with the history of their gradual development,
and of the theories which have been founded on them, and
accompanied with exact references to the original works in

    On the 18th of Januarv the academy held a public sitting
to celebrate the anniversary     of its establishment.      It was
opened bv the director Merian with an oration ; afier which
M. de Verdv du Yernois read the sketch of a plan for reviv
ing the antient tournaments, and mowed the utility of again
introducing this antient amusement, formerly a school for
dexterity and intrepidity, and which might be attended with
great advantage to the cavalry service, aud to all troops that
sight on hoiseback.
    Al. Erman then read a pnper containing particulars re
specting the reign of the elector Frederic William the Great,
extracted from a manuscript diary of marshal Dieierich Si-
gismund von Buch.
    Al. Klaproth next read a dissertation on stones and iron
masses, and showed that the fall of such bodies from the
heavens is a phænomenon totally different from all ihe other
phænoniena of nature ; and that it need? therefore excite no
wonder that doubis have been entertained respecting the truth
of such facts, but that hitherto thev are not only supported
by experience, but bv chemical anakses of the fallen bodies.
As a contribution towards thi.> subject, Al. Klaproth gave an
account of experiments, made by hinilelf, with some of these
 productions which had fallen at different times and in dif
ferent countries, particularly a specimen of that which fell
 near Siena on the 16th of January 1794; and a fragment of
the mass of iron, weighing 71 pounds, which fell near Agram
on the 26th of May 1 75 1, comparing them with the ana
 lyses lately published by Mr. Howard of the (tones which
 fell at Benares in the East Indies on the 19th of December
 1798, and on the 13th of December 1795 in Yorkshire; and
 adding a short history of these and some other bodies that
 have fallen from the clouds. Thev consist either entirely of cel
 lular masses of iron, or of stonv substances mixed with grains
of iron. In all of them the iron is of the fame nature : it is
ductile, exceedingly tough, appears white when filed, and
almost always contains nickel.      The stones are covered on
the outside with a black emit, are bright gray in the inside
with black spots, and interspersed, betides the ferruginous
p. rtieles, with grains of pyrites.     The principal part of the

opinion   of  Dr.   Chladni, that these meteoric productions
are fragments of fire balls which have burst, may be consi
dered as fully established.    Real native iron from the mines
of Kamsdorff is distinguished from the meteoric iron by not
containing any nickel, and by containing a mixture of cop
per-lead.

Observations    on tie Transit of Mercury    over the Sun's Disc,
                        November   9, 1802.
   If the theory of attraction, aided by the powerful means of
analysis, has enabled astronomers to give, almost at once, to
the tables of the planets, and particularly to those of the moon
and sun, a degree of exactness far superior to that to which
they could have been carried by the efforts of observers alone
during a long series of ages, time has not, on that account, lost
its right to the perfection of these results deduced from the
measurement of its dnration.      Astronomers therefore, always
attentive  to the spectacle of the heavens, never suffer to escape
but with regret opportunities of observing the simplest and
most frequent phænomena, because they know that, however
precise they may. be for the moment at which they are as
signed, agronomical determinations have continual need' of
being rectified : with much more reason, therefore, thuy are
anxious to take advantage of those circumstances where the
position of the planets is less affected by the combination of
their own motion and that of the earth. Such in regard to.
Mercury are his transits over the disc of the sun.
   The first of these phænomena preserved in the annals of
astronomy was observed in 1631, at the college of France, by
Cassendi, one os the most illustrious professors of that cele
brated school.     Since that time great attention has been paid
to this phænomenon ; and the observations of these transits,
which follow each other pretty rapidly, have been multiplied.
C. Lalaii'le has employed himself in collecting and examin
ing them with a care and alliduity for which he has been re
warded by the perfection he has thence been abie to give to
his tables of Mercury. After having successively corrected
each element, he waited for a confirmation of them by the

transit announced for the 9th of November 1802, and hoped
he should then be able to be convinced that his tables, one
of the moll important results of his long labours, had reached
the utmost perfection to which they could attain in the pre
sent state of tiie science.     His wishes have been fully gratified
hy   the  observations   we  are  about to detail.
    The moments ot interior aud exterior contact of the two
bodies on the egress of Mercury were determined as follows:

    By then comparinsr three differences of declination selected
 from twenty-five, which were measured by C. Messier during
  the transit, he deduces from them the shortest distance of the
 centres, namely 6s'": and combining it with the distance of
 the centres at the moment of the egrets, he is enabled to find
 the difference in longitude and latitude of 'he two bodies, and
 the time elapsed between the middle of the transit and the
  egress.   We shall not follow the detail of his process any
 farther, as our astronomical readers may easily supply what is
 'he^e omitted ; and to others it would he superfluous.                 We
  onlvTlate   the  results which    C.  Lalande    obtained by     this first

                     l<rencb National Institute.              1 85
     C. Lalande re-commenced his calculations ; substituting
for the differences of declinations the observation of Mercu
ry's passage of the meridian, made the fame day by his ne- .
phew andC. Burckhardt; and by these means found z!l less
in longitude, and 6" less for the latitude, at the moment of
 the egress.
     He determines the geocentric latitude at the time of con
junction to be 56*5 ", which gives the place of the node
 I' 16° o'37", further advanced by \' 46" than in the tables;
 and as C. Delambre had found by the passage of 1799 that
 this element ought to be increased by 1 ', C. Lalande adopts
 a mean correction of + 1' 23", which makes the place of
 the node in 1801 to be
                           Is 15° 58 ? 54".
      By comparing this determination with that which he de
 duced from the transit of 1677, he found for the annual mo
  tion of the node 43*98" instead of 43'3", which he had be
  fore.
      To ascertain whether the position which he gave to the
  aphelion of Mercury was exact, C. Lalande examined again
  the transit observed by C. Delambre in 1799, taking into ac
  count the perturbations calculated by M. Oriani, and the
  error in the tables of the fun, and he found the fame error
  of 13" as in that of this year, though the anomalies were
  very different. He consequently thought that this error ought
   to be ascribed only to the epoch of the mean motions : but
   after a communication from Dr. Maskelyne in regard to a
   correction of 4.1' to be made in the right ascensions, which
   he assigned to the positions of the principal stars employed
   for determining the places of the fun, the error in the tables
   of Mercury would be reduced to 9", and the epoch of the
   mean motions of this planet would consequently be for 1801,
                             5' n° 53' 32".
       By distributing this error to the secular motion it would be
   reduced 6", and would become
                              a' 140 4' 4".
       In a word, the transit of November 9, this year, has fully
    confirmed the result which C. Delambre deduced from that
    of 1799 in regard to the diameter of Mercury. C. Delambre
    had obtained for this diameter as seen from the fun 6"3";
    and C. Lalande found 6-2", while in his Astronomy it was
    69".
        C. Messier communicated to the class a particular account
     of his observation of the transit of Mercury, during which
    he successively determined twenty-five positions of that planet,
            6                                             comparing

   comparing it either with the sun's limb, or to a very considera
   ble spot which appeared on that body, and of which the dia
   meter was 25' of a degree.     He determines the moment of
   the egress of Mercury's centre at    j'  6" true time; and this
  planet's passage of the meridian 55" before that of the fun's
  centre.
      C. Messier's memoir contains a detailed view of the deter
  minations he obtained, and is accompanied with a drawing
  which represents the apparent route of Mercury on the fun.
  It exhibits a luminous ring, with which Mercury seems to
  be surrounded.    This circumstance, peculiar to the observa
  tion of C. Messier, was remarked by him in the transit of
  1799; it was observed also at Montpellier, in 1736, by Plan-
  tade; and at Upsal, in J 736, by M. Prosperin. - This ring
  exhibited a very faint light, and of a colour different from
  that of the fun.   Its diameter towards the end of the transit
  was 1' 19^, and that of Mercury      ij".
                 EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY.
            On the Method   of magnetizing    to Saturation.
      To apply with constancy to the fame objects, and to vary
  their combinations in everv manner possible, are the condi
 tions on which nature contents to disclose her secrets to those
  who interrogate her. It was by fulfilling them with an assi
 duity and sagacity worthy of success that C. Coulomb attained
 to his interesting discoveries in electricity and magnetism, and
 by imposing on himself the task of illustrating every part of
 these important branches of philosophy.          Magnetizing, the
 perfecting of which is of so much importance to navi
 gators, could not escape his attention.        Very vague notions
 had hitherto been acquired in regard to the intensity of the
 magnetic force which steel is capable of acquiring in its dif
 ferent states ; and it was measured in general by the weight
 of the piece magnetized. But it is of the greatest import
 ance here to know the energy with which needles tend to
 return to their direction after they have been removed from
 it ; and this C. Coulomb measures directly, by determin
ing, according to Borda's views, and bv means of verv nice
suspension, how many oscillations these needles perform in a
given time.
     After comparing the methods of magnetizing proposed
by Duhamel, Knight, and Æpiniu, to give a needle all the
directing force it is capable of receiving, the author decides
in favour of that of Æpinus. He found that it is most ad
vantageous to make the needles long and broad, but not
                                                             thick.

     On the Stones supposed   to    have   fallen from   the Clouds.
    The attention of philosophers has been again directed to
the singular stones the origin of which is unknown, and
which are supposed to have fallen from the clouds. The
French chemists were desirous of proving by experiments the
identity of these stones, and of ascertaining their component
parts, already indicated by Mr. Howard.
     C. Vanquelin procured some specimens of the stones* ana
lysed bv Mr. Howard, found at Benares in the East Indies,
in Yorkshire, at Siena in Italy, and at Bologna : to which
he added some of those which fell in France in 1789 ; at Bar-
 botan near Roqueton, and Creon in the parish of Juliac, in
 1790. He remarked, as Mr. Howard did, that these stones
have such a perfect resemblance to each other that it is al
most impossible to distinguilh them.           He was convinced by
various analyses that they all contain the fame principles,
 namely, silex, manganese, iron, nickel, and sulphur.           These
 results, analogous to those obtained bv Mr. Howard, and the
work in which Dr. Chladni, known by his ingenious expe
riments on vibrating surfaces, has collected all the accounts
 published respecting the fall of these stones, concur to render
 it probable that their origin is foreign to our globe ; for hi
 therto none of a similar kind have been found in the interior
 parts of it.
     The reading of this interesting memoir gave rife to a dif-
 cuflion the results of which must be here mentioned, as they
 afford new motives to induce philosophers to examine and
 appreciate the different testimonies,      in consequence of which
 the stones in question have been supposed to have fallen from
 the clouds. When a phenomenon is announced, if we were
 able to ascertain, by a complete enumeration of the different
 physical agents, that none of them is capable ot producing
 it, the impossibility of the phænomenon would be the evi
 dent result, and consequently the falsity of the account.
      But, on the other hand, when we find a cause which esta
  blishes the probability of  it,
                                if   found logic forbids us to ascribe

    Chemists at present would be much embarrassed to find in
the atmosphere the component principles which have been
discovered by analvsis in the Hones given to them as having
fallen from the clouds ; and on this account they would na
turally reject such events as absurd.        But C. Laplace has
mentioned an explanation, which he announces not as the
only one which could be given of them, and not to prove
their existence, but to show that we ought not to reject them
as absurd, and to suspend our opinion until time has procured
some further illustration.
    It is shown, by a very simple calculation, that a body pro
jected from the moon would require oniv a velocity nearly
quintuple that of the bullet of a 24-poiinder discharged with
a quantity of gunpowder equal to half its weight, to proceed
to a ciiiiance from that satellite where the intensity of its
attraction would be the fame as that of the earth. The
 body, when it had pasted this point, being in the sphere of the
 activity of our globe, would necessarily fall to its surface. The
 appearance of verv considerable       volcanoes observed on the
 surface of the moon does not render such a conjecture impro
 bable ; but, independently of eruptions, which may be more
 or less uncommon, it will not often happen that the direction
 of the projection will be that which the combined motions
 of the earth and moon require in order that a projectile
 thrown from the latter body may meet with the former.
    The atmosphere of the moon, which is doubted by many
 astronomers, is so rare and of so little extent that it could op
 pose only a very feeble resistance to those bodies which might
 move in it. The cafe is not the fame with the terrestrial at
 mosphere : it reduces almost to a tenth of its extent the largest
 range of a piece of ordnance; and the resistance it opposes to
 rapid motion is such, that to make a body projected from
 Vesuvius reach France, it would be necessary that it should
 have a projection far greater than that which would carry a
 lunar body to the limits of the sphere of the activity of that
 satellite.
     It is therefore not possible to suppose that stones found at
  a distance from terrestrial volcanoes are the product of the
  eruptions of these mountains : and mineralogy also opposes
 this explanation; for none of the volcanic productions known
  are analogous to those supposed to have fallen from the
  clouds.

advantages which would arise to mankind from the possibility
of foretelling the nature of the seasons, sufficiently justifies all
the fruitless attempts hitherto made to accomplish that end.
   Being much struck with these advantages, C. Lamarck was
discouraged          by
                   the bad success of those who had preceded him
in this career; and from continuing to pursue              with ardour,

these strata,    which    naturally become rarer and colder the
higher they go,     inversions  to which he ascribes the formation
of the clouds.
   The discordance of the effects which the fame wind pro

of theory of these effects an insurmountable obstacle: but

besides the direction and nature of the winds alone, attention
ought to be paid also to the height at which they blow in the
atmosphere.

   The above table, containing the geocentric motion of the
two new planets, Ceres Ferdinandea and Pallas, for the en
suing month, is selected from an Ephemeris calculated by
Mr. Gauss, of Germany, of whose abilities as a calculator
the world has already been fully convinced.                         Mr. Gauss-
does not expect that the observed places of these planets
when they shall be again found will agree very correctly
with his Ephemeris, as there has not yet been a sufficient
number of observations made to settle the elements of their
motions with such a degree of precision ; but he hopes his
eelculations will render them very easy to be found : those
gentlemen, therefore, who are provided with ecjuatorials, or
instruments for taking angles out of the meridian, will no

doubt be soon able to find both, or at least Pallas, whose
situation is now become pretty favourable, being at a suffi
cient distance from the sun to be seen in the morning when
the weather is clear.      It does not appear likely that Ceres
Ferdinandea, from her great south declination, will be seen
here till the latter end of April, or perhaps the beginning
of May ; but those astronomers who are situated in more
southern latitudes will view her under more favourable cir
cumstances, and may perhaps be able to find her sooner.

   Where Alexander von Humboldt may be at present is not
known even to his relations ; but all the observations which
he collected up to the beginning of March 1801 have lately
arrived safe in Europe.        He entrusted this valuable deposit,
which consists of four bound volumes and three manuscript
bundles, a roll of plans, and a number of drawings of plants,
to one of his friends at the Havannah, where he then was,
to be sent to Spain by a proper opportunity.             They arrived
in the beginning of September 1801, and have since been,
transmitted to Berlin.
                         FOSSIL BONES.
   Two horns, with the head and several bones of an un
known animal of a monstrous size, have lately been found
in the Mologi circle, of the government of Jaroflawi, on the
banks of the Mologa, on an estate belonging to count Alexet
Iwanfwitch Puschkin.          The length of the head is two ells
Leipfic  measure  *,  and    the breadth on the forehead one ell
eight inches, (two feet five inches.) The horns are like those
ofan ox, are about four ells in length (six feet eleven inches),
and in the thickest part are about an ell in circumference (one
foot nine inches). Gmelin, as is well known, fays that, be
sides bones of the mammoth, (different however from those
of the American mammoth,) heads with horns ofan extra
ordinary size are sometimes found in Siberia.              He himself
carried with him to Petersburgh a head of this kind, which
in all probability is still preserved in the cabinet of curiosities
belonging to the Academy of Sciences.             It will be interest
ing to natural history to compare this head with the one lately
found, in order to ascertain whether they belong to the same
species of animal.     At any rate, these heads seem to afford a
new proof, in opposition to the opinion of Daubenton, Bus-
son, and other naturalists, that there existed formerly species
of animals now become extinct.

name I shall make known at a proper time, found lately a
particular substance which he transmitted to me for exa
mination.       Though the quantity was small, I am however
convinced that it is a new metal combined with sulphur.
The characteristic marks of this metal are : It belongs to the
volatile- metals : with sulphur it forms a mass which melts
like wax, and which crystallizes; with sulphureous acid it
gives a reddish solution ; with nitrous acid and nitro-muri-
atic acid it gives a yellowish solution ; muriatic acid has no
action on it warm : from acid solutions it is precipitated green
by the prufliate of potash ; of a steel gray by tincture of galls;
chamois yellow by bydrotbion-ammoma * ; by carbonate of
potash it is precipitated as a white oxide ; it is not precipi
tated from its solution by caustic ammonia, and it is proba
ble that it forms with it a double fait. I shall observe in the
last place, that this new substance is found in Germany.               A
further account of it will be published in my journal."

      DEAR SIR,                                                  is,
I HAVE
                                              Philadelphia, Feb.     1800.
               never yet received the translation which you have
made     of my    "  Memoir concerning the fascinating Faculty
which has been ascribed to the Rattlesnake, and other Ame
rican Serpents."        I feel flattered by your kind notice of that
little production, one of my first essays in natural history,
and one to which, I confess, I devoted a good deal of atten
tion.     By transferring my sentiments on the subject which
 I have touched into the language of your country, you have,
no doubt, contributed to draw the attention of the learned
to the discussion of the question, whether serpents are endued
with the power of fascinating other animals.
     I did not, before this day, know that our learned friend
 professor Blumenbach, of Gottingen,              had published some
.Remarks on the Memoir, in Voigt's Magazin fiir den neu-
ejlen zujland der Naturhunde, part ii.            I have not seen the
magazine,       but have   met   with  a translation  of the professor's
         in the Philosophical Magazine tj published in London
   y Mr. Alexander Tilloch.
Eaper                                  In this letter I am going to
 trouble you with some further remarks, which you are at
 liberty to make use of in any way you may think proper.
     I shall not pursue the professor in the precise order of his
 remarks.      I shall first take notice of his defence of that pas
 sage   in  his  Manual of Natural History J, which T particu
 larly examined in my memoir, and which he seems to think
 I have criticised with somewhat of severity. The following
 are Mr. Blumenbach's words, as I have translated them in
 the memoir : — " That squirrels, small birds, &c. voluntarily
 fall from trees into the jaws of the rattlesnake lying under
 them, is certainly founded in facts : nor is this much to be
 wondered at, as similar phænomena have been observed in
 other species of serpents, and even in toads, hawks, and in
  cats, all of svhich, to appearance,        can, under particular cir
  cumstances,     entice other small animals by mere steadfast
  looks.    Here the rattles of this snake (the rattlesnake) are of
  peculiar service ; for their hissing noise causes the squirrels,

                                         it,        it

 from well-informed eye-witnesses, that             one of the comit   is

    On this passage made some remarks, which were brought
                        I
 together under three distinct heads.           observed, ist, That
"

                       is
 and other serpents, which are not furnished with the crepi-
 taculum, or let of bells." 2dly, That " fume persons, who
have seen the rattlesnake          the supposed act of charming,
                                        in
assure me that the reptile did not make its rattles, but kept
them still      ;"
                and lastly,   was inclined to think that there was
                                   I
no solid foundation for the story upon which, in part at least,
Mr. Blumenbach has founded his theory.
     Itis certainly the prevailing opinion in this country, that
the black snake and other serpents, as well as the rattle
snake, are endowed with the faculty of fascinating or charm
ing other animals.             well known that none of the ser
                              It   is
pents except      the different  species of crotalus are furnished
with the crepitaculum cauda, or rattle, and no attempt has
been made to point out the difference          there be    (if
                                                           difference)           a
in the modes of fascinating employed                these several ser  by
pents, with the exception of the remark made bv                  few of                a
the Indians and Whites, that the rattlesnake charms with its
rattles. But we stiall afterwards fee that this             no means        is    by
the general opinion among the Indians or Whites.
    Since the printing of my memoir,           have been assured
                                                          I                                by

I  think, somewhat unphilosophical to ascribe       much to the                    so
"    hissing noise"       of the instrument as Mr. Blumenbach has
done,        "    This lazy animal, when lying on the ground, might
certainly," fays the professor, " employ that singular organ for
enticing animals, as well as the cerastes employs its horns for
the fame purpose, at least according to common report."
 I   will readily allow, that the cerastes of Egypt
                                              if            capable                     is
of charming        means of the horns upon his head, the rattle
                      by
snake might, without much stretch of the imagination, be
supposed capable of charming           means of the horny bells

lution of one difficulty                by
                               having recourse to another diffi
culty; or, rather, he seems disposed to cut the knot of fas
cination, as     respects the rattlesnake,

which has never been proved to be             fact, and which,       a                            I
cannot but think,         one of the many improbable tales in
                                  is

linus.    But, alas! how many hundred anile stories has Pliny
                              _
told and who does not know that Solinus

   In the discussion of curious questions like the present,                                       I
can feel pleasure even      furnishing my opponent with imple
                                       in

of mind will here mention
             I                     supposed fact, which
                                                  a           good                      is   a
deal similar to that related of the cerastes.         do not doubt                 I
that    it as worthy of belief.
             is                    There inhabits the lakes and
rivers of many parts of North America         very curious species   a
of esox or pike, which        commonly known
                                        is             the name of                 by
the gar fish or bill fish.    The upper jaw        lengthened out         is
into    long bony roll rum, or protuberance, which has given
        a
it the name of bill fijh.    Although this fish      known to live             is
almost entirely upon other fish, # to which he proves very de
structive, we are told that the gar hides himself in the reeds
in such      manner, that nothing but the curious rostrum,

themselves upon the reeds, mistaking the fish's bill for a reed,
 or dry piece of wood, perch upon it also.               He then opens his
mouth)         and   generally    makes   an  immediate     prey of the mis
guided       bird.
       This story is related by a very respectable writer, father
 Charlevoix, who adds a circumstance which I must not omit
 to mention, especially as it would seem to show that there
 is some hidden (we will call it a fascinating) virtue in the
           bill. The Indians fay, that the (harp teeth which are
     iftributed along the edges of this instrument are a " sove
 Sar's
 reign remedy against ihe head-ach, and that pricking with
 one of these teeth where the pain is stiarpest, takes it away
 instantly      V
       But to be serious : As most, if not all, a:iimals are fur
 nished with an organ of hearing, so it is not improbable that
 different sounds, particularly the sounds of musical instru
 ments, have something charming or attractive to certain spe
 cies of animals.          Passing by the stories that are told of the
  tricbeebus manatus,           or sea-cow, the common mouse, and
  some other animals, I will here mention a fact related by
  Dr. Odier on a very respectable authority, and I relate it the
  more confidently because it has been confirmed to me by se
  veral persons of credit.          The iguana f of the West Indies is
  said to be so fond of music, that at the sound of an instrument
  this ugly looking lizard becomes almost motionless, and is
  easily taken by a noose %.
       But I must return to Mr. Blumenbach.                 "  I know," says
      * A Voyage to North America, vol. i. pages 117 and 118. English
  translation.
       t  Lacerta iguana of Linnæus.
       % See Epistola Physiologica, Inauguralis.de Elementariis   Musicae Sensa-
  tionibus, Nora 31, Edinburgi 1770.         It were much to be wilhed that
  some ingenious man would favour us with a memoir concerning the in
  fluence of music upon different animals.        Some interesting materials foe
  such a work are to be found scattered through a number of writers both
  antient and modern.       But new materials might readily be collected, since
  it would not be a difficult task to make experiments. Much curious phy
  siological knowledge would result from such an inquiry: and I greatly
  mistake if the inquiry would not somewhat tend to diminish the quantity
  of our prejudices against animals that are unquestionably innocent. Should
   it have this effect, how great would be the gain to a benevolent mind !
   Nurtured among prejudices of different kinds, we are at once miserable
   and unjust.     1 must confess   that I have dropped some of my prejudices
   against the amphibia (See a Memoir, Sec. p. 45, note) since 1 have learned
   that the iguana is pleased with the music of the W«st Indians; and that
   a little garden lizard listened, " with a breathless attention," to the found
   of a lady's piano-forte. — For a very interesting instance of this kind, fee
   the Analytical Review for January 17J9.
                                                                             he,

           the Rattksnaie, and   other American Serpents.        197
 he,   " from   well-informed eye-witnesses, that it is one of the
common practices among the younger savages to hide them
selves in the woods, and, by counterfeiting the hissing of the
rattlesnake, to allure and catch the squirrels."       After quoting
this passage, I observed in my memoir, that " I have inquirea
of Indians, and of persons who have resided for a considerable
time among the Indians, and they appear to be as ignorant
of the circumstance as I am myself." I continued, " I am
inclined to think that Mr. Blumenbach has been imposed
upon," or, perhaps, that a circumstance which. I have re
lated may have given rife to the story*.          Mr. Blumenbach
has since informed me by letter, and now informs the public
in his Remarks, that he received his " information from
major Gardner, who, with his family, resided many years
in East Florida.       He is," fays the professor, " a very intel
ligent naturalist, an accurate observer, and certainly would
be very far from imposing upon me."
    I knew not, when I printed my memoir, from whom Mr.
Blumenbach received his information.           It was not, however,
 unnatural for me to suppose, that he had been            "  imposed
 upon," because I well know that some of the most respecta
 ble naturalists and historians of Europe have often been most
 grossly deceived by travellers who have visited this country:
 hence the many tales and scandalous stories which crowd
 and deform some of the works of your most celebrated wri
 ters.   Such tales and stories are the following : — That the
 Indians have no beards; that they have very small appetites;
 that they are greatly addicted to the " antiphyfical vice j"
 that none of the tribes knew any thing of the use of salt be
 fore the Europeans came among them; that they cannot carry
 their arithmetic beyond the numeral three ; &tc. 8cc. &c.
     I have lately made further inquiries of the Indians con
 cerning the stratagem which, Mr. Blumenbach fays, the
 younger savages employ to allure to them squirrels.            I can
 learn nothing concerning it. I am (till disposed to think that
 there is but a slender foundation for the story.       I am certain
 that it is not a common practice among the Indians. Persons
 who have resided for many years among our northern and
 western Indians have never heard of it : neither have intelli
 gent traders and interpreters from the very country in which
 major Gardner resided.       Anxious to ascertain the truth,        I
  shall extend my inquiries, and, should I learn that the In
 dians do actually employ the stratagem, I shall endeavour to
 be the first to inform Mr. Blumenbach of the success of my
 research.

I98             On the fascinating Faculty ascrihed    to
    I shall conclude this part of my letter with two observa
tions; viz.     1st,   If it be a fact, as I have asserted, that the
rattlesnake, while watching for his prey, seldom moves his
rattle, the story related by major Gardner must, independ
ently on any other facts, appear highly improbable.             2dly,
Even admitting the fact, that the rattlesnake does shake his
rattle while employed in the supposed act of charming, I
think the greater number of the favourers of the existence
of a fascinating quality in this serpent ought, upon a careful
consideration of the subject, to give up Mr. Blumenbach's
explanation of the business.           They tell you that the bird or
squirrel   is  often    seen  precipitating itself from the top of a
lofty  tree   into   the  jaws of the serpent lying at the bottom.
Now, is it likely that the noise of the rattle can be distinctly
heard at the distance of sixty, eighty, or a hundred feet, in
a forest where all else is not silence ; in a forest where rooks,
and ravens, and jays, wood-peckers, and many other species
of birds, utter their various cries or notes, which are mixed,
and often confounded, with the noise of tree-frogs, locusts,
and a hundred other animals ? I think, sir, you will admit
 with me, that it is very improbable, if not impossible, that
the rattle could affect the bird at such a distance; and I am
disposed to believe, that, after reading the preceding observa
tions, you will not think Mr. Blumenbach's svstem is so ca
 pable of being maintained as that ingenious gentleman seems
 to suppose it is.
    Mr. Blumenbach, in taking notice of niv theory of ac
 counting for the supposed fatcinatitig pi wer os serpents, in
 forms us, that with this method of explaining the phæno-
 menon he has been acquainted since 1785, from an essay by
 professor Michaelis, in the Gottingen Magazine for January
 of that year. Injustice to Dr. Michaelis, I sliall here quote
 his words, as they are given by Mr. Blumenbach : — " Others
 believe that it is owing merely to the care of the old ones for
 their young, which throw themselves between the latter and
 their enemies, and by these means become a prey to them.
 One of my friends, Mr. David Colden, at Flushing, an
 amateur of natural history, and son of governor Colden,
 whose service to science is so well known, assured me that he
 had several times seen birds fascinated by snakes, but always
 found the nest of the bird either with eggs or young ones in
 the neighbourhood ; which made the spectators give up the
 idea of fascination. But," Mr. Michaelis adds, " I know some
 instances where no nest could be in the neighbourhood, and
 where, though the snake was at first at a great distance from
 the bird, it nevertheless fell towards it.''

   From this quotation it appears that      was not the first  I
person who endeavoured to explain the supposed fascinating
power somewhat in the manner I have done. I have not
asserted that I was.  But I certainly neither did nor could
borrow the explanation from Mr. Michael       whose   valua        is,                "
ble essay," as Mr. Blumenbach calls          have never yetit,

seen.    My theory, which every day's inquiry serves to
strengthen, was the result of     great deal of attention to
                                                a
the subject    and  :have enjoyed as manv opportunities of
                             I
investigating the truth as Mr. Michaelis did.   With respect
to that ingenious gentleman, mould have allowed him more
                                          I
merit had he adopted Mr. Gulden's explanation and         can                ;            I
allow him very little for rejecting                 it,
                                             because, in some
                                      merely
instances, no nest could be found in the neighbourhood, and
because,        "
            though the snake was at first at great distance              a
from the bird,    nevertheless fell towards it."
                        it                            surely does            It
not follow, because no nest could be found, that none existed.
The schoolboy well knows the difficulty of discovering the
nests of many species of birds   and the naturalist, who ought
                                           ;
to be acquainted with the arts employed         these animals to by
conceal, from man and other enemies, their nests, should
make still greater allowance for the difficulty of discovering
 these nests.    As to Mr. Michaelis's other assertion, that,
 " though the snake was at first at great distance from the
                                                      a
bird,      nevertheless fell towards it,"      will not positively
      it, it
                                                           I
deny       until    learn whether that gentleman has himself
                        I
witnessed any thing of the kind.       But, in the meanwhile,                                 I
must say, that        have no reasons to think that
                         1                               have been           I

                                             I
ject in my memoir.
 I     do not perceive that Mr. Blumenbach has made any
other attempt to controvert mv theorv, except in           far as he             so
 has mentioned Mr. Michaelis's     two  observations  just noticed.
On the contrary, in the new edition of his Manual, the pro
 fessor has quoted my memoir, and expunged the story about
 the ringing of the serpent's tail *.   Of Mr. Michaelis's essay
 he makes no mention.        And here, before     adduce any adI
 ditional tacts         in
                    support ot my explanation,      cannot forbear I
 to observe, that      do not think Mr. Blumenbach has done
                         I

 fact communicated to me           the late Mr. Rittenhouse, of

    certainly favour the system which I have advanced.                  Inde
    pendently, however, of their connection with the subject of
    the memoir, they appear worthy of preservation ; for they
    serve to illustrate, in some degree, the history of the manners
     and instincts of serpents; a subject which has been too much
    neglected by naturalists.
         A species of coluber, which is commonly called the chicken
    snake in the southern parts of the United States, of which it
     is a native, frequently climbs up the loftiest trees in pursuit
     of young birds. One of my friends *, when he was in
     Georgia, several years since, had an opportunity of seeing
  ""one of these snakes in a situation which furnishes a striking
     argument in favour of my opinion. The active reptile having
     seized upon a young martin        j  (which had left its nest for some
     days), upon      a  walnut-tree,  at  the height of about thirty feet,
     had not a little difficulty in swallowing the young bird. Hav
     ing taken in the head first, as is commonly the cafe with our
     serpents, the bird made great resistance by the flapping of its
     wings, so that the serpent could only swallow the head and
     neck.     Whilst the wings of the bird were in motion, num
     bers of the old martins collecting together flew about the
     snake aud attacked him with their bills.               Here, as in the
     instance related by Mr. Rittenhouse, the old birds were ac
      tuated by the instinct of saving their young.
         The following facts were communicated to me by Mr.
   •
      John Heckewelder : — " In the summer of 1770," says this
      gentleman,
                      " while I was fishing under the bank of Le-
      heigh J, I heard, for the space cf near an hour, the sound
      of a ground-squirrel, seemingly in distress, on the top of the
      bank.     At length I went up to fee what was the matter with
      the squirrel; when, to my utter astonishment, 1 discovered
      the animal about half way up a bush, but running sometimes
      higher up, sometimes lower down, and a very large rattle
      snake at the root of the busti on which the squirrel was.
      Here I was immediately struck with the idea that the snake
      was in the act of inchauting, and I hoped now to become fully
      convinced that the rattlesnake obtained its prev altogether in
       this manner, as I had often heard reported.             I therefore fat
      down quietly on       a  log about   six yards distance, where I had

a   full view of both the snake and the squrirel.         Sometimes I
thought the squirrel going down for the last time, and to
enter the jaws of the snake ; but it would again return up the
bush with the same liveliness it had run down.          Finding,
finally, no material alteration in the squirrel or its motions,
and my patience being exhausted, I determined on killing
the snake, and examining into the case of the squirrel, viz.
what strength, &c. it yet retained after being charmed for so
long a time ; for, by this time, the supposed charm had lasted
near three hours.      I struck at the snake with a long pole,
but missed it ; upon which it ran down the bank where                  I
had been fishing.       Remaining by the bush on which the
squirrel was, I hailed a man on the opposite side of the river,
desiring him to cross in a canoe and kill the snake under the
 bank.      To which he immediately complied; but likewise
 miffing his stroke, on account of the bushes, the snake took
 up the bank again, where I killed it. We now both joined
 to shake the squirrel down; but it had both sense and strength
 enough to climb to the very top, I suppose near twenty feet
 high.      However, we brought it down to the ground ; and
 though it had fallen about two yards from the busti, it well
 knew its hole in which it dwelt, and this was at the root of
  the bu(h, and exactly at the spot where the snake had lain.
  Here the mystery was cleared up to us at once. We con
 jectured that the snake was either watching for the squirrel
  to come down to enter its hole, or for its companion or
  young, which were probably in the hole, to come out; all
  of which were sufficient to cause anxiety in the squirrel on
  the bush.    The dexterity, however, of the squirrel in making
  its way into the hole, and at the very place where we stood,
  showed plainly that it retained its full strength and sagacity,
  and had by no means suffered from the charm of the snake*."
      " A similar circumstance, to which 1 was also an eye
   witness, happened," fays Mr. Ilcckewelder, " in the year
   1771, near Wyalufing, on Susquehanna, where the cries of
   the chewinkf drew my attention to the spot.        The rattle
   snake was just entering a heap of brush, in which the old
   ones had their nest with young.    I supposed that one or the
   other of the old ones, with the young, would have become
   its prey, had I not approached and relieved them by killing
   the snake I."

  in my memoir":         — " In      the year 176a, at Tuscarawas, on
  Muskingum, while going to fetch water out of the river,                     I
  observed," savs Mr. Heckewelder,                  " a large black snake
  running    out   on  a  long   limb   of  a  large  tree  which stood on
 the water's edge. This limb was nearly horizontal over, and
 about twelve feet above the level of, the water.                I  could not,
 at first, conceive what the snake aimed at, until near the end
 of this limb I saw the animal stretch downwards, where                       I
 observed a hangings bird's nest, pretty well concealed be
 tween some small boughs or leaves, into which the snake put
 its head, having strung its tail, with part of its body, round
 the limb above.          Determined on killing the snake, if possi
 ble, I ran to the house for my gun, and shot the reptile,
 which fell into the river, with a young bird in its jaws."
     " I and another person once observed a snake of this kind
 run up a tree pretty high, and put its head into a woodpeck
 er's nest, where, as we supposed, it sucked the bird's eggs, it
 being too early for the young birds to be hatched                J."

 but shall proceed with my examination of Mr. Blumenbach's

 XXXVI.        Observations on (he different Theories        of Philosophers
    to explain the Pbanomena of Combustion.                 By   Charles
    Portal,       Esq.§
  J. HERE         is no phænomenon in nature that has hitherto
engaged     the  attention     of philosophers with less success in the
elucidation of its principles than that of combustion, and it
at present affords one of the chief obstacles to the forming of
a clear and satisfactory           theory of chemistry.        It is not sin
gular,   that  a subject    of  so  striking   a  nature,  and    abounding
with a variety os such important phænomena, stiould have
early attracted the attention of philosophers, and we accord
ingly find that it was made the subject of investigation by
lord Bacon and Mr. Boyle.
    These two philosophers were, however, more particularly
confined in their inquiries to the nature of the unknown ele
ment called sire, nor did they reach sufficiently far in such

                                                                    inquiries

inquiries as to frame any particular theory on the subject of
combustion.
   In referring back to the earlier periods of the history of
chemistry, we shall find that Becher was the first philosopher
who withdrew that science from the contracted limits of phar
macy and alchemy, and laid the foundation of the doctrine
of phlogiston.
   G. Ernest Stahl,       whose genius was formed for the highest
improvement of science, succeeded him ; and it is to this phi
losopher that we are indebted for the first positive attempt to
explain the phænomena, and to exhibit a regular theory of
combustion.
    The doctrine of phlogiston, as expounded by this cele
brated chemist, is too well known to require being described
at any considerable length.
    It proceeded on the assumption, that there was only one
substance in nature capable of combustion, which he there
fore called phlogiston} and he held, that all bodies that were
inflammable owed their combustibility only to the presence of
this principle.      Combustion, therefore, he considered merely
as its separation in the form of light and heat; and such bo
dies as were not inflammable were thought to be devoid of
it : for during the combustion of substances he taught that
their phlogiston flies off, and the incombustible parts of them
alone remain behind.          Thus, if iron be exposed to a suffi
ciently strong     heat   it wiH  undergo combustion, a complete
 alteration will take place in its constituent parts, and a resi
duum will be found left of an incombustible nature.
    Stahl explained these phænomena in the following way :
 Iron he considered as a peculiar earth united to a certain
proportion of phlogiston ; when it was made to undergo com
 bustion, the phlogiston which formed a part of           it,  and to
which  it    alone owed its combustibility, made its escape, and
there was left behind only the base, which was found to
 be no longer inflammable.          Now, as this separation was     al
 ways attended with the emission of light and heat, phlogiston
 was considered only as heat and light combined with some
other species of matter in   a    peculiar and unknown way.
    This doctrine was considered as deriving much support from
 the fact, that    a body, after having undergone combustion,
(i.   by
     e.    the dissipation of its phlogiston
                                           in   the form of light and
 heal,) was converted into   a    bodv that was no longer combus
 tible, but which might again have its combustibility restored
 by   the addition of any inflammable matter.          Thus, in the
example before adduced,      if,   after the iron has undergone the
                                                                process

204          On the different Theories  of Philosophers
process  of combustion, and formed a residuum that is incom
bustible, we heat this latter substance with charcoal (an in
flammable body), the metal will be again, revived — phlogiston
is imparted to it from the charcoal, and we again procure a
combustible substance.      Thus, the light and heat which are
evolved during combustion are supposed to proceed from the
burning body, and to be occasioned by the separation of
phlogiston from the base to which it is united.
    Such is the outline of that theory of combustion the foun
dation of which was first laid by Becher, and afterwards re
duced into a regular system by the immortal Stahl.              The
phlogistic doctrine of this chemist was universally adopted
until the middle of the present century, when the discoveries
of Mayow and Hooke, of Priestley and Lavoisier, led the
way to a new theory of combustion, which soon displaced
the former, and established itself on its ruins.        Stahl, from
being wholly occupied    in demonstrating   the  existence  of phlo
giston,  seems  to  have   paid no  attention  to  the influence   of
air on combustion. The experiments of Boyle and of Hales
had already pointed out the influence of this element on many
of the phænomena of combustion, and the increase of weight
that bodies acquire during such a process, is a fact totally
irreconcileable with the theory of phlogiston.
   Many attempts, however, were made to overcome the
weight of this objection by the disciples of Stahl ; and they
even had recourse to the supposition that phlogiston was the
principle of levity, and that, when abstracted from any body,
that body, by losing so much absolute levity, became heavier.
So strongly were they fettered by the tenets of their master,
that, without submitting to the labour of investigation, they
implicitly adopted any illustration that was conformable to
his ideas ; affording a strong proof of the desire that pervades
the human mind to reduce everything to first principles, and
to adopt hasty generalizations, without having recourse either
to an extensive collection of facts or the more certain evi
dence of accurate experiment.
    Whilst other chemists were intent on reconciling the va
rious discoveries that had been recently made with the hy
pothesis of Stahl, Lavoisier (of a bold and creative genius)
was led to call into question the very existence of phlogiston
itself.  This arose from his- having discovered that during the
process of combustion a portion of air constantly enters into
union with the body which is made to undergo this opera
tion, and that the weight of the air which disappears in the
process is exactly equal to the increase of weight gained by
                                                                 iho

              to  explain the Phenomena of Comhujiion.         aOJ
the body that has undergone combustion.            These important
facts led to the adoption of a new theory of combustion well
known at present by the name of its illustrious author.
    The theory of Lavoisier is founded on the absorption of
oxygen by a combustible body, and proceeds upon the fol
lowing principles :
     ist, That combustion never takes place without the pre
sence    of oxygen gas.
     adly, That in every combustion there is an absorption of
 oxygen gas.
     3aly, That there is an augmentation of weight in the pro
 ducts of combustion equal to the gas absorbed ; that the oxy
 gen likewise imbibed by the combustible body may be again
 recovered from the compound formed, and the weight re
 gained will be equal to the weight which disappeared during
 combustion.                                             ,
      And, lastly, That in all cases of combustion there is a dis
 engagement of light and heat.
      These facts have been established by the most accurate ex
 periments, and are too well known to require any further
 illustration ; they incontrovertibly prove the general princi
 ple, "that combustion is only a play of affinities between ox
 ygen gas, caloric, and the base of the combustible body. It is
  a further part of this theory, that the light and caloric which
  are evolved during combustion proceed from the oxygen gas,
  and that they are not emitted, as should follow from the phlo
  gistic doctrine, from the combustible body.
      As this theory, however beautiful, is not capable of ex
  plaining with clearness and accuracy many of the phæno-
  mena of combustion, Dr. Thomson, of Edinburgh, has
  lately (fee Nicholson's Journal, New Series, for May and
  June 1803,) offered another which places this subject in a
  point of view somewhat different, and which certainly bids
  fair to enable us to estimate the phænomena of combustion
   with more success than has hitherto been done. Chemists
  have been lately accustomed to give to the term combustion,
   according to the foregoing theory, a new meaning, and to
   make it stand for the general combination of a body with
   oxygen.       Nothing, however, can be more evident than the
   difference that in numberless instances prevails between the
   act of oxygenation of bodies and that of combustion, inas
   much as neither the phænomena attending them, nor the
   results arising therefrom, are the fame.
       It is probable that this error has arisen from the considera
   tion that all bodies during their combustion combine with
   oxvgen, without at the fame time recollecting that this latter
                                                               effect

io6                  On   the different    Theories   of Philosophers
effect may be produced without any of the phænomena usu*
ally attendant on combustion; and that, though certainly all
combustion presupposes the combination of oxygen with a
base, yet this combination may be, and repeatedly is, effected
where no combustion can possibly take place.
   It is the object, therefore, of Dr. Thomson's theory to
point out the difference which in numberless instances pre
vails between the act of oxygenation of bodies and that of
combustion, and particularly to account, in a more satisfac
tory manner than has hitherto been done, for the emission
that takes place during combustion of light and caloric. The
two following are the leading positions of the doctor's theory:
    I ft, That during combustion all combustibles emit light,
which previously formed         necessary ingredient to their own
                                      a
composition: and,
    adly, That the heat which        evolved during the process of
                                             is
combustion proceeds from the decomposition of oxygen gas.
    It has been before observed, that                  by
                                              the phlogistic theory
the light and heat are supposed to proceed from the combus
tible body but that by the theory of Lavoisier they are held
                 ;
to proceed from the decomposition of oxygen gas, of which
body they are considered as forming constituent parts.
    In the infancy of chemical knowledge, and before the dis
covery of vital air, that the extrication of heat proceeded from
the combustible body, was the only natural conclusion that
could present itself to the mind        and as light and heat were
                                              ;
considered as only modifications of the fame substance, the
supposition of course prevailed that both were evolved from
the inflammable body.
    Since, however, the later experiments of philosophers, and
particularly those of Drs. Herschel and Woolaston, have dis
proved this supposed identity,        evidently becomes no longer
                                             it
necessary   to trace  these  two  substances   to the fame source;
and this, as       before stated,
                     is              the cafe with the theory we
                                             is
are now reviewing.
   That ihe caloric which       evolved during combustion should
                                      is
proceed from the decomposition of the oxygen gas,           amongst     is,
a  vai icty of other reasons, rendered the more probable from
the consideration that bodies possess       greater (hare of caloric
                                                      a
in the gaseous state than in any other; and consequently the
probability          is
                  greatly strengthened,    that the heat which                is
evolved during the procels of combustion proceeds rather
from the oxygen gas than from the inflammable matter, and
that  it    from the condensation of oxygen gas that caloric
            is                                                                is
chiefly evolved      or, according to the explanation of Lavoi
                          ;
sier, that the oxygen of the gas, possessing        stronger affinity
                                                             a
                                                                  for

             to   explain the Phænomena    of Combustion.         20J
for the base of the combustible body than for caloric, is
thereby attracted, and that the heat combined with it is con
sequently set at liberty, and diffuses itself among the adjacent
bodies.
  To      the second    position    of Dr. Thomson, that the light
invariably proceeds        from  the  combustible body, and not from
the oxygen gas, there are much stronger objections, and such
as, with our present collection of chemical facts, are, I ap
prehend, not readily to be explained.
    It is a part of the theory of the doctor, that oxygen gas
possesses no light : indeed this is so material a part, that, unless
it can be substantiated, the theory is inadequate to elucidate
the phænomena intended by it.
    How shall we, however, reconcile the following facts on
the above supposition ? If nitric acid be exposed to the light,
it changes colour; it first grows yellow, afterwards green, and
lastly red, and oxygen gas is disengaged ; and on examining
the acid we find that it is converted from nitric into nitrous
acid.
    It is evident that, as this decomposition is of a chemical
nature, the light that occasions it either combines with the
oxygen to form oxygen gas, or with the acid to form nitrous
 acid : that the latter is not the cafe we are justified in sup
 posing, because we find no difference between acid so pro
 cured and that gained by any other means, and we are neces
sitated to conclude that the light has combined with the
 oxygen, and that the latter is by this mean converted into
oxygen gas.         The fame reasoning may be applied to the
 conversion of oxygenated muriatic acid by light into simple
 muriatic acid.        Unless these facts can be otherwise satisfac
 torily  accounted     for, the position of Lavoisier still remains
 with   all its   force,    that light is a constituent part of oxygen
 gas.    That   light   forms   a necessary part in the constitution of
 many    bodies,    is a  fact  too well authenticated to be refuted.
 The experiments of the Dutch chemists, who heated together
 the filings of different metals with sulphur under mercury ;
 the phænomena of the pyrophori ; the inflammation that
 takes place from the action of many of the acids on the oils;
 and the recent experiments of Dr. Hulme, illustrate this fact
 beyond the possibility of contradiction.
    After a body has undergone combustion, we learn from
 this theory that it is deprived of light, and that it is only by
 means of a combustible body that light can be again trans
 ferred to the product of combustion.             Thus water is consi
 dered by Dr. Thomson as a product of combustion, and
 consequently deprived of light.          If,  says he, we decompose
                                                                    this

 this water by means of iron or zinc, we restore it to it»
 former combustibility by occasioning it to imbibe light,
 which is afforded it by the metal. If such decomposition is
 effected by means of iron, 73 parts of this latter unite with
 27 of oxygen.     Now, as every 27 parts of oxygen require
 about four of hydrogen to form water, of course these four
 parts of hydrogen are liberated during such decomposition :
 but, as it is not probable that combustibles are capable of
 combining with light in all proportions, it may be asked,
 Whether the 73 parts of iron which are oxidated contain
just light enough, and no more, to restore the combustibility
 of the four parts of hydrogen ? for, if there be too much for
 that purpose, the superabundant quantity ought to become
 visible; and if too little, a part only of the hydrogen should
 recover its combustibility, and be converted into gas.        The
 fame reasoning may of course be urged with regard to the
decomposition of water by any other metal j for it is some
 what singular, that the combustible should always contain
 and give out the precise quantity of light that is sufficient to
 restore combustibility to the base of the product of combus
tion, and in no case either more or less. These, as well as
some other objections to the above theory, were pointed out
by me in a paper entitled Remarks on Dr. Thomson's
Theory of Combustion, and inserted in Nicholson's Journal
for the month of July 1802.
    It should appear, then, that we arc not in possession of a suf
ficient collection of facts to enable us to form any theory of
combustion that is perfectly free from objection, and calcu
lated to explain all the phænomena attendant on it.          Whe
ther the light evolved during combustion is emitted from the
combustible body or from the oxygen gas, must still be con
sidered as a matter of doubt ; for the supposition seems per
haps the more probable, that it is partly derived from both.
The subtile nature of light itself is highly adverse to any in
quiry into its real essence. The fame observation will like
wise apply to caloric.     The theory last noticed    is, however,
possessed ofa    high degree of merit;  it  satisfactorily explains
many phænomena that were before but little understood             ;   it
points out, with sufficient perspicuity, the difference that
prevails between the act of oxygenation in bodies and that
of combustion and though certainly liable to some objec
                ;
tions,it   approximates the nearest to   a   satisfactory explana
tion of the phænomena of combustion of any that have hi
therto been offered.

 which he attributes to Dr. Thomson as its author was first
 proposed by Dr. Gren, whose doctrine is briefly as follows:
     Oxygen gas is composed of oxygen and caloric— Combustible
bodies consist of their respective bases in chemical combination
 with the matter of light — Free light consists of the matter of
light united to caloric.
    Combustion, then, is a mere play of chemical affinities;
the oxygen of the oxvgen gas uniting with the base of the
inflammable body to form an oxide or an acid, while the
caloric of the gas unites with the matter of light of the com

XXXVII.       History of Astronomy for the Year 1803. Read in
    the Athenæum     of Paris December 30, by Jerome La-
    LANDE.
                       [Concluded from p. 179.]
 \JN      the 7th  of June I publistied the two last volumes of
the   large  History of the Mathematics by Montucla. The
fourth is almost entirely devoted to the history of astronomy
and navigation, which I communicated to the present period.
   There has appeared also, in two volumes quarto, with 23
plates, Hi'loire de la Mefure da Temps far les tiorloges, by
Ferdinand Berthoud, mechanist of the marine, member of
the National Institute, and of the Royal Society of London.
It contains a description of escapements, compensation ba
lances, moving spheres, and of the principal inventions of
clock-work. The author speaks of all the celebrated clock-
makers, except Louis Berthoud, his nephew, to whom we are
indebted for all the time-keepers made since 1784.         I shall
here take occasion to observe, that Mr. Emery died at Lon
don, and that his widow has four time-keepers which she
wishes to dispose of: they would be a valuable acquisition.
    We have received the 7th volume of the Transactions of
the Royal Irish Academy, publistied in 1800, and in which
Mr. V oung examines the solution given by Newton of the
problem respecting precession of the equinoxes ; also the 8th
volume of the Iri(h Transactions, Dublin 1802.

    The third volume of the M.'canique          Celeste of C. Dela-
place   has been printed,      and  was published   on the 29th of
December.        This work will form an epoch in physical astro
nomy.      It exhibits a series of important researches by that
great geometrican, and the perturbations of each of the pla
nets by the action of all the rest ; with a new theory of the
moon, containing, besides other things, the discovery of a
new inequality the period of which is 180 years, and of which
I  have already spoken.
    M. Haflenfratz has published his Ccurs de Physique Ce
leste, or Lemons fur I' Exposition du Syjleme du Monde.            He
makes no mention in it of my Astronomy, but he neverthe
less has borrowed from it things which he could not find any
where else.      I have corrected some faults in it. (Bibliotbeque
Fran^oife   de Pougens.)
   The Board of Longitude        has sent to the printing-office ob
servations   made    for two years with the new instruments of
the observatory by Mechain and Bouvard, to be printed in
folio like those which Monnier published between 1751 and
1773, and those of Greenwich in England, which were
worthy of serving as a model.
    On the 3d of July M. de Rofel, a naval officer, arrived at
Paris with the journals of the voyage undertaken in search
of La Pcrouse, under the command of captain d'Entrecas-
teaux.
   La Grandiere also has brought a journal of that voyage,
which the English government had a year in their hands,
but which they restored to him. At the depot of the marine
there are 58 charts constructed during that voyage by Beau-
tcmps-Beaupre, hvdrographcr of the expedition.
    In the month of June I received intelligence from C. Ber-
nier, who was at New Holland.            Captain Baudin touched
only in two places in an extent of 400 leagues which he tra
versed on the western coast. He was preparing to accomplim
the remaining part of the expedition to the north and south :
but it appears to me that the zeal of this astronomer has been
thwarted by the indifference of t!je captain ; and this voyage,
on which we sounded great hopes, will not be so productive
as it ought to be.
    The (nip Lady Nelson, sent out with the Investigator, cap
tain Flinders, which arrived at New Holland about the mid
dle of December 1801, fell in with the Geographe, com
manded by Baudin.           She then found at Port Jackson the
Naturaliste, commanded by Hameliu, and which sailed
about the middle of May to go in search of the Geographe,
from which she had been separated by a gale of wind in the
                                                               Straits

servations,   and a chart   of those parts  of New Holland which
he visited.
    Captain Flinders made a discovery between Van Diemen's
Land     and New South Wales, of which information was re
ceived in March 1802 : Governor King's Island, Cape Alban
Otway, Portland Bay, Cap'e Northumberland.
    Joseph Joachim de Ferrer has sent me several positions ob
served on the Mississippi and on the Ohio, which will be of
the more importance as the French government is employed
with the means of deriving benefit from that new colony,
which may be attended with immense advantages, as Rayn;>l
has stiown in his Hijioire Pbilofopbique.
    The Voyage to the Northern Part of Asiatic Russia, the
Frozen Ocean, the Sea of Anadir, and the Coasts of Ame
rica, from 1785 to 1794, by commodore Billings, translated
 by Castcra, in two volumes quarto, has made us acquainted
with countries before unclescribed or defined.         The shores of
the Kousim have been traversed : a chart by M. Bauer, and
Arrovvsmith, the English geographer, is added.           The officers
complain     of the commanJer,      who  would   not  allow  them to
 penetrate   further  north,   notwithstanding   the  instructions  he
 had received to search for a passage through the Frozen,
 Ocean.
     Travels into the interior Parts of Africa in 1797 and 1798,
 by Frederic Horncman, has been published.                 Horneman
 proceeded   from   Cairo  lo  Mazoul.      Another  French   edition,
 with additions by C. Langles, is in forwardness.
     Geography has been enriched also by A Voyage to Senegal
 bv C. Durand, one volume in quarto, with many plates.
 The author was a long time at Senegal; and I have men
 tioned his researches in a memoir on Africa.
     M. Sutzen, a physician, accompanied by M. Jacobzen, a,
 surgeon, is also preparing to penetrate into the interior parts
 of Africa. They have been furnished with observations by
 baron Von Zaeh, of Gotha.           The duke of Gotha has given
 them a sextant os seven inches radius, and a time-keeper by
 Emery; three artificial horizon-;, with their levels; an achro
 matic telescope of twenty inches, and two and a quarter
 inches aperture ; a declination compass, a mariner's compass,
 and    a camera obscura.
     M. Sutzen will    proceed from Constantinople to the eastern
 coast of Africa, where he intends to join some of the cara
 vans of Zinguebar or Monœmugi.              He hopes to be four or
 five years absent. (Von Zach's Journal for August 1802.)

will embark in England for Morocco, and will follow the
route of the caravans of the interior.
    Voyages a Madagascar, aux hides Orientates, et a Maroc,
by Alexis Rochon, a celebrated astronomer and geographer,
have appeared in three volumes.
    The general depot of war at Paris continues its labours
with surprising activity, as may be seen in the Moniteur of
June 25 and October 16. Generals Calon, Clark, and An-
dreoffy, who had the direction of it in succession, have been
                                                               ¦
succeeded by general Samson.
    The map ot the country between the Adige and the Adda
will soon be followed by maps of all Piedmont, of the Ita
lian republic, and of the island of Elba : those of Bavaria,
Helvetia, of the Valais, and of the four departments of the
Rhine, are continued.        More than a hundred geographical
engineers    are employed, among whom are the celebrated
Nouet, Henry, and Tranchot.
    On the 1st of July M. Henry quitted Bavaria, disgusted by
the opposition of M. Bonne. The latter is still occupied with
the map of Bavaria ; but we lose the measurement of a de
gree, which M. Henry proposed to make.            However, we
shall have from the Scheldt to the Adige, and from Brest to
Munich, an uninterrupted trigonometrical outline, which
will soon be silled up with a complete topography. A map of
Egypt in fifty sliects, and those of the Morea and neighbour
ing isles, are now engraving. Materials are collecting for maps
of Saint Domingo and of Louisiana.
   The beautiful map des cbaffes, a master piece of engraving,
of which only five sheets were terminated, will be carried
to thirteen.
    A plan is even in agitation for making a new and correct
edition of the large map of France in 183 (beets, which had
been too much neglected.        In the mean time, thirty are re
touching.
    The collection of manuscript charts at the depot, which
already amounts to 7400, daily increases.       C. Baibier-Du-
bocage, already known by his important labours, turns them
to the best advantage possible; and the depot of war, encou
 raged by the government, is about to produce to geography
immense riches.
    The first number of a topographical and military memo
rial, edited at the general depot of war, has been publislied
for November 1802. It contains a notice respecting the geo
graphical charts; a treatise on geodesic operations; tables for
                                                        reducing

    C. Nouet, who arrived from Egypt on the 5th of January,
 has already set out for Mount Blanc, where he will continue
 the laborious operations which he began in 1796.
    The Russians are going to construct a map of Esihonia and
 Volhynia.
    M.  Weiss has terminated his map of Swisscrland in sixteen
 meets.
    A  beautiful chart of the southern part of the geometrical
survey, by captain Mudge and Mr. Dalby, has been engraved
in England in four sheets.
    M. Ciccolini has made a tour to the coasts of the Adriatic,
where he has verified the positions of a great number of
points.    In regard to Pezaro there was an error of 30" in
 time.
    The travels of baron Von Zach, so useful to the geography
of Germany, are detailed in the excellent journal which he
 publishes every month.
    M. Mentelle has undertaken for the First Consul a terres
trial globe a metre in diameter, which will contain all the
new discoveries collected with great care and erudition.
    On the 26th of March I obtained permission to found at
the Institute a prize, to be assigned to the person who, in the
course of the vear, shall make the most curious observation, or
publish the most useful memoir, in regard to astronomy.
    C. Chaptal, whom we have the good fortune to have for
minister of the interior, and whose labours as a philosopher
announce his zeal as a minister, has attached calculators to
the Board of Longitude; he has granted gratifications to
C. Flaguergues, an assiduous observer, and to C. Pon%
keeper of the observatory of Marseilles, who discovered a se
cond comet.
    When the consultation establissicd for distributing rewards,
and which was very useful in 1793 and 1794, was suppressed,
the Institute was charged to take up the (ame business, and
to propose to government the gratifications it would be ne
cessary to give.    The Institution has not yet exercised this
right, but I have proposed to it to fulfil its obligation.
    M. .lacotot, professor of astronomv at Dijon, has obtained
from C. Giraudet, prefect of La Cote-d'or, the repairs ne
cessary for the observatory damaged by a fire.         I hoped I
should have been able to observe there the eclipse of the sun
on the 28th of August: but the sky was absolutely cloudy,
as it was at Paris.    We have received observations of that

    Prince Henry of Wirtemberg,         brother of the empress
dowager of Russia, who resides at Hamburgh, has purchased
the beautiful instruments made by Megnie, of Paris.
    The speculum for a telescope, which Dr. Herschel sent to
Petersburgh, has been sent back to him for the purpose of
being mounted.       Kramp solicits for the establishment of an
observatory   at Cologne.
    The academy of Turin requeststhe re-establishmentofits ob
servatory ; and M. Henry has offered to take the direction of it.
    Fathers Canovai and Delricco, who have at Florence the
 observatory of father Ximencs, have sent us a list of their
  nstruments, to prove that they cannot exert themselves with
any advantage for astronomy ; but they have published tables
of logarithms.
    The king of Etruria has announced that he still entertains
 a design of placing an astronomer in his Cabinet de Pbjjique,
 where he has already some excellent instruments.
    General Chabert, who has returned from England after
 an absence often years, has been associated with the Board
 of Longitude, to which office he was justly entitled by his
 geographical labours ; and his age of sixty-eight years dots
 not prevent him from being present at the sittings, and from
 being useful by his advice and experience.
    The youngest son of our celebrated astronomer C. Mechain
 has been appointed by- the Board of Longitude secretary of
 the observatorv, which affords him an opportunity of de
 voting himself to astronomy. Augustine Francis .Mechain was
 born at Paris, March 5, 1786.
    He has succeeded his brother Isaac, who having returned
 from Egypt has been appointed commissioner ol foreign rela
 tions at Galasia, in Moldavia.
    C. Lechevalier has constructed in the Hotel of Foreign
 Relations a small observatory, where he can gratify the taste
 and curiosity of which he gave proofs during his stay at Con
 stantinople.
    C. Louis Berthoud has constructed for the observatory a
 clock worth a thousand crowns.       The pivots turn in rubies,.
 and we hope it will equal that given by the First Consul to,
 the observatory of Milan.
     C. Pons, a watchmaker of great skill and ingenuity, made
 an experiment at my observatory of a clock which beats half
 seconds with a free icapement, and which goes with wonder
 ful regularity.

  C. Lev£que has published, in the fourth volume of the
Memoirs or the Institute, a learned paper on the longitude,
and particularly on Maignon's charts for reducing the moon's
distances observed at sea.
   C. Richer has made a new trigonometric compass, or com
pass for reducing the moon's distances from the stars. It has
ingenious inventions for dividing into unequal parts the rules
containing the distance, the sum, and the difference of the
heights.   In my short Treatise of Navigation     have given          I
a description of the instrument which gained the prize in
1
  791 ; and in the Connotffance des Temps for the year 4, the
demonstration of the formula of M. de la Grange, which
serves   as a   foundation for this instrument; which, however,
has been much improved         : the only inconvenience    that            is,
itwill cost 600 francs.
    Mr. Troughton has finished the model of Menoza's circle,
which gives the double of the multiple of Borda's circle, even
retaining the smallest fixed mirror.
    A curious detail respecting the calendar of the Indians has
been published in the letters of the abbe Sevin.
    C. Girard read in the Institute long memoir on the Egyp
                                           a

which shows that the antient measurement of the earth                                by
Eratosthones was very correct.
    The abbe Testa has published at Rome dissertation on        a
the zodiac found at Dendara (in Greek, Tenthvris) in Egypt.
He undertakes to prove that               itnot older than 300 years
                                               is

the Egyptian taste, and though some hieroglyphics are carved
out on the walls, has an evident relation to the arts of Greece.
For my part, I have remarked by the engraving of M. De
non that Cancer is inscribed in two lines, at the beginning
of the descending signs and at the end of the ascending ;
which proves that the solstice was towards the middle of
Cancer; and this carries it back 3000 years.             But I have
shown in my Astronomy that Eudoxus, who wrote 370 years
before our æra; and Aratus, who followed Eudoxus, described
the sphere according to an older tradition, which goes back
twelve or thirteen hundred years before the vulgar æra, and
which came from Egypt or India.           Petau, Whiston, Freret,
and Legentil, found nearly the fame date : it is therefore na
tural to believe that it fliould be found in the zodiac of Ten-
thyris, which consequently, in this respect, may be consi
dered as a work of the Greeks.
   C. Villoison, well known by his Greek erudition, has ce
lebrated astronomy in Latin verses, which announce both his
talent for Latin poetry and his taste for astronomy. He ad
dressed them to me on my birth-day,         and publistied them in
the Magazin Encyclopedique.          In the notes he speaks of the
labours of the uncle, the nephew, and niece ; and of citizen
Burckhardt, their most learned co-operator and their most
intimate friend.
   C. Boulage, of Trove, has written a beautiful epistle to
Piazzi on the discovery of his planet : it has been inserted in
the fourth number of the Memoirs of the Academical Society
of the department of Aube.
   Astronomy this year has lost the respectable Augustin
Darquier, member of the National Institute.           He was born
at Toulouse, November 23, 1718, and died on the ioth of
                   '
January 1802.         He devoted himself early to astronomy
through    natural  inclination.   Though in a town distant from
 the capital, he applied to it with a zeal and activity which
were not lessened by age.        He purchased instruments, esta
blished an observatory in his own house, and caused two vo
lumes of observations to be printed at his own expense. His
translation of Lambert's Cosmologic Letters has been printed
at Amsterdam.        He instructed pupils, paid calculators, and
 being  in no need   of the assistance of government he was in
debted for every thing to himself.         I have printed his last
observations   in my Histoire Celeste; they go as far as the
 19th of March 1798; and he had some more to send me,
though 80 years of age. The Lyceum of Toulouse will give
us some further particulars respecting his long and interesting
•areer.

    Astronomy lost also in France, on the xst of March,
M.     Lemery, whose singular turn for calculation I discovered
thirty years ago.       Being then attached to the marquis De
Pusieux, he employed all his leisure lime in calculation.       I
made him calculate a great many places of the moon, which.
were published in 1777 in the Connoijsance des Temps for
1779: and for fifteen years he made all the calculations of
that work with equal care and assiduity.
     Daniel Bogdanich died at Pest, in Hungary, on the 31st
of January, at the age of 37. He was occupied with the
geography of Hungary. (See Von Zaoh's Journal for April
 1802.)
     M. George Frederic Kordenbusch, astronomer of Nurem
berg, died on the 3d of April, at the age of 71.
     In the month of September baron De Vega was drowned
 in the Danube, and it is supposed threw himself into that
 river.    We are indebted to him for the large edition of
 Vlacq's tables of logarithms in folio, containing the numbers
 to 100,000 ; and the fines from ten lo ten seconds, which had
 become very rare, and in which he corrected many faults.
     Meteorology has this year exhibited very extraordinary
  phænomena.        In the month of January an extraordinary
  inundation : the Seine rose 22 feet and a half above the
  height of 1719.
     On the 23th of May a frost, which did immense hurt to,
  the productions of the earth.
     On the 14th of May snow fell at Munich, and continued
  for forty-five hours : the trees were stripped of their leaves,
  and overturned.
      In the months of July and August an excessive heat took
  place, and continued forty days.       The thermometer at the
  observatory stood at 970 F., which is very uncommon at Paris.
     The need of having meteorological rules founded on ob
  servation,   induced our learned minister to establish a corre
  spondence on that subject, and an office to conduct it.
      Meteorological observations    have been made in thirty
  places, from the convent of Mount Cenis as far as the
   borders  of the sea.
      John Dominic Beraud, born in 1741, formerly a drafts
   man at Coni, and who for twenty years has resided at Turin,
   continues to employ himself in making meteorological ob
   servations, and sends us regularly his results.
      Lafon, geographical engineer in Louisiana, has sent us
   meteorological observations made at New Orleans ; and we
   ^ave received some made at Guadeloupe by C. Hapel La-

      C. Coulomb read in the Institute experiments on     the me
  thod of magnetizing needles to saturation ; with a compara
  tive view of the methods of Knight, Duhamel, and Æpinus.
  He has pointed out to navigators the surest means of obtain
  ing the best needles. The broadest and largest are preferable,
  but they must not be thick.     This philosopher has published
  in the fourth volume of the Institute a curious memoir on
 the dipping needle.
     The declination of the magnetic needle at Paris was ob
 served by C. Bouvard at the observatory, on the ad of May,
 to be 22° 3', and on the 22d of July 210 45'.
     C. Lenoir, at the Garden of the Depot de la Marine,
 sound it on the 20th of June to be 220 6' with a compass,
 on which he employed every care possible.       But the changes
 which take place at the different hours of the day, and in dif
 ferent months of the year, amount to more than io'.          We
 can therefore only fay that the declination is 22°, and it was
 found to be the fame in 1792 and 1800; so that at present it
 appears to be stationary, whereas ten years ago it increased
 from 67 to 8' annually.
     Forty years ago I observed it to be j8^°. (See Connoijsance
 ihs Temps for 1762.)
     M. Simonin, professor of Croisic, has sent us the result of
 a thousand observations on the tides, with the tables neces
sary for keeping an account of the variations produced by the
fun and moon according to their altitude and distance.
     M. Romme, professor of Rochfort, has sent to the Institute
observations made every three minutes from low water to full
moon to make known the irregularities, which are very sin
gular ; and a new table of the retardation of the tides, de
duced from an immense number of observations.
     He has presented also a general table of the tides, the cur
rents, and winds, observed in all the seas of the earth ; the
publication of which will form an important supplement to
the large Treatise on the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, which
I   published in 1781.
    Mr. Grenier, an officer known by his discoveries in the
Indian seas, has written a considerable work on the winds
and currents in all the seas; with a theory which renders the
explanation of them easier. He proposes to lay it soon besorf
the public.

XXXVIII.      On the Disappearance             of Saturn's Ring in                 the
           Year 1803.  By Professor            J. E. Bodb*.
 J.  HE plane of Saturn's ring, as is well known, during
the whole of his revolution of thirty years round the fun, re
tains its parallelism, and intersects the plane of the ecliptic
in 17 degrees of Pisces and of Virgo at an angle of 31 J°.
The necessary consequence, therefore,                 is,
                                                    that the northern
fide of the ring  is illuminated for fifteen years           by
                                                           the oblique
rays of the fun, and then the southern for the same period.
It  must also happen, that in the above places the plane of the
ring passes twice through the fun          each revolution, at which
                                          in
time   the  edge of the  ring only   isilluminated.      But the edge
or thickness of the ring Geing too small to admit of its being
seen from the earth on account of the great distance of Sa
 turn, the ring becomes invisible.        For fifteen years the earth
and   the  fun are on  the fame side of  the  ring, which     the illu
                                                                    is
minated fide, and therefore the ring during that period                             is
always visible; but      little before, and at that period when
                         a
the plane of the ring passes through the fun, or when Sa
turn's heliocentric place     isin 170 of x or of n# in the ascend
ing   or  descending   nodes   of  the ring, the earth and the fun
may first be on one side and then on the other side of the
ring.    In the first cafe, as long as its plane does not pass
through the fun     itwill be visible from the earth but in the;
other cafe it  will be invisible. The earth, therefore, can then
pass several times through the plane of the ring, at which
time the ring will appear like       aright line, or be entirely in
visible the consequence of which
       ;                                        is,
                                              that the ring will be
alternately visible and invisible.
    This alternation of disappearing and reappearing will be
exhibited   by  the ring     inthe year 1803.     The sun, having
illuminated the south side of the ring since October 1789,
will pass through the plane of in the month of June 1803,
                                     it
and will illuminate the northern fide, when Saturn passes
 heliocentrically the ascending node of his ring         and in the
                                                               ;
 mean time the plane of the ring will pass three times through
 the earth, which will be first on the fide illuminated          the          by
 fun, and then on the opposite or darkened side;              conse      in
 quence of which the ring seen from the earth will be twice
 visible and invisible in the course of few months.

placed in Saturn.    This figure, then, exhibits the exact in
clination of the plane of the ring to the ecliptic ; the appa
rent motion of the earth and the fun, as seen from Saturn,
together with the time of the passage of these planets through
the ascending node of his ring. (See Plate V. fig. a.)
    AB is the ecliptic seen from Saturn in the sign of Pisces,
and divided into degrees.      The ascending node of Saturn's
ring seen from thence is placed in 170 6', in which point the
  lane of the ring intersects the ecliptic at an angle of 310 20'.
?'he eye is then in that plane. Thus the ring appears as a
straight line; nn is the north side, and zz the south fide of
it. The dotted line CD is the solar orbit seen from Saturn ;
and the sun's place is marked in it on the first day of each
month, from November 1802 to October 1803. These places
of the fun are directly opposite to the heliocentric places of
Saturn : the longitude thus differs six signs, and the northern
latitude of Saturn seen from thence changes into the southern
of the sun. In this manner, the fun in November, Decem
ber, January, and to the month of June, illuminates the south
fide of the ring; but always in a fainter manner, the nearer
he comes to the plane of it. On the 13th of June he passes
through the plane in e. The ring at that time is illuminated
on the edge, and can be seen only by powerful telescopes as
a fine luminous line.
    The longitude of the point e, reduced to the ecliptic, falls
iny, or 20' 42' of Pisces. The fun, then, about the middle
of June begins to illuminate the northern fide of the ring;
in July, August, September, October, &c. he recedes more
and more from the plane of the ring, and the illumination of
jt   then becomesstronger.
     The elliptical line
                       is the earth's orbit as seen from Saturn,
according to its direct and retrograde motion from the        of           ill
November 1802 to the        ill

                                                                is
less or more than the geocentric longitude of Saturn          and      ;
the northern latitude of Saturn     changed into the southern
                                     is
of the earth.
    Now, as the figure clearly shows, the earth            in
                                                      November
and December 1802          represented on the south side, or
                           is
turned towards the fun, and therefore on the illuminated
side of the ring.  But afterwards the earth approaches more
and more to the plane of the ring; and, as the ring receives
the solar rays in   more and more oblique manner, the ring
                    a
pot only becomes narrower but even decreases               in

then, for the first time, becomes to us invisible: but this
invisibility  is   not of long continuance; for, as may be seen
by the figure, the earth on the id of January,                      by
                                                                its Satur-
niocentric apparent retrograde motion, pastes                second time

through the plane of the ring, and goes to the south
ern or illuminated fide, and the ring then begins to appear
again as     a    straight line.    In February, March, and April,
the earth recedes more and more from the plane, and the
ring becomes broader and more perceptible. But the fun
during these months approaches nearer to the plane of the
ring, and        by these means      .is illuminated in
                                      it                    more oblique
                                                             is a
 direction.       In the month of May the earth             at its greatest
 distance from the plane of the ring, while the fun approaches
it    more and more till the middle of June, when he passes
 through the plane in            and the ring for the second time be
                                 e,
 comes totally invisible to the earth, which             then on its dark
                                                        is
 fide.     From this period, during the month of July and till
 August, the ring will remain in this state. About the 18th.
 of August the earth will pass, for the third lime, through the
 plane of the ring, as          will then be on the northern, which
                                 it
 is now the illuminated side of the ring:              will again appear
                                                       it
 as  a   straight  line,  and  be visible   when   viewed  through good
 telescopes  :   it  will increase      light and breadth in September
                                       in
  and October in proportion as the earth and the fun recede
  from the plane.
      Between the 1st of November 1802 and the 1st of October
  1803 the ring of Saturn twice disappears and twice reappears.
  At the first disappearance on the 13th of December 1802,
  Saturn in the morning will be in the eastern part of the hea
  vens; and the first reappearance will be about the 7th of
  January 1803 Saturn in the night-time being on the fame
                      ;
   side of the heavens.
      At the second disappearance in the middle of June, Saturn
  in the night will be in the west, and, as he sets half an hour
   after midnight, the phænomenon may be observed.                   But at
   the second and last disappearance           in August, Saturn will be
   aster the sun, and therefore the phænomenon cannot be seen.
   In the month of October, when Saturn emerges from the
   stm's rays, he may be seen besire sun-rise in the east, and
   the ring then will be very visible.
       In regard to the above calculation of the times of the dis
   appearance and reappearance of Saturn's ring, the accuracy
   of them, and the correspondence of them with the phæno-
   mena, must depend on the accuracy of the tables and the
   theory hitherto adopted            in
                                        '

 3.ZZ        On the Disappearance      of the Ring of Saturn.
The    state of the atmosphere also, and the different power of
 the telescopes and of the eyes of the observers, may occasion
 some variation.      The disappearance and reappearance of the
ring, which are occasioned by the earth pasting through its
plane, can be better and more conveniently observed than
those which take place in consequence of the passage of the
 sun through that plane, because the earth, on account of its
quicker motion, pastes sooner through the plane of the ring
than the sun.
    As the fix first satellites of Jupiter move in the fame plane
with the ring, when the ring disappears, or becomes like a
luminous line, these satellites must appear on both sides of Sa
turn in a right line, and can then be more readily discovered
and distinguished from fixed stars.

  J.  HE plane of Saturn's ring, according to astronomical
observations, has always a direction parallel to itself, so
that it intersects the ecliptic in 17° 18' of rtjt and X, at an
angle of 31 j", and the orbit of Saturn at ao° 42' of nR and
 X- Now, if Saturn as seen from the sun be in longitude
200 43' of X, the plane of the ring will pass through the
centre of the fun ; by which the edge of the ring being illu
minated, while the northern and southern surface receive no
light, it must become invisible, and can be seen only by the
most powerful telescopes as a sine luminous line.                   On the
15th   of  June  next Saturn   will  be  in  this  situation  ; and   as this
planet employs     about   thirty  years   in  its revolution    round    the
fun, this phænomenon takes place only once in 15 years.
Other phænomena, however, in consequence of which the
ring before the 15th of June will alternately disappear and
reappear, are connected with this state of the planet. These
phænomena arise from the different positions of the earth,
which in the course of its revolution is at one time above
and at another below the plane of the ring ; so that from
the 1st of November 1802 to October 1803 the ring will
be twice invisible and twice visible; first the southern and
then the northern, then the southern and afterwards the
northern surface will be alternately seen from the earth
within the course of ten months. For determining and cal
culating these phænomena with more accuracy, Lambert in

                                                                     vented

           On the Disappearance    of tht Ring of Saturn.        323
vented a very ingenious kind of projection, a representation,
of which    was given by professor Bode, of Berlin, in his Astro
nomical Almanac for 1789, in which year these phænomena
took place in the fame manner as they will do in 1803 ; and
this representation has been repeated in the fame work for the
present year : but as this diagram, in my opinion, is too dif
ficult for those not well versed in astronomy, I flatter myself
that the following figure will render the phænomenon easier
to be understood by amateurs ; though Lambert's method is
more exact, and better suited to astronomers.
    The circle (Plate IV. fig. 1.) represents the earth's orbit,
and exhibits the points where the earth is placed at the com
mencement of each month.           The vernal equinox is marked
ot,     the line SZ' drawn through the fun; and the place of
Saturn on the 15th of June is the direction of the plane of
the ring.     Saturn, at the four periods announced, is in the
lines drawn parallel to SZ, though at a distance from the
fun five times greater than is here represented for want of
room.      The plane of the paper is that of the ecliptic, with
which the one-half of Saturn's ring makes an angle of 310.
    I have already observed that the ring twice disappears, and
then twice becomes again visible. This phænomenon arises
 partly from the situation of Saturn in regard to the fun, and
 partly from that of the earth ; and each of these causes must
 be considered separately to have a clear idea of these phæno
 mena.      In regard to the first, it is evident that that fide only
 of Saturn's ring which is turned towards the fun can be illu
 minated; and this illumination is strongest when the planet
 is in 200 of n and ao° of      f , the whole surface of the ring'
 being then opposite to the sun.        Now as the direction of th«
 ring is always the fame, that is to fay, parallel to itself,
 the rays of the fun, as the planet approaches to 200 of ng
 and M, must fall more obliquely on the ring, by which
 means it will be more faintly lighted, and at the fame time
 appear smaller; and when Saturn has attained to this longi
 tude, no part of the upper surface, but merely the edge of The
 ring, the plane of which passes through the fun, will be illu
 minated ; so that the ring will then have the appearance of a
  thin luminous line, but will not be visible without the help
 of good glasses. For the last seven years the ring has been
  observed to decrease in light and in breadth ; and this de
  crease will continue till the 15th of June, after which both
  wilt again increase. During the last fifteen years the southern
  surface of the ring has been illuminated, but in the next fif
  teen the northern surface alone will receive the rays of the
  fun.    In whatever part of our solar system this phænome
                                                                  non

 444       On  the disappearance   ef the Ring of Saturn.
 non be viewed, the appearance will be the same.         The ring
till the r5th of June will continually become smaller, and on
 that day will be converted into an almost imperceptible line
of light. The disappearance then of Saturn's ring on the
15th of June, or rather its decrease till that period and its
subsequent increase, arises alone from the relative position of
Saturn and the fun. As to the other causes of disappearance,
¦which are the consequence       of Saturn's position in regard to
the earth, we must first keep in view the slow motion of
Saturn compared to that of the earth, as this planet advances
scarcely  12° in the time that the earth performs its revolu
tion around the fun.      On the 15th of June, at which time
Saturn will be in 20° of K, and the plane of the ring will
pass through the fun, the intersection of that plane with the
ecliptic, or the line ZS in the figure, passes through the mid
dle of the earth's orbit.     During the last fifteen years, while
Saturn advanced from T to itE, this line of the plane of the
ring was without, and above the earth's orbit, and during
that period the southern and luminous part of the ring was
always visible ; but about the middle of December 1802 this
line approached the earth's orbit, and on the 13th of De
cember passed through it exactly in the point where the earth
then was. The earth being then in the plane of the ring,
the thickness of the ring only could be visible to us ; and
thus, for the first time in fifteen years, disappeared on the 13th
of December 1803. On the other hand, as the earth moved
straight towards Saturn, or parallel with that line, while Saturn
advanced,    it was necessary that the southern surface of the
ring hitherto visible should become invisible, and the north
ern, which was not illuminated, being turned towards the
earth, the whole ring would become invisible.           But as the
earth proceeded in its orbit it would soon reach the line of
the plane, and on the 7th of January 1803 would again pass
through it. At that period, the southern surface of the ring
being illuminated by the sun would again be visible from the
earth ; but as the earth on the 21st of June must in its revo
lution be again on the other fide, Saturn in his course falling
in with the earth in the plane of the intersection of the riiur,
and the ecliptic, will again pass through it on the 18th of
August, at which time the ring will appear once more as a
fine stripe of light.   After that day the northern surface of
the ring will be visible from the earth, and, as the line of the
plane will then be without the earth's orbit, will, during the
next fifteen years, remain always visible.
    From the 7 th January to the 2tst of June, the southern
surface of the ring being illuminated, the ring will be visible;

but from the 21st of June to the i8lh of August no part of it
will be seen, as its darkened side during that period will be
turned towards the earth. This disappearance and reappear
ance of Saturn's ring will be of importance to astronomers, as
it will enable them to determine the direction of the plane of
the ring, and will afford a curious spectacle to amateurs who
are provided with good telescopes.     The ring, which already
appears as a broad stripe of light, will continually become
smaller till the 15th of June; after which time it will disap
pear till the 15th of August, when it will appear as a sine
stripe of light, which will increase in breadth till the aper
ture between it and the planet will increase during the first
seven years.    As Saturn till the month of June sets at mid
night, the decrease of the ring may always be observed ; but
when he sets earlier it will be possible to fee him only a short
time in August, as he will be lost in the fun's rays.

       of Derby/hire.       By    Faujas-Saint-Fond                   *.
Ai  lBOUT twenty years ago some insulated portions of a
kind of blackish bitumen, compressible and even elastic, which
had some sort of resemblance to old leather, were found in the
natural fissures of one of the mines of Castleton. The young
miners having set sire to some of this matter, it burnt with a
bright flame, emitting an odour which did not apptar to be
disagreeable.
   At that period mineralogy was not so well known as at
present in England, and particularly in Derbyshire: no one
paid attention to this fossil, or endeavoured to ascertain its
nature.
  Twelve years after,       a heavy   storm     of rain having produced
a deep ravine   on the side     of         of
                                       the hills which surround
                                     one
the village of Castleton, a similar kind of bitumen was found
between the fossil strata of argillaceous schist which exists at
the bottom of that bill-.
   More care was then taken to collect this matter, some of
which was sent to Derby, Edinburgh, and London ; and so
great a relation was found between it and the caout-cbouc,
known under the vulgar name of elastic gum, that mineralo
gists did not hesitate to consider it as the lame as that brought

from Guiana and Peru. This opinion was soon confirmed by
chemical analysis; and this singular fossil was the more sought
after, and considered as a curious object of natural history, as
it was more rare ; and as it was thought an astonishing cir
cumstance, that a substance which distils from exotic trees
which grow only in the torrid zone should be found between
strata of argillaceous schist in the bosom of the mountains id
the northern part of England.
    Lametherie mentioned this discovery in the Journal de
Physique, without giving any details respecting the place
where it was found: he only insisted an the analogy be
tween this fossil bitumen and the caout-chouc.
    At that period some varied fragments of this substance
were sent to me, together with the matrices in which they
had been found ; and as I was acquainted with the place*
and the mountain where the discovery had been made, I
mentioned this important fact every year in my geological
lectures at the Mulæum, when I treated of the exotic wood
and plants sound in a fossil state, in countries absolutely oppo
site to thole where these plants and trees grow at present: but
I published nothing on the subject, as has been observed by
Mr. Mawe, proprietor of the principal mines of sparry fluor
of the neighbourhood of Castleton, and author of The Mine
ralogy of Derbyshire, lately published ; a work which will
be exceedingly useful to naturalists who intend to visit that
county, so abundant in a variety of mineral productions*.
    Mr. Mawe, when last at Paris, brought me some very re
markable specimens which were wanting in my collection of
fulfil caout-chouc ; and it is my duty to acknowledge here my
gratitude to him.         He was lo kind as to give me also some
information on this subject ; and he showed me at the same
time a piece of fossil caout-chouc, discovered not long ago,
consisting of an oblong mass two feet and a half in circum
ference and two inches and a half in thickness, weighing
about three pounds.          It is soft, exceedingly compressible,
 and of a black and somewhat olive colour; solid, hard, and
 shining fragments of a bitumen nearly similar are enveloped
 bv, and adhere as it were to, the clastic mass, both in the
 inside and on the exterior faces.        They are not larger than a
 common almond; some of them are black like jet, others of
 a brown Hirer colour.        They may be easily detached from
 the eomprestible caout-chouc where these hard fragments are
 not abundant.

   Mr. Mawe has made known in his Mineralogy of Derby
shire the principal varieties of the fossil caout-chouc; but as
he has attended rather to those select specimens fittest for or
namenting colledtions, than to a systematic description of these
pieces as well as of the matrices which accompany them,
and as he thought it of no use in his plan to enter into details
respecting the nature and depth of the places where the fossil
caout-chouc is found, I (hall supply the deficiency in this
part, which is so intimately connected with geology.
    In order to give a topographical idea of the place, I shall
observe, that in going from Derby to Castleton you are
obliged to ascend a pretty rapid acclivity to a large plain in
the form of a mountain, which extends for several leagues in
every direction.       All this elevated, rugged, and rocky district
is known by the name of High Peak.              It is in general cal
careous, and even abundant in (hells, except some argil
laceous strata, and particularly several veins of trapp which
intersect transversely the calcareous strata, or which, disposed
sometimes in banks, proceed nearly parallel with beds of
limestone. I (hall fay nothing of the veins of lead ore, of
 the beautiful crystals of sparry fluor, of the calamine and
 other minerals found in this district.           For an account of
 these I  (hall  refer  to the  Description  of  Derbystiire, White-
 hurst on the Formation of the Earth *, and Ferber's Orycto-
 graphia of Derbystiire t> or that which I gave myself of the
 environs of Buxton and of Castleton in my Tour through
 England and Derbystiire %•
     Castleton is not seen till you are, as I may fay, above
 it,  and till you arrive at the edge of       a   rapid and steep de
 clivity,  which    intersects,  in  an abrupt  and   sudden manner,
 this part  of   the  mountain    surrounding  the   bason,  at the bot
  tom  of which     the  small  village  in question  is  situated  as in
  the  middle   of arunnel.
     The revolution which divided this mountain,               by tearing
  asunder its sides, arose, no doubt, from one of those grand
  natural events similar traces of which are to be found even
  in the High Alps; but here this terrible commotion,                       by
  opening the bosom of the earth, has uncovered several mi
  neral riches which without this accidental circumstance
  would never have been known.

     One of the precipices of this mountain is known by the
name of Hay Cliff: it is calcareous, and contains shells and
other marine productions in a state of petrification.                   The
other is called Man-Tor: it is also calcareous, and towards
the foot there are some galleries of a mine, on a vein which
terminates near the surface, and of which the matrix is a
milky calcareous spar containing large-grained galena, but in
small quantity.         There are found also towards the bottom of
the fame precipice, as well as in some other parts, fissile strata
of argillaceous schist, very often marly, which imbibe water
in the time of rain, split, and occasion the solid and stony
masses which rest above them to crumble down*.
     Some of the schiltous strata in question have a certain
hardness; but all in general have a character of alluvion which
an experienced eye cannot mistake, and yet their formation is
of the highest antiquity.            It is at a depth which, without fear
of being deceived, mav be estimated at least at four hundred
and fifty feet below the upper stratum, that the fossil caout
 chouc has been found, and particularly the large fragment
 in the possession of Mr. Mawe.               In general it is in small ca
 vities, in a kind of nests between the fissile strata, that this bi
 tuminous matter is contained ; and as in this state it is shel
 tered from the action of the air, it needs excite no surprise
 that it should have experienced only very little alteration, and
 that its nature is not changed.
     In the last place, one of the cavities, twenty-two inches in
 length and five inches in height, contained a great deal of
 caout-chouc.          By these means very sine specimens of it may
 be    obtained    for  collections, at a very moderate price ; and it
 is to     Mr.   Mawe     that we are indebted for this obligation.
 This gentleman,         who   with his father-in-law Mr. Brawn pos
  sesses  a  large manufactory of sparry fluor, of which thev make
  elegant vases and other ornaments, carries on trade in a very
  honourable manner with the minerals of Scotland, Derby
  shire and other parts of England, a depot of which he pro
  poses to establish at Paris, which must, no doubt, be of ad
  vantage to the progress of mineralogy.
      I divide the fossil caout-chouc of Derbyssiire into elastic or
  compressible bitumen, and solid, hard, and brittle bitumen.

and somewhat fat, of a slightly aromatic smell, but having
a little of the insipid odour of natural caout chouc; inflam
mable, and burning with a bright brilliant flame, leaving a
black oily residuum which does not become dry. The frag
ments of this variety are sometimes an inch and a half in
thickness and four inches in breadth. They are the largest
except the fragment in possession of Mr. Mawe, which is
considerably larger.
    Variety If. Fossil caout-chouc, split and cracked in the
whole exterior surface, which was in contact with the matrix
from which it has been detached.        It is dry in that part, but
nevertheless compressible; black on the surface exposed to
the contact of the air; but remarkable in this respect, that
when a lamina of about a line in thickness is cut from this
caout-chouc with a very fliarp knife, it- appears in the inside
of a yellowish white colour: when cut in a very thick part,
where the action of the air has not been able to render it
black, like certain balls of the elastic gum brought sometimes
from Fara, it has the fame appearance as the usual caout
chouc.     Another circumstance worthy of attention                that is,
in the part recently cut      kind of acid matter

of the milky substance which flowed from the tree more or

consistence tillit  had lost the mucilaginous water which held
the matter of caout-chouc suspended or in solution.               par   1
ticularly mention this fact, to show that this variety has no

    Variety IV. Fossil caout-chouc, compressible, and having a
relation to the first variety, but of a darker colour, adhering
to gray calcareous spar mixed with some grains of galena.
    Variety V. Caout-chouc of a liver brown colour, much
less unctuous to the touch than the first variety, but com
pressible, and having the aspect of the real natural elastic
gum ; and the more remarkable, as it is found to become
iolid, as we may fay, in some parts, where it acquires a much
greater hardness, and even becomes brittle, and acquires a
vitreous splendour.     This gradual change is so striking, that
we cannot consider this hard bitumen, which in the present
specimen is of a yellowish colour, as a hard bituminous matter
accidentally enveloped by caout-chouc.
                           Section II.
              Solid and   Brittle Fojil Caout-Cbouc.
   No. VI. Black solid caout-chouc, hard and brittle like jet,
exceedingly brilliant on its fracture, which is conchoid, and
sometimes finely marked with striae disposed in the form of
ravs, proceeding from the point of fracture, and expanding in
the manner of a fan ; electric by friction, opake throughout
the whole mass, but pellucid at the edges, and particularly
when viewed in a strong light: its colour is then a red, almost
as bright and agreeable as that of the hyacinth, and analogous
to the colour observed on the edges of the elastic caout-chouc
of the second variety, seen in the light which seems to an
nounce their identity.
   No. VII. Another variety of hard caout-chouc, similar to
that of No. VI. in hardness and splendour, but which is of
a liver brown colour.      It is entirely pellucid by the light of
a lamp even throughout its whole substance, though opake
in common day-light, and its colour is then similar to that
of the hyacinth.
   No. VIII. The fame variety as the above, but of a paler
liver colour.    It has besides the fame characters and the
fame properties as the other hard and brittle kinds of caout
chouc ; but it is remarkable for still adhering to its matrix,
consisting of semi- transparent milky calcareous spar, with thick
brilliant lamina? of galena.      The caout-chouc here not only
adheres lo the calcareous spar but to sulphurated lead, and is
intimately mixed with both.
    Mr. Mawc, in his Mineralogy of Derbyshire, mentions
the following verv curious fact: — " A variety, the only one
1 poflefs of the kind, is elastic bitumen in a petrified marine
well inclosed in the rock ;" also " another specimen no less
                                                              rare

Tare is obscure caout-chouc, but transparent in the light, in
 closed in crystallized fluor."      Fossil caout-chouc, according
 to Mr. Mawe, is found also in sulphated barytes.
    If  it be considered that trees and other vegetables, which
produce natural caout-chouc in such abundance that the
matter can flow down and accumulate at the root os them
when the wind or any other accident lacerates the bark or
breaks the branches, are all exotic, it will be allowed that this
is a curious geological fact, which coincides with that of fossil
amber, which has been found, and is still found, in some coal
rmnes,and in turf foil of an antique origin, and which diflers
from that formed in the common turf mosses. We are not
yet acquainted    with any vegetable productions which furnish
caout-chouc in abundance, but the following :
    1st, The vahea, a species of apocinea, which grows in Ma
dagascar, and of which Laniarc has given a figure in his II-
lujtrations de Botanique.
    ad, The urceola elajiica of Sumatra and of Pullo-Pinang,
discovered by Mr. Howison, an English surgeon at Pullo-Pi
nang, and described in the fifth volume of the Astatic Re
searches by Dr. Roxburgh
                                ,r.  This plant is of the family of
 the apocineæ.
    3d, The bevea     Guianenjis, described and exhibited in a
figure by Aublet in his Plantes de la Guiane, is a large tree
of the family of the enphorbia.            It riles to the height of
more than forty feet;       its trunk   is sometimes above two feet
in diameter; and the natives of Para make bottles, boots, and
 other articles of the caout-chouc which distils from it.       It is
 the fame as that mentioned by M. de la Condaniine in the
 Memoirs of the Aeademy of Sciences for 1736, which grows
 also in the province of Esmeralda, in Peru, which the Maina
 Indians call caout-chouc, and of which they make bottles by
 means of earthen moulds : they use it also for torches to give
 them light.
    4th, The artocarpus integrtfolia of South America, a tree
 which approaches- near to the mulberry and iig-tree.

 XLI. A       general View of the Coal Mines worked in France,
    of  tbeir  different Produ&s, and the Means of circulating
    them.      By C. Lefebvre, Member of the Council of
    Mines, of the Pbilomatic Society, &C. &c.
                        [Continued from p. 164.]
                     Department   of La  Cote  if Or.
  OOME indications of coal have been announced here, and
 particularly in the communes of A re she, Turcey, Montbard,
 and Chevauney.        They deserve to be examined ; and Cham-
 peaux, engineer of mine?, now employed in that district,
 will no doubt give some accurate information on the sub
ject : but hitherto no coal mines have been worked in this
 department ; it can receive its coals from Blanzi by the canal
 of Charollois, and by going up the Saone as far as Saint-
Jean- de-L6ne, where the canal of Burgundy begins.
                  Department of the Cotes-du-Nord.
    No coals have yet been found in this department. Indi
 cations of coal have been announced near Lannion and
 Quimper-Gaczence,         in the neighbourhood of Pontrieux ;
 but no attention has been paid to them. It is supplied there
 fore only by means of its sea-ports, which may receive the
 coal brought from the mines of Litrv, in the Calvados, and
 those which abound in the northern departments, which
 may be convened by land to the canals which terminate at
 the sea.
                      Department    of La  Crease.
    Several coal mines (14) are worked in this country, which
 is still little known in a mineralogical point of view, and
 which appears worthy of being carefully examined. The
 communes where coal mines in a stale of working are found,
 are those of Couchezotte,        Bosmoraud,     Vavory, St. Palais,
and Fautmazuras.
    Though their production, according to the information
obtained by the Council of Mines, is estimated in general at
 126,000 myriagramnies, it certainly exceeds lhat quantity,
because several of the mines have not yet been worked with
proper activity.      The mean price of the coals at the pit is
jo   cents per mvmgramme.
   These mines are not much worked, because there are very
sew means of consumption.
    If the Creuse, which is said to be navigable as far as
Gucret, could be rendered navigable for boau to Ahun, it
                                                             would

          General View   of the Coal Mines woried in France.    233
  would open a very useful circulation for the coals of the mines
 in    the neighbourhood of that commune, and would facilitate
  the transportation of them as far as the Vienne, to which it
 joins in the department of Indre-et-Loire.          These mines,
  then, would supply in part the consumption of the depart
  ment of Indre.
      On the other hand, if it were possible to render the Thi-
  rion, which passes Bourganeuf, navigable from that town to
  its junction with the Vienne above Limoges, and to ensure
  the navigation of the Vienne from Limoges to Chatelleraux,
  where it begins to bear boats, an extensive consumption would
  be opened for the coals which are on the north and south of
  Bourganeuf, and make this fuel circulate in the departments
  of La Haute-Vienne and of La Vienne.             This circulation
  would be exceedingly useful, and increase manufactories and
   industry.
                        Department of La Dyle.
      This department possesses no coal mines ; but it borders
  on that of Jemappes, the numerous mines of which supply
  more coals than it has occasion for.        It is of importance,
  therefore, that this fuel, the use of which is general in that
   country, may be obtained at a price suited to the different
   places where it is consumed ; and that the roads be repaired
   and carefully maintained in a proper state. Without this
   attention, the dearness of carriage would throw the inhabi-
' tants of La Dyle into a deplorable .state of distress in
                                                             regard
   to fuel, and produce a hurtful stagnation in the mines of the
   department of Jemappes.
                     Department    of La Dordogne.
       The cantons of Cransac and Terasson (15) afford collec
   tions and strata of coals of a good quality and exceedingly
    rich. These mines would be an object worthy being worked
   with activity, if the navigation ot the Vesere were rendered
   more certain, and easier.
       At present they are worked only at the surface by some
   proprietors of land, and supply only the local consumption.
    The product of these coal mines is not known ; but it is cer
    tain that the working of them would be easy, and that they
    are capable of affording great resources for a long time.
                          Department   of Doubs.
        Several indications of coals have been announced in this
    department (16).      Researches even have been made indif
    ferent parts, but hitherto no coals have been dug up.
                                                         According

  According    to the general measures which have heen taken
by   the government, this department is one of those where an
engineer of mines will be employed ; and we have reason lo
hope that researches will be made, and followed with success.
    A very considerable mass of fossil bituminous wood has
been discovered at Grand-Denis, in the neighbourhood of
Ornans, in the commune of Flanchebouche.        This substance
has not entirely the fame qualities as coals ; but in the state
in which it is found at Grand-Denis it may be advantage
ously employed for several purposes, and particularly under
boilers.   The managers of the salt-works, who have caused
trials to be made with             it,
                             are going to employ    for evapo    it
rating the water of the fait- work or Montmorot. This will
produce great saving in the wood employed in that manu
             a
factory.
                   Department     La Drome.

   The discovery of coal mines        this department (iy) has
                                               in
often been announced      but, according to the reports of the
                          ;
engineers of mines who have visited them,           appears thatit
these indications were nothing else than bituminous fossil
wood, which      frequently found in strata of sand, and parti
                  is
cularly in the environs  of Crest in the district of that name,
and in the territory of several communes in the environs of
Nions.
  This  fossil wood has been dug up, and particularly at Crest;
and  though        cannot be applied to the fame purposes as
                  it
coals,  it  still useful in these countries in the manufactories
             is
for spinning silk.
   The department of La Drome may receive abundance of
coals, at least for supplying the communes which lie near to
the banks of the Rhone, as those of the departments of Ar-
deche and La Loire can be conveyed to them on that river.
                       Department         of   the   Scheldt.
  The mines of the departments of the North and                            of Je-
mappes furnisli abundance of coals to the inhabitants                      of this
department, in which no coal mines are worked.
                         Department            of    Eurc.
   In this department no coal mines are known.                        Itcannot

those   of   the departments        of   the   North.
                                                                     Department

                  Department of Eure-et- Loire.
   As this department, like the preceding, has no mines in a
state of being worked, it can procure no coals but those con
veyed down the Loire as far as Orleans, which supply its
southern part, and those circulated on the Seine, which sup
ply the northern.     But the land carriage there must render
this fuel very dear.
                    Department  of Finijlerre.
   There are no coal mines in this department (18) which
can be considered in a stale of productive working: however,
in consequence of old indications, some researches have been
within these few years resumed in the neighbourhood of
Quimper.
   These researches have afforded some hopes.       Small veins
of   coal have even been found ; and as a mine of this kind
would be of great importance to the port of Brest and the
other sea ports and arsenals of this department, the minister
of the marine has caused these researches to be continued
near Quimper with great activity, according to plans approved
by the Council of Mines.
   Several other indications have been announced al Cleden
and at the bottom of the Bay of Dinan. C. Berth had given
in the year 6 some information in regard to this district ; in
consequence     of which he was allowed to continue the re
searches he had begun, and to put himself in a condition to
obtain a grant when his discovery should be fully established.
C. Berth set out for Egypt, and it does not appear that at
tention has since been paid to his labours : a coal mine in
this point would be of the more importance, as it would be
within reach of the harbour of Brest.
                      Department  of Fore Is.
   No    coal mines are worked in this department, which may
receive    in the southern part the product of the abundant
mines in the environs of Saarbruck, and the coals which may
be conveyed on the Moselle.
                       Department of Gard.
   This is one of the departments of the south of France (19)
 where this kind of fuel is most abundant.      On the north of
 Alais the mines of Cendras, of Portes, of the Forest of Abi-
lon, La Grand-Combe, and Pradel, furnish about 2,300,000
myriagrammes of coals per annum.

2$6                       A general   View of the
  The coal mines of Banes, Robillac, Meranes, Saint- Jean-
de-Valerisque, furnish at least 900,000 myriagrammes.
  Several strata of coal are still worked in the environs of
Pont-Saint-Efprit, and towards Laudun ; but it is inferior in
quality to the before-mentioned.    This is the more unfortu
nate, as the situation of these mines on the banks of the*
Rhone would render them of great importance on account
of the facility with tvhich they could be transported.
   If the coal mines in the environs of Alais possessed the
same advantages in regard to transportation, the quantity dug
up might be increased to ten times the present quantity, with
out any fear of the mines being exhausted in many years.
But they cannot be exported from the country, in consequence
of the        of carriage.
         dearness                                     •
   The mean price of the large coals        at these mines is 7 cents"
per myriagramme, and that of the            small coals from 4 to 5
cents.
  It   appears that  canal is now constructing from Nimes to
                      a
Saint-Gilles.   The mineral riches and abundant resources in
fuel, which  the mines in the neighbourhood of Alais would
fumisli for ages, are of so much importance, that a commu
nication might to be opened with that country by means of
a counter-canal to supply the place of the bed of the Gardon,
which is not navigable.
   In this department there are also some strata of coal worked
in the environs of the commune of Vigan. At present the
working is not carried on with much activity; some of the
pits have even been abandoned in consequence of law-suits,
which are on the point of being decided.
   The common amount of the product of this canton may
be estimated at least at 200,0:0 myriagrammes.
  These mines cannot find much consumption except by the.
Hcrault ; but this riveris not navigable in the neighbour
hood of Vigan.
             Department of ha Haute-Garonnc.
  In this department there are no coal mines worked. Some
foundings have been made in the envitons of Toulouse, in
consequence of some supposed indications.     These soundings
have not confirmed the hopes which had been conceived.
   Fossil wood in the state of very fine        jet
                                            has been found         in
the Forest of Montbrun towards Montesquieu and Ricux.
Specimens of     may be seen in the collection of the Council
                it

  The department of La Haute- Garonne may                 be supplied

the department of Tarn.        The products of these mines are
embarked on the Tarn, and enter with that river into the
northern part of the department of La Haute-Garonne.           But
the difficulties which occur in the navigation of the Tarn
greatly increase the price of the coals of Carmeaux.          This
inconvenience might be removed without much expense. We
must therefore hope that measures will be pursued to remove
these obstacles, which are equally prejudicial to industry, to
 commerce, and to all the consumers of these departments.
The coals destined for Toulouse and the southern part of the
department are deposited at Port Saint-Sulpicc, from which
 they are transported    by land carriage.
                         Department of Gen.
      This department, in which no coal mines are known, can
 obtain this fuel only by land carriage from the entrepots of
 Toulouse, or from some of the ports of La Garonne in its
 northern part.
                     Department   of La Gironde.
      Collections of bituminous fossil wood deposited in strata of
  sand have been discovered in several places in the neighbour
  hood of Bourdeaux. As this fossil wood seems to be dispersed
  in great abundance, it would be of advantage to pursue the
  researches which have been made, with more constancy than
  has hitherto been the cafe.
      These researches might not conduct to the discovery of a
  coal mine; but the fossil wood might be used with great ad
  vantage as fuel in different operations for which wood is em
   ployed/
       There are no coal mines worked in this department, but
   it receives by the Garonne the coals of Carmeaux. This fuel
   might also be procured with more ease from the abundant
   coal mines which are known between Tcrasson and Eergerac,
   on the banks of the Vesere and the Dordogne, if the naviga
   tion of these rivers were rendered easier.
       This department might receive also by the mouth of the
    Gironde the products of the rich mines of the departments
   of the North. An exchange of the coals, iron works, and
    of a variety of other articles manufactured in these depart
    ments, for the wines and brandy of the Bordelais, which are
    in request in the whole North, might be made by the French
    naval trade as well as the English.     It is even probable that
    \ve mould   obtain great advantages  for the ironmongery trade
    in India, in consequence of the low price at which the ma-

   rica or for the East Indies.
                         Department   of Herault.
      Coal mines are frequency met with in this department (20) .
   The canton of Bedarieux affords some immensely rich, such
  as those of Saint- Gervais, ofCamplong, ofBoussaque, and
   Graisseffac ; towards the south, in the canton of Roman, those
  of Bousquet, in the commune of Neffies ; towards the south
  west, in the canton of Saint-Chiniau, the mines of Cessenon;
  and towards the south, near the canal of the two seas, those
  of Azillanet. Some have been found also in different places
  in the environs of Montpellier. A lease is about to be granted
  for working those of Saint-Gely-du-Fesq.
      Though the greater part of the coals procured from these
 mines is not of the best quality, they are a great relief, in
 consequence of the dearness of wood, and of the numerous
 manufactories in which they are employed.
      But in general, the means of circulation in the interior of
 this department are neither numerous nor easy. The coals of
 the mines in the neighbourhood of Bedarieux, which might
 furnish a great many, cannot conveniently be transported.
 Some individuals are soliciting for grants subject to the con
 dition of making a road, which would soon give more im-
             to these mines by facilitating the carnage of them to
 Ejrtance
    edarieux.    It would be necessary also to have a communica
 tion with the canal of the two seas, less expensive than that
 by land.      It appears that the river Ourbe might easily be
rendered navigable from Bedarieux to Bezieres.             It would
then answer very well the proposed object.
     The price of coals at these mines is 15 cents per myria-
gramme.         But this price is doubled when they have been
transported as far as the canal.
     The coal mines which are nearest, such as those of Azil
lanet, are attended with some advantages in this respect.
     The whole product of the different mines of this depart
ment may be estimated at 1,800,000 myriagrammes.
     In consequence of the superior quality of the coals of Car-
meaux, in the department of Tarn, they are received by the
consumers along the canal, in preference to those already
mentioned, though the price is nearly double.

 cularly its southern part, may be considered as an immense
 mass of coals, in some places scarcely covered by strata more
 modern than the depots of that mineral.
     The geologue, in traversing the interior of these mines, is
 astonished at the varied phænomena exhibited by the nume
 rous and successive strata of coals, the inflection, curvatures,
 or turns of which, in an inverse direction and parallelism, open
 a vast but difficult field for conjectures respecting their forma
 tion, and the revolutions of the globe which must have pro
 duced these results : but to enter here into a consideration of
 these wonderful effects, a description of which must be re
 served for particular treatises on the operations of nature,
 would lead me too far from my present object.
     I shall therefore content myself with giving some idea of
 the resources which this country furnishes, not only to its in
 habitants, but to those of several other departments ; by which
 it will be seen how much its productions in coal might be in
 creased,'    and that they would be sufficient to supply for many
 years   all  those parts of France which receive coals by sea from
 foreign     countries.
     More than 3000 pits are worked in the environs of Je-
  mappes, Mons, and Charleroi.           They are far from being
  carried to their maximum of activity.          The sum of their
  products, however, amounts, at the least, to 220,000,000 my-
  riagrammes annually ; and this product might easily be dou
  bled, if the c.il imption increased in the same proportion.
      In regard to the quality os these coals, it is exceedingly va
  rious : these numerous mines furnish coals of every kind,
  and the price at the pits differs according to the quality from
  5 to 9 cents per myriagramme.
     The places where they are consumed are, the departments
  of the Sambre and Meusc, La Dyle, the Scheldt, the Deux-
.Nethes, and Batavia, in competition with the English coals.
     The means of circulation are the river Haine, the Scheldt,
  the canals which communicate with these rivers, the Sambre
  and the Meuse, and the large roads from Mons and Charleroi
  to Brussels.
      It may be readily conceived of how much importance it
  would be to this department, which employs a great number
  of hands in working its coals, and also to those countries to
  which these coals might be transported, if the oanals and
  roads were kept in a state of better repair.
       Everv degradation of the roads which retards conveyance,
  or which renders more horses necessary, multiplies expense
  and increases the price of the coals; which ought to be kept
                                                                   as

240                 On a nezo    Kind of Painting
as low as possible, both on account of their utility in our ma
nufactories, and of the necessity of maintaining a competition
with the English coals.
    The carriage by the causeways from Charleroi and Mons
to Brussels adds greatly to the price of these coals. A canal
has been projected for uniting the Sambre towards Thuin
with the small river of Senne ; which would convey the coals
of the mines in the neighbourhood of Charleroi to Brussels,
and would thus form a communication with the Scheldt and
Batavia, so as to prevent the necessity of land carriage.
    This canal, valuable in this point of view, would be of
utility also to the export trade of these countries in regard to
the glass and nails sent to Holland and to our own ports, and
which are thence conveyed to the Indies.
    It would be of utility also to government for transporting
the timber of the Forest of Souane, through which it would
pass.
    To point out these improvements will, no doubt, be suffi
 cient to induce government to pay serious attention to them;
 but until new means of circulation be provided, it is of im
 portance that the existing roads should be properly repaired.
    I shall terminate this article by observing, that it is the in
 terest of France to facilitate its commercial intercourse with
 Holland, and particularly that which relates to the importa
 tion of our coals into that country : consequently, instead of
 laying a duty on their exportation to the amount, as is said,
 of 20 per cent., this branch of commerce ought to be entirely
 free.    It would be good policy also to encourage by bounties
 the exportation of the coals of this department, especially
 when destined for French ports in parts of our territory which
 cannot receive this fuel from the mines of the interior, and
 which if not supplied by our mines would procure them from
 foreign countries.

 XLII.      On a new Kind of Painting tvitb the Serum or
     watery Part of the Blood.            By F. Carbonel, M.D.
     of Barcelona *.
   X HE       advantages and utility of painting have at all times
  excited   the emulation of professors and of artists.         The pro
  gress of this art, which imitates nature, has fortunately cor
  responded to their wishes ; but its advancement would cer-

tainly have been more rapid if artists had been sooner made
acquainted with the new chemistry. This assertion is proved
 by the present discovery.
     The necessity of painting surfaces of different kinds, their
various situations, and the complex circumstances which al-
tend the application of colours, have given rife to the differ
ent kinds of painting which are known ; such as painting in
fresco,    painting in size, oil-painting, painting with milk,
painting on porcelain, painting with wax, painting on glass,
8cc.
     The journey of the king of Spain to Barcelona, and the
preparation of the edifices destined for the use of their ma
jesties, afforded me an opportunity of solving a new problem
in regard to this art. It was necessary to discover some kind
of painting of the common colour of stone which might be
able to resist rain, which should be unalterable in the sun,
easy to be applied on wood, and which should dry soon and
exhale no bad odour ; in a word, a painting equally durable
 with that in size, and which should have the property of being
 able to withstand the inclemency of the weather.                The solu
 bility of gelatin in water, the bad smell of oil, the weak ad
 hesion of milk of lime to wood, and its ready alteration by
 heat, made me sensible that it would be impossible to have
 recourse to any of the known vehicles for securing the co
louring matters.         After some examination I found that al
 bumen * was the only substance which could answer the re
quired conditions, on account of its insolubility in water,
 and the consistence it acquires by combining with calcareous
 earths. This substance, prepared by the vital power in the
 animal organs, is found almost pure in the white of an egg
 or albumen, and is found in combination in different animal
 substances.      But the great viscidity of the white of an egg,
 the clots which are formed bv its combination with lime, and
 particularly its dearness, made me give up all idea of employ
 ing it for painting a whole edifice.
      I then conceived that the serum of blood, the principal
 part of which consists of albumen, would be attended with
 all the advantages of white of egg for the proposed end, with
 out having any of its inconveniences.              Chemical analysis of
 animal subltances, indeed, shows that the serum of blood,
 commonly called the water of the blood, or, improperly, the
 lymph of the blood, is a kind of animal mucilage composed
 of albuminous or gelatinous substances in different propor-

343                     On a new   Kind of Painting
tions, dissolved in an indeterminate quantity of water, con
stantly united to pure soda, which reduces the albuminous
substance to an almost saponaceous state.       There is found
also in the serum phosphate of soda, of lime, and of ammo
nia. But these saline substances are not essential to this com
bination, since they not only may vary in their proportions,
but be wanting either in whole or in part; and even unite in
the serum to other salts, such as the muriate of potasti, the
phosphate of magnesia, Sec, without the albuminous, alka
line, or gelatinous substance of the serum being changed, or
exhibiting different characteristic properties.
   This doctrine, received by all the celebrated modern che
mists, induced me to think that the albuminous substance of
serum, modified by its combination with gelatin and soda,
ought to form with calcareous earth a composition which
would retain no more of that viscidity and tenacity assumed
by the mixture of the white of an egg and lime, than what
might be necessary for answering the proposed end.
   These reasons, and the low price of this liquid in large
cities, soon induced me to try the effects of the serum of
blood with pulverized quicklime; and I found, with much
satisfaction, that my first trials corresponded in every respect
to the hopes I had conceived.
      Praclice and Application       of the new Kind of Painting.
   The preparation of this new kind of paint is easy, and re
quires very little time. Nothing is necessary but to pulverize
the lime, and to dilute it in the serum of blood until it forms
a liquid of sufficient thickness for painting ; which is then to
be applied in the usual manner.          The colour which this
composition acquires is whitish, and more or less mining, ac
cording to the purity of the serum and the whiteness of the
lime.     This earth may be employed either in the state of
quick or caustic lime reduced to powder, or well slaked
with a small quantity of water to lessen the adhesion of its
integrant parts. It must then be reduced to a fine powder,
and De sifted through a close sieve. If kept for some days, it
is necessary to preserve it in a close tub or earthen vessel, to
prevent its combination with the carbonic acid and water of
the atmosphere.       The serum is separated from the curdled
blood by decantation : but care must be taken to shake the
matter as little as possible, and to suffer it each time to re
main at rest.
    In this composition two things only are to be observed:
           it is,
the first     that serum being    fluid highly susceptible of cor
                                    a
ruption,            must be employed the same day   it   is   separated   ;   or
                                                                              at

           •will the Serum or watery Part   of the Blood.      243
 at furthest the day following, provided it be kept in a cool
 place sheltered from the contact of the air, especially during
 the summer, when it alters much more easily.
     In cafe of doubt, inspection of the fluid alone may serve to
 determine its quality; for the signs of its fermentation are
 very evident.     This observation is applicable also to the co
 louring liquor, but in a less degree.       Tt follows from this
 circumstance, that the vessels which have been used for con
 taining, preparing, or applying paint made with serum ought
 to be washed every day. The second precaution to be taken
 is, that as the re-action of the serum and lime increases in the
 course of time, as well as the density of the mixture, in order
 that it may be preserved in the necessary state of fluidity, or
 to diminish or increase it according lo the nature of the sub
stances to be painted and the number of strata to be applied,
 another vessel filled with serum must be provided, to give to
 the colouring liquor the necessary fluidity.    It thence follows
that the mixture must be prepared as it is used.
    Having assured myself of the successful and constant effects
of this kind of painting, I tried to mix it with different co
louring substances, to render the application of the invention
more general.
    The well known re-action of animal substances and of lime
on the metallic oxides, and particularly on those in which
 oxygen is united to the metal with little force, made me sus
pect an alteration of some colours when mixed with this li
quid ; an alteration naturally produced by the separation of
a part of the oxygen from the metallic oxides.        On the other
hand, the analogy which coloured chalks have with calca
reous earth induced me to believe that their combination
would be attended with the happiest result.          The oxides of
lead, copper, and arsenic, indeed, undergo a singular altera
tion in their respective colours, when they are united with
serum and calcareous earth : but this is not the cafe with co
balt green ; which on that account appears to me to be very
proper for being used as a colouring matter in this new kind
of painting. Those earths, however, called red, green, black,
or yellow, which are of an argillo-calcareous nature, when
mixed with these substances, may furnish different agreeable
colours of a durability equal to the blueish colour produced
merely by the mixture of lime and of serum.
    I have however remarked, that the durability of this paint
ing is considerably altered when there is mixed with it a very
large quantity of colouring earth, such as the black earth used
for painting an iron colour, or the representation of white
marble with black spots. To remedy this inconvenience, no
                               li a                          thing

thing will be necessary but to mix a little white of an egg
with the serum before it is united with the lime or the black
earth.      I must here add, thai wood painted in this manner
may be polislied, and made to acquire a certain degree of
lustre.     In this cafe I have observed that fresh spermaceti
may be substituted with advantage for the tallow or oil in
which the rags employed for rubbing wood before it is po
lished are commonly dipped.             This kind of paint mav be
applied    also  with the  fame   success to earthen ware, lead, iron,
cut stone, &x.
    The circumstances which induced me to employ this new
kind of painting, obliged me so make an extensive use of                    it,
without allowing me time to carry mv operations any further.
More than 300 arrobes * of serum were consumed in the
course of     a few days.     In this manner we were able to paint
not only the passage and bridge of the king's palace, but also
the windows and doors of the fame edifice, those of the
magnificent building of the Exchange, the Place de Taureau,
and many private houses.             The happy effects          produced,
                                                                  it
when exposed to the eyes of the public, are              sufficient proof
                                                          a
that practice here perfectly corresponds with theory.
    It   ishardly necessary to observe, that the surfaces to be
painted must be smooth; that the wood must be covered
with stratum of plaster; and that this painting must not be
         a
applied over painting with oil or with turpentine, because the
heat would make        it crack.
.I    propose to continue the small number of trials              have
                                                                   I       al

The following     is   the result of those which          have hitherto

    In consequence of the viscidity, adhesion, and speedy de

manner as bitumen, to cement with great solidity broken ar

     The hardness of this substance, and its susceptibility of re
 ceiving a polish, induce me to believe that it might be em
 ployed on stucco, and for imitating it on walls and ceilings.
     It may be used also for uniting water-conduits, and for ce
 menting stones of all dimensions, and especially those which
 are put into wood caissons for building under water.
     It appears from different works, that the antients had con
 ceived the idea of employing blood in the composition of their
 cements and mortar; but the use of it in painting was before
 unknown.          Besides, there was too great a distance between
 this use of blood and that of serum freed from the fibrous part
 and the colouring matter, to admit of any doubt that the prin
 ciple of my discovery is entirely my own.
     It follows from what has been here said, that this new
 kind of painting may be added to those already known, and
 that it may be called painting in serum ; that it is as easily
 applied as prepared ; that the elements of it are common, and
 of little value ; and that it unites in it all the advantages of
 painting in oil and in distemper, without having any of their
 inconveniences.

       Remarks upon tie Melting       of Iron in these Furnaces.
   The     effect wished to be produced in air furnaces is the
fusion   of  a certain portion of pig- or cast-iron for the purpose
of  being poured or run into moulds to form articles of almost
every description.
   The preparation previous to melting is as follows :— After
the bottom of the furnace is laid, and smoothed with fresh
sand, and all the openings made air-tight, the furnace-man
introduces a kindling at the teasing-hole, accompanied with
                                                                     '
new pit-coal.        In a few minutes a considerable volume of
dark flame mixed with smoke is produced. The fire quickly
gathers strength ; more coal is introduced ; and the furnace
now becomes silled with a yellow-coloured flame. By con
tinuing this operation for an hour, or an hour and a quarter,
the furnace and flame will have become completely white;
the latter steady, and at times apparently without motion.
The furnace- man now judges the bottom to have been suffi
ciently hardened for receiving the pig-iron withoMt any risk
of sinking. The charging-door is now opened, and the pig-
metal thrown carefully and regularly upon that par' of the

 bottom formerly described as being appropriated for its recep
 tion.    The door is again closed and made air-tight, and the
 operation of firing continued with unremitting care and at
  tention.
    The time of melting depends entirely upon the quantity of
 metal introduced.      The furnaces described above are capable
 of melting from 50 to 60 hundred weight of metal each, and
 when there is a moderate circulation of air they will perform
 this work in 2[ or 3 hours.     In half an hour after the metal
 is introduced it assumes a blackish red colour.          It then
 begins    to brighten with every additional fire, and   in about
 one hour appears white, and begins to lose shape, and resem
 ble a wreath of snow.
    An eye accustomed to such heats will now discern the
 metal beginning to drop, and run down the inclined plane
 in very beautiful streamlets resembling quicksilver. Eight or
 ten of these are visible at a time, and after proceeding half
 way down begin to form junctions with each other, ana flow
 connected into the general cavity or reservoir.      By-and-by
 this becomes filled, and literally forms a beautiful molten
 mirror, in which sometimes part of the interior furnace is
 reflected.
    The furnace-man, by searching at the bridge with his fire-
iron or teaser, judges when the metal is nearly all gone. Of
 this he is certain by looking up from the peep-hole of the
 lading-door.     If the streamlets of the running metal have
 ceased, then the whole is melted, and ready for running out.
    In the operation of melting, the three following circum
 stances ought to be particularly attended to : the thinness
or hotness of the metal ; the waste or loss sustained in melt
 ing; and the quantity of coals employed.
    The first is of the utmost importance, as many articles in
 the foundry business require the metal in a state of the greatest
 division; otherwise they will be found imperfect when taken
 from the sand, and unfit for sale. The furnace-man, there
 fore, is always on the watch to replace the sire as it decay*,
 and keep a large and stiarp volume of flame constantly pasting
 over the metal.
    The waste or loss of real metal is also an object of great
 importance.      This always bears a relation to the quality of
 the iron, the strength and cleanness of the coals, and the
judgment and attention of the melter. Strong iron is found
 always more difficult to fuse; this necessarily exposes it for a
long period in contact with the flame. The reverse happens
with metal that is more fragile, and easier broken in the pig.
The length of the exposure in fusing depends on this ; and

other circumstances being alike, the loss or waste of metal
will also be in the same ratio.
   There are, however, other facts not unworthy of notice.
No. I. pig-iron, or richly carbonated metal, when run from
an air-furnace, will be found in point of quality little better
than No. II. or carbonated iron.         This is owing to a quan
tity of its carbon being destroyed during the fusion. The loss
in melting No. I. iron, therefore, chiefly consists of carbon;
and the deficiency of metal ought never, with a clean bot
tom, to exceed 1 cwt. in 20.
    Carbonated or No. II. iron also becomes deprived of a
considerable portion of its carbonaceous         mixture in fusion ;
and when run from the air-furnace is seldom better than
No. III. metal. The loss sustained in melting may be ave
raged at 7 i- per cent.
   No. III. pig-iron
                          It is,
                           after melting in an air-furnace, found
whitish or mottled.            seldom susceptible of the same nice
                                   is
degree of division as the superior qualities, and loses in fusion
a  much larger proportion of metal, seldom under 10 per cent,
 and frequently 12* or 15.
    The quantity of coals requisite to melt given quantity of
                                                           a
iron  is  various, as much depends upon the quality and fusi
bility of the metal. If the furnace goes one heat          day with
                                                                  a
 No. or II. iron, the quantity of coals will be from 20 to
     I.
 25 cwt. for     ton of iron.
                 a               If two or three heats day, or asa
 many    tons of iron are  melted   at one kindling, the proportion
 of coals will be nearly weight for weight or the iron melted
 when the coals are mixed with fair proportion of small

 with strong large splint coals, one ton of good pig-iron may
 be completely reduced with from 13 to 15 cwt. including the
 previous heating of the furnace.

                                                                            At

 250            Observations  on the Freezing of Water,
    At  present, however, I shall give you only a short account
 of my experiments,      because I hope, in the course of a sew
years, lo collect materials for a more elaborate work on the
freezing of water, and the state of the atmosphere in winter;
having Deen induced to turn my attention to the latter object
by the observations I had made, and which I mentioned to
you three years ago, on the force with which a considerable
quantity of vapour, especially during the time of strong frost,
is disengaged in an aeriform state from freezing water, and
rises, as it were, with violence into the atmosphere ; and on
the increase of volume which the air thereby acquires even
in close vessels, and which it retains during the strongest cold.
   When I traverse the snow-clad fields during the coldest
days of winter; when I consider the dry state ot the air, and
of every thing around me, arising, no doubt, from a strong
and continued tendency of the aqueous particles, of which I
neither fee nor feel any thing, to rife into the higher regions
of the atmosphere; and when in consequence ofthe serenity
of. the heavens I can distinguish very small objects at a great
distance, I cannot help admiring the power of nature, as yet
so little known, by which air so cold and so much condensed
can be so intimately connected with water. This water, in
niv opinion, can be considered only as in an aeriform state,
as such combined with the atmosphere by a very strong affi
nity, and forming with it one and the same body : I must
observe also, that this affinity seems to increase in the ratio
of the cold.
   The atmosphere being an elastic fluid in which caloric is
combined bv the strongest affinity with its bases, it by these
means appears to be more capable of preserving by the power
of this union, in the state of atmospheric vapour, the aeriform
water which has so weak an affinity for its specific caloric.
The air thus condensed, and containing more aerial particles
in the fame space than in summer, attracts, on this account,
the water with much greater force. The water becoming
aeriform during the process of freezing, and in that state en
tering into combination with the air, has no need of external
heat to maintain it in that state of union. The aeriform state
of water, which in summer is maintained by the heat ofthe
surrounding bodies, is in this season preserved by a state of
greater affinity.
   Is the water then, during this cold, serene, wintery atmo
sphere, in a more perfect state of union with the air?      I an
swer in the affirmative; and therefore I can readily conceive
why the mercury stands at such heights in the barometer
during that season. This air also may be considered as a re

                         is   so                             But
as
 I     dare not venture to proceed further in this path, for
which    I  yet feel myself too weak,        I shall return to the prin
cipal object of this paper.
 I    have repeated the experiments which before communi
                                                   I
cated to yon, as already observed, and with the same result                     :
I  entertained no doubt that the dilatation of freezing water,
previously deprived of air,            to be ascribed, besides to crys
                                        is
tallization, in particular to the aeriform water, which during
the freezing being carried off with the liberated caloric, de
ranges in its passage and separates the crystals from each
other.   I    had entirely given up the idea of the existence of
air in chemical union with water, or with its bases, which
could not be separated             by
                                    boiling, and which by freezing
might again       be  liberated  in  an elastic state, till the treatise
of my    friend   Dr.   Uilkens,  written    inMarch 1800, came into
my    hands.
   The well-known merit of this philosopher, the modesty
with which he communicates his ideas to the public, made
me consider       itas my duty to examine his objections with all
due respect   ;   but at the same time to prove to my pupils,                   if
possible, the truth of my experiments.
    According to my experiments, water can be perfectly freed
from air. In such water no air-bubbles arise during the pro
cess of freezing, provided the air has no access to it.                   Its
communication with the air would instantly make them ap
         '

pear.
    For the fake of those who may be desirous to repeat my
experiments,      I  shall describe an infallible method             bywhich
the smallest traces of air in water may be detected.                None of
the means commonly used for the purpose are sufficient when
accuracy     is required, as       the cafe
                                   is        in  the present instance.
    I pour    the  water   destined  for  examination      into an earthen
vessel, communicate        a  blue tint to   it   by   sufficient quantity
                                                       a
of solution of litmus, which             Ipreserve ready, of         acertain
strength, for such purposes         :   then fill with
                                        I                   it flask in such
                                                                 a
a  manner, that the aperture of the flask               kept under water
                                                       is
during the time of filling; taking care to (hake the flask, that
the smallest air-bubble may not remain                 in
                                                       it.       then invert
                                                                 I
the flask in the water, and introduce into              it,in the common
                                                                    manner,

25 1           Observations    on the Freezing       of Water,
 manner, pure nitrous gas until i-i6th or i-2oth of it is
 filled.     I then place the flask in a dish, and intercept its com
 munication with the atmosphere by means of mercury. Now,
 if there be any air in the water, its oxygen gas must unite
 with the nitrous gas, producing more or less acid according
 to the quantity of the oxygen gas.              The solution of litmus,
 therefore, must acquire a red colour, and that, cateris faribus,
 more or less, and in a shorter or longer time, according to
 the quantity of oxygen present in the water. When you in
 tend to examine different kinds of water at the fame time,
 after it has stood two days introduce into it carefully, in small
         ities, by means of a syringe, an alkaline solution ; and
  rom the quantity of the solution necessary to restore the blue
 ?|uant
 colour to the solution of litmus, which has been turned red,
you can estimate very accurately the relative quantity of oxy
gen gas, and consequently that of the common air mixed
with the water.
     A proof of this kind was necessary in order to determine
 with certainty whether water could be entirely freed from
oxygen gas, and consequently from common air ; for azotic
gas is never present in water alone.
     Distilled water, however carefully prepared, and immedi
 ately received as it comes off in flasks closely stopped, cannot
 bear the proof by nitrous gas.               Water freed from air by
means of the air-pump again imbibes it as soon as the air
has free access to it ~: even if the water be boiled in the flask,
when exposed for a few moments to the atmosphere it be
 comes, in some measure, reddish by this proof.
     After a great many fruitless attempts, I was never able to
free water entirely from air but by the following process :
     I boil pure water for at least two hours in a large bason ;
colour it with litmus ; warm a Urge stoppered flask in                   it,
                                                                         and,
holding   it   by    means of  a    pair of forceps, fill it   entirely with
the boiling water.        I   let the flask remain for at least half an
hour with       its  aperture some inches below the surface of the
boiling     water,    frequently striking its fides with the forceps to
expel any      air   which  may still remain    in   it.
                                                       I     then invert the
flask, place   it   in an earthen vessel, and immediately introduce
nitrous gas            then intercept all communication with the
                   by I
               :
external air          mercury, of which there must be            a  sufficient
quantity,      on   account   of the  diminution    of   the  volume   of the
water, and particularly of the nitrous gas,                by   cooling; in
consequence of which the mercury rises into the flask to                        a
certain height.         In this manner, had the satisfaction to fee
                                         I
that the liquor retains its blue colour for weeks               ;    acertain
proof    that   water   can  be  entirely  freed  from   air.
                                                                         I     was

                     and on the Nature  of Snow.               253
     I  was now enabled to proceed a step further, and to deter
mine whether after this process any of the bases of air, and,
in particular, free oxygen, remained in the water, which
during freezing might be extricated in the state of elastic air.
     On one of the coldest evenings of the month of December
1801, I filled some flasks, in the manner already mentioned,
with blue-coloured water freed from its air and with nitrous
        and others with water without any addition ; all of which
Fis, placed in the window.     Next morning no change was to
be observed, though the frost had been very strong : the water
in all the flasks was in a state of perfect fluidity. This phæ-
uornenon, I acknowledge, is very common : but I mention
it because some consider the impeded disengagement of air
as the cause of it ; an idea which I was not ignorant of, and
which agrees with the result of this experiment.
      This circumstance rendered the experiment more agreea
 ble; and being certain that every thing would freeze on the
 least agitation, I was enabled to observe better the smallest
 change which would take place during the process of freezing.
      What I expected took place; none of those present during
 the freezing could observe the least change 01 colour.         We
 every where saw bubbles appear, and disperse themselves
  widely through the lump of ice; but they were merely ni
  trous gas.     At the end of two days we did not perceive the
  least trace of redness in the ice, till the flask at length burst
 ing, and the air thus having free access, the whole mass in
  stantly became red.     The flasks which contained no nitrous
  gas, or tincture of litmus, exhibited during the freezing of the
  water no air-bubbles ; but when the flasks burst in conse
  quence of the frost increasing, the mass of ice was immedi
  ately interspersed here and there with air-bubbles.
      But though these experiments fully proved my idea in re
  gard to the origin of air-bubbles in ice, 1 was very desirous
   to observe the phænomena of freezing in vacuo.
      My former pupil and worthy friend Van In En Kniphuisen,
   lord of Nienoord, who has added so much lustre to his noble
   birth by an assiduous cultivation of the sciences, was so kind
   as to assist me in these experiments, and to allow me the use
   of his valuable apparatus.
       The experiment of Lichtenberg falls    to the ground.     We
   have seen curious phænomena.        I shall give you an account
   of them, which I find in my memorandums, dated Janu
   ary 16, 1802. This will be more than sufficient to induce
   all the amateurs of the study, of nature to repeat my experi
    ments.
       We   had already observed several times, with great satisfac
                                                                tion,

   354          Observations     on the   Freezing    of Water,
   tion, the spongy appearance which water acquires by freezing
   in vacuo, in consequence of its greater expansion, which every
   lime that the glass burst was unaccompanied with the appear
   ance of air-bubbles, but immediately on the introduction of
   air they spread themselves through the whole mass.                  Hence
  there was no doubt that this increased dilatation was entirely
   the consequence of the aeriform water,the expansion of which
  was not impeded by the pressure of the atmosphere.                  We re
  peated this experiment for the last time on the fame day,
  when the frost .was perceptibly less intense.                A beer-glass
  capable   of containing eight      ounces   was    two-thirds   filled with
  distilled  water  as much    freed   from  air  as  possible : it  was im
  mediately placed     under    the  receiver   of  an  air-pump, and the
  air  was  exhausted   as speedily   a  spofiible.    At  the end of some
  hours   we  saw  a  phænomenon         which   appeared so strange and
  singular,  that  I was   at first incapable of saying what it might
  be. The freezing water had raised itself up in a straight
  column nearly three inches above the glass, being in thick
  ness in the middle above a line, and at the bottom two lines.
  The water was equally frozen at the surface and throughout
  the whole mass : the cellular or spongy appearance existed
 only under the column, and extended to the middle of the
  base.    No air-bubbles were any where to be seen. It is pro
 bable that the flowness of the freezing may have contributed
 to produce this singular phænomenon.
     We conjectured, and with great probability, that this co
 lumn was hollow, and had served for discharging the aeriform
 water. As soon as the air was admitted under the receiver
 we saw a movement in the pipe like that of air which pene
 trates into a wet glass tube, and in the mean time a great
 many air-bubbles appeared in the cavities at the bottom of
 the column.       By introducing a stiff bristle into the aperture,
 and employing a magnifying glass, we could easily trace the
 hollow part of the tube to the cavity where the air-bubbles
 were.
     The air, therefore, on this occasion had no share in the
expansion of the ice ; and as our water before freezing never
contains so much air, it appears that during the freezing it
could contribute little or nothing towards the expansion.
     Expansion is a phænomenon common during all crystal
lization, and is a consequence of the peculiar regular form
which the moleculæ of bodies adhering mutually to each other
assume, and by which means larger vacuities are formed.
Expansion is increased, and particularly during the crystal
lization of water, by the aeriform state to which a part of it
is brought by the disengaged caloric.
                                                                      While

    While    a  part of this caloric,   disengaged during the process
of freezing,    keeps the water beneath the crust of ice in a state
of warmth      and fluidity, another part, in consequence of the
aeriform expansion of the water, forms the cavities in the ice
by which the so necessary communication between the ex
ternal air and the fluid water is maintained, in order to sup
port the life of those beings which reside in it.
    And what would be the cafe with vegetation if ice were
a body impermeable to air? While the warmth of the earth
is maintained as far as possible under its hard surface by the
power of congelation, the air continually penetrates through
it ; by which means the principles of germination are pre
served in the seeds, and prepared for development.
    My experiments have also shown that ice water produced
by a slow thaw contains more air than water which has not
 been frozen during the fame time.
    But snow water in particular contains much more air
than common rain water; and this air contains more oxygen
 than the air obtained from rain water.
    The opinion of Haflenfratz, which may be seen in the
 fourth part of the Journal Poly technique *, is fully confirmed,
 whatever Dr. Carradori may assert to the contrary \. Snow
 water may, with great propriety, be called oxygenated water.
 This I can incontrovertibly prove, not only in the usual man
 ner by sulphate of iron, but in particular by means of nitrous
 gas ; and have shown it more than twenty times in my lec
 tures, as a thing of importance not only to philosophy but also
 to pharmacy. What I assert may be easily proved in the fol
 lowing manner:
     Fill two flasks, one with snow and the other with rain
 water, and place them, inverted, in boiling water : the air
 will then evidently be seen to collect itself at the bottom (now
 the top).       Yesterday my amanuensis, H. Uilkens, exhibited
 to us this important phenomenon.                 A flask filled with rain
 water, which at that time consitted chiefly of melted snow,
 did not present one-half of the air-bubbles exhibited by snow
 water collected in the garden.
     Besides this larger quantity of air, and particularly oxygen
  gas, snow water contains also much fewer extractive particles
  than rain water; and from these two circumstances we can
  explain the properties by which this water distinguishes itself
  from ram water, as a medicine, as drink, and in many ceco-
  nomical uses.
     It is needless to inquire, why this water is sometimes hurt-

2$6         Observations on the Freezing of Water, tSc.
ful in cases of inflammation of the eyes ? why it occasions
colic, griping pains, and other affections, when drunk cold ?
But, without enlarging further on this subject, I shall here
mention a remarkable effect of the wise dispensations of Na
ture. As snow water contains oxygen united with little ca
loric, it thereby possesses a stronger tendency to communicate
its oxygen to bodies susceptible of oxygenation. No substance
in nature deprives water of its oxygen with more avidity than
fertile earth. Snow water mixed with vegetable mould, and
exposed to the solar light, improves the mould in a short
time.    Almost as soon as a lively fish placed in a glass of
water containing oxygen makes the superfluous oxygen dis
appear, and fills the water with carbonic acid gas in its room,
is the oxygen taken up by the earth assisted by the influence
of the light.     Pure earths do not exhaust snow water of it*
oxygen ; nor do they attract the oxygen of the atmosphere,
as asserted by Von Humboldt.
    I have long been convinced of the contrary, from various
experiments.      It appears, in particular, that carbon is the
principle .whose strong affinity for oxygen produces so many
important phænomena, and which nature continually em
ploys in the composition and decomposition of organic bo
dies : it is carbon also which in this cafe deprives water of
its oxygen, and consequently frees it from what renders it
prejudicial to health, and unfit for the purposes of life.
   That which is prejudicial to us is improved by the ground,
and at the lame time gives power and activity to the mould.
   When the snow covers the earth, it tends to keep it warm :
the snow, as a body which cannot conduct caloric in a very
small degree, prevents, by its interposition, the cold air from
taking the caloric from the earth. But this does not appear
to be the only cause of its fertilizing power. The snow melt
ing and penetrating into the softened earth communicates to
it oxygen, promotes by these means the germination of feeds:
the young plant grows with more vigour, because the carbon
of the fertile earth combining with the oxygen is converted
into carbonic acid, and thereby acquires more solubility; while
the water, by its stimulating property, contributes to excite
that activity which had been rendered dormant in the roots
by the cold.
   This fertilizing power of snow, which was before ascribed
to nitrous particles, but the presence of which was never
          seems thus, according to the idea of Ingenhousz, Has-
firoved,
  enfratz, and other naturalists, to be explained in a more sa
tisfactory manner.
    I shall now conclude this short essay by expressing a hope
                                                            that

admire with me the great and noble operations of the divine
providence, which so evidently appear in the different changes
effected in air and water, and which are so necessary for sup
porting and maintaining the creation.

XLV.       Observations    on   the Lotusof Egypt.      By Alt rb
 Raffenau-Delile,               Member of the Institute of Egypt * .
OlNCE        my return from Egypt           T   presented to the Museum
bf Natural History different kinds of feeds and several bulbs
of the nymphæa cœrulea, of which an accurate description was
       in Egypt by C. Savigny, my colleague. These bulbs
  egan to germinate-towards the end of Meflidor, when kept
fiven
immersed in water.    I collected them in the island of Ro-
setta in the month   of Ventose, year 8 ; and though I had kept
them two years without planting them, they had not become
desiccated: one of the plants of the nymphæa has already pro
duced severa Jflowers somewhat smaller, less odorous, and of
a paler blue colour, than those in Egypt.
   Though I made a tour with the Commission of Arts into
Upper Egypt during the time of the inundation, which is
that also of the increase of the two kinds of nymphæa of the
Nile, we met with none of these plants in that country.
   The waters of the Nile rife to a considerable height in the
Said, and much less in Lower Egypt. The nymphæa, there
fore, easily reaches the surface of the water, during the in
undation, in the lakes and the canals of the Delta, where
they are not hurt by the current of the river.       It       is,
                                                           perhaps,
for contrary reason that the nymphæa does not grow in the
   a
 Said.
   We observed the nymphæa cærulea painted and engraven
on the Egyptian monuments much oftener than the two kinds
of lotus mentioned        by
                          the oldest hiltorians.    This nymphæa
has a  great  resemblance   to these kinds   of  lotus, and appears
to be  a third species of it.
   Most authors who have undertaken to make known the
lotus in regard to its antiquity have fallen into many errors               ;
but Mahudel, of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles

258                 Observations      on the   Lotus    of Egypt.
Lettres *, and lately professor Sprengel, of Halle f, have given
very accurate information respecting these plants.
    The expedition to Egvpt afforded me an opportunity of
making the following observations on the fame subject : they
are naturally connected with those already made in Egypt
by C. Savigny on the nymphæa cærulea, and complete the
history of that plant.
    Herodotus J relates that the Egyptians fed on the lotus
which grew in the waters of the Nile.                   He calls this lotus a
lily,  and   fays  that  the    feeds,   similar     to  those of the poppy,
were employed for making bread.                    He adds, that they ate
also the roots of the lotus, which were round, of the size of
an apple, and of a sweet and agreeable savour.                       Herodotus
then speaks of another kind of                 lit
                                                vresembling       arose,  which
grew    also in  the Nile,     the  fruit  of which       had   the   form   of  a
wasp's    nest,  and  which      contained       several   seeds   good   to eat,
and of the size of an olive.
    Theophrastus       gives     avery accurate description of the fame
             "

they are inundated.          Its flowers are white, and have petals
like those of the lily. They spring up                  great numbers close
                                                        in

their fruit. These flowers open again when the fun reappears,
and rife above the water and this alternation
                                   ;                              isrepeated till
the fruit       completely formed, and the flowers have dropped

                       is                       large poppy, and contains
                                                a
a   great number or feeds similar to grains of millet.                       The
Egyptians deposit the fruit in heaps, and suffer the rind lo
putrefy they then separate the seeds
           ;                                            washing them in the

ported by pedicles similar to those of fruits : they are large,
and have a resemblance to a Thessalian cap.       When one of
the beans is bruised there is seen in the inside of it a small
body folded together, from which the leaf arises.     The root
is thicker than that of a strong reed, and has partitions like
the stem.     It serves as nourishment to those who reside near
the marslies.     This plant grows spontaneously, and in abun
dance. It is sown also in the mud, by forming for it a bed
of straw, in order that it may not rot." ¦
   The lotus of Herodotus and Theophrastus grows also in
Egvpt.    It is the nympbaa lotus of Linnæus *, the cha
racters of which, compared by C. Savigny to those of the
nympbœa cærulea,          agree with the descriptions                   given by the
antients.
    In regard to the rose lily or Egyptian bean, which is fre
quently carved out among the ornaments and symbolical re
presentations of the Egyptian temples, it no longer grows in
that country; and would have remained unknown to natu
ralists had it not heen discovered in India.        This plant has
been called by Linnæus f the nympbaa nelumbo.             Its fruit,
which the Greeks compare to a wasp's nest, has a perfect re
semblance to it.    They called it ciborion J on account, no
doubt, of its resemblance to a cup. This fruit is shaped like
the spout of a watering-pot, and is flatted at the upper part,
which contains from fifteen to thirty small fossæ, containing a
like number of seeds of the size of a nut, and somewhat promi
nent. The plumula§, which is the rudiment of the leaves,                            is,
indeed, rolled up in the middle of the feed, as Theophrastus
fays. The flowers are roses, and very large.        The leaves are
orbicular, ihuriform, and about two feet in diameter                        ||.
   Belon has confounded the Egyptian bean with the coloca-

                                                           is                        :

from antient sculptures as from the account of historians.
The rose lotus, or Egyptian bean, is very correctly repre
sented in the mosaic of Palestrine, an explanation of which
has been given by Barthelemy in the Memoirs of the Aca
demy of Inscriptions and Belles- Lettres *. The fruit, the
flowers, and the leaves of that plant are exceedingly like.
They float on the surface of ihe water in a lake which carries
several barks during the time of a festival.                This painting
brings     to   remembrance       a  passage  of  Strabo f, who   fays, that
people     made     excursions   of   pleasure  in boats on  the  lakes  co
vered with beans, and that they sheltered themselves from the
fun with the leaves of that plant.               On the Egyptian monu
ments Harpocrates is represented above the flower of the fruit
 of the rose lotus.          This plant, so well known in antient
 Egypt,      is  at  present   celebrated in the religion of the Bra-
 mins, and is often placed among the attributes of the Indian
 deities   J.
      It is not possible to say to what kind of lotus the flowers
 seen represented on the heads of the Egyptian kings or dei
 ties in several medals belonged, because the species of lotus
 differ chiefly in regard to the colour of their flowers, and the
 form of their fruits or leaves; but on the wajls of the tem
 ples of Egypt, and on the cafes containing the mummies,
 they may be easily distinguistied when the painting is in good
 preservation.         The Egyptians often represented the leaves of
 the white lotus (nympbaa lotus) of the fame size as the flow
 ers, though naturally the leaves are much larger ; hut they
 have omitted to mark the indentations of these leaves, which
 indeed are wanting when the plant is very young.                     I have,
 however, seen in the table of Latopolis this lotus represented
  with the leaves indented.
       But it would be in vain to seek for scrupulous exactness in
  allegorical sculptures.          Thus on the base of the statue of the
  Nile, placed in the gardens of the Tuileries, the fruit of the
  lotus is very exactly represented, but the leaves which ac
  company it are not those of that plant.

       t Strabo, lib. xvii.  The Greek text has been badly interpreted by
  translators, who supposed      that the boats rowed along under the shade of
   the leaves, which role to a great height above the water.       These leaves
   float on the surface of the water, and are very broad.   It appears that the
   boats were covered with them in order to form a shade, as they arc covered
   in Egypt at present with the leaves of the date-tree and with reeds.

  that of the poppy, may be distinguished              on the Egyptian
  monuments.          Jn my opinion, this resemblance has made
  the fruit of the lotus, delineated on several Egyptian medals,
 to be confounded with that of the poppy. The fruits repre
  sented on these medals are the fame as those sculptured on
  the Egyptian monuments anterior to those of the Greeks.
  It does not appear from any historical testimony that the
  Egyptians ever made much use of the poppy ; and they ra
 ther placed the fruits of the lotus among the attributes of Isis,
  with ears of corn, as a sign of abundance and fertility, since
  they were long accustomed to make a fort of bread with the
  feeds of that plant. The Egyptian lotus was very little known
  to the Greeks and the Romans, who compared it to the most
  common plants.           Herodotus calls the lotus a lily; Theo-
  phrastus compared it to the poppy, and Pliny calls its flowers
                  Another cause which may have occasioned the
Jioppies*.
   otus to be confounded with the poppv, is the resemblance
  which exists between the attributes of Isis and those of Ceres,
  to whom the poppy was consecrated f.
     The nymphtsa lotus and the nymphœa nelumbo are the two
  species of lotus described by Herodotus and Theophrastus.
  Both grew naturally in blgypt, and were cultivated in that
  country.       It was the fruit of the cultivated nympbisa lotus to
  which Pliny gives the name of lotometra J.
     A passage in Athenæu6 proves that the nympbœa aerulea
  is a third species of lotus. This author relates that Antino-
  ian § crowns were made at Alexandria with the rose lotus,
  and that the blue were interwoven with these crowns.              The
  flowers of these different kinds of lotus are very odoriferous,
  have great splendour and freshness, and must have been se
  lected for making crowns.             Heliodorus relates, that couriers
  who announced a victory in Meroe were crowned with
  lotus || . When Plutarch speaks of a crown of melilot which
  fell from the head of Osiris 11, and when he classes that plant
  among those which grow in the Nile, he alludes to a crown
  of lotus. Athenæus relates, that the lotus was also called me
  lilot **, and that it was formed into melilotine garlands. The
  fame historian tells us also why the rose lotus was called the
  Antinoian. A poet presented the emperor Adrian, during

his residence at Alexandria, with a rose lotus as a rarity, and
said that this lotus, which had grown up in a country moist
ened by the blood of so terrible a lion, ought to be called the
Antihoian. The lion of which the poet nere speaks had ra
vaged a part of Libya, and had at length been destroyed by
the emperor Adrian during a hunting excursion.
    Independently of the plausible conjectures of several wri
ters respecting the origin of the religious employment which
the Egyptians made of the lotus, these plants, on account of
their simple and natural properties, must have been very much
celebrated in antient Egypt.       This country being indebted to
the Nile for its prosperity,   its inhabitants considered as the
figns of a great benefit the plants which grew in the waters
of that river. The flowers of the lotus rife lo the surface of
the water when the Nile begins to increase, and announce
the inundation, which is about to bring abundance along
with it. Besides the names of bacben'm and naufar, which
the Egyptians give to the nymphæa, they call them also
ara'is el Nil, that is to fay, which grow up in the Nile. 1 hefe
names certainly refer to the fertility about to be renewed by
the presence of the waters.
    The Egyptians collected the roots of the lotus when the
waters of the Nile retired. At present they are seldom col
lected ; but they multiply very much in the rice-fields, so that
the peasants are obliged to pull them up after the rice har
vest.    They then sometimes eat these roots, which they call
biaro.     I saw some of them sold in the market of Damietta
in the month of Frimaire, year 7 : I tasted them, and sound
that their taste was not disagreeable.     These roots are round,
or somewhat oblong, and smaller than a common egg.            The
rind is black, and coriaceous : they exhibit tubercles, traced
out by the base of the petioles or shoots.     These roots in the
 inside are white and farinaceous; in the centre they are yel-
 lowifli. After the inundation they remain funk in the earth
which has become dry ; and the following year, when co
 vered by water, they fend forth leaves and small roots merely
 from the summit, which has a cottony appearance.             The
 radiculæ penetrate laterally into   the mud, where  they produce
 tubercles which become similar to the former roots, and
 which multiply the plant.         The Egyptians to collect the
 feeds  wastied them, after leaving the rind of the fruit to pu
 trefy.   This  method is the only one that could be employed,
 otherwise these seeds would income mixed and deliccated
 with the parenchyme of the fruit. These seeds are very small,
 role-coloured or gray on the outside, and farinaceous within.
Ihe antients compared them to grains of millet. I have
                                                            heard

                    Observations     on the    Lotus   of Egypt.         263
heard the peasants call them docbn el bachenrn, that is to
 fay, millet of bachenin : but they told me that they were of
very little use. The roots and feeds of the nymphæa lotus and
those of the nymph/sa cærulea are similar.       It is natural,
then, to believe that the Egyptians not only made garlands
of the blue lotus, but that they used it for food like the
nymphæa lotus.      This is proved by the Egyptian sculptures,
since the blue nymphæa is often represented among the offer
ings of fruits in the grottos of Said, the paintings of which
exhibit scenes of domestic life.
    Of the two kinds of nymphæa, the Egyptians at present
prefer that with blue flowers, which is often represented in
the temples.     Ebn il Bitar, an Arabian physician, who has
written a treatise on plants, quoted by Prosper Alpinus *, di
stinguishes two kinds of bacbemn or nymphæa, the best of
which is called that of the Arabs. I observed that the pea
sants of the Delta gave the name of bachenin of the Arabs.
to the nymphæa cærulea, and that they set less value on the
nymphæa lotus.
   As the antients have made             very little mention of the blue
lotus, one might believe that            it was brought to Egypt front
the East Indies along with the           rice, since it grows abundantly
in the rice-fields of the Delta;          but the paintings in the tem
ples evidently prove           that this plant is as antient in Egypt as
the nymphæa lotus.
   It is certain that the nymphæa cærulea exists in India. In
the Horlus Malabaricus it is called citambel^.       Hum phi us
considers  it as  a variety with blue flowers of the  nymphæa
lotus %.   This nymphæa grows also at the Cape of Good
Hope, and seems to be sufficiently distinguished by the fol
lowing phrase of Breyn : nymphæa fore cærulea edorattffima.

XLVI.       Memoir on some Peculiarities in (be Anatomy and
    Pbyfiology of the Shark, particularly respecting the Pro
    duction of its Young. By Dr.     Mitchill,     of New York*.
 OA.LTH0UGH the generation and multiplication of ani
 mals have so long exercised the attention of philosophers, the
 whole subject remains involved in intricacy and indistinctness.
 The maxim laid down by Harvey, and adopted by Linnæus,
 of omne animal ex ovo, that every animal proceeds from an
 egg, has, perhaps, been too generally received, since nume
 rous facts, related by Mr. Bonnet, in his work entitled Con
siderations fur les Corps Organises, evince the propagation of
 animals, in a great variety of cafes, from germs. Notwith
 standing the multiplicative powers of animals have been thus
 traced to eggs and germs, yet a popular distinction still pre
 vails to a considerable extent, of classing animals that propa
 gate their species by means of genital organs, into oviparous
 and viviparous.
     The great discovery of Haller, that the membrane covering
 the yolk of an egg was really a continuation of the membrane
 covering the intestines of the chick, had not ohty given coun
 tenance to the idea of the pie-existence of the embryo, but
 has shown that animals, whether of the oviparous or vivi
 parous kirids, really propagated their species in pretty much
 the fame wav.
     Amidst the different modes in which the embryo and its
 membranes are organized in different animals, there seems
 to be one cafe which has not been hitherto described with
 the accuracy and minuteness which its singularity deserves :
 the genus of the fqualus, which includes all the animals of
 the shark tribe, has some peculiarities which make these ani
 mals approach both to the oviparous and viviparous classes,
 without, however, belonging strictly to either.
     It had been known a long time, that the young of the
 shark had something in their structure considerably different
 from any other creatures, and figures of them have been given
 by Edwards in his Natural History, and probably copied from
 thence into the Encyclopædia; but there has not been, as yet,
 any dissection of these animals in this period of their exist
 ence, nor any explanation of their physiology that I know of.
  It is the object of this short memoir to explain the structure
 and functions of the feetus of a species of shark found fre
 quently along the coast of New- York, in the waters of the
 Atlantic, during the summer months.             About two years

        On the Anatomy and Pbyjiology as the Shark.             3,6$
ago, as I was engaged in a fishing party in one of the bay*
on the south side ofLong Island, a shark, between four and
five feet in length, was taken in the seine, and secured in our
boat, without receiving any material injury. Upon examina
tion, this animal was found to be a female, whose uterus con
tained eleven young ones, of the size and figure represented
in the plate.
    Besides these young ones that had advanced thus far ia
their growth, there were contained a large number of ova
within the body of this fish, in different degrees of evolution
and size, some of thetn resembling the full grown eggs of
the tortoise, aud others similar to the smaller rudiments of
eggs found in the ovaria of laying hens.       On opening the
uterus with a knife, the young fishes, as represented in the
figure, were found each connected with an egg, dependent
from that part of the belly which may be considered as the
umbilicus, and appearing in the form of a very large hernia.
This hernia, on examination, proved to be a true ovum, filled
with yolky substance, evidently intended for its nourishment:
and what was very remarkable, the young animal, though
grown to a considerable fize, and connected in this manner
with its egg, had no connection whatever by means of an
umbilical cord, 3 placenta, or by vessels of any kind, to the
 uterus of its dam ; but it was so completely organized as to
derive no sustenance to its body, nor to receive any renova
 tion of its blood from its parent.
    The membrane covering the egg contained most beautiful
 ramifications of blood-vessels.   The arteries descending from
 the little fish could be seen sending off their branches over
 its whole exterior surface ; and terminating in veins, to unite
 their trunks* and carry back their contents.
     The singularity of all these appearances was considerably
 heightened by the capability ef the little sharks, when cut
 out of the uterus, to live for a considerable time in the open
 air. The larger part of the brood had been left on the grafs
 of the shore where the dam had been dissected ; but the three
 which I reserved for examination lived, and exhibited, during
  the greater part of the time, brisk motion for almost two
  hours, although exposed to the temperature of a common
  atmosphere.    During this time, while they     lay
                                                   before me on
a   plate, nothing of the kind appeared more beautiful or         di
  stinct than the branches of blood-vessels shooting through
  and running over the transparent membrane of the egg, the
  blood evidently appearing to acquire  a brighter scarlet colour,
  whilst the fish was thus exposed to the air, than      had pos
  sessed during the immersion of the young animal

membrane, the oxygen of the air to which it was exposed ;
the union of which with the blood evidently brightened its
colour, and imparted to it at the fame time so much of a sti
mulant quality as to have shortened the duration of its life by
excessive excitement.
   The internal structure of the foetus of this shark may be
seen in the plate.  The dissection was made by my colleague
Mr. Post, professor of anatomy in Columbia College ; and
the drawing was executed, immediately after, by Dr. Alex
ander Anderson, of New York, in the presence of the late
Dr. Elihu H. Smith, Mr. William Dunlap, and Mr. Thome.

     A species ot (hark, called catulus major vulgaris, is deli
neated by Edwards, but appears to be different from this.
He has taken two views of the parent animal, and two more
of the young. From the figures there given, it would seem
that the same law of generation obtained as in this species.
All the species probably breed in the fame way.
     There is a great variety in the multiplicative process of
living beings. The female rana pipa, or Surinam frog, nou
rishes its young in certain cells or cavities in her back, and
not in the womb.           The opossum of this country supports her
 young      appendant    to  the teats within the paunch or sac,
 calleu a false belly.         The kangaroo of New Holland has
somewhat of a similar structure and oeconomy. More ex
 tensive and penetrating inquiries (how the exceptions to the
 common mode of generation to be almost indescribably cu
 rious and diversified.       We fee no end to the variety of ways
 in which the perpetuation of the species is carried on. Eveji
 Spallanzani (5 Viaggi alle due Sicilie, 8tc. p. 46), though
 he went to the lake of Orbitello on purpose to examine the
 anatomy of the large eels which live there, could discover in
 them no appearance of sex.
     When I published my Inaugural Dissertation in 1786,
 Circa nov'i Geniluram Animalis, I was decidedly in favour of
 the hypothesis of pre-existent germs, and of the production
 of animals by their gradual evolution. All my numerous
  experiments on generation appeared at that time to lead to
  such a conclusion, though I have since had a good deal of
  reason to doubt the soundness of the inference; and the ex
 periment now to be rtlated, though it throws light on some
 part of the process, leaves the main question almost as un
 settled as ever.     In 1789 I ordered a large sow to be killed,
  immediately after having had intercourse with a male. On
 examining the genital organs, the blood-vessels of the vagina,
  uterus, fallopian tubes, and simbriæ, were more than usually

  the most remarkable appearances were in the ovarium itself.
 The sow had borne pigs before.                  Some of the ova were of
  course exhausted of their powers, and exhibited the appear
 ance common in such cases. The whole ovarium was tinged
 with blood, and appeared to have been under the operation
 of a powerful stimulus. The entire substance seemed to have
 been enlarged. The ova partook of this enlargement, and all
 of them had evidently shared in the excitement and suffusion.
 Some of them were but little swelled : some were so tumkl as
 to be on the point of bursting : the membrane of others was
 ruptured, and the contents partly protruded ; and, in several,
 the substance discharged from the broken ovum was fairly
 within the grasp of the fimbriæ. I imagined now I had be
 fore me proof sufficient to determine the derivation of the
 foetus from the mother. I accordingly examined the portions
 of substance discharged from one ovum, and extracted from
 others, with all possible care.            But instead of finding an emr
 bryo,    or  any thing      like the rudiment    of a young animal, the
 little masses I had obtained resembled coagulated blood more
 than any thing to which I can compare them, and appeared
 to have no more of organization or figure than is frequently
•seen in grumes or clots of that fluid.

   J.  HE substratum to this soil being impervious to water,
 the surface must consequently be continually saturated with
 moistnre.        Many landlords on such soils restrict their te
 nants, by covenants, not to till or plough up the old grafs
 lands, under an apprehension of the soil being exhausted by
 tillage and cropping.             In this unproductive state the land
 lets for from five shillings to seven shillings and sixpence an
 acre ; and, being always full of stagnant water, the produce
 consists of poisonous weeds, water quitch, and a little sour
 grafs.      Two acres will keep one head of lean cattle alive for

 Number, p. 167.
                                                                     twenty

                 of old Grass Lands       on a  direS Clay.            tSq
twenty spring and summer weeks.                Some labour, and a con
siderable expense,       will be requisite   to bring this stubborn, ste
rile foil to a state    of fertility.
      I would  first recommend the surface to be pared and burned,
and      the ashes to be secured dry upon the headlands of the
fields, by a covering of earth, sods, or thatch.             This opera
tion must be finished in the summer.                  As soon as the au
tumnal rains have moistened the foil so as to enable a plough
to turn      a  furrow seven or eight inches deep, this operation
should be performed, forming each ridge with only two fur
rows, three feet from the centre of one ridge to the centre of
the other.        Then let the scarifier, with three long tines, or
 teeth, pafe      at  the bottom of every furrow to loosen the foil
 five or fix inches deeper.          Water furrows should be cut so as
 to lay the land dry all the winter.            Should the winter prove
 favourable, the tops of these ridges may be harrowed down
 with the fixed harrow, and the scarifier passed again through
 the bottom of the furrows, and the ridge formed over tins
 deeply pulverized foil : if not, they must remain until per
  fectly dry in the spring. In telling soils of all denominations
  in which the clay predominates, this general rule should be
  observed ; no injury will be sustained from ploughing them
  when wet, previous to the winter frosts : but all the horses
  on a farm had better remain idle than touch a furrow in the
  spring, until the soil be perfectly dry. When in this latter
  state, narrow down the tops of the ridges ; scarify, with Mr.
   Cooke's scarifier, the bottoms, and once more reverse the
   lands, forming the ridges where the furrows were.                Thus a
   depth of fifteen inches of finely pulverized foil will be ob
   tained by two half ploughings, two scarifyings, and two har-
   rowings; at least the foil will be so much opened to that
   depth as to admit the rain water to pass freely. Every shower
   will not make a paste on the surface, neither will forty-eight
   hours fun form it into bricks.           In short, by stirring this land
   deep you avoid the injuries to which it was before exposed
   by excessive wet or drought, and the soil will become healthy
    and productive.        Should it not be sufficiently pulverized for
    turnips,   scarify,   harrow,     and roll, with a heavy roller only
    five feet long, until a garden tilth be obtained, leaving the
    land, when completely fine, on three-feet ridges.              Previous
    to putting ashes on for drilling turnips, beat down three or
    four inches of the tops of the ridges with a fled, or beam of
    wood five feet long, annexed to the handles of Mr. Cooke's
    scarifier. On this bed of finely pulverized mould in the fur
    rows spread the ashes ; about eighty bushels on an acre. This
     work will be easily performed, as the horse will walk in the
                                                                     furrow,

 2/0       Management and Improvement,        hy   Tillage.,
   furrow, and each wheel of tbe cart will occupy another.       As
   the horses and the cart-wheels will make the foil in the bot
   tom of the furrows immediately under the ashes compact,
   pass the fcarificator through, as before directed, with only
   three long tines, or teeth, in the centre of the beam, then
   with one Dout of the common plough reverse the ridges and
   cover the ashes. Let the land continue in this state until the
   season suit for sowing.    Then with the sled, as before, level
   the tops of the ridges so as to obtain a surface on each ridge
  eighteen inches wide. Mr. Cooke's drill will sow two of
   these ridges at a time, two rows of turnips on each ridge,
  nine inches from row to row, with an interval of twenty-
  seven inches.     The turnips, as soon as the rough leaf ap
  pears, should be harrowed across the ridges with the fixed
  harrow, then scarified between the rows; and a few days
  after these operations they should be hand-hoed, leaving the
  plants in rows, single, and one foot apart. The intervals
  should be kept highly pulverized by alternate ploughings,
  horse-hoeings, and scarifying; being careful, before the au
  tumnal rains commence, to throw all the mould from the
  bottoms of the furrows up to the ridges with a double mould
  board plough.      This will not only keep the land dry and
  healthy all the winter ; but, as the horses will walk in one
  furrow, and each wheel of the cart will occupy another, the
  turnips may be carted to the bullock-sheds without poaching
 or injuring the land.
     Knowing the difficulty in these clayey soils of obtaining
 a fine tilth for spring sowing, I should recommend the same
 ridges, after the turnips are drawn, and carted home, to be
 worked with the fixed harrow and roller, only so as to obtain
 a sine tilth five inches deep; and then to drill two rows of
 oats, nine inches from row to row, leaving a furrow or in
 terval of twenty-seven inches. When the oats are about two
 inches above the surface, harrow across with the fixed har
row, scarify twice in a place between the rows of oats, and
roll the whole. After these operations, should weeds appear,
horse-hoe with the flat hoes.       When the oats are harvested,
throw you ¦ridges up high, like trenching in a garden, with
out reversing them, keeping the bottoms of the furrows clean
from mould, and laying the land perfectly dry.         In the first
frost cart about twenty loads per acre of good horse or bullock
dung, not too rotten, into the furrows; spread      it;
                                                      and as soon
as the frost
           is    out of the land, harrow or sled down the tops of
the ridges, reverse them, and cover the dung: the first drv
weather in February or March, sled down the tops of these
sidges, to obtain a    surface of eighteen inches, and drill two
                                                             rows

             .-  *s old Grass Lands        on a dlreft Clay.            Oyt
 rows of beans on each ridge, nine inches from row to row,
 and twenty-seven inches interval.              Scarify, horfe-hoe, and
plough     between     the intervals,     so as to keep a sine tilth, and
to destroy the weeds.         When the beans are sit for harvesting
pull them, and when carried off the land pulverize the tops
of the fame ridges by scarifying, rolling, and working with
the fixed harrow ; and, if any surface-weeds appear, skim the
land with the scufflers; and by repeating these operations
prepare the fame ridges for wheat, and drill two rows on each
ridge nine inches from row to row.                  In the spring harrow
across, &c. as directed for the oat crop.              Should the farmer
wish to substitute cabbages for turnips, one row should be
planted on each ridge, setting the plants two feet and a half
from each other in rows, with three-feet intervals. In this
succession of crops, viz. turnips or cabbages, oats or barley,
beans, pease and clover, and wheat, even this naturally ste
rile foil will be in a constant state of improvement : and if
the vegetable crops and straw be expended in the most ad
vantageous method upon the farm, the land may be dressed
 with fourteen loads per acre twice in four years, viz. for the
 turnip or cabbage crop, and for the bean, pea, and clover
crop.     I shall not, therefore, limit the number of years for
keeping it in tillage to any precise term, as it appears to me
 immaterial ; but proceed to point out the best method of se
curing a good meadow whenever the occupier may wish it *.
    We will suppose the land cropped eight years in the ro
 tation of crops before recommended, and at the expiration
 of that term, a wheat stubble.              The first operation I .stiould
recommend would be to drain the land so as to take off the
surface water, for nothing more can be effected by draining
these lands, as they will hold water like a bucket; and were
the drains cut ever so deep, and only six inches from each
other, the water would not draw from one to the other. The
method I shall propose is easy and efficacious, and the ex
pense very trifling.        I speak with confidence, as almost the
whole parish of Hitcham, in Suffolk, where twenty years
back it was thought impossible to grow barley, now produces
fine and heavy crops of that grain, by the surface water being
taken off expeditiously.        Open furrows in the wheat stubble
with the common plough, about five yards from each other,
and as deep as the laud was ever ploughed and scarified.
Then with a narrow gripping-spade, twenty inches long,

bottom, open a drain sixteen inches deep ; fill this with the
wheat haulm, ramming it down as hard as possible ; the
price two {hillings and sixpence per score rods, to dig and
fill up. It       is,
                  presume, unnecessary to observe that these
                      I
and all other drains should not be cut in         line with the na
                                                   a
tural fall of the land, but in an oblique direction.              No
bushes should be used, as, when these begin to decay, pieces
of them will fall across these very narrow drains, ami obstruct
the course of the water. The straw or haulm, when                 deit
cays, sloughs    off, and the water pasting through   the clay forms
an arch, which will last many years.          There are drains of
this fort still open in Hitcham parish, which hare been cut
more than twenty years.        Having thus freed the land from
the noxious moisture arising from stagnant water, with one
bout of the plough throw the land on to three-feet ridges,
and before January reverse these.        In the spring, when per
fectly dry, harrow down the ridges with the fixed harrow,
so as to make        complete fallow*; then dress with lime or
                      a
compost, and baulk the land, viz. give           half ploughing,

            it                             will harrow down quite
                                           it
level and fine without any furrows appearing.             In the be-
          of August sow thirty-two bushels per acre of the
f;inning
  weepings of hay-chambers, where only good old meadow
hay has been used without any broad clover and rye-grafs,
five pounds of Dutch clover, and five pounds of trefoil                   ;
harrow the seeds three or four times over, and you may ex
pect two tons or two tons and         half of hay per acre the first
                                      a
year  ; which will pay all the expenses, and kave the land im
proved from five shillings or seven (hillings and fix-pence per
acre, its original value, to fourteen (hillings or sixteen (hil

obtaining information from actual experiment, permit me to

acres of the laud will more particularly elucidate this subject.
Part of    it was broken up from old four grafs, not worth five
shillings per acre, and part of            was old tillage land, which
                                                  it

produce was estimated at two tons and                    half of hay per

viate the onlv objections to growing green winter crops on
wet lands, viz. cutting up the lands by carting off the crop,
and the impracticability            of afterwards preparing them for
spring sowing.        In carting, the horses walk in one furrowj
and the wheels track in two other furrows ; the tops of the
ridges are always dry ; and the fixed harrow pasting twice in
a place, will prepare such lands for sowing, before the farmers
in the common mode of management, without a crop of green
food, can put a hoof on their lands. Should surface weeds
appear before sowing, Mr. Cooke's scufflers, or broad sliares
fixed in the scarify ing-beam, stiould be passed through the
land.

persons
            are sensible that an editor of the biography of living
           (houjd  consider himself as in a very delicate situation,
and the more respectable the character who is his subject, the
greater should be his care; for utterly unmerited eulogy, from
 motives of interest or vanity, is so usual, that any praise at
 all, or at least exceeding what is already generally conferred
 and confessedly due, must be offensive to a man of intrinsic
 merit.     But these considerations need not restrain an editor
 from gratifying the curiosity of the public, who may not
 personally know a man of eminence, by a statement at least
 of the departments in which he has been occupied, and a
 recital of his published literary labours.
     Dr. Pearson graduated at Edinburgh at a very early pe
riod of life, and of course he must have previously studied
 a certain number of years in that university.                   An extract
 from his inaugural dissertation, De Putredine, may be found
                                                                             in

 In the Medical Commentaries for 1775.           Several communi
 cations on medical and philosophical subjects, subsequently to
 this period, are inserted in that annual work.
      In 1784 Dr. Pearson published a treatise on the Buxton
 waters, principally to make known his discovery that the
  jas which issues from them spontaneously is not, as was be-
 llieved, fixed air or carbonic acid, but phlogisticated     air or
 azotic gas. Dr. Saunders, in his late treatise on Mineral
 Waters, has given due credit to the author for this disco
 very, as well as for his able analysis in general.
      In the year 178S Dr. Pearson published in several jour
 nals his account of the salt composed of phosphoric acid
 and soda, recommending it as a purgative which possesses no
disagreeable taste, and is equally mild with any other of the
cathartic salts.      It is one of the articles in the Edinburgh
Pharmacopœia of 1791, under the title of Soda Phofphorata :
since that time it has been in general use.
      In the Philosophical Transactions for 1791 we find Dr.
Pearson's masterly and at that time unrivalled analysis of the
James's Powder.          Immense savings have been made by in-
dividuds since this discovery, especially in the navy, to the
amount, a« the late Dr. Johnson, one of the Commissioners
of the Sick and Hurt Office, asserted, of several thousand
pounds a year.
      In the Philosophical Transactions for 1792 is a paper enti*
tied, Experiments made with a View of decompounding Fixed
Air or Carbonic Acid, by Dr. Pearson. In 1789 M. Lavoi
sier showed that carbonic acid might be composed by uniting
carbon to oxygen : but the author in the present paper says,
"I      he honour of the first analytical experiments on carbonic
acid is clue to Mr. Tentiant, F. U. S." who obtained phos
phoric acid and carbon bv passing phosphorus through red-
hot carbonate of lime, or marble powder.          Whatever doubts
were entertained of this fact, as stated by Mr. Tennant, they
were entirely removed by the decisive experiments of Dr.
Pearson.
     In the Philosophical Transactions for 1794 is inserted Dr.
Pearson's paper on the wax-like matter called w'hite lack, in
which he discovered a new acid called by him laxic acid, ac
cording to the new nomenclature of chemists.
     In the fame work for 1795 is Dr. Pearson's paper on the
steel supposed to be made directly from the ore by the Hin
doos, called luootz.
     In the following year is our author's paper on ihe com-
  osition   of the hard and strong metals of the antients, which

    In 1797 the Philosophical Transactions contain Dr. Pear
son's communication of experiments on the gas produced by
palling the electric spark through water; which he determines
to be the mixture of oxygen and hydrogen gas, as demon
strated by first separating the oxygen by nitrous gas to pro
duce nitrous acid, and then inflaming the residue after adding
oxygen, and thus composing water.
    In the Philosophical Transactions for 1798 is published the
author's paper on urinary calculi of man and brute animals;
in which lie shows that the sublimed acid of Scheele and the
precipitate    examined   by the French chemists are not the
i';ime substance ; and that the latter does not possess acid pro
perties, but those of an oxide, for which he proposes the de
nomination uric oxide, a name since generally adopted.
    In 1794 Dr. Pearson published the new French Chemical
Nomenclature, with explanations suited to the Knglish reader,
and additions according to subsequent improvements in che
mical philosophy.       In a second edition ot this work the au
thor has made very considerable additions, by giving new
tables of affinities, and tables of double and single elective
attractions.
     Among the medical dissertations and papers of the author,
the prominent ones arc those on the Cow- pock.           '] he first of
these, in 1798, contains a great collection of facts of this dis
ease ; and it immediately succeeded the work of Dr. Jenner,
 the first professed pmmulgator of this disease.     This is neither
 the fit place nor time for a comparison os what has been ef
 fected by these two gentlemen ; and if it were so, it would
 not be advisable to interfere.     We honour and respect both
 of them as public benefactors.         We have already let forth
 Dr. Jenner's merits in our Journal, vol. xiii., and we have
 given an abridged account of Dr. Bearson's late work, in
  1802, in the fame volume. The work entitled The Report
 of the Cow-Pock Inoculation from the Practice at the Vac
 cine Institution in 1800, 1801, and 1802, as read at a ge
 neral meeting of the subscribers February 7th lad, which we
  had the pleasure to hear read, will give the best account of
  the merit of Dr. Pearson, in conjunction with the other phy
  sicians, in establishing that institution, and carrying on the
  investigation of the new disease, occupied as he is in extensive
  practice as a physician, as a teacher on the different branche«
  of physic, and as physician to a large London hospital.           But
  after all it must be reserved for posterity to assign the due place
                                                                     of

   Dr. Pearson was elected physician to St. George's hospital
in 1787; and how serviceable he has made it to his school
of medicine is best evinced bv his numerous pupils, and the
proficiency they make in their studies.

 insert the Preface.
     "   Ifthe subject of the following pages were regarded
merely    with reference to those immediate practical conse
quences     which   result from its consideration as connected
with     great branch of the revenue, and still more with the

universally admitted.

 wheat taken from the middle of the ear*.
    " These ideas were naturally suggested to the minds of the
authors by the necessity which they have heen under, in the
course of their trade, of deciding on which of the various dis
cordant authorities they should found their estimation of the
weight of given measures of different fluids, and of the rela
tion which these measures of capacity bear lo the linear mea
sures of the country; and there cannot, perhaps, be a stronger
proof of the propriety of a declaratory act to settle these mat
ters, than that there should still remain something to be
assumed with respect to every one of them.      This important
measure      however, as the writers of this essay believe, now
              is,
in the contemplation of the government.
   "    It   is   stated   in   §   16, that     thev have estimated the               wine-
 gallon at 231 cubic inches, the pound avoirdupoise at 7000
 grains troy, ami the relation between troy weight and linear

 stilled water at 6o°, when weighed in air at 6o°, (hall be equal
 to 252! of the same grains.
      " The assumption with regard to the wine-gallon founded                    is
 on the established practice of the Boards of Customs and Ex
 cise to consider     as of the content which
                           it                          here given      is               ;    it

former,    however,             is,
                           perhaps,   at the  present day,   the   legal
wine-gallon.
     '' The supposition with respect to the relation between
avoirdupoise and troy weight,         chiefly founded on
                                                is              kind of           a
tacit agreement amongst the majority of scientific men at
present to consider the avoirdupoise         pound as equal to 7000
grains troy     and
                  ;   that which       perhaps, of still more prac

always subject          to more uncertainty than the latter.           Mr.
Ward       tell us,   in his Mathematics, that he found, by a very
nice experiment, that the pound avoirdupoile weighed 6999^
grains troy , and yet we find, from the Report on the Weights
of Europe in general, in. the Memoirs of the French Academy
of Sciences for 1767, that the ratio between the avoirdupoile
and troy pounds, which M. Tillet had obtained for the pur
pose, was that of 7004-5 to 5^60.
    " The appreciation of the weight of a cubic inch of di
stilled water is principally founJrd on the experiments of
Sir George Shuckburgh Evelyn, BaiC, described in the Phi
losophical Transactions for 1798 ; from a mean of which it
follows *, that the cubic inch of distilled water at 60", under
the circumstances described in § 16, weighs 252-506 grains
of the standard trov pound made for the Committee of the
House of Commons in 1758, or 2528.6 if weighed in va-.
cuo.
    " A varietv of motives concur to induce the authors to
take these as standard experiments.             All the older attempts
of this kind are of no value whatever, having been made with
water which was not distilled, and under other circumstances
which render them liable to innumerable errors : even the
celebrated experiment of Mr. Everard in 1696 was made with
undistilled New River water. The only ones, perhaps, which
are at all to be compared with those of Sir G. S. Evelyn are
those of Dr. Robison, and the French Commissioners of
Weights and Measures.
     " The former gentleman weighed a cylinder whose height '
and diameter were each 6 inches, taken, as he fays, from a
most accurate copy of the Exchequer standard, sevaral times
 in distilled water at 55°, and found that it lost 42895 grains
of its weight without a variation of 2 grains in the whole.
 Now, the solid content of the above body being 63 X .785398,
or 169-646 cubic inches, a cubic inch of water weighs in
air, according to this experiment, 252-85 grains at ^^ ; or,
by Mr. Gilpin's Tables, exactly 252; at 6o°.
     " The authors of this essay are, however, induced to pre
fer the experiments of Sir G. S. Evelyn to that of Dr. Robi
 son, principally for the following reason :— Me does not tell
 us whether his weights had been immediately and accurately
 compared with any of the parliamentary standards.                The ad
justment of the best weights is generally thus performed : — .
 They are, in the first place, filed to something near the re-«

  lished. Now, it very frequently happens, that some of these
  operations are carried a little too far, and one or two of the
  weights rendered somewhat too light ; and when this is the
  cafe, unless the workman can be absolutely depended on, the
  whole set will infallibly be spoiled ; for, instead of making
  new ones to supply their place, he will, nine times in ten,
  prefer the adjusting the others to them ; conceiving it to be
  of more  consequence that they should all agree, than that they
  should be accurately of any particular weight. When weights
 are successively copied from each other a number of times,
  the last of the series will therefore frequently be lighter than
 the first, and sometimes very considerably so.
      "For the appreciation of the weight in trov grains of a cubic
 inch of distilled water at 6o°, from the experiments of the
 French commissioner! of weights and measures, we have the
 following data.
     "  We are told by the InJlrucHon fur les Poids         &  Mejures,
 prefixed to M. Brisson*s Traits de Pbyjique, and which is cer
 tified by the commissioners to be       "   exactly founded on the
 results obtained and' recorded by the said commission," and
 in several oiher works, that they weighed distilled water in
 nine different cafes at various temperatures,            in air and in
 vacuo. We will, however, select the case which they have
 thought proper to assume as the basis of their standard of
 weight, viz. that in which the weight of water is taken at its
maximum of density (or about the temperature of 400 of Fahr.)
and in vacuo; under which circumstances thev inform us
that the cubic decimetre weighs 2 pounds 5 gros and 35*15
grains, or i8827-i5 grains ot the poids de marc.
     " This, according to M. Tillet's appreciation of the Eng
lish trov pound, which he makes equal to 7021 of these grains,
is equal to 15445-7 grains troy.
     " Now, we find from the report made to the Mathematical
and Physical Class of the National Institute on the 27th of
December 1801 *, relative to a comparison of the metre with
a scale of M. Pictet's, which was exactly similar to that of
Sir George Shucklnugh Evelyn, that this measure is equal to
39/38272 inches of that scale when at 32°; or, correcting for
temperature according to General Roy's table of the expan
sion of his brass scale, in the 75th volume of the Philosophical
Transactions, equal to 39*371 2 inches of the fame scale when
at 6o°; the French platiua and iron standards, when at the
freezing point, indicating the length of the metre.

                       252-851. The weisrht of a cubic inch of
water, therefore, according to this method of calculation,
would, if weighed in vacuo at 6o°, be         252-85 grains ; and
if weighed in air at the fame temperature, under the pressure
of 29 finches, = 252-55 ; being within T~oeth part of the
weight deduced from Sir G. S. Evelyn's experiments.
   " It was thought indispensable thus to state the hypotheses

relative strengths and values of liquors of various descriptions,
and particularly those which constitute the subject of these
sheets.   The variation of density in alcoholic compounds is
a circumstance which is not only of importance to the mer
chant, the spirit dealer, and the revenue officer; to the phi
losopher, who is engaged in the investigation of the nature
and progression of those forces by which the constituent par
ticles of matter are connected with each other, it must also
afford matter of interesting contemplation.       It         is,

tending to prove that Galvanism is of very little       use in deaf

    M. Mojon gave an account of some experiments which
item to prove that Galvanism is proper for retarding the pu
tridity ot animal matters.
   M. Nauche the president, and Pajot-Laforfit, communi
cated a new Galvanic phænomenon.               Having subjected to
the action of the pile frogs exposed to a temperature of ten
degrees below zero, they observed, that repeated contact of
the conductor communicating with the copper pole produces
the development of a whitish mucous fluid, exceedingly abun
dant in the liver, lungs, and particularly the nerves and the
heart; not very abundant in the muscles, the intestines, and
none in the integuments ; while the conductor in communi
cation with the zinc pole produces no development of this
fluid, and seems rather to cause that which has been pro
duced to disappear.
    C. Gautherot has made a series      of experiments tending to,
prove   that electricity is developed  in  the ratio of the surfaces.
    C.  Nauche    the president, with  his fellow-labourers Bonnet
and Pajot-Laforet, has been able, by means of two bomoge-*
neous metallic conductors, to draw off the electric fluid from
the brain and spinal marrow of an ox recently killed, and to
 convey it to the thighs of a frog, where it produced muscular
 contractions.     This operation succeeded also in the palpi
 tating  muscles,    and could be continued only a quarter of an
 hour after death. The senator Lamartillierc gave an explana
tion of the disengagement of mucous matter by the poles,
 and showed that it arises from a chemical decomposition.
    C. Izam gave an account of the construction of a pile in
 vented by C. Alizeau, in which, instead of disks moistened
 with a saline solution, a stratum of moistened salt is employed,
 and which can produce its effects for a month without being
 cleaned.
    The Commission of Medical Application, consisting of
 Guillotin, Dudaujon, Petit- Radel, &c. have made a great

                            ANTIOUITIES.
VTENERAL REYNIER                   having presented to the French
National Institute      a tunic and the remains of some antient
vestments found near Sakara, in Egypt, the three classes ap
pointed commissioners          to give in a report on these curious
articles. A very exact idea may be given of this tunic by
comparing it to the tunics worn by the deacons and sobdea-
cons of the Roman catholic church, if we suppose the latter
to have long close sleeves, as was formerly the cafe.           It is
ornamented with embroidered pieces, some of which descend
from the shoulders ; others are applied to the slioulders, and
at the bottom before and behind : two pieces of the fame
kind surround the extremity of the sleeves. The colour of
the stuff is a souci yellow, and the embroidery is puce co
lour, or dark brown. The design is of little importance, and
has no relation either to natural objects, to hieroglyphics, or
to written characters.         The stuff has been wove in the loom,
but the embroidery seems to have been executed according
to the process of tapestry au petit point.          In regard to the
nature of them, chemists have found that the yellow stuff of
the tunic is animal matter. In regard to the embroidery,
the yellow tissue or ground is vegetable matter, and the
brown thread, animal matter.
    General Reynier was not able to procure any further in •
 formation from the inhabitants of Sakara, who sold him this
 tunic, except that they had found it with other articles in a
pit filled with sand which they had dug up.
    No particular account can be given of the time when this
tissue was wove, nor of the personage to whom it belonged.
In the report made on it to the Institute, the author sliows
that it belonged neither to a Macedonian nor a Greek esta
blished in Kgypt, as it has sleeves which descend to the wrist,
whereas the Grecian tunic had no sleeves, or sleeves so short
that they reached only to the elbow ; but it appears certain
that the Macedonian tunic was not different from the Gre
cian. The Macedonians were distinguished from the other
 Greeks only by their head-dress (rau/ia) and their chlamys.
 The tunic of Sakara belonged then to an Egyptian.           But the
 point   is to determine    at  what  period.  The author of the re
 port only fays, that it cannot be older than the time when
 Thebes was abandoned. The grottoes of Sakara, which are
                                                                   at

 284                         Antiquities.
 at the distance of a few miles from Thebes, near the ruins
 of Thebes,    were no doubt dug. about that time.  It was in
 the sixth century before the Christian æra that Cambyfes ra
 vaged Thebes, and plundered it of its riches and monuments.
 The most remote period, therefore, which can be assigned to
 the time when the tunics were wove is the fifth or fourth
 century before Augustus.
    It is impossible to fay any thing more correct in regard to
 the personage who wore it.      We are told by Herodotus that
 the Egyptian priests wore a single vestment of linen, and shoes
 of papyrus. The priests of Ifis at Rome were called the troop
   clothed in linen, linigera turba.     Pythagoras, who imitated
   them, made no use of woven stuffs made from animal mat
   ters. The tunic of Sakara was therefore not worn by an
  Egyptian of the sacerdotal order.
      It did not form part of a female dress, for we are told also
   by the father of history that the Egyptian women were clothed
   in linen. The men used also similar vestments; but they
   wore above these tunics white woollen vestments.        " But,"
  Herodotus adds,      " they do not wear woollen vestments in
  the temples, and they do not bury their dead in dresses of that
  kind : they would be considered as indecent."
      The yellow colour of the tunic, if not the effect of anti
  quity, would be no proof of its not having belonged to an
  Egyptian ; but if it be the effect of art, we may suppose that
  it was the distinguistiing mark of some dignity.      In a word,
  the only thing certain which can be said of this Egyptian
  vestment  is,  that
                   it    was not conveyed with the body        of
                                                                de
                                                                a
  ceased person to the grottoes of Sakara, which served as
  tombs, because  it     was repugnant to the jdeas of the Egyp
  tians to be interred  in wove wooHen cloth.   It   must therefore
  have been deposited with other riches which the proprietors
  wished to secure from the rapacity os the enemy.
      C. Mongcz has communicated to the Institute memoir   a
 on some antient medals and other articles discovered near Au-
       in
 rillac,     the department of Cantal.     Some workmen digging
 in meadow found lie portion of circular inclosure consist
   a                   t              a
 ing of a    double wall.    It  was about fix feet  in  diameter,
 and four feet eight inches in height       ;  but rose very little
 above the surface of (he meadow.         The interior wall was of
 baked brick, exceedingly beautiful, circular, and with the
joinings tending to the centre. This interior wall was sur
 rounded    by another of dry stones, destined, no doubt, to sup
port the earth.       No traces ofa   covering appeared, and        it   is
 probable there never was any.
     In digging in this inclosure, and demolishing   it,there were
                                                                    first

                             Antiquities.                      385
first found medals of gilt bronze of all the Roman emperors
down to Commodus, Otho excepted ; which proves that in
the second century bronze medals of that prince were exceed
ingly rare, and that they had not then, perhaps, been carried
into Gaul. Along with the small vessels of baked earth which
contained these medals, there were dug up some smaller ones
which contained aromatic substances. The workmen took them
for tobacco ; but finding by the taile that they were deceived,
 they threw them away, and carefully washed the vessels which
 contained them ; so that neither the nature of these aroma-
 tics, nor even the odour which the vessels would have.. re
 tained, could be known.          Two small bits of very white
 moulded clay were also dug up : one represented a dog, the
 legs of which were broken ; the other was a female bust, but
 the remainder of the body was destroyed by the digging.         A
 clasp of bronze, and a glass ring of so large a size that it could
 be worn only on the thumb if it served lor a ring, were also
 dug up.
      The circular form of the inclosure discovered near Aurillac
  induces C. Mongez to conjecture that it might have been
  used for burning dead bodies, and that it was an ujlrinum,
  such as the circular inclosure cf earth in which the body of
  Augustus was burnt, and which was religiously preserved near
  his mausoleum, still in part existing;; and such as the inclo
  sure of the same form discovered m 1763 near Placentia, in
  the ruins of the antient Veleia, which appears to have been
   buried by the fall of a mountain, and which Winckelmann
   found to be an ujlrinum.     Some of the inscriptions on antient
   sepulchral stones of the Romans announce an express prohi
   bition to construct an ujlrinum near a monument. The reason
   of this prohibition has not yet been examined. After men
   tioning the law of the twelve tables, which forbade the burn
   ing of bodies nearer any edifice than the distance of sixty feet,
   without the owner's consent, C. Mongez is of opinion that
   this prohibition supposed some edifice to be in the neighbour
   hood, the proprietor of which insisted on the rigorous execu-
   tionof the law.
       In regard to the small female bust found near Aurillac,
    C. Mongez observes, that Montfaucon has given engravings
   of four female figures of the like kind. They were all of that
    kind of argillaceous earth called tobacco-pipe clay; the work-
    manstiip was coarse, and they had all been moulded : one of
    them was found in 17 10, in digging in the abbey of Saint-
    Lomer, at Blois. It was deposited in a small grotto contain
    ing the half-burnt bones of animals, among which were found
    the thigh-bone of a horse and the tooth ot a dog. The Gauls
                                                                were

 l86                             Antiquhhst
 were accustomed to throw into the funeral piles of their &eaAf
those animals they had been fondest of, such as dogs and
horses. There is reason, therefore, to conclude that the grotto
of Blois was a burying-place of the Gauls, and, by analogy,
that the inclosure of Aurillac belonged to the same nation.
The female bust found there exhibits the fame characters as
the figures published by Montfaucon ; and besides, there was
found along with it a figure of a dog of the fame substance
and workmanstiip.
    These female figures have been so often dug up in the se
pulchres of the Gauls, and the style, the workmanship, and
materials have so great a resemblance, that one cannot help
supposing that they must have been deposited there from the
same motives.         C. Mongez is of opinion that they may have
represented the principal mother goddesses in general, and
those in particular whom the deceased whose ashes re
posed in these tombs had adopted as their protectors. A
great deal has been written on the mother goddesses men
tioned in the sepulchral inscriptions of the Romans : Diis
matribus              matronis,    &c. As bas-reliefs representing
three females,        sometimes standing and sometimes               fitting,
holding fruits, cones of the fir-tree, and cornucopias, Were
sometimes        added to such inscriptions 3 the mother god
desses were at first taken for rural deities : but one of these
monuments was found in the city of Lyons, and on others
they are called the mothers of Galicia, the mothers of the
 Gabii, 8cc. Their protection therefore was extended to
cities and provinces also.             Keyster thinks that they were
those    druid   females   for whom      the Gauls entertained so great
a  veneration     ; but  this opinion is contradicted by monuments
of   the  fame   kind,    consecrated     in countries at a very great
distance     from   Gaul.     Others    considered   the mother goddesses
 as  the  three   Parcæ   or  Fates  ;  but   it is   not certain that the
Parcæ      ever  formed    a part  of   all the  nations    among whom
the   deities  in  question  were   worshipped    : besides, the latter had
their proper denomination, Fata. In the last place, Barries
proposed a still more probable opinion respecting the mother
goddesses : he supposed them to be deities common to several
nations, and that their surnames denoted the places where
they were worshipped.
    To this may be added, that the women acknowledged them
as their special protectors ; for we read on two inscriptions s
Matronis Gabiabas,                 Junonibus Gabiabus.         Every wo
man believed that she had a female genius who protected
her, and whom she called her Juno.                      The Greeks, the
Cretans in particular, and the Scilians, rendered worship to
           6                                                              the

the celestial bears under the name of Mothers.           But it ap
pears doubtful whether the mother goddesses of the Gaul's of
Britain, Germany, Spain, &c. were the fame deities.            It is
at least certain that in consequence of migrations, the notions
respecting these goddesses, their functions and attributes, had
at that time been strangely altered.        The figures given by
 Montfaucon hold children in their arms, Tike the female
figures seen on medals of some of the empresses, with the
legend Juno Lucina;        which confirms the opinion of C.
Mongez, that these figures represent the mother goddesses in
general, and in particular the Junos and Genii of women.
               PALLADIUM, OR NEW SILVER.
    We have just been favoured with a specimen of a metal,
said to be a new one, to which the above name has been
          and which, among others, is said to possess the sol-
  owing properties : — 1. It dissolves in pure spirit of nitre, and
i;iven,
makes a dajk red solution.       2. Green vitriol throws it down
in a state of a regulus from this solution, as it always does
gold from aqua regia. 3.        If you evaporate the solution you
get a red calx, that dissolves in spirit of salt or other acids.
 4. It is thrown down by quicksilver, and by all the metals
 but gold, platina, and silver.    5. Its specific gravity by ham
 mering was only 11*3 ; but by flatting, as much as n*8.
 6. In a common sire it tarnishes a little, and turns blue;
 but comes bright again, like other noble metals, when
 stronger heated.    7. The greatest heat of a blacksmith's fire
 would hardly melt it. 8. But if you touch it while hot with
 a small bit of sulphur, it runs as easily as zinc. — It is sold
 only by Mr. Forster, at No. 26, Gerrard-street, Soho, Lon
 don, in samples of five shillings, half a guinea, and one guinea
 each. — We have not had time to subject the specimen sent
 to us to any chemical tests. When we do, we stiall report the
result to our readers.    Where or how it has been procured
 we have not yet learnt.

    Mr. Paul, of Geneva, now in London, has made some im
 portant improvements in the construction of lamps and re
 flectors, by which, among other advantages, that light which
 is usually thrown up into the atmosphere and lost, is reflected
 to the space intended to be illuminated ; by which a much
 greater effect is produced, and at the fame time a saving in
 the consumption of the oil.      We understand they are soon to
 be employed by Mr. Smethurst in lighting the streets.

    Professor  Aldini, when         on his way to France, made the
following experiment at Calais : — He extended a wire from
the top of the West Jetty to Fort Rouge, dill ant about 160
feet, and which are separated by an arm of the sta.                        The
 extremity of this wire towards the jetty was immersed in the
water, the other extremity was fixed to a mast, and a portion
of the wire was free. A second wire was disposed in such a

at the bottom of the mast, while its upper extremity could be
made to communicate with the wire fixed to the mast.                       Be
tween the extremity of the wire attached to the mast and that
of the second wire immersed in the sea the professor placed
an animal, as a prepared frog for example, which being then
brought into contact with the two wires, immediately expe
rienced the usual contractions.               The sea water, therefore,
served as a conductor between the other extremities of the
wires.

                of Bremen in
                               in a   lecture which

                                               1795, on the shower of
stones, as it is called, which fell at Siena in Italy,                I   ex
pressed the fame idea which I lately read with much satis
faction in a letter of Laplace, in which he fays :              "  It is not
impossible that large masses,           detached  from   some   of  the ce
lestial bodies, ana particularly from the moon, may have
sometimes         been projected to the earth."          As you require a
more circumstantial illustration of fivfo subject, I embrace
the present opportunity of gratifying your willies.
     I must readily acknowledge, that when I wrote the before-
mentioned essay on the (hower of stones which fell at Siena,
 I considered these stones to be of a volcanic origin. The
stones found at Siena fell at the distance of sixty miles from
Vesuvius, only eighteen hours after the commencement of
 the great eruption which destroyed the unfortunate Torre
 del Greco, and of which so elegant a description has been
 given by sir William Hamilton.               I was acquainted with the
 principles of Zolner and Lichtenberg, according to which
 these stones could not be ascribed to Vesuvius ; but to me
 these principles did not appear satisfactory.               The great ve
 locity which would be necessary to make a mass projected
 from Vesuvius to proceed to so great a distance, was not suf
 ficient to induce me to abandon my opinion. By calculation.
  I found that it was not so qreat as what might be supposed
  to be produced          hy the dreadful convulsion which takes
  place on such occasions.            What tended chiefly to confirm
  me in my idea was, that sir William Hamilton then be
  lieved that he had often sound at Vesuvius stones which had
  a great resemblance to those which fell at Sienas-                    I also
  supposed that Vesuvius might            have  projected   from  one   of its
  mouths a half-filed mass at an angle of from forty to fifty
  degrees, which, like every thing else proceeding from the
  crater, was in a high degree electric; that this mass had

 IcjO       On Stones which have fallen from          the Heavens.
 taken its direction towards Siena; that when within a cer
 tain distance of the earth it had discharged itself; and that
 in consequence of this discharge it had burst, so that the
 fragments fell down in the state of ignited stones*.
     On the other hand, however, it is known that no such
 stones are found on Mount Vesuvius.                  It has been lately
  (hown by the mineralogical description of Count de Bour-
 non, and the chemical analysis of Mr. Howard, that the
 stones found at Siena have a perfect resemblance to all the
 other stones which have been seen to fall from the heavens,
 and which certainly cannot be productions of our earth f.
 My former explanation and conjectures fall therefore to the
 ground, and we must class the (tones of Siena among those
 which are formed by nature in some mode with which we
 are unacquainted, and which bursting always with the ap
 pearance of light fall down to the earth.
     Since the time when naturalists first ventured, or were
 obliged, to believe in the falling of such stones, it has been
 found that this phænomenon is not so uncommon as was
 supposed.       During the last century, fourteen or fifteen in
 stances at least can be quoted.
     When I erroneously ascribed in my lectures the stones
 found at Siena to an eruption of Vesuvius, the nature of
 other stones fallen from the heavens, which certainly were
 not of volcanic origin, had given occasion to the question,
 whether it was impossible that heavy masses could be pro
jected to the earth from other heavenly bodies, and particu
 larly from the moon ? The celebrated stone which fell near
Argos Potamos, in the year 462 before Christ J, induced me
 in particular to undertake an examination of this question;
 and on this occasion my learned friend, Mr. Bredenkamp,
 clergyman of Bremen, was so kind as to collect for me all
 the passages in antient authors which make mention of this
 (lone.      In regard to the rest, the reader may consult what
 Siruyk; Pingre § and Chladni || have said on the subject.
     It appears from calculation, that when a greater vertical
 velocity than 3443,5 7 Paris feet in a second can be given to
 ahea\\ bodv projected from the earth's surface, supposing
the atmosphere to oppose no resistance, this body would not

 fall back to the earth, but would continue to move from it
  in infinitum.   A cannon bullet sometimes acquires a Velocity
  of 1800 or acoo feet in a second*; and heavy masses are
 projected from the volcanoes of our earth with a velocity
 four or five times as great.      This velocity, therefore, is far
 greater than that of 35,000 feet per second.          But even if it
 were possible, by the help of chemistry and mechanics, to
 give a ball a velocity of 35,000 feet, or even more, per se
 cond, the strong resistance opposed by the air, which always
 increases at the least as the square of the velocity, would tend
 very much to destroy it.         We may therefore consider it as
 almost impossible that heavy bodies can ever be entirely pro
jected from the earth.         I consider it altogether unnecessary
 to take into account in this calculation the influence which
 the attractive force of the moon would have on the motion
 of a bodv projected in this manner.                               ,
     But the cafe is entirely different if we subject to calcula
 tion the motion os a heavy body projected from the surface
 of the moon. The moon is a great deal smaller than the
 earth, possesses a much weaker power of attraction, and at
 the fame time its atmosphere is of so small extent, and so
  rare, that it could oppose very little resistance to a heavy
 body in a state of motion.        It is therefore possible that a
 heavy body might be projected from the moon with such a
 velocity as to carryit to a distance where it would be attracted
 with greater force by the earth.
     it is found by calculation that 7780 feet per second is the
 minimum of velocity with which a body projected from the
 moon would require to fall upon the earth. It appears, there
 fore, that if heavy bodies were projected from the moon with
 a vertical velocity of 7800 or 8000 feet under certain circum
  stances, some of these bodies would reach the earth and fall
 down upon it. Such a velocity appears to me to be very
  possible.   The surface of the moon, by the new craters which
 arise, shows evident traces of violent eruptions, by which
 even as great or greater velocity might be communicated to
 the bodies thrown up hv them.
     It appears then, that it is not altogether impossible that the
 stones or masses which have been seen to fall from the hea
 vens, and which, though entirely different from all the mi
 neral bodies of our earth, have a great resemblance to each
 other, mav have fallen from the moon.            It is in their great
 similarity and correspondence that the grounds of this opinion
 are to be found j for the similarity of their external appear

tql        On Stones which have fallen from the Heavens.
 ancej and of their component parts, evidently show that they
 have all had the same origin.           If we admit, with Halley and
 Chladni, that, besides the large celestial bodies, there are in
 boundless space an infinite number of small masses which
 move about till they approach so near a planet as to enter its
 atmosphere,       when they take sire, burst, and fall down upon
 it; we can explain whv all these masses dispersed throughout
 infinite space consist of' iron, nickel, siliceous earth, and talc
 earth, which, according to the ingenious experiments of Mr. •
 Howard, are the component parts of all the masses whick
 have fallen from the heavens.
      But, on the other hand, great difficulties occur, if these
 stones which have fallen from the heavens be seriously consi
 dered as bodies projected from the moon.              In consequence
 of the motion of the moon, bodies projected from it acquire,
 besides their projectile velocity, that velocity which the moon
 has in the direction of the tangents to her orbit.               If we
 therefore take this velocity into the account, it will appear,
 that heavy bodies projected from the moon with a velocity of
 8000 feet or more per second, as soon as they have got to
 such a distance from the moon as to experience less attrac
 tion from it than from the earth, would describe around the
 earth a conic section pasting more or less through the moon.
 These conic sections, according to the difference of the di
 rection and velocity, may be either hyperbolas or ellipses*.
 In order that the body should fall to the earth, the ellipse it
 describes ought to be of such a nature that its perigeum falls
 within the body of the earth, or at least within its atmosphere.
 The moon, therefore, must perceptibly decrease in size, as it
 would be necessary that it should throw out a great number
 of masses to make some of them reach the earth. For this
 purpose also a very limited direction and velocity of the heavy
 bodies would be required. And would not an infinite num
 ber of such small fragments move around our earth as satel
 lites ? Would they not be visible through our best telescopes,
 as we know that fire-balls sometimes are of very great size,
 and as the observation of Ceres and Pallas has stiown that
 bodies of a very small diameter become visible to us when
 illuminated by the light of the fun ; or are the sliooting stars,
 which seem to have a cosmical origin, such small satellites
 of our earth ? Perhaps we ought to class among these also
 the small pale luminous spot which Schroeter saw pass over
 the field of his telescope. These objections, and others which

 ing, seem to me to be of great importance, and difficult to be
 removed.
    I am therefore far from asserting that ihese stones which
 have fallen to the earth are to be considered as masses pro
jected from the moon ; nor does Laplace make any such as
 sertion.   His object, as well as mine, is to show philosophers
 engaged in researches on this subject the possibility of these
 masses having a
                    selenitic origin.  It is much to be wished
 that the ingenious Chladni would favour us with a new edi
 tion of his celebrated essay on the mass of iron found in Si
 beria *, as he no doubt would be able, from Benzenberg and
Brandes' Observations on falling Stars, Howard's Chemical
Examination, and from various other documents, to make
considerable additions to it.
  LIII.   Qn the Nervous Power, and its Mode            qfaSingf.
I_T   has been generally supposed by physiologists that the
power by which sensations were transmitted to the sensorium,
was likewise the medium by which mental impressions were
communicated to the body. But this opinion is totally in
consistent with that most frequent observation, that very often
every possible susceptibility of sensation is lost in a whole
limb, which nevertheless retains voluntary motion. Thi»
appears most strikingly in the St. Viius's dance, which de
prives the afflicted parts of every susceptibility of sensation
without destroying voluntary motion. And, on the contrary,
there are cases where the functions of the fenses remain un
impaired, and are sometimes increased, while the muscular
motion is completely lost.     In order to explain this phæno-
menon two kinds ot nerves have been hypothetically adopted,
nerves of sensation and nerves of motion ; but without ren
dering the explanation more satisfactory.    Certain it     thatis,
the action of mental irritation upon the body, and the com
munication of the sensations with the sensorium, are effects
of two different powers, which cannot possibly have their
seats in one and the fame organ.

of  the nerves, and the cellular texture ; the latter being com
posed   of cylindric tubes, containing the former in their ca
vity : and in these lubes, these sheaths of the nerves, is the
feat of the power which continues the irritation of the mind
into the body. The medullary substance of the nerves, on
the other hand, possesses no other power than that of exciting
in the sensorium sensations corresponding with the impres
sions received by the fenses.          The cellular texture of the
nerves    possesses a power of contraction, elasticity; but the
medullary     substance of the nerves possesses only the simple
sensitive power of the nerves.         From this, the above-men
tioned phænomena, especially         those observable in St. Vitus's
dance, are easily explained. The sensitive power of the nerves
disappears, because its organ, the medullary substance, is de
stroyed or wounded.        The two following arguments confirm
the correctness of this opinion : — l . According to Aaneman's
numerous experiments on the regeneration of the nerves,
each end of a nerve which has been cut in two forms itself
into a icirrhus, and both afterwards join again in the cel
lular texture ; but the lower end of the nerve thus intersected
always loses its sensitive power, whereas it recovers in a few
months the power of motion when both the ends are joined
again bv a sufficient quantity of the cellular substance,
a. Arsenic and all sorts of mercurial preparations, when
immediately applied to the brain, exhibit not the least im
mediate effect upon it. But those very minerals, when ap
plied in any other part, excite the most violent convulsions
of the whole body ; and it is well known, from other circum
stances, that these produce the greatest irritation upon the
cellular texture.     Without entering into any further elucida
tion, every one will easily conceive the great importance of
these ideas in the explanation of many physiological and pa
thological phænomena.

The rattlesnake," Mr. Blumenbach continues, " is also one
of the laziest of all the serpent tribe; under these circum
stances it seems very natural that such a lazy animal should
be endowed with the fascinating1 power of bringing down
from trees small animals, which otherwise would have no
thing to fear from a snake that cannot creep upwards."
    h is true, as I have asserted, that the rattlesnake is one of
the most sluggish species of serpents; and further inquiries
have confirmed me in my former opinion, that this serpent
does not climb up trees.       But if Mr. Blumenbach had re
collected what I have so particularly said on the subject of
the nidisication of our birds *, he would not,    presume,          I
have imagined that it is at all necessary that the serpent
should be endowed with            "
                           a fascinating power of bringing
down from trees small animals."     I have shown that the
rattlesnake feeds upon bull-frogs,  which are never found
upon trees; upon the ground-squirrel, which is most com
monly found upon the ground ; and upon the sringilla ery-
throphthalma, or ground-robin, a species of finch, which
receives its common English name from its being so gene
rally seen upon the ground \.       I may now add, that this
reptile feeds upon young rabbits (lepus americanus), wild
mice of different kinds, moles (sorex aquaticus), and many
other small animals, which it cannot have much trouble in
obtaining without its possessing the power of charming.
    But although the rattlesnake          is,   in

species of serpent which inhabits Guiana*.
     I was ignorant of these facts when I printed my memoir ;
and now that they are known to me, they do not appear to
be of much consequence.              They certainly do not prove that
serpents are endowed with the power of fascinating.                      It is

     Since the publication of my memoir I have been able to
 make a more complete collection of the sentiments of the
 North American Indians on the subject.                    I am led to be
 lieve, that it is far from being the general opinion among
 these people that the rattlesnake is endowed with the faculty
 of charming. I cannot in any other way so strikingly show
 the notions of the Indians on the subject, as by extracting
 part of a very curious manuscript which I received from my
 friend Mr. John Heckewelder : — " Having questioned In
 dians a number of times with respect to snakes having the
 power of charming, and always being answered in the nega
  tive, I was at length desired," fays Mr. Heckewelder, " to
  give the reason the white people had for believing such a
  thing ; which not being satisfactory, Pemaholend \ declared :
  * The rattlesnake obtains its food merely by slyness, and a
  persevering patience.        It knoweth as well where to watch
  For its prey as a cat does, and succeeds as well.              It has, and
  retains, its hunting grounds.            In spring, when the warm
  weather sets in, ana the .woods seem alive with the smaller
  animals, it leaves its den. It will cross a river and go a mile
  and further from its den to the place it intends to spend the
  summer; and in fall, when all the young animals bred this
  season are become strong and active, so that they are no more
   so easily overtaken or caught, it directs its course back again,
   to its den, the fame as a hunter does to his camp.
       " ' The white people,' continued Pemaholend, 'probably
   have taken the idea of this snake having the power of charm-
   jng from a tradition of ours (the Indians), which our fore
   fathers have handed down to us, from many hundred years

a rattlesnake too ; but then there was only ibis one snake
which had this power, and he was afterwards destroyed j and
since that time it hath never been said that any other of the
kind had made its appearance.'
                                        "
     The whole of this tradition, as related by Pemaholend, is
in my possession. It is a very curious piece of American
 mythology, and will be published at large in another place,
 perhaps in my Fragments of the Natural History of Penn
 sylvania. It is a new proof of my assertion,
                                                        " that the my
 thology j or superstitious religion,     of   the Americans is a frag
 ment of that mythology whose range in Asia and in Africa
 has been so extensive *."          But this tradition is interesting in
 the discussion       of  the  question in which I am now engaged.
 It plainly      shows   that   the Indians do not in general suppose
 that     the rattlesnake   is gifted with the faculty of charming;
  and it renders it still more doubtful that the whites derived
  this notion from the Indians.
       The Indians are so far from believing in the existence of
  this faculty in snakes, that the worthy gentleman from whom
  I    received the tradition which I have just mentioned, assures
  me that he would be unwilling in future to trouble them with
   any further inquiries on the subject, as the sure reward of
   the pains of inquiring is a laugh at the easy credulity of the
   Whites. I may here add, what I have mentioned in my
   memoir, that Mr. William Bartram never understood that
   the nations of Indians among whom he travelled had any
   idea of the fascinating power of snakes f .             Among other
    Indians Mr. Bartram visited, with the zeal and knowledge
    of a naturalist, the nations of East and West Florida. As
    this ingenious and amiable gentleman believes that serpents
    can charm other animals, there will be no suspicion, among
    candid people, that he has concealed the opinions of the In
     dians on the subject.
         I think I have now considered every essential part of Mr.
     Blumenbach's remarks on my memoir.               I have little doubt
     that this illustrious professor, who is not less candid than he
     is learned and ingenious, will give to the new facts which I
     have adduced all the consideration which they merit. What
     is the proportion of that consideration I must leave it with
      you and other able judges to decide.           In the meanwhile I
      am not a little flattered that one of my earliest essays in na
      tural history has solicited so much of the attention of the phi
      losophers of Europe.

  898           On the fascinating Faculty ascribed       to
     You inform me, that my explanation of the supposed fas
  cinating faculty of serpents is adopted by many or your na
 turalists. This is pleasing to me. Indeed, such is our selfish
 ness, that I fear I should have felt somewhat gratified to learn
 that the theory had been adopted, though I myself had re
 linquished it. But I assure you that, as yet, I have seen no
  cause to relinquish it.         On the contrary, I possess a great
 body   of additional    facts  in support of it.   These facts will be
 carefully  adduced     in  that  part of my  Fragments which is in
 tended to comprise the history of the amphibia of Pennsyl
 vania.
     In my native country the explanation which I have of
 fered has been adopted by many persons.                 But there are
 others who still believe in the existence of a true fascinating
 faculty in the rattlesnake and other serpents.          What change
 time and further attention to the subject may accomplish in
 them, I know not. But why should we expect to make all
 philosophers converts to our opinions ? Almost every phæ-
 nomenon, almost every fact in nature, seems to admit of an
 explanation upon more than one principle.               The stream of
 inquiry is often diverted by trifling circumstances into very
 opposite directions.         Prejudices, or, to name them by a
milder phrase, the earlier biasses of our minds, frequently
detain us, in the investigations of science, in a long and
pleasing reign of tyranny.          Our first love is said to be the
strongest.     Our   first  principles   in science, in religion, and
in politics, are often adhered to with the extreme of pertina
city.    He who, turned of fifty years of age, relinquishes a
favourite error, has infinitely more merit than the world may
be willing to allow him.

                              postscript.
    I began this long letter on the very day that I first saw
Mr. Blumenbach's remarks in Tilloch's Magazine.                  I had
not finished it before I received a copy of the original publica
tion of the professor.        In the conclusion I find he urges me
to extend my inquiries into the real use of the crepitacu/um
cuuihc, or rattle of the crotalus. This is certainly a question
                                                               worthy

        the Ralllesnale,         and other American Serpents.                   299
worthy of the attention of American naturalists, who enjoy
the best opportunities of investigating the subject.      I am,
indeed, inclined to think that we are not yet acquainted with
the real or exclusive use of the rattle of the crotalus. That
it was given to this reptile to warn man and other animals of
a dangerous enemy, does not appear a sufficient explanation
of the use of the organ. Many serpents whose poison is not
less deleterious than that of the rattlesnake, are entirely de
stitute of any apparatus like the crepitaculum of this reptile.
Besides, we have seen that, when most intent upon obtaining
his prey, the rattlesnake keeps his rattle still. This would
seem to (how that it was not designed to terrify its enemies.
Indeed, it is highly probable that one reason why the rattle
snake so frequently succeeds in capturing animals       because     is,
he makes no noise, and therefore surprises his prey.
      do not doubt that the crepitaculum of the rattlesnake
                                                                                 it is
 I
an organ of very essential importance    but : must fay that
                                                      I
has always been deemed of more importance than          can yet     it
be shown to be.      Thus       has been said to give an unerring
                                 it
indication of the age of the reptile. In this respect             less     is
                                                                   It it
                                                                            a
sure criterion than has been generally imagined.                 fact  is   a
which, I    believe, has entirely escaped the notice of all the
writers on the natural history of this reptile, that the rattles
are formed before the exclusion of the young ones from the
uterus. Towards the latter end of August          number of female
                                                      a
rattlesnakes were opened.        The young animals were about
 five inches long, and about the thickness of            small-sized
                                                               a
 goose-quill:   the scales were formed so as to be visible to the
 naked eye the head very large, and the fangs, though of
           ;                                                                      a
 somewhat gelatinous consistence, were shaped, and distinctly
 visible. The rattles were        far formed that three bells could
                                      so
 be plainly discerned  ; and this was the cafe            in
                                                     more than sixty
 instances.   Hence    it   evident, that when they are excluded
                            is
 from the womb the young animals have at least three rat
 tles.   After this,
                   I   believe, they generally acquire two bells
 every year.    Yet, in one instance,        rattlesnake
                                             a             has been*
 known to acquire four bells in the term of year.          a    may        I
 add, that the bells are liable to be lost they are sometimes
                                                  :
 broken, and
                it
                is   not improbable that they wear out.
       am sometimes almost inclined to think, with your learned
 and eloquent countryman Mr. Herder, that " natural his
 I
  tory has reaped no advantage from the philosophy of final
 causes." And yet without an inquiry into the ultimate                           in
  tentions of nature, what       natural history
                                  is                 A barren waste

I
       MY IORDS,
   N reporting upon the survey I made in Scotland, in obe
dience to the instructions I had the honour of receiving from
your lordships, dated the istof July 1802, I find the business
may be most conveniently arranged under the following
heads   :
    I. What   regards rendering the intercourse of the country
more perfect, by means of bridges and roads.
    II. Ascertaining various circumstances relative to the Ca
ledonian canal, especially with regard to the supplies of water
on the summit level, and the best communications from this
canal to the fishing locks at the back of the Isle of Skye.
    III. The means of promoting the fisheries on the east and
west coasts.
    IV. The   causes of emigration,  and the means     of prevent
ing it.
    V. Improving the     means   of intercourse between Great
Britain and the   northern parts of Ireland ; particularly as to
the bridges and roads between Carlisle and Port Patrick, and
also the harbour of Port Patrick.
    Under each of those heads are comprehended             subjects
highly deserving the attention of government; the more
                                                              they

              end Central Highlands    of Scotland.         JOI
they are investigated, the more important they will appear,
and the public will become more fully convinced, that .the
general interests of the British empire are extensively con
nected with the several improvements which are mentioned
in your lordships' instructions.
                      Of Bridges and Roads.
    The obstacles which at present obstruct the communica
tions in the north of Scotland are numerous and well known,
not only to the inhabitants, but to every person who has
travelled through, or even inquired into the state of, the
 country.
    Previous lo the year 1742, the roads were merely the tracks
of black cattle and horses, intersected by numerous rapid
streams, which being frequently swoln into torrents by heavy
rains, rendered them dangerous or impassable.       The military
roads, which were formed about this time, having been laid
out with other views than promoting commerce and industry,
are generally in such directions, and so inconveniently steep
as to be nearly unfit for the purposes of civil life ; and in
 those parts where they are tolerably accessible, or where roads
 have since been formed by the inhabitants, the use of them
is very much circumscribed from the want of bridges over
 some of the principal rivers.
    The general connections of the country may be stated as
 leading from Edinburgh to the north and north-west coun
 ties, by means of one road through the Highlands, and by
 another along the east coast and south stiore of the Murray
 Frith to the town of Inverness, and from thence through
 Beauley and Dingwall, to Tain in Ross-sliire. From Glasgow
 and Greenock, the communications          by land are through
Argyleshire,   to the western parts of Inverness and Ross-lhire,
 and to the shores opposite the whole of the Hebrides.    There
 is an important communication from Inverness westward,
 across the country to Fort Augustus and Fort William, and
 from Fort Augustus there are just the vestiges remaining of
 what was once a military road to Bernera, opposite the back
 of the Isle of Skye.
    In considering these lines of roads, it appears most regular
 to begin on the borders of the improved country, and near to
 the feats of commerce and industry.         In proceeding from
 Edinburgh northwards, by the east coast and Moray Frith
 to Inverness, or through the central Highlands to the fame
 place, and from thence to Tain on the Dornoch Frith in
  Ross-shire, we find the communications intercepted, and we
 learn that accidents frequently happen from the want of a
                                                          bridge

  JO J           A Survey    and Report   of the Coajli
  bridge over the river Tay, at Dunkeld, in Perthshire ; an
  other over the river Spey, at Fochahers, in Bamffshire; a
  third over the river Beauley, in Inverness- shire ; and a fourth
  over the river Conon, near Dingwall, in Ross-shire.         These
  rivers are large, and at present are ail crossed by means of
  ferry-boats.
     At Dunkeld the river Tay is deep and broad, and there
 is reason to expect the foundations will be expensive, the bed
 of the river at and for a great distance above and below the
 town being composed of alluvial earth and gravel. The best
 situation for a bridge is a little below the lower ferry; at this
 place there is a straight reach of the river, and in winter the
 ice is broken by pasting over a ford nearly opposite the mouth
 of the river Bran. This situation will also connect with th6
 improved lines of road which are proposed to be made on
 each fide of the river.     It is probable that a flat rubble stone
 will be got near the slate quarries, which are within a short
 distance of the place.     Freestone of a durable quality is to be
 had near Dundee : it may be brought by water carriage to
 Perth, and from thence by land to Dunkeld.
     Under all these circumstances the expense would be consi
 derable ; and, taking into account the uncertainty of the
 foundations, the amount cannot be stated at less than
 15,000 1.
     The two ferries which are now at Dunkeld belong to his
grace the duke of Athol ; he has authorized me to state, that
 if government will defray one-half the expense of a bridge,
 he will advance the other half; that he will give up his in
 terest in the ferries, if in lieu thereof a reasonable toll be put
upon the bridge, in order to liquidate the capital advanced
by the duke : after this has been accomplislied, with a small
surplus to answer the repairs, the bridge ever after to remain
 free of toll.
     This seems a very reasonable and just mode of defraying
the expense : the safety and accommodation would be so
great, that no person travelling that road could object to pay
ing the same toll for a safe and convenient bridge which at
present is paid for a dangerous and inconvenient ferry-boat,
especially when there will be a certain prospect of having a
bridge free of toll in a few years.
     This bridge is of the first importance to the Central High
lands ; it would accommodate a great district of that country,
and at the fame time facilitate the communication with the
North Highlands.
     The river Spey is also rapid and deep, being the drain of
a great extent of mountainous country, where there is much
                                                               rain.

             and Central Highlands     of Scotland.             303
rain.    It is of course a very dangerous ferry. This ferry is
on the great coast road eastward from Inverness and Fort
George, through the towns and cultivated country in Mur
ray and Banff-shires, from whence it passes through Fraser-
burgh and Pcterhead to Aberdeen.
   Another branch of road also strikes off at Fochabers, ott
the Spey, and passes by Huntly and Inverury to Aberdeen.
   The necessity of having a bridge over the Spey at this
place became so urgent, that his grace the duke of Gordon
began a subscription in the adjacent country in order to raise
a part of the money necessary to defray the expense of a
bridge ; his grace set a liberal example, and it has been fol
lowed by most of the gentlemen in that part of the country.
In consequence of this exertion, a contract has been entered
into, and some steps have been taken towards carrying this
useful work into execution ; but unless government will grant
an aid equal to one-half the expense, the works must still be
left unfinished, and unfit for the purposes intended.
   The situation fixed upon for this bridge is adjacent to the
ferry and town of Fochabers.          At this place a rock passes
quite through the river, at about from eight to ten sect below
the surface of ordinary low water; and, as far as I could
 learn, it is the only place, unless at a great distance up the
 country, where the rock passes quite through the river. On
these accounts it was judicious to prefer it for the situation
of the bridge ; and it was fortunate this happened precisely
in the line of the present road.
    As one-half of the expense will be raised by subscription
in the neighbourhood, if government will defray the other
half, I understand it is proposed that the bridge shall be free
of toll. The expense cannot be stated at less than 12,000 1.
    I have made plans and sections for both those bridges. On
account of their being so nearlv connected with the feats of
the two before-mentioned noblemen, I have introduced more
 decorations than what are absolutely necessary for common
 road bridges.    This extra expense will not amount to much ;
 but whatever it  is,
                    I   proposeit sliall be defrayed  by thole no
 blemen.
 I    last year produced plans and estimates for the bridges
 over the rivers Beauley and Conon     :   I have again examined
 the proposed situations, and perceive that, on account of the
 uncertainty of the foundations, and the alteration which must
 be made in some parts of the beds of the rivers,           will be
                                                           it
 necessary to take the expenses of each bridge at 5000I. instead

  the communications with Ross-sliire, Sutherland, and Caith
  ness ; they are equally so for the north-west coast of the main
  land, and the northern parts of the Hebrides ; they are the
  roots from which a great number of branches of roads are to
  proceed, which are necessary for the improvement of the
  country and the extension of the fislieries.
     Before entering upon the consideration of the roads to the
 north of the line of the Caledonian canal, it is necessary to
 speak of the communications from Glasgow and Greenock
 by Argyleshire to Fort William^         From Glasgow there is al
 ready a road, which passes through Dumbarton up the west
 fide of Loch Lomond, by the upper ends of Loch Long and
 Loch Fyne to Inverary. From Greenock, by crossing the
 frith of the Clyde, there is a road which passes up the east
 fide of Gare Loch and Loch Long, and joins the road to
 Inverary at the top of Loch Long. From Inverary there is
 one road which passes the upper end of Loch Awe, and an
 other which crosses that loch by a ferry at Port Sonachan ;
.and these roads unite at Bunawe, on the banks of Loch
 Etive.    From Bunawe the road is already made to Oban,
 and a branch crosses Loch Etive and pastes along the south
 fide of the Linnhe Loch and Loch Eil to Fort William.
 Between Bunawe and Fort William there are three ferries,
,over arms of the sea, which running many miles into the
 land, cannot well be avoided : in other respects, the commu
 nication from Glasgow and Grenock, thus far, is tolerably
 good.     The Highland Society, in the excellent report to
 which I shall frequently have occasion to refer, and which
 may be found in the appendix*, have pointed out a new line
 of road from the north side of the Frith of Clyde, nearly
 opposite to Greenock, to be carried to the Bay of Slrachan
 upon Loch Fyne : this would be a very direct line from
 Greenock to Inverary, but it would be subject to two fer
 ries, and it seems doubtful whether this inconvenience would
not overbalance the additional distance round the upper end
ofthelochs; at least, as there is already a very good com
 munication by this road, it seems most prudent to attend to
 the other more necessary portions of road before this is un
dertaken.
    From Fort William it will be very adviseable to improve
and extend the road which passes along the north fide of the
portion of Loch Eil which turns from Fort William to the
west, and to carry it from thence across the upper end of
Loch Shiel, through Arrasaig to Morer, as described in the
                * This shall appear in our next Number.

rect communication from the Clyde to the filhing lochs at
the back of Skye, to.Skye itself, and to the islands of Egg,
Rum, Muck, Barra, and South Uist. This would prove of
great importance to the fisheries on account of facilitating
intelligence, which is one of the most necessary steps to pro
mote the success of this business.
   In   the year 1796,          Mr. Brown, of Elgin,                   made   a survey
and estimate-of this road from Fort William to Morer, and
stated the expense at 6456                    1.;

    With regard to the improvement of the roads which lead
from Fort William east to Inverness, there            one principle
                                                                  is

    We now come to consider the communications of the
countries which lie to the north and west of the track of the
Caledonian canal. From this valley, which runs from Fort
William to Inverness,             of great importance that there
                                    it   is

hitherto have remained nearly inaccessible               incalculable

the loss which the public has sustained, and are about to
suffer, from the want of roads in this country.
   From the bridges of Beauley and Conon, lines of road,
from the fame important causes, are wanted in several direc
tions to the west coast, and through the whole of the coun
ties of Ross-sliire, Sutherland, and Caithness.        The outlines
of those roads are well described in the report of the Highland
Society and although there               diversity of opinion as to
                                                    is

3°6             A Survey  and Report of   the Coajls
 creasing the revenue and population os the kingdom, justi
 fies government in granting aid towards making roads arid
 bridges in a country which mustotheiivise remain; perhaps
 for ages to come, thus imperfectly connected.           Yet is the
 land-owners in those extensive districts through which the
 roads would pass, and indeed the whole of the adjoining di
 stricts of country, would enjoy improved Cultivation and pas
turage, 'increased incomes, and all the blessings which are to
 be derived from a facility of intercourse,     it is certainly ju(t
that they should contribute a share wim government in the
expense of acquiring those advantages.        They might be en
abled to do this without inconvenience to the present pos
sessors, by being empowered     by an act of parliament to fell
land, or borrow money upon the land, to the amount of their
              of the expense to be incurred by the roads and
Eroportion
   ridges.   This is reasonable, because the money so raised
would be applied to improve the remainder of the entailed
estate, which would be enhanced in value though somewhat
diminished in extent.
     The expense of the Tines of road which were surveyed and
estimated by Mr. Brown, comprehending the whole of the
beforementioned counties, and nearly jooo miles in length,
did not amount to 150,0001.         If, therefore, we admit an
equal Quantity of lines of road, to be undertaken and com
pleted in the course of three vears, would require an annual
supply of 50,000 b; and supposing this to be raised in equal
moieties by government and the land-owners, it would
amount to 25,0001. each : but as it is not likely the whole
could be brought so immediately into operation, it may,
with more probability, be expected that six years would be
taken up in executing all the lines, which would reduce the
annual supply to 25,0001. or 12,500b from each party. But
this is exclusive of the four great bridges, the total expense
of which is reckoned at 37,000b; if they were undertaken
by proper persons they might be executed in three years,
which would require an annual supply of 12,333b 6s. 8d.;
and if government was to grant one-half,
     It would be annually     -    £.6,166 13 4

     »                            £. 18,666 13 4
     Speaking therefore generally, if government was disposed
to encourage these, plans of improvement, and would agree to
advance 20,000b in each of the first three years, and 12,000].
in each of the lall three years, it would then remain with the
land-owners of the dillridl* of country through which the
                                                               lines

               and Central Highlands     of Scotland.          307
lines were to be carried, to come forward with their surveys
and estimates, and subscriptions to one-half the amount of
the expense, proving at the same time, to the satisfaction of
government, that the proposed lines would be of public as
well as private utility.    It would be necessary also to provide
that the works should be substantially executed, and that the
land-owners or others interested should always lay out a cer
tain sum before government advanced an equal moiety.
     Means should oe provided for the maintenance of the roads
and bridges after they have been completed; and for this
  mrpose there should either be a fund reserved, or a small toll
IIaid on, to go in aid of the statute labour of the country. A
 very important consideration also, is the erecting and main
 taining proper inns upon the roads.
     Several of the houses which were built by government
 upon the military roads, are striking instances of the neces
 sity there is of giving the people who are to keep the inns
something else to depend upon besides what arises from sup
 plying travellers; there should be some land attached to the
 house, at a rent to be settled by reference.    I am not prepared
 to say what the quantity should be, or of what particular de
 scription; it is at present sufficient to point out the principle.
     Upon the whole, as far as regards the bridges and roads, I
 can have no hesitation in stating, that they are of the greatest
 moment for promoting the improvement of the country, and
 for perfecting the connections with the fishing lochs and the
  Hebrides ; and I shall hereafter endeavour to explain my rea
  son for thinking that some share of the emigrations is to be
  attributed to the want of proper communications.
                          Naval Stations.
     Before entering upon the subject of the Caledonian canal
  it will be proper to observe, that I again examined the Bay
  of Cromarty, and have procured some more information re
  specting it and the Murray Frith.
     Mr. Henderson, the      resident custom-house officer, a man
  of respectability, has, at my desire, ascertained the depth of
  water in the wells, and also what quantity flows from a spring
  about half a mile from the town. From this letter it appears,
  that at the depth of twenty feet from the surface of the plain
   upon which the town stands, there arc four feet of water in
  their wells ; when at Cromarty I learned, that at high springs
  this water is brackifli, but it is generally used for washing,
  and other domestic purposes.        At the distance of about half
  a mile from the town there is a fine spring, which was dis
   covered by the late Mr. Boss during" his ineffectual attempt
                                  Xj                              t»

308             A   Survey and Report as   the Coasts
to find coal:    from this circumstance it is called the Coal
Well.   This    spring produces,   on an average, upwards of
twenty hogsheads of water in an hour; this water might
be collected into a reservoir at a small expense; from this
reservoir it might he brought to the shore, which is a short
distance, in pipes, and bv means of hose rim into casks in a
ship's boat:    to protect the boais, a small pier might be
formed   at this place.
    Captain Duff, of the royal navy, who is well acquainted
with the country, and has navigated the Moray Frith in a
frigate, has been so obliging as to resolve some queries which
I took the liberty of transmitting to him through his brother-
in-law colonel Dirom. Captain Duff confirms the general
report of the excellence of the Cav of Cromartv, and the en
trance to it; his opinion respecting the navigation of the
Moray Frith is quite as favourable as I have been led to ad
vance in mv last report.      From what he states it appears,
that even with a contrary wind a ship of war could clear the
headlands in forty-eight hours from the time of leaving the
Bay of Cromarty.        From this account, persons conversant in
naval affairs will be able to judge how far this bay would be
suitable for a squadron destined to watch the mouth of the
Baltic and protect the coast. It would be singularly well situ
ated for convoys to vessels coming from the westward through
the Caledonian canal, and when returning with the sam«
trade; after seeing the merchant ships pass Fort George, the
(hips of war would be close in with their own harbour.
    As an aid to this station, the harbour of Aberdeen might
be made to receive frigates.     This harbour is not embayed,
and frigates might fail from it at all times. In my last re
port I Hated the expense which would attend improving thi     >
 harbour, and I distinguished what extra expense would be
 required to render it capable of receiving frigates, which ap
 peared to be 33,700!.
   The magistrates of the town, by whose spirited exertion*
several valuable improvements have already been effected,
 have authorized me to sav, that they are ready to co-operate
with government as far as their circumstances will admit.
If  frigates were stationed at Aberdeen, and large ships at
 Cromarty, a naval protection would be immediately obtained
in that quarter at a very moderate expense; and experience
would point out what future improvements were necessary
upon this coast.
   From Aberdeen, Pcterhead, and Frascrburgh, a commu
nication might be kept up with Cromarty by means of          sig
nals or a   telegraph, or    land expresses to Nairn, where
                             by

                    and Central Highlands               of Scotland.                309
the frith is only three leagues over ; or a fast sailing vessel
would soon run with an easterly wind from Fraserburgh to
Cromarty.
  "If Cromarty Bav was made a roadstead, there would be
wanted a storehouse aud some other conveniences, which
may be on a small sale, until the merits of the place have
been fully proved : allow au expense here of 5000 1.
                          The Caledonian Canal.
    Ipassed along the whole line of this canal, that    from                  is,
Inverness on the east, to Fort William on the west coast.                           I
took much pains to examine into the nature of the navigation
ot the lochs, their soundings, and anchoring places.      For
this purpose     applied chiefly to Mr. Guynn, who com
                    I
manded the Lochness galley, in government service, thirty-six
years; from him          obtained
                          I          very full and satisfactory ac
                                             a
count of Lochness: he also took the soundings of LochOich
and     apart of Loch Lochy for me.
    From him        learnt that Lochness
                    I                          twenty-two miles in
                                                         is

                                   is
 30 very near the shores; that there are six anchoring places
on the north, and four on the south side            and that at each
                                                                 ;

                                   is   a
 five, eight, and ten fathom water.
    That    a vessel passing from the west to the east end before
a   westerly wind, or in      contrary direction before an easterly
                                a
wind, has nothing to do but run before the wind the whole
way, which she would do in from three to five hours, and
 with contrary winds          in
                             moderate weather she would work                         it
in from twenty-four to thirty-six hours.
    That the easterly winds generally prevail from March till
the end of September, when the westerly winds set in, and
continue for the rest of the year.
    The soundings he took         Loch Lochy are from seven to
                                        in
sixty-eight fathoms, with bold (bores and good anchorage.
     In Loch Quoich, which             sliort loch on the summit
                                             is   a
level, there are some shallow parts, but they may be made
sufficiently deep.
 I     next proceeded to examine the supplies of water which
are on the summit level, and for this purpose
                                                       passed up the I
valley of Glengarey to Loch Hourn at the back of Skye.            In
this villey     found Loch Garry, which appears to be upwards
                I
of five miles in length, and from half           mile to one mile in
                                                            a
breadth     :   towards   the   head         of     the valley   is   Loch Quoich,
which appears to be upwards of eight miles                            in   length, and

from one to two miles in breadth : these natural reservoirs,
placed in an extensive valley and a rainy country, form art
abundant provision for every purpose to which water can be
 applied in the course of the canal.
    Having ascertained these points, I passed by a very rockv
and precipitous tract down to the head of Loch Hourn ; from
Loch Hourn I travelled by a tract scarcely less rugged to the
top of Glen Elg, and over the steep mountain of Kaatachan
to the top of Loch Duich ; from thence I travelled along the
vestiges of a military road, up Glen Shiel, down a part of
 Glen Morrison, and over a rugged mountain to Fort Augustus.
 In Glen Morrison and Glen Garry it is possible to make
roads, if judiciously laid out, upon an easy ascent; but the
idea of water conveyance through them between the Caledo
nian canal and the fishing lochs is altogether unadvisable.
    My next object was to examine the country which lies be
tween the top of Loch Eil and Loch Shiel, in order to find
whether a water conveyance could be made at a moderate
expense from Loch Eil through Loch Shiel, and so into the
 fishing grounds to the south of Skye, without passing down
the Linnhe Loch, up the Sound of Mull, and round the
 Point of Ardnamurchan.       I carried a level across the neck
of land which separates Loch Eil from Loch Shiel : the di
 stance is about three miles.    I found the summit of the land
 forty-three feet above high water in Loch Eil, and thirty-five
feet five inches above the level of the fresh water in Loch
Shiel.    In order to form a canal, as there is no water to be
got on this summit, the ground must be cut down to twelve
Feet below the level of the water in Loch Shiel, which would
make forty-seven feet five, inches of cutting, and this depth
of cutting would be continued for nearly a mile : I also sus
 pect that in this distance rock would be met with.        I am
therefore sorry to fay, I cannot advise the work being under
 taken before the nature of the ground has been fully proved,
 and the whole of Loch Shiel has been examined with great
care : and as this passage cannot be useful unless the Caledo
nian canal be made and navigated from the east, if that event
should take place, there will be plenty of time to re-examine
this point with care; at present it ought, in my opinion, to
be postponed.
    Having investigated all the points which fell under my ob

the proposed inland navigation, if united with a naval station
in the Moray frith, or on the adjacent coast of Scotland.

 LVI.       On Winds.       By    Richard Kirwan,              Esq.  LL.D.

                Of the Origin of the general Trade Winds.
   ;A HOUGH the origin of the general trade winds appears
 to me to have been hilly established by Dr. Halley, yet it
 seems he has explained himself too briefly, since his explana
 tion has been misunderstood                by many, and was thought
 obscure even by d'Alembert t-
     To understand it more perfectly, let us suppose the sun for
 the first time in the meridian, and to communicate its heat
 every instant fifteen degrees all around.             If it were to remain
 in this situation the surrounding air could have no other mo
 tion but upwards, for the lateral dilatations being equal,
 would necessarily check each other, but in the second, and
 all the succeeding instants, the fun moves westwards; there

 the western, to which the sun approaches nearer, is more
 heated than the eastern, from which the fun recedes; there
 fore in this, and all the succeeding instants, the eastern, being
 more cooled, will press on the western, and thus an eastern
 wind will be established.
     It is true, that, in the northern hemisphere, the northern
 air also presses upon the more heated spaces ; but as this also
 follows the fun's path to the westward, it becomes also east
 erly, preserving only a few points of its primitive direction.
 D'Alembert adds also the solar attraction, which, according
 to him, elevates the air in the points over which the fun is
 vertical, and consequently produces a dilatation advancing
 from east to west.        But M. De la Place, not denying this
 cause,    considers it too weak to produce singly any considera
 ble effect*.
    About the year 1735 Mr. Hadley published a very different
 account of the origin of the trade winds (Phil. Trans. Abrid.
 viii. p. 5C0) ; which, however, has been rejected by the most
 distinguished astronomers that have since attended to this ob
ject, as d'Alembert, fur la Cause des Vents, art. 376 and
 385; Gentil Voy.; Bergman Erde Beschreib. ii. p. 91.
    According to Mr. Hadley, the air, being rarefied towards
 the equator, is consequently invaded in the northern hemi
 sphere by the northern, and in the southern hemisphere by
 the southern colder air.
    But as the parallels of latitude enlarge as they approach
 the equator, and as the equatorial space is nearly in the pro
 portion of 1000 to 917, the difference of their circumference
 is nearly 2083 miles ; consequently, the surface of the globe
 at the equator moves so much faster than under the tropics ;
 and hence the northern or southern air, moving from the
 tropics towards the equator, must possess less velocity than
the parts it arrives at, and consequently appear to move in a
 direction contrary to that of the earth's motion ; which being
from west to east, the air arriving sooner at the western parts,
will appear to move from east to west ; and this relative mo
tion being combined with that towards the equator, a north
east wind will be produced on the north fide, and a south-east
 wind on the south fide of the equator.         These as they ap
 proach the equator should become stronger and more easterly,
and appear due east in the equator itself, by reason of the
concourse of both currents from the north and from the
south. There the velocity of each sliould be at the rate of
2083 miles in the space of one natural day, or above 1*33
                           • Mem. Paris

                                                             miles.

                            On Winds.                         313
miles per minute, if it had not been that before the air at
the tropics could arrive at the equator, it must have gained
sonic motion eastwards from the surface of the earth or sea,
whereby the relative motion is diminished to the degree that
actually exists in it.
     This theory appears to me rather ingenious than solid, for
the following reasons :
     i . The trade winds are commonly gentle, moving only
at the rate of eight miles an hour ; therefore they have suffi
cient time to gain or participate of the motion of the earth ;
therefore their contrary course must arise from an absolute
cause, and cannot be deemed merely relative.
     2. Because the north-east wind scarce ever approaches
nearer than eight or ten degrees to the equator, and there
dies away; whereas it ought there, according to this theory,
 to be strongest.    And, on the contrary, the south-east pastes
 the equator several degrees, even when the fun is in the south
 tropic.    A fact which, as Gentil remarks, is absolutely irre-
 concileable wiih this theory. (Gentil Voy. i. p. 638 ; Ibid. v.
 p. 116.)
     3. Because, if the constant easterly wind was in the north
 ern hemisphere supplied solely from the north, and in the
 southern hemisphere solely from the south, we should in the
 former have a constant north wind at least at 35 or 40 degrees
 from the equator, or at least from some northern point, and
 in the latter a constant south wind, or at least from some
 southern point ; whereas, on the contrary, a south wind
  often prevails in those latitudes on the north fide of the equa
 tor, and a north wind on the south side. Thus La Perouie
  met an E. S. E. in north latitude 3a0, and a due east in lati
  tude 31°; and a S.S.E. in latitude 14°, and a due east in
  latitude 16 ; and a due north in latitude 200, (where then
  was the relative motion?) and a due south in latitude 330.
  (See his Journal in La Peyr. Voy. iii.)      He also met with a
  due north in latitude 27" and 420 south, and a N. N. E. in
  latitude 25° south.    So captain Cook met a S. S. E. wind in
 Jatimde 300    north, and   also in latitudes 400 and 410, and a
  due south wind in latitude 380 and 20°; and in the southern
  hemisphere a due north in latitude 30, 40, and 440. I might
  produce other instances from sea journals, and particularly
  from that, most ample and instructive, kept by major Dai
  ry mple during a voyage to the East Indies (Phil. Trans. 1778);
  but I think the alleged sufficiently prove that the general east
  wind is not supplied^ solely from the north or south in the dif
   ferent hemispheres respectively.
      4. Because, during our fix summer months, when the fun
   is in or approaches to the northern tropic, the easterly trade
                                                              wind

   wind partakes less of the northerly, than when the fe*
  is in or approaches to the southern tropic, (Phil. Trans.
  Abrid.         p. 134; and Schued. Abhandl. 1762, p. 475:)
               ii.
  which        directly contrary to Hadley's system; for when
  the sun  is isin the southern tropic, the north wind must tra
  verse more of that space in which the earth's motion east
  ward    is strongest, and therefore sliould participate more of
  that motion, as Hadley himself states         though still partaking
                                                            :
  of it in a smaller degree than that which the globe itself pos
  sesses, it should appear to move westwards         yet   should pro;   it
 portionally retain less of its original direction from north to
 south than when            had traversed
                             it              space more distant from
                                                       a
 the equator, whereas the fact            that     retains more, and
                                                  is            it
 often passes into the southern hemisphere into the 13° south
 latitude without having any eastern direction, (Marchand iii.
 p. 551   ;)  and an analogous fact        observed with respect to
                                                  is
 the (outh-east wind when the fun            in the northern tropic.
                                                       is
 Hence    it     evident, that
                is                     from the approach of the fun,
                                        it   is
 and not from the latitude traversed, that the eastern direction
is   derived   ; nay, the wind      often more easterly than north
                                        is
 erly between latitude 23° and a83 (Foster's Observations,

 far beyond the tropics when the fun              in the fame hemi

                              Of   Variable Winds.
    With respect to winds we must lay down one general and
fundamental principle, which is, that they always originate
at the extremity of that point towards which they proceed.
Thus the easterly trade wind begins at the point nearest the
fun, which     follows, and
                     it        perpetually renovated and sup
                                         is
plied from parts still more easterly.  Thus in the year 709                        1
a  north wind was sooner perceived in England than at Dant-
zic (Phil. Trans. Abrid. iv. partii.p. 115. And Wargentin
notes, that when the wind changes to the west, this change
takes place at Moscow before        happens at Abo, which is

several degrees west of it; and sooner in Finland than in
Sweden. (Schwd. Abhandl. 1762, p. 195.) And Dr. Frank
lin, in his xxxvith Letter, p. 389, thinks that the north-east
storms in North America begin first, in point of time, in the
south-west parts ; that is to soy, sooner in Georgia than in
Carolina, and sooner in Carolina than in Vtreinia, &c. He
found that a north-cast storm began at Philadelphia at seven
o'clock, but did not extend to Boston (about forty miles to
the north-east) until eleven o'clock.       The Teason of which
he well explains, as the current must begin in the places
nearest to that in which the rarefaction arises, towards which
the current is directed.
                       Of Westerly Winds.
    That eminent and laborious meteorologist C. La Cotte,
infers from numerous observations of many years, that be
tween latitude 470 and 6o° on the western side of our hemi
sphere, the west wind, with some participation of the north
or south, is that which obtains oftenest. (Roz. Jour, xxxix.
p. 267.) Leche obtained the fame result at Abo, latitude 6o°$
from twelve years observations; Musehenbroeck, in Utrecht;
Mr. Dalton, in Westmorland, latitude 54", (fee his Meteoro
logical Essays, p. 48 and 88,) from five years observations.
    This wind in our continent originates in the Pacific Ocean
between the above-mentioned parallels, at least in winter;
the air incumbent on that ocean is then much warmer than
that of Siberia and Chinese Tartary that lie west of it; this
therefore presses upon and flows into the supra-marine, and
is immediately succeeded by air still further westwards, and
thus a current is gradually established extending to the At
 lantic, which, though in winter, being much warmer than
 the air of the islands and continent on which it flows, is
forced into the current, both by the rupture of the equili
brium to the eastwards, and by the pressure of the much
colder air of the continent of North America.
                       Of Easterly Winds.
    During the winter months there seems to be a frequent
 struggle and contest betwixt the air incumbent over the Asi
 atic continent and that incumbent on the North American
 lying betwixt the above-mentioned parallels and bordering
 on the Pacific Ocean, which of them sliall rule over it.
    The mass of the American air being less considerable, and
its efforts divided between the Pacific and the Atlantic, ic
 generally obliged to yield to its antagonist ; though sometime*
 the Asiatic being warmed, either Dy a diffusion of the su

JlcT                            On Winds.
perior current or by southerly winds, the colder American
becomes more forcible.      In summer this must happen fre
quently, the E.N. E. oftenest prevailing: upon the whole,
however, Leche remarked that the east and E. S. E. were
nearly the most uncommon ; as did La Cotte in the climate
of Paris. (Meteorolog. p. 305.)
   With us this wind is most frequent in the months of April
and May ; and I have observed in Cook's Journal, tables 9th,
10th, and uth, that it prevails also in the fame months in
the Pacific, therefore the colder continental air then pours in
upon us.
   La Cotte also observes, that in the western tracts of Eu
rope, in latitudes balow 48°, this wind occurs oftenest during
the winter months*; for the superior heat of the Atlantic in
the low latitudes determines the colder air incumbent on
Hungary and European Turkey to flow in upon it.
                       Of   Southerly   Winds.
   A few years ago, no problem in meteorology appeared to
me more difficult than to assign a cause for the frequent pre
valence of a south wind even in winter, it being contrary to
the laws of nature that warm air should rush upon colder ;
yet I since discovered that the conjectural solution I then of
fered is grounded on a real fact.
   In the eastern parts of our hemisphere, from longitude 72*
to 1600, that   is,
                  from the coast of Malabar to the Moluccas,
it blows from the north-east constantly from October until
April. Now this northern blast must be supplied and re
cruited from countries still further north until we arrive at
the pole, and the polar air must consequently be supplied by
that which lies south of         it,
                                and thus    southern current
                                                   a                          is
established on the western fide of our hemisphere.
   Instances to support or contradict this theory do not often
occur; yet have found some that appear to me decisive,
            I                                                                in
dependently of the general reason alleged.       Thus find in     I
the ninth table of the third volume of Cook's Voyages, that
in north latitude 590, and east longitude 207°, on the 25th
of May 1778,    a strong north-west wind prevailed; and on
the 29th day of the fame month and year, an equally strong
south-west wind prevailed at Petersburgh, latitude         ana     6   3°
longitude 300   east.   Now   the  places of  observation were
177 degrees distant, one on the eastern and the other on the
western side of our hemisphere, (which, at this proximity to
the pole,   argues not   a   superior   distance to that      I   have men-

tioned ;) and four days is as short a time as can be allowed to
the south-west to supply the more eastern north-west. (Mem.
Petersburgh 1778, p. 92.) So also in the same journal I find,
that from the 4th to the 30th of May a north wind prevailed
in the eastern part of our hemisphere from latitude 580 to 6i°,
except seventeen days of variable winds; but in London it
blew from the south-west during the first fifteen days of June,
thus replacing the northern air. And to replace the constant
north-east wind on the Indian peninsula to the Moluccas,
there is a constant draught from the south in the western
parts of our hemisphere; accordingly Leske observed, that
on an average of twelve years it blew 126 days each year,
from October until May, from some south point, namely,
 86 days from the south or south-west, and 40 from the south
east, at Abo, latitude 606.
    It is true, that he found it to take place very frequently
also in summer ; but this is occasioned by the great heat that
 then prevails in the northern tracts of Lapland.
    Ajid, upon the whole, more of the south air is drawn off
in winter than in summer; for its flow is gentle in summer,
 but often stormy in winter. See Leske's 9th, nth, and 12th
 tables.    If all other meteorological tables of a series of years
 had been arranged with equal sagacity and precision as those
 of Leche and Dr. Horseley, a vast fund of information might
 be extracted from them.
    At Petersburgh, during the year 1793, Euler junior found
 a south or south-west wind prevailed 79 days, 52 from Oc
 tober to the end of March, and only 27 in the summer
 months : it was stormy in November, December, and Janu
 ary. I have not noted the south-east.
     Mr. Stritter also found the south wind to predominate at
 Moscow during the six winter months of that year, (N. Acta
  Petrop. xi. p. 569;) so that the frequency of this wind in
 high latitudes is certain.
                         Of Northerly Winds.
    In the   western parts of our continent and hemisphere these
 are  of all others the least frequent in latitudes above 480. Sec
  La Cotte's and Leche's tables.        The cause of this unfre-
 quency appears from what has been said of south winds.
     But in latitudes below 480 they occur oftener, and oftenest

 in the eastern parts of our hemisphere to supply the constant
 north-east wind that prevails in the low latitudes of the west
 ern side ? The reason                is,
                            that on the western side the north
 east winds of low latitudes are easily supplied     the conti     by

  different and even opposite points of the horizon, prevail at
  different heights in the atmosphere over the same tracts of

gentle, until at last (in about three weeks)                  it   is

sphere, he says, extends to the height of 2880 feet. (Vol. iv.
p. 48.)       At the commencement of winter, when the fun
approaches the south tropic, and the north air begins to flow
in and follow         it,must meet with more resistance from the

lower denser air, as its impetuous course in an opposite di
rection      is more slowly altered (this respects the monsoons)
than in the rarer superior strata; and the same effect, but in
a   different direction, takes place when the fun approaches to
the northern tropic.
    It  has been said            by
                            many, that winds in the superior re

   Well established general laws on this head would be ex
tremely useful, as we might then foresee what wind might
next be expected.    Besides the gemral succession in an open
country, it is probable there is a local, confined to certain
situations,
   Gentil remarks, that in the southern latitudes of our hemi
sphere, a north-east is succeeded by an east, south-east, and
south.   According to La Cotte, the order of succession in the
middle latitudes is south-west, north, west, north-east, south,
north-west, east, south-east. (Roz. .louru. xxxix. p. 267.)

  This is a south or south-east wind, known in the southern
parts of Italy, Sicily, and Malta, distinguished by peculiar
debilitating effects, well described by Brydone, and by Do-
lomieu in his Treatise on the Temperature of Malta. The
latter has fliown that its malignity results from the constitu
tion of the air it conveys, and not merely from its tempera
ture, which is variable, from 550 to 8o°. It contains a much
smaller proportion of oxygen than air usually does.            The
constitution of the African wind, called barmattan, is as yet
 unknown ; it        is,
                     at least on land, loaded with some unknown
undiflblved vapour* and          much hotter and drier than the

JM              On the Adiott of Galvanism, and     the
Ions, and, as is always the cafe with new discoveries, their
uses are exaggerated by some, and despised by others.           This
diversity of opinion induced our associate Charles Bosse to
propose to me two questions, which I endeavoured to solve
in the next letter I wrote to him about the end of September.
I  could easily increase the number of cures obtained by means
of Galvanism and electricity, as well as of the misfortunes oc
casioned by the action of these fluids and of the instances
         I
where observed a constant relation between the moral part ;
that is to fay, the strength of mind, the courage of the victims
to justice, and the effects of the Galvanic fluid on their bodies:
but these observations belong to the general report of the ex
periments which we made since the 14th of August.             I shall
therefore only present to you the letter which I wrote at that
period.
    " You asked me in one os our late academic sittings, why,
after so many experiments, made by the first philosophers of
the last century, on the electric fluid, such a variety of opi
nions is entertained in regard to its medical action in the
human body ; and whether Galvanism seems already to pro
mise results more useful to the healing art.      I  shall here give
you my opinion on these questions, or rather submit to you
 the inductions which different experiments made by myself,
or at which I assisted, gave me reason to deduce with more
 certainty than I durst venture to hope when        I  began to pay
 a serious attention to this object.
    "I    consider Galvanism as a modification of electricity — a
 modification which renders this fluid more active; as the
 small flame separated by the blow-pipe is far more ardent
 than the large one from which it is taken.           I have read to
 the class several experiments which seem to support this com
 parison between electricity and Galvanism.        Animals which
 were only stunned by the strongest sparks from a magic pic
 ture, were killed in less than three minutes by a very weak
 degree of Galvanism.
    " The fluid of a pile composed of 25 plates of silver and zinc
 of the size of a crown-piece, intermixed with pieces of paste
 board moistened in water saturated with muriate of ammonia,
 oxidates the metals in decomposing the water, while it is
 scarcely sensible in the fingers, and gives only small sparks.
 The brilliant electric sparks which excite in our bodies a strong
 sensation of pricking, neither oxidate the metals nor decom
 pose the water if they do not communicate a shock.          Having
 made the Galvanic current to pass through the body of a
 frog, its fluids were decomposed, and I saw it swell up so
 much that it could no longer plunge into the water though
                                                            possessed

        Application   of this Fluid and Electricity  to Medicine.  32s
  'possessed  of great vitality, which I never observed to be the
   case in frogs when tormented by strong electric sparks           All
   these facts, to which many more of a similar kind might be
   added, confirm the great activity of Galvanism in compa
   rison of electricity.     Hence it results, that the fluid of the
   Voltaic pile may be very useful in cases in which common
   electricity would not have sufficient activity.         You are ac
   quainted with some of the experiments which I made in con
  junction with my colleagues Giulio and Rossi : we made
   others, still more interesting, which have determined physio
   logical fa6ts, before doubtful for want of being verified.      We
   then tried an application of it in several diseases with the
   greatest success.     Three of the cafes are as follow :
       "A   lady about thirty years of age, after severe pains in the
   head, lost the sight of the right eye.         C. Rossi being con
   sulted in regard to this malady, after a close examination of
   the eye, which appeared to be as found and to look as well
   as the left, concluded that it must arise from a palsy of the
   optic nerve, or what is called a gutla J'erena, which suffered
   the patient to sec only, as it were, through a thick mist;
   which increased her misfortune, since it deranged the fight
   of the other eye, so that she was always afraid of falling1, not
    being able to distinguish well with the right eye the objects
   which slie handled. Rossi being sick, sent her to me, that I
   might make an application of Galvanism.              I formed a pile
   of thirty pairs of plates like those already mentioned, and
   employing gold wire as conductors, I caused the Galvanic
    current to enter near the exterior angle of the eye, and to
   issue sometimes at the eyebrow, sometimes by the ophthal
    mic ramus which passes through the orbital foramen, and
    sometimes near the interior ansrle of the fame eye. The ope
    ration was very painful ; it caused abundance of tears to flow;
    but, after successive Galvanic shocks for half an hour, the eye
    begin lo fee a little better.      That I might not fatigue n^v
    patient too much, and that nature might have time to act,
    the operation was suspended till the evening, when it was
    repeated tor half an hour.      The next day the eye began to
    distinguish the figure os bodies.       Having repeated the ope
    ration for three days following, the lady was not only able to
    distinguish the figure of bodies, and people's featutes, but also
.   the pupils of their eyes.        Before this operation, in conse
   quence    of a  consultation  with   Dr. John Baptist Ansorini, first
    physician   of  the Hospital  de  la Charite, I had Galvuiized a
    young woman, twenty-seven years of age, of a melancholy
    temperament, who, after some slight attacks, had a hemi-
    plegia of the right tide, whiuh affected in particular the arm,

the cheek, and the eye.     The other symptoms were removed
by bleeding and the use of the remedies usual in such cases ;
but the eye always remained fixed, with pains in the muscles.
The application of Galvanism for ten minutes was sufficient
to excite abundant tears and a discharge of a watery fluid
from the nose on the side which had always been shut since
the attack of the disorder, and greatly alleviated the pains of
the muscles.    She could even turn her eve to both fides ;
but (lie found great difficulty in raising or lowering    with
                                                             it,
a  sensation of heaviness all around the eye.    This operation
being repeated, after the interval of     dav the eve acquired
                                               a
its former freedom of motion, and the patient was freed
from every sensation of uneasiness.

several persons, and executed almost entirelv bv C. Hyacinth
Carena, lecturer on natural philosophy in the National Col
lege    of Turin.

employed.                                  ,
    " A man bit the singer by mad dog, came to consult
                    in                     a
him, in consequence of pain which he felt

                                                       in
back, and particularly the sincer, which had been bit more
than    amonth.     A caustic applied to the linger removed the
pain    but
        ;     a few days after      returned, accompanied with
                                    it
svmptoms of hydrophobia. The patient could no longer look
at water without horror    ; an inflammation in the throat pre
vented him from swallowing even chewed bread, and he ex
perienced   a strong propensity to bite thole around him.
    " In this (late he was brought to C. Koffi, who observing
that he could not bear the fight of water, nor that even of
stiining bodies, provided in another room        pile consisting or*
                                                   a
co pairs of plates of silver and zinc intermixed with 50 pieces
of pasteboard moistened with       solution of muriate of ammo
                                    a
nia.    He employed flips of brown paper moistened as con     a
ductor, on which the naked sect of the patient were plated,
and at the moment when he opened his mouth to bite, one
end of the arc was thrust into         while the other communi
                                         it,
cated with the pile.     The patient suffered great deal from
                                                     a
this operation, which after several shocks weakened him so
much that he could no longer support it. Being stretched
out on the floor, he was then Galvanized with cafe             : the
operation made the sweat run from him in drops. After
some time Kolfi caused the patient to be conveyed home, and
                                                                   gave

     Application of this Fluid and Electricity   to Medicine.   3 23
^ave orders, that he should be brought back next day, that
the operation might be repeated.         It was two o'clock in the
afternoon when the patient was Galvanized, and at fix next
morning he came to Rossi himself to tell him that he was
completely cur-ed, as he experienced no pain or difficulty of
swallowing, and was entirely freed from his aversion to water
and to liquids : no persuasion, however, could induce him to
submit to a new operation.
   " But a few days after, some flight pains having given him
reason to apprehend a new attack of hydrophobia,             he re
turned to Rossi, who bv repeating the operation made all the
symptoms disappear.       This cure was also effected in the pre
sence os several persons.     The patient, was endowed with so
great sensibility, that  for  more than a month after he felt in
the shoulders a sensation of the Galvanic (hocks, which I
fell only as far as the articulation of the finger, though I am
not one of the least sensible.      You see by these trials what
are the advantages which may be hoped for from Galvanism.
I entertain no doubt that a mean so active may preserve from
the grave many individuals, by Galvanizing them at the mo
ment when the play of the vital organs is suspended by an
accidental cause.
    " This will become more evident by an explanation of the
medical action of electricity on the human body.
   " Several celebrated writers have classed electricity among
those remedies which are most certain and most active;
others have shown the inutilitv, and even danger, of this
fluid considered as a remedy j aud both seem to be supported
by well attested facts.
    " Nothing, however, can be more easily explained, if we re
flect, that most of those who have applied electricity to me
dicine have been guided by quackery, without consulting the
nature of the disease, or of the agent which they employed.
For this reason I stated in the memoir which is about to ap
pear in the Transactions of the Academy, that the greatest
circumspection should be observed in the use of Galvanism,
which, like electricity, may be attended with bad conse
quences; and even advanced, that the latter, though a very
good remedy of itself, has done more hurt than good by im
proper application.
    " I (hall not here speak of the chemical properties which
during the enthusiasm of novelty has been ascribed to elec
tricity, such as that of transfusing into the human body the
action of remedies enclosed in glass tubes, by rubbing it with
them   .
    " It is well known tfiat it is the fate of new discoveries to be
                                 Y2                    exaggerated?

   324               On tbe Aclion     of Galvanism, &c.
   exaggerated, so that their adversaries easily find reasons to
   oppose them ; but after some time things come to their pro
   per level, established on a more complete knowledge of the
   agent; and those well acquainted with the properties of elec
   tricity are able to distinguish the cafes in which it may be
   administered with advantage, from those in which it would be
   only prejudicial.        Of ten patients affected with the fame dis
   ease, which undergo the same electric treatment, five may be
   entirely cured, and the other five be exceedinglyiH.
       "Those who are cured extol electricity as the best of reme
   dies ; those who have suffered, say that it only aggravates the
   evil.     Both speak from correct experience, and at the same
  time right and wrong, for attempting too much to general
   ize; that is to fay, because they do not distinguish the cause
  of the disease which' requires or opposes the application of
  electricity.      Thus the fame pain, the sciatica * for example,
  may be occasioned either by a stagnation of the fluids, by their
  too great abundance, or by the want of reaction in the solids :
  it may arise also from organic defects; an alteration of the
  fluids; a poisonous, or, as it is called, acrid principle; or
  from a peculiar virus in the fluids.
       " The five patients who labour under a stagnation of the
  fluids, receive the greatest relief from electricity, which puts
  them in motion ; the other five, tormented by sciatica occa
  sioned by vitiated humours, will grow worse under electric
  treatment, which will increase the acridity of the humours,
  carrying off a part of the water which kept the poison di-
•
  luted.      This theory of the effects of electricity in the human
  body is founded on the nature of this fluid, and on its pro
  perties establislied by numerous experiments.                 The electric
  fluid tends always to put itself into a state of equilibrium, and
  this tendency is so strong, that it penetrates to a certain di
  stance in the air, and extends along idio-electric bodies.                 It
  is this tendency which causes water when electrified to flow
  from capillary syphons, whereas a very few drops only stow
  without this electrization.          It is by the fame tendency that
  the electric spark, when it pastes from one conducting body
  to another by non-conducting substances, carries with it in
  its passage conducting particles which serve it as a vehicle, if
  the solidity of the bodies does not oppose a very strong resist
  ance. This property, proved by the common effects of thun
  der, and by several experiments, serves to account for the
      " Dr. Balbis observed to me, that sciatica of every kind may be ac
  counted for without recurring to the hypothetic alteration of the fluids.
  I  replied, that I wished only to compare my theory with the principal
  theories of sciatica, without concerning myself with their probability.

A>  lMONG the remains of gigantic and unknown animals
found in America, we have lately discovered one of the ox or
buffalo kind, which was taken from the bed of    creek fall             a

phical Society at Philadelphia.     By permission of the society
I made a plaster cast of this extraordinary bone, which I
have now with me in London, and of which I lend you an
accurate drawing, representing the back part of the head,
with the condyles of the neck, and the pith or internal part
of the left horn at the base. (See Plate             VI)
                                                 The right horn
is broken off, and all the fore part of the head ; but from the
fragment remaining it is a reasonable conjecture that the
buffalo to which it belonged was about ioor i feet high.
The horn at the base measures 21 inches in circumference,
and tapers very gently towards the extremity, where it is
broken off; so that the horn could not have been less than
fix feet in length.    From the middle future on the head to
the base of the horn measures 7 \ inches; consequently the
two horns were 15 inches distant; which must have been in
creased when they were partly covered with flesh, (kin, and
hair.
   It is very extraordinary that bones of this kind have been
occasionally found in Siberia, in Italy, Germany, and other
parts of Europe, though not quite so large as this American
bone; which circumstance, strengthened with others of a
similar nature, must prove, either that these great animals
have inhabited those various countries, or that their remains
have been forcibly scattered by the action of water.
   Buffon informs us*, that in the pari(h of H aux, a mile
and a half from Langoiran, in the splitting of a great rock,
some large bones, mostly petrified, were discovered ; probably
of the ox kind, but of a very great magnitude. He likewise
mentions t, that in 1772 there was found near Rome an
ox's head in a state of petrifaction.    The length of the fore
head between the two horns was 2 feet 3 inches ; the distance
between the orbits of the eves 14 inches ; that from the upper
portion of the forehead to the orbit of the exes, 1 foot 6 inches;
the circumference of one horn, 18 inches; the length ot the
fame following the curve, 4 feet. " This instance is sufficient
to prove," says Buffon, " that there have been prodigious
giants among this species of animals; but it is further con
firmed by other facts."     He then enumerates several bones
of the fame kind in the museum at Paris similar to some
which I have remarked in the Britisti museum.
   In the Philosophical Transactions J there is an engraving
and an account ot a bone of this kind, found near the city of

  characters which distinguish the one found on the Ohio.
       Until the discovery or this bone in America, the tradition
  of the Indians concerning the great buffalo has been consi
  dered as entitled to very little attention.       Many interpreted
  it as having emire reference to the mammoth, whole pre
  eminent size was obvious, and whose carnivorous teeth were
 well calculated to excite terror; but I have now no hesitation
  in believing that the tradition, which, with such little varia
  tion, prevails through all North America, mentioning the
  antient existence of a great buffalo, is a tradition really handed
 down to them from their forefathers, but, like all other tra
 ditions, clouded with fable: yet it is not improbable, since
 we find the remains of the mammoth and the great buffalo
 in the fame country, that the distinct ideas of each have
 been in time confounded, the terrible power of the one with
  the name of the other.
      It has been too much the custom, whenever any large bones
 have been found in Europe, to call them all elephants' bones;
 and in America, to think them all belonging to the mam
 moth : but from the progress now made in this inquiry there
 is reason to hope for additional light on this interesting sub
ject, whether it be considered as a foundation to theological
 faith, or regarded as a conspicuous monument in the history
 of the world.
 LIX.      Description  of I be Nymphæa Cærulca.           By Julius
           Cæsak Savigny, oftlx          Institute of Egypt *.
 J.T     is well known that the lotus of the antient Egyptians
was one      of the most celebrated plants of antiquity.         Rising
every year with the waters of a river whicli overflowed its
banks only to fecundate the earth ; springing up amidst plains
formerly desert, which it embellished with its beautiful flow
ers j and cultivated to serve as food to the least sensual, but
the most numerous class of the inhabitants;             it was judged
worthy of homage bv one of the first people in the world,
who considered it as the happy sign of abundance, and as
a sacred pledge of the favour of the gods.
     It is to the genus of the njmpbisa that the modern bota
nists have referred the lotus, wjiich has been described bv
most ot the antient historians, and which is engraven on all
\he antique monuments of Egypt.           Two   species  of this genus,

one with white and the other with azure flowers, still orna
ment, during the time of the inundation, the surface of the
canals and rivers, and in general of all the fields ef Lower
Egypt, which are covered bv the waters of the river. Plants
so similar were no doubt beheld by the Egyptians with equal
veneration ; and though Linnæus, who was well acquainted
with the former, gave it the name of lotus, it is to be pre
sumed that the second procured      the same advantages and
served for the same mysteries.   Its flowers have more splen
dour and a sweeter smell, and the azure colour they exhibited
might become, among a people so religious, the emblem of
the residence of the deity on the waters.
   The njmpbæa lotus is verv well described, and a good figure
is given of       in several Systems ofBotanv; but the case
                    it,                                                                        is

up  after  the  inundation  :  they are used  as food  ; they have an
insipid earthy taste,    and  form  a delicate  disti.
   1 he leaves of both are large, prettv numerous, sub-orbi
cular, divided into two lobes from their base to the place
whore the petiole is inserted; that is to fay, nearly to the
middle of the disk.      Thev are not so thick as those of our
nenuphars in Europe: they have a darker green colour, and
a shining appearance above ; and below are often tinged with
         or violet. These leaves are supported by radical cy-
simple
 indric petioles, slightly compressed and sometimes very long,
which float on the surface of the water.
   The flowers are very large, and are often more than four
inches in diameter. Their pedicles, which arise from the
root, are uuiflorons and differ very little from the petioles.
   The calyx of these flowers is composed of eight leaves dis
posed in two rows, and coloured in the inside : the more in
terior ones are the most coloured, and have some resemblance
to the petioles.
   The latter, from twelve to twenty in number, are also dis
posed   in several series.
   The stamina are of a yellow colour with large filaments,
and petaliform.
   The radii of the stigma vary, for the most part, in number
from twelve to twenty- five. Thev have the fame colour as
the stamina, are compressed and slightly bent at the summit.
   Such is the common appearance of the roots, the leaves,
and the flowe.-s.     Let us now examine the differences they
exhibit.
   The leaves of the nympbtea lotus are bordered quite round
with very acute indentations, firm and almost like prickles :
their lobes, for the most part, are exactly parallel and some
times even ; they converge, and mutually cover each other:
their inferior surface is charged with very prominent ribs,
which form a very apparent reticulation : their petioles are
rough.
   On the other hand, those of the nympbtea carulea have
their edges scarcely finuateu ; their lobes are more pointed,
and commonly divergent.          The inferior surface exhibits ribs
scarcely sensible, the principal ones of which only are some
what prominent; the rest being concave and less elevated
than the disk. The petioles of these leaves are exceedingly
rough.
   in the nymphæa lotus the leaves are always more open.
The folioles of the calyx are oval, lanceolated, greenish exter

     The folioles of the calyx in the nymphæa cærulea are much

  fide»f them is of a dark green colour, constantly varied with
  an infinite number of points and small lines of a purplish co
  lour, and have no apparent ribs.
     The petals of the nymphæa lotus are oval, lanceolated, and
  very unequal ; those of the last being much smaller than the
  rest : their colour is a pure milk-white, tinged with a greenish
 purple colour on the outside, but rarely.
     In the nymphæa cærulea the petals are lanceolated all per
 fectly equal, of a bright white colour, tinged, in particular
 towards the summit, with the most beautiful azure, inclining
 slightly however, sometimes, to violet.
     The stamina of the nympbaa lotus have antheræ very much
 compressed, lanceolated, without any appendix at the summit,
 and have scarcely the length of the filaments.
     On the other hand, the antheræ of the nympbaa carulea
 are very little compressed, lineal and longer than the fila
 ments ; their summit is terminated by a Tubulated blueifh
 appendix similar to a small petal.
     In the last place, the summits of the radii of the stigma
 are longer and subulated in the nympbaa lotus; shorter, oval,
 and lanceolated, in the nympbaa carulea.
     The smell exhaled from the flowers of each kind is also
 very different: that of the nympbaa carulea is exceedingly
 sweet and agreeable ; that of the nympbaa lotus is stronger,
 more pungent, and much less agreeable.
     Tn regard to the fruit, I did not find in them any very re
 markable difference : in both species it consists of a dry round
 berry, which is long, covered by the bases of the folioles of
 the calyx and those of the petals ; truncated and radiated at
 the summit, which is always stained by the decomposition of
 the stamina and interior petals : it is divided into several cells,
 each of which corresponds to a radius of the stigma, and con
 tains a quantity of round feeds of a rose colour.
     The Arabs have very well distinguished these plants, and
 given to each a particular name : the former they call neou-
J'ar,   and the latter bacbenin.
     By selecting from the description here given the most promi
 nent differences, both species may be characterized as follows;

         SIR,
A       considerable time has elapsed since I had the ho
nour to lay before the Society a model of the life-boat of my
invention.
    I have now enclosed a particular account of its construction
in a letter fmni Mr. Hinderwell, explaining upon what prin
ciple it is built, so as to render it superior to any other form
of a boat for the dangerous enterprises for which it was in
tended, and has been used.
                                  I am, Sir, your humble servant,
                                               Henry Greathead.

 Jan. 1, 1802.
     To  Mr.   Charles Taylor.
        SIR,
     IT  is much to he lamented, that in an age enlightened by
 science, such a languid indifference should prevail on many
 important public occasions; and that the most excellent in
 ventions should have to combat the force of inveterate preju
 dice.
     How many valuable discoveries have languished in obscu
 rity ! How many useful projects have penstied in embryo,
 deprived of the fostering aid of the public, and the patronage
 of influence and authority ! In the class of useful improve
 ments for the diminution of the dangers incident to a mari
 time profession, the life-boat, invented by Mr. Greathead, of
  Shields, has a claim to a distinguished patronage.               An ex
 perimental     conviction     of  its great utility   in saving  the  live*
 of stiipwrecked seamen, and of its perfect safety in the most
  agitated sea, has induced me lo advocate the cause with a

 *eal proportioned to its importance ; and it is a consolatory
 reflection to my own mind, that my exertions have been
 successful in the introduction of a life-boat in the port of
 Scarborough, and, I trust, not unprofitable towards pro
 moting a similar establishment in other places.       The services
 which have been recently performed at this port by means of
the life-boat, in contributing to the preservation of the lives
of the crews of two vessels, more than compensate for every
labour.     I am far from the ambition of aspiring to any ho
norary testimony on this occasion. Actuated by the purest
principle of philanthropy, my sole object is the benefit of the
community, and to endeavour, by ardent recommendations,
to excite a spirit of emulation in order to introduce the life-
boat, with its invaluable properties, into more general use.
I  am induced to submit, with the utmost deference and re
 spect, to the consideration of the Society of Arts, &c. the
following description of the life-boat, with some miscella
neous observations.      The construction of the boat, agreeably
to Mr. Greathead's plan, is as follows :
    The length is thirty feet; the breadth, ten feet; the
depth, from the top of the gunwale to the lower part of the
keel in midships, three feet three inches; from the gunwale
to the platform (within), two feet four inches ; from the top
of the stems (both ends being similar) to the horizontal line
of the bottom of the keel, five feet nine inches. The keel is
a plank of three inches thick, of a proportionate breadih in
midships, narrowing gradually toward the ends to the breadth
of the stems at the bottom, and forming a great convexity
downwards.       The stems are segments of a circle, with consi
derable rakes.      The bottom section, to the floor-heads, is a
curve fore and aft, with the sweep of the keel. The floor-
timber has a small rise curving from the keel to the floor-
heads.     A bilge-plank is wrought in on each fide next the
floor-heads with a double rabbet or groove of a similar thick
ness with the keel ; and on the outside of this are fixed two
bilge-trees, corresponding nearly with the level of the keel.
The ends of the bottom section form that fine kind of en
trance observable in the lower part of the bow of the fishing-
boat, called a colle, much used in the North.           From this
part  to the  top  of the stem  it is  more elliptical,  forming a
considerable projection.     The sides, from the floor-heads to
the top of the gunwale, flaunch off on each side, in propor
tion to about half the breadth of the floor. The breadth is
continued far forward towards the ends, leaving a sufficient
length of strait side at the top.     The sheer is regular along
the strait side, and more elevated towards the ends.           The
                                                          gunwale,

                    X)n Mr.    Greatbead's Life-Boat.              335
«unwa1e, fixed on the outside, is three inches thick.              The
tides, from the under part of the gunwale along the whole
length of the regular sheer, extending twenty-one feet fix
inches, are cased with layers of cork to the depth of sixteen
inches downward ; and the thickness of this casing of cork
 being four inches, it projects at the top a little without the
gunwale.         The cork on the outside is secured with, thin
 plates or flips of copper, and the boat is fastened with copper
 nails.      The thwarts, or feats, are five in number, double
 banked, consequently the boat may be rowed with ten* oars.
 The thwarts are firmly stanchioned. The fide oars are shorts,
 with iron tholes and rope grommets, so that the rower can
 pull either way. The boat is steered with an oar at each
 end; and the steering oar is one-third longer than the row
 ing oar. The platform placed at the bottom within the boat
 is horizontal, the length of the midships, and elevated at the
 ends for the convenience of the steersman, to give him a
 greater power with the oar.          The internal part of the boat
 next the fides, from the under part of the thwarts down to
 the platform, is cased with cork ; the whole quantity of which
 affixed to the life-boat is nearly seven hundred weight.           The
  cork indisputably contributes much to the buoyancy of the
  boat, is a good defence in going alongside a vessel, and is of
  principal use in keeping the boat in an erect position in the
 sea, or rather of giving her a very lively and quick disposition
  to recover from any sudden cant or lurch which she may re
  ceive from the stroke of a heavy wave.         But exclusive of the
  cork, the admirable construction of this boat gives it a decided
  pre-eminence. The ends being similar, the boat can be rowed,
  either way ; and this peculiarity of form alleviates her in rising
  over the waves.        The curvature of the keel and bottom faci
  litates her movement in turning, and contributes to the ease
  of the steerage, as a single stroke of the steering oar has an im
  mediate effect, the boat moving as it were upon a centre. The
  fine entrance below is of use in dividing the waves, when row
  ing against them ; and, combined with the convexity of the
  bottom and the elliptical form of the stem, admits her to rife
  with wonderful buoyancy in high sea, and to launch forward
  with rapidity, without shipping any water, when a common
  boat would be in danger of being silled.        The staunching, or
  spreading form of the boat, from the floor-heads to the gun
  wale, gives her a considerable bearing ; and the continuation
     * Five of the benches are only used, the boat being           rowed
                                                         generally
   with  ten oars.
      f The short oar is more manageable in a high sea than the long car,
   and it, stroke is more certain.
                                                                       Of

of   the breadth, well forward, is a great support to her in the
sea ; and    it has been found by experience, that boats of this
construction are the best sea-boats for rowing against turbu
lent waves.       The internal (hallowness of the boat from the
gunwale down to the platform, the convexity of the form,
and the bulk of cork within, leave a very diminished space
for the water to occupv ; so that the life-boat when silled with
water contains a considerable less quantity than the common
boat, and is in no danger either of finking or overturning.
It may be presumed by some, that in cases of high wind,
agitated sea, and broken waves, that a boat of such a bulk
could not prevail against them by the force of the oars ; but
the life-boat, from her peculiar form, may be rowed a-head
when the attempt in other boats would fail. Boats of the
common form, adapted for speed, are of course put in mo
tion with a small power, but for want of buoyancy and bear
ing are overrun by the waves and funk, when impelled
against them ; and boats constructed          for burden meet with
too much resistance from the wind and sea when opposed to
them, and cannot in such cases be rowed from the shore to a
fliip in distress. An idea has been entertained, that the su
perior advantages of the life-boat are to be ascribed solely to
the quantity of cork affixed.          But this is a very erroneous
opinion ; and,      I  trust, has been   amply refuted by the pre
ceding   observations     on  the supereminent construction of this
boat.     It  must    be  admitted,  that the application of cork to
common boats would add to their buoyancy and security ;
and it might be a useful expedient, if there were a quantity
of cork on board of ships, to prepare the boats with in cafes
of shipwreck, as it might be expeditiously done, in a tempo
rary way, by means of clamps, or some other contrivance.
The application of cork to some of the boats of his majesty's
(hips* might be worthy of consideration ; more particularly
as an experiment might be made at a little expense, and
¦without    inconvenience to the boats; or may prevent plea
sure boats from upsetting or sinking.
    The life-boat is kept in a boat-house, and placed upon four
low wheels, ready to be moved at a moment's notice. These
wheels are convenient in conveying the boat along the stiore
to the sea ; but if she had to travel upon them on a rough
road, her frame would be exceedingly fliaken.             Besides, it
has been found difficult and troublesome to replace her
upon these wheels on her return from sea.               Another plan
has therefore been adopted.           Two wheels, of nine feet dia-

                                                              meter,

                  OA   Mr.    Greatbiad's   Lift-Boat.               335
meter, with a moveable arched axis, and a pole fixed thereto
for a lever, have been constructed. The boat is suspended
near her centre between the wheels under the axis, toward
each extremity of which is an iron pin with a chain attached.
When the pole is elevated perpendicularly, the upper part of
the axis becomes depressed, and the chains being hooked to
eye-bolts on the inside of the boat, (he is raised with the ut
most facility by means of the pole, which is then fastened
down to the stem of the boat.
    The Scarborough boat is under the direction of a commit
tee.     Twenty-four fishermen, composing two crews *, are
alternately employed to navigate her. A reward, in cafes of
shipwreck, is paid by the committee to each man actually
engaged in the assistance ; and it is expected that the vessel
receiving assistance mould contribute to defray this expense.
None have hitherto refused.
    It is of importance that the command of the boat should
be intrusted to some steady, experienced person, who is ac
quainted with the direction of the tides or currents, as much
skill may be required in rising them to the most advantage in
going to a ship in distress.        It should also be recommended,
to keep the head of the boat to the sea as much as circum
 stances will admit; and to give her an accelerated velocity
 to meet the wave.        Much caution is necessary in approach
 ing a wreck, on account of the strong reflux of the waves,
 which is sometimes attended with great danger. In a ge
 neral way, it is safest to go on the Ice quarter ; but this de-
 pends upon the position of the vessel ; and the master of the
 boat should exercise his skill in placing her in the most con
 venient situation. The boatmen should practise themselves
 in the nse of the boat, that they may be the better acquainted
 with her movements ; and they should at all times be strictly
 obedient to the directions of the person who is appointed
 to the command.
    The great ingenuity which has been displayed in the con
 struction of the life-boat, leave* scarcely any room for im
 provement; but some have supposed that a boat of twenty-
 five feet in length, with' a proportionate breadth, would an
 swer every purpose of a larger one.          A boat of these dimen
 sions would certainly be lighter, and less expensive; but whe
 ther (lie would be equally fife and steady in a high sea I
 cannot take upon myself to determine.

   Sea, and vice versa, as pracTifed at Lowejiojfe, in Suffolk.
   The life-boat may be launched from any beach, when
wanted, with as much ease as any other boat, by proper as
sistance.   The distance from the boat-house at Lowestoffe lo
the sliore is one hundred yards, and the boat's crew can run
her down in ten minutes.      When the sea does not tumble in
upon the beach very much, the boat may be easily launched
by laving the ways as far as possible in the water> and haul
ing trie carriage from under her.
    When there is a great sea on the beach, the boat must be
launched from the carriage before she comes to the surf, on
planks laid across, as other boats are launched; the people
standing on the ends to prevent the sea moving them ; then,
with the assistance of the anchor and cable (which fliould be
laid out at sea for the purpose), the boat's crew can draw her
over the highest sea.
    Upon the boat returning to the stiore, two double blocks
are provided; and, having a stiort strop fixed in the hole, in
the end of the boat next the sea, the boat is easily drawn upon
the carriage.    The boat's crew can run her-any distance upon
a clear fliore by the carriage of Mr. Greathead's contrivance.

a strong reflux of sea, occasioned                by
                                               the stranded wrecks,
which requires both dispatch and care in the people em
ployed, that the boat be not damaged.            When the wreck                       is
reached,  if  the  wind  blows   to   the  land, the boat will come
in stiore without  any  other  effort   than steering.
 I   would strongly recommend practising the boat,               which  by
means,    with  experience,  the  danger     will appear   less,  from
the confidence people will have in her from repeated trials.

     This department  in the fame situation as the preceding
                           is
in regard to the want of coal mines.                   It
                                           might be supplied

of that name, which         is
                       navigable for boats only to Argentan,
were rendered navigable higher up.
     If
      the navigation of the Cher were improved,     might also    it
supply  with coals the eastern part of the department or Indre,
because the coal mines in the environs of Montlucon would
then become'-an object of importance.

                Department    of Indre and Ijoire.
    There are no coal mines in this department ; but it re
 ceives the products of the mines of various departments by
 the river Loire, which traverses it in its longest direction.
                        Department  of Isere.
    The  southern part of this department (22) contains some
 coal  mines; and particularly in the environs of the com
 munes of La Motte, Pierre-Chatfil,        La Mure, Saint-Bar-
 thelemi-de-Sechilienne,     &c.
    They supply a mineral combustible of a moderate quality;
 but is exceedingly valuable in a country where wood is daily
 becoming scarcer.
    These coal mines are almost all worked in an irregular
 manner, without attention to the lives of the workmen or to
 economy.
    The annual product of these mines may be estimated at
from a million to twelve hundred myriagrammes.
    The price at the mines is from 15 to 20 cents per myria-
gramme; but the difficulty of land-carriage raises the price
 at Grenoble to from 60 to 80 cents.
                        Department  of Jura.
    Several indications of coals have been announced in this
department; and some attempts were made to work mines,
which gave rife to well-sounded hopes : but these attempts
are now abandoned, and no mines are worked in this depart
 ment.
    In the present state of things, the mines of Blanzy and
Saint-Bcrain, in the department of Sa6ne and Loire, furnifli
coals to this department by the canal of Charolois and Doubt.
The southern part is supplied from the mines of Kives-de-
 Gier.
                       Department of Landes.
   Indications of coal have been announced in the neigh
bourhood of Dax ; but from the nature of the soil it is pro
bable that it is fossil wood.    As this department has no coal
mines worked, it is supplied with this fuel by sea, and par
ticularly from the port of Bayonne.
                 Department of Loire and Cher.
   This department (23) has no coal mines. It receives this
fuel by the river Loire from the mines of Haute-Loire and
Allier.

34°
                       jt general  Jsietv of the
                    Department    of Haute-Loire.
     Very abundant coal mines are worked in the cantons of
Braflac-Sainte-Florine, Freugeres, Vergongheon, and Lemp-
des, the product of which is considerable.           That of Grof-
menil, situated in the last-mentioned commune, which had
been perforated by a number of small pits in such a manner
that the strata of coal was inundated, is now in the hands of
a company,       who are clearing it of water, and making pre
parations    for working it to a greater depth.
     There is reason to think, that this mine alone, when in a
 productive state, will furnish as much as all the other mines
 of the country do at present. The annual product, however*
of the latter is from fifteen to eighteen hundred thousand
myriagrammes.          These coals are of an excellent quality.
The means of their conveyance are the navigation of the
 Allier and the Loire, the canal of Briare and of the Seine;
 which gives for their circulation an extent of more than 140
 leagues.     A large quantity of these coals is consumed at
 Paris. The mean price of them at the pits is from 15 to 20
 cents, and when delivered at Paris from 30 to 40 cents per
 tnyriagramme.
                       Department of     La Loire.
     The south-east part of this department (24) contains a
 great number of coal mines, worked in an extent of more
  than ten miles in length and five or six miles in breadth.
  The principal communes in which these mines are situated
  are those  01  Rives-de-Gier, Saint-Chamond, Sainl-Etienne,
  Le Chambon,       Firnini, Roche-Moliere, &c.
      In consequence of the number and richness of the strata
  found in these cantons, an immense quantity of this fuel has
  been extracted    for several centuries past ; but in order to ob
  tain it sooner, and with more ease, a great many pits have
   been funk, by means of which the coals nearest the surface
  were dug out. The whole country is perforated with these
   apertures. This irregular method rendered the working of
   the inferior strata much more laborious and expensive.
      The present product of the different mines in this depart
   ment are staled at thirty millions of myriagrammes annually;
   and this, in all probability, is below the truth.    If the mines
   were better worked, it is certain that the quantity might be
   quadrupled.
      The quality and price of these coals is exceedingly various.
   Those of the first quality cost at the mine from 10 to 12 cents
                                                                  per

                  Coal Mines untried in France.              341
per myriagramme ; those of mean quality are sold for 7 or 8
cents, and the worst for 5.
    The medium price of these coals transported to Lyons is
15 or 18 cents per myriagramme:        the price at Marseilles is
35   cents.
                Department of   La Loire lnferieure.
    This department (25), as has been seen, may receive coals
from the mines situated towards the upper part of the ¦course
of the Loire as well as from those of Allier. The coals of
the mine of Decise, which will be mentioned in speaking of
the department of La Nievre, are also conveyed to different
  laces on the Loire. The coals also of the mines of Montre-
Iais, situated two or three leagues to the north of Varades and
Ingrande, are conveyed on the lower part of the Loire. They
are embarked in particular at the latter place to be trans
ported to the communes on the banks of that river descend
ing to Nantes, where the consumption is considerable.
     she coals annually extracted from these mines may be safely
estimated at a million of myriagrammes. They are of a good
quality.    The mean price on the spot is 5 cents per myria
gramme; when sent to Nantes, the fame quantity colts 25
cents.
    In this department   there are also peat-mosses, the product
of which    is abundant, and of great utility to the inhabitants.
1 he most considerable are found in the marsties of M< n oir<-,
to the north of Nantes.        More than eight thousand indivi
duals are employed in digging peat from these mosses.
                  Department of Loire and Cher.
    There are no mines worked in this department. It receives
coals by the Loire, which traverses it; and might consume
those also brought by the Cher from the mines situated in
the environs ot Commentry and Montlucon, in the depart
ment of AHier, if the navigation of the Cher were improved.
                       Department of Loiret.
    There are no coal mines worked in this department; but
it is abundantly provided with coals by the navigation of the
Seine.
                        Department of Lot.
    Abundant coal mines exist in the environs of Figeac, to
wards the east extremity of this department. They are badly
worked by the proprietors of the ground ; but thev are sus
ceptible of improvement, if means of consumption were
opened for their products.

     No   coal mines are worked in this department.     Those ex
 tracted    from the mines of Carmeaux, in the department of
 Tarn, are brought to it on the Garonne; and it receives by
 the Lot those of the department of that name, which would
 be supplied     much cheaper if the Lot were rendered navigable
 towards Figeac and the department of Aveyron.
                       Department   of La Lozere.
     The discovery of some strata of coal in this country would
 be of great utility.      Wood daily becomes scarcer ; and the
 communication with the coal countries in the neighbouring
 departments is difficult and expensive.
     Several indications of coal have been announced ; parti
 cularly towards Canourgue, towards Mende, and in the
 neighbourhood of Meyrmey.           Some specimens sent to the
 Council of Mines announce only fossil wood.
                           Department of Lys.
     This department has no coal mines worked. It receives
those of the departments of the North and of Jemappes.
                       Department of La JMancbe.
     There are several indications of coal in this department;
 and particularly in the Forest of Briquebec, near Valongesj
 in the commune of Plessis, near Fretot ; in that of Moon, and
 Jhat of Semilly, in thedilirict of Saint-L6.
     Strata of coal have been found in the commune of Plessi ;
 but hitherto they are so intermixed with strata of schist, that
 if worked they would not pay the expenses.
                       Department   of La Marne.
     This department, as far as is yet known, has no coal
mini-s.       Collections of fossil wood, and of ptat exceedingly
 pvritous, are frequently found under strata of marly earth.
 These substances have often been announced as coal, but
 they do not possess the qualities of that fuel. Thev kindle
 flowly, and become totally incandescent; but they give very
 little flame, and for the most part none at all. This sub
 stance is called by the inhabitants earth coal.
     The Valley of La Vefle fu missies abundance of peat of an
excellent quality.       This river, which takes its source on the
east of Chalons, passes Rheims and Brainc, and discharges it-

      There are no coal mines worked in this department. Se
  veral indications of coal have been announced, but hitherto
  the specimens have turned out to be bituminous fossil wood.
  This department is at a distance from coal countries, and has
  on easy communication with them ; but it is abundant in
  wood.
                    Department    of La Mayenne.
     This department is supplied with coals by the Loire. Boats
  can go up the Mayenne as far as Laval ; and the Sarthe as
  far as Mons.
                 Department   of Mayenne and Loire.
     There are several small coal pits worked in the canton (26)
 of Saint- Aubin-de-Luigne, in       the territories of Chaudefond;
 Montjean, and several other         places adjacent.       They are
 worked very irregularly, and the product of them is not
 known.
     The mine of Saint-George's-Chateloison,        situated between
 Vihiers and Doue, to the east of the latter commune, is more
 important and worked in a more regular manner.             The pro
 duct amounts to about 300,000 myriagrammes per annum;
 but it m;ghi be rendered more considerable.

                      Department of the Meufe.
     No coal    mines  are worked in this department (27).         It
can receive coals from La Saare by the Moselle, and the ca
nal which communicates with the Meufe between Toul and
Pagny : and the coals of the department of Ourthe may be
conveyed on the Meufe to its northern part.
                Department of La Meufe Inferienre.
    This department possesses very important coal mines in the
neighbourhood of Kolduc.           The annual product of them
amounts to more than 13.500,000 myriagrammes; and they
are tar from being properly worked.
    The coals are of different qualities; some of them are very
good. Their mean price at the mine varies from 5 tP 14 cents

   There arc several coal mines in this country (28).         Some
are worked in the territory of the communes of Entrevernes
near Annecy, Montmin, Novalaise", Servolex, and Petit-
Bernard.      Indications of coal have been announced also in
the canton of Moutiers, Cruseilles, Valloires, and Cocnin.
The annual product of the coal mines worked in this depart
ment may be estimated at 120,000 myriagrammes per an-
num. These mines are susceptible of improvement, but there
is no consumption.        The price of the coals al the mine is
5  cents  per myriagramme.
                   Department of Mont-Tonnere.
   There are more than thirty cpal mines known in this de
partment (29). Several of them have been abandoned in
consequence     os the war. The cantons molt abundant are
those of Lautereck, Woltstcin, and Obermoschel.
   The product of these mines may be estimated at about
425,000 myriagrammes; but if the consumption required,
it could be increased. The quality of the coal varies. There
is very little of it good; but it is generally used for heating
stoves.   1 he price at the mines is 8 cents per myriagramme.
   These coals are consumed merely by the wants of the coun
try.    A considerable quantity of them is employed for burn
ing lime, either for building or for manure. They are em
ployed also in the fusing of mercury, os which there is very
important mines in this department ; and for the purposes
of evaporation in the salt-works of Kreutznach.
                      Department of Morbiban.
    The Morbihan has no coals. It receives those which are
 dug up on the banks of the Lone, or of the rivers united
 with it.
                     Department    of La Moselle.
    Some coal mines are worked in this department (30) in
 the environs of the communes of Ostenbach and in the can
 ton of Petelange. The annual product of them may be esti
 mated at 100, 00 myriagrammes at least.            The coal is of a
 very good qualify.      It costs at the mine   9

                      Department of the North.
    Very important coal mines are worked at Anzin near Va
lenciennes, at Fresncs, Raismes, and Vieux-Conde. There
 is a very considerable one also in the commune of Aniche.
    The different mines worked in this department furnish at
the least 30,000,000 of myriagrammes.          They are of various
qualities.     Some of them are very good for forging iron j
 others are preferable for stoves; and some of an interior qua
lity are proper for burning lime. The price at the mines
 differs according to the quality.       The mean price of good
 coal is from 12 to 15 cents per myriagramme.           When de
livered at the ports of Ostend, Dunkirk, and Calais, it costs
from 25 to 28, and at Havre from 52 to 55.
     The means of consumption for these coals, and particu
larly for those near Conde and Saini-Amand, are very ex
 tensive towards the north, on account of the navigation of
 the Scheldt, and of the numerous canals which communicate
 with that river. So that the products of these mines might
 be conveyed at very little expense as far as Ghent, Bruges,
 Ostend, Termonde, and Antwerp. They might also be cir
 culated in Holland, and be exported by the ports of Ostend
 and   Dunkirk,   so as to become   as  important an object of ma
 ritime commerce      as the English   coals.
                     Department of    La Nievre.
     Coal mines are worked in the canton of Decife (32), and
  are very productive.      The annual product is ellimated at
  1,000, 00 of myriagrammes, but mav be much increased.
  The quality of these coals is in general such that they must
  be speedily employed after they are dug up, as they lose con
  siderably by long exposure to the air. The price at the mine
  is from 8 to jo cents per myriagramme; and delivered at
  Paris from 10 to 13. They are conveyed on the Loire, the
  canal  of Briarc, the Seine, &c.

3LXTT.    Memoir on the Stones said to have fallen from the
      Heavens.  Read in the French National Injiitute by
      C. Vauouelin *.
    VV H I L E all Europe resounded with the report of stones
  fallen from the heavens, and while philosophers, divided in
 opinion on this subject, were forming hypotheses to explnin
 jthe origin of them, each according to his own manner, Mr.
 Idward Howard, an able English chemist, was pursuing in
 lilence the only route which could lead to a solution of the
 problem.       He collected specimens of stones which had fallen
 at different times, procured as much information as possible
 refpeiting them, compared the physical or exterior charac
 ters of these bodies; and even did more, in subjecting them
 to chemical analysis by means as ingenious as exact.
     It results from his research's, that the stones which fell in
 England, in Italy, in Germany, in the East Indies, and in
 oiher places, have all such a perfect resemblance that it is
 almost impossible to distinguish them from each other; and
 what renders the similitude more perfect and more striking
is,   that they are composed of the same principles and nearly
in the lame proportions.
     Before the last results of the labour of Mr. Howard were
known          France,
               in         1 had employed myself on the same ob
ject and

 has been since printed, that they perfectly agree with those
 which    I had obtained.

correct account was     given of it at that time in the abbe Ber-
tholon's Journal a" Hijtoire Naturelle, together with the pro*
ces-verbal of the municipality of the place, which confirmed
the fall of this stone.
   Another stone was given to me by M. Darcet junior: it
fell at Barbotan, near Roquefort, in the month of July 17^9.
The brother of the late Darcet, cure in the neighbourhood,
sent it to him,    with the proces-verbal drawn up respecting
this extraordinary phænomenon.            C  Lomet, who is known
to several members of the Institute, was at Agen on the day
when this kind of meteor appeared in the atmosphere.             The
following   is the account  which   he   gave  me of it :
    " It appeared as a very bright fire-ball, the light of which
was as pure as that of the fun ; it had the size of a common
air-balloon, and was long enough visible to throw the inha
bitants of the country into the greatest consternation; after
which it burst, and disappeared:        A few days after, some pea
sants brought stones, which they said were the result of the
fall of the meteor : but at thit period they were laughed at.
What they said was considered as fables ; and those to whom
the stones were offered, would not accept of them. The pea
 sants would have now more reason to laugh at philosophers."
    The third kind of these stones is that brought from Be
 nares in the East Indies, which fell on the 19th of Decem
 ber 1798, exhibiting the very fame phænomena as were ob
 served under similar circumstances in other countries.             It
 was given to me by C. De Dree and by C. Saint-Amans,
 who brought it from England.
    All thele stones have a similar appearance, and one might
 readily believe that they had been detached from the fame
 mass.     Their surface is blackish, smooth, and, as it were,
 varnished by a commencement of fusion.            The inside is of a
 whiiifh gray colour marked with a greater or less number of
 brown spots, or spots of a darker gray colour than the rest of
 the mass.     Those, however, found at Benares, and in York
 shire, are whiter in the interior part than thole found in
 France.     There are observed in them white p\ rite*, the frac
 ture of which is very much lamellated ; globules of metallic
 and ductile iron, some of which weigh 46 English grains;
 but this iron has a whiter colour, and a ereater decree of
 hardness than common iron.           The cause of this difference
  will be seen hereafter.
    I  wished to have been able to subject to a separate anavlsis
 each of the constituent principles of these stones sensible to
 the eye : but they are so intimately mixed, that it was im
 possible to' separate them exactly.         By patience, however,
                                                                I  wai

 348              Memoir on the Stones    said   to
  I was able to obtain a sufficient quantity of the globules of
  iron and of pyrites to ascertain the nature of them.
     A. A hundred parts of the stones of Benares, pulverized
  in a mortar of hard stone, and lifted through a fine silk sieve
  to separate the coarsest particles of the iron which cannot be
  pulverised, were treated with dilute nitric acid.            During
  this operation there was diseiiEfaged a large quantity of nitrous
  gas; the acid assumed a ycTlowifli green colour; the stony
 powder became whitish, and, dividing itself, increased con
  siderably in volume, so that it resembled gelatinous filex.
 Sulphureous particles were observed floating at the surface of
  the liquor.
     B. When the action of the nitric acid ceased, water was,
  added to the mixture ; the liquor being filtered, the undis-
 solved matter was washed, and after desiccation in the open
 air it weighed no more than 64 parts.
     C. As the matter treated in this manner was still slightly
  coloured, it was boiled with muriatic acid, which, as is well
 known, unites more easily with oxidated iron : it assumed
 alto a greenish yellow colour, and the powder became much
 whiter.    After this second operation the stone, when washed
 and calcined in a platina crucible, weighed only 47 parts.
     D. The nitric and muriatic acids which had been succes
 sively poured over the stone as above mentioned were mixed
 together and then precipitated by ammonia, of which an ex
 cess was added.     Being heated for some time, the liquor was
 filtered; and the precipitate was washed and calcined: it had
 a brown colour, and weighed 38 parts.
     E. The ammoniacal liquor had a flight blue colour in
 clining to violet. Alkaline carbonates produced in it no pre
 cipitate ; on the other hand, caustic alkalies formed a white
precipitate very abundant, but the liquor lost none of its vio
let colour.    This precipitate, when washed and dried in the
air, had a greenish shade, and weighed lH parts ; calcination
reduced it to 13.     This matter readily combined with sul
phuric acid, and the result was a solution, which by sponta
neous evaporation produced prismatic crystals resembling in
taste and savour those os the sulphate of magnesia.          It how
ever had a flight greenish colour,    and  at  the end  of some   mi
nutes produced in the mouth a         metallic   favour.   To   know
whether the colour and savour of the sulphate of magnesia
arose from some metallic substances it was dissolved in water,
and hydrosulphuret of ammonia being poured over         it,
                                                          a    pretty
voluminous black precipitate was produced. After washing
and desiccation, however,     it  weighed only two parts. We
shall return hereafter to this matter.
                                                              F. The

  F. The ammoniacal liquor, from which                 the magnesia had
been separated by means           of   caustic potash, was mixed with a
solution of sulphurated hydrogen.   By this mixture there was
formed a very voluminous black precipitate, which when
washed and dried weighed seven parts.        This part being
united with the three parts obtained also by sulphate or
magnesia, and kept at a red heat for some minutes, exhaled
the odour of sulphureous acid, and acquired a very dark green
Colour inclining to brown : the whole then weighed scarcely
three parts.
   A small quantity     of this matter   fused with borax gave glass
of a hyacinth colour;        put  into sulphuric acid diluted with
water, it dissolved only in part, and a small quantity which,
had a metallic appearance refused to combine with it; but
the addition of a few drops of nitric acid, by oxidating                            it,
favoured its solution   :    byspontaneous evaporation       furnished  it
elongated crystals of very beautiful green colour.

 its combination with acids and ammonia triple salts which
 are not precipitated       by
                             fixed alkalies.
     An examination of the principles successively obtained by
 the different means employed for analysing the stone of Be
 nares, proves that  it     composed of silex, magnesia, and iron,
                            is
a    part of which appears to be oxidated, nickel and sulphur.
  Iron, nickel, and sulphur, according to every appearance,
  form  a  particular triple combination, which seems only to be
  interposed between the earthy parts.             am, however, in
                                                      I

  really in combination with the earths           for at the moment

350               Memoir on the Stones said to
    If we   might suppose that the iron contained in this stone
exists in the perfect metallic state, we might easily find, by
the increase of weight which it acquires in consequence of
oxygenation, the proportion of sulphur ; but as it is certain
that this metal is oxidated in it in an unknown quantity, that
of the sulphur cannot be determined.
    A hundred parts of this stone, freed as far as could possibly
be done from ferruginous matters, were treated with muri
atic acid diluted with a little water. The mixture produced
immediately, with a strong effervescence, a gas which had
the odour of sulphurated hydrogen gas. The matter assumed
the form of a gelatinous mass, which seems to prove, as al
ready said, that the filex exists in this stone in a state of com
bination either with iron or with other substances.
    When the effervescence had subsided, and the mixture had
boiled for some time, it was diluted with water and filtered.
The liquor had a green colour analogous to that of muriate
of iron, but a little darker. The residuum when washed was
white, and weighed 49 parts.
    The muriatic solution and washings being united together
were precipitated by ammonia added in excess, and were
stirred for some time with the precipitate.
    It has been remarked, that oxidated iron, precipitated in
this manner by ammonia, has a more intense colour than
that of iron obtained under the same circumstances.           This
iron, washed and dried, weighed 42 parts.
    The liquor containing the superabundant ammonia in the
precipitation of the iron had acquired a violet colour, which
neither the heat nor the contact of the air made it lose. Al
kaline carbonates produced in it no alteration; on the other
hand, fixed caustic akalies formed in it a white precipitate
pretty abundant, which when washed and calcined weighed
twelve parts. This matter combined with sulphuric acid
gave sulphate of magnesia, coloured green by a small quan
tity of nickel which the magnesia had carried down with it.
    The liquor from which this earth had been separated by
potash had lost a part of its violet colour;     it, however, still
formed    a black precipitate with sulphurated hydrogen. From
what  I   had before observed,   I entertained   no doubt that the
substance which coloured the magnesia green, and was pre
cipitated black  by  hodro-sulphuret of ammonia, was nickel.
I  therefore separated, by  means of this reagent, the portion
which remained in solution and that which was mixed with
the sulphate of magnesia     I
                             :    united them, and having cal
cined them to separate the sulphur,      I obtaineda  green oxide,
which weighed three parts and        ahalf.
                                                              The

                  have fallen from the Heavens.               351
    The method employed to separate the      iron and  the mag
nesia is founded on this circumstance, that a solution of that
earth containing an excess of acid is not precipitated by am
monia, because there is formed a triple salt, which cannot be
decomposed bv a superabundance of that alkali ; but the acid
must be in such quantity that the salt resulting from its com
bination with the ammonia may be able to saturate the salt
os magnesia existing in the liquor. Care was taken to observe
this
    Alkaline carbonates produce no precipitation of      the sub
stances which enter into combination with the triple salt here
mentioned, though it must, however, be decomposed; but
there is formed another kind, composed of magnesia, car
bonic acid, and ammonia, which remains in solution.           But
one thing I did not foresee was the simultaneous precipita
tion of a portion of nickel and magnesia by the caustic pot
ash ; for, as Mr. Howard remarked, this metal is found there
in complex combination, the oxide of which ought to be
dissolved by the ammonia in proportion as it becomes free:
the precipitation of this metal must be produced by its affi
nity for magnesia, at least this is what appears most probable.
     After thele two analyses of the stone of Benares, and the
 conformity of the results which they furnished, though ef
 fected by methods somewhat different,- there can be no doubt
 that it is really composed of iron, filex, magnesia, nickel, and
 sulphur, as Mr. Howard announced.
     Having therefore confirmed by these two means, and by
 others, which it is needless to mention, the results given by
 the Knglish chemist in regard to the composition of the stone
 of Benares, I subjected to similar experiments two other kinds
 of stone which fell in France, in order to ascertain whether
 they would furnish the same principles of analysis as their
 external characters seemed to announce.
     To avoid a repetition of the details already given of the
 analytical methods employed, I {hall only observe, that the
 stones which fell at Barbotan and Juliac, treated with sul
 phuric, nitric, muriatic, &c. acids, exhibited in the series of
 operations to which they were subjected, and by the nature
 os the elements which they furnished, the most perfect simi
 larity to the preceding.      It may therefore be considered as
 fully proved, that the stones said to have fallen from the
 clouds in different countries are composed of principles per
 fectly similar, and consequently    that we must have recourse
  to a common cause to explain their formation, and- to sup
  pose also a common source from which nature derived the
  elements of them.      I must, however, acknowledge, that the
                                                        specimens

 352                Memoir on  the Stones said to
  specimens    of the stones which have fallen in France are a
  little more  charged with iron than those of other countries;
 but as this metal exists in them, for the most part, in distinct
 globules which cannot be pulverized, thev could have no in
 fluence on the results of the analysis, as the earthy part was
 fisted through a fine sieve.
     All the stones which have fallen to the earth, and particu
 larly in France, contain, as I have already mentioned several
 times, globules of iron in a metallic staie more or less di
 stinct, some of which weigh from forty to sixty English grains.
 It appeared to me of importance to subject this iron to some
 analytical trials in order to ascertain the nature of their con
 stituent principles; but before I give the results it may be of
utility that I should first give an account of their physical
characters.      These globules are much whiter than common
 iron ; their colour approaches that of tin ; their hardness is
 also greater, and consequently they are more difficult to be
forged.
     This metaT dissolves easily, and with effervescence, in all
those acids which dissolve common iron ; but instead of giving
         hydrogen gas, it furnishes hydrogen gas very sensibly
fture
   ulphurated.    A part only of this hydrogen gas, indeed, is
combined with the sulphur; for, having made it to pass
through water and caustic alkalies, the greater part of this
fluid was not dissolved ; and after having made the different
liquids here mentioned lo pass in the fame manner, no sen
sible signs of sulphur were given by reagents ; but the water
and the alkalies were manifestly hydro- (ulphurated, since they
then precipitated black the greater part of metallic solutions,
and particularly lead.     This sulphurated hydrogen gas exhi
bited to me a phænomenon which, as far as I know, has
never been before observed in its combination with water—
I mean a very speedy decomposition which it experienced in
a flask perfectly closed iq which it had been preserved for
some days.      At the end of that time there were al the bot
tom of the water a great many small white laminae, and the
water had no odour: it no longer precipitated solutions of
lead. This gas then had experienced complete decomposi
tion.
     The solution of this iron in muriatic acid was precipitated
by ammonia, of which a superabundance           was added.   The
liquor when filtered had a colour inclining to purple ; the
oxide of iron, when washed and calcined, was of a brown
colour, -and had sensibly increased in weight.       The ammo-
niacal liquor when subjected to evaporation deposited slight
traces of iron, but at long as there was ammonia m excess
                                                               it

                 have  fallen from   the Heavens.              353
U retained its blue colour, which,      as soon as this free alkali
was evaporated,    was changed to a meadow green.          The li
quor 'constantly preserved this colour, which still acquired
greater intensity until complete       evaporation, and without
forming any deposit, which proves that nickel existed in the
combination in the state of a triple salt.
   Fixed caustic alkalies occasion no precipitation in this li
quor; but they make it resume its blue colour by decom
posing the muriate of ammonia and laying bare its base,
which then redisfolves the nickel.
   The hydro-sulphurets formed in it an abundant black de
posit; and this was the method employed for obtaining th»
nickel separate.    The hvdro-sulphuret os' this metal, calcined
in a platina crucible, left a powder of a dark meadow-green
colour, which had all the properties of oxide of nickel.
   The iron contained in the stones which have fallen from
the heavens is therefore combined with sulphur and nickel ;
whence it appears very probable that these two substances,
which always present themselves in a quantity more or less
considerable in the analysis of the whole ttones, arise from a
similar combination, which it is impossible, whatever care
may be taken, to separate exactly from the earthy parts.
   The presence of nickel and of sulphur in this iron explains
why it is whiter, harder, and less ductile than common iron.
   Though I did not ascertain very exactly the quantities of
these substances in the iron, I think I may assert that they do
not amount to more than five or six percent. In regard to the
pyrites disseminated here and there throughout these stones,
it is formed, as Mr. Howard fays, of iron, sulphur, and
a small quantity of nickel ; but I was not able to ascertain in
what proportions these three substances are united, becauie       I
had not a sufficient quantity to subject them to an exact ana
lysis.
   It  appears to result from all the information obtained, and
from testimonies    worthy of credit, 1st, That masses, tome-
times of considerable size, have fallen to the surface of the
earth : 2d, That these masses penetraied with fire move in the
atmosphere like inflamed balls, which throw light and heat,
and to a great distance: 3d, That they seem to have received
a motion parallel to the horizon, though they really describe
a curve : 4th, That they fall in a state of softness or fusion
like paste, as is attested by their varnished surface, and the
impressions formed on them by the bodies which they meet
with : 5th, That some of them have fallen in fclncland, Ger
many, Italy, France, and the East Indies         :  6tn, That all

and communicale to them so rapid and so singular a motion ?
How comes it they are always penetrated with fire? These
are questions for which at present it would be difficult to as
sign plausible reasons.
    But whatever these causes may be, if multiple they must
be of the fame nature, since all the stones which have fallen
in countries so different have in every respect a resemblance
to each other.
    Do they owe their origin to volcanoes?          But where are
these volcanoes? We are not yet acquainted with them;
and stones similar to those in quellion have never been found
among the productions of any of the known volcanoes. Is
the atmosphere the medium in which they are formed ? But
how can we conceive that substances so heavy as earths and
metals could exist in sufficient quantity, and remain lone
enough suspended in a fluid so light as air?         If we suppose
that these bodies existed in the atmosphere, whence did they
originally come, and what means were so powerful as to
 unite them, and to form of them masses so heavy and so vo
 luminous?
     The opinion which makes them come from the moon,
 however extraordinary it may appear, is, perhaps, the least
 improbable; and it it be true, that no direct proofs can be
 given of this opinion, it is equally certain that no well-
 lounded reasoning can be opposed to it.
     The most prudent course to be pursued in this state of
 things is freely to acknowledge, that we are entirely unac
 quainted with the origin of these stones, and of the causes
 which produced them.
 LXIII.     Conjeflures on the Stones which have fallen from
         the Atmosphere.    By  Eusf.bius Salvf.kte        *.
    I HE antients never entertained any doubt in regard to
  what they observed.    As the natural sciences among them
  were only collections of facts, no theory compelled them to
  contradict their observations.      We accuse them of often
  having seen without examining; but though we examine
  better ourselves, we are often obliged to abjure our scepti
  cism, and at length to see what the antients law before us.

   Among the phænomena to which thi* reflection may be
applied, there is none more remarkable than the fall of stones,
produced, according to the antients, by thunder.               This is
what they called thunder-bolts, an expression long ago ba
nished to the domains of poetry, and which it would appear
ought to acquire a place in the language of philosophy.
   The antient historians all make frequent mention of the
production of these stones.        No doubt was entertained re
specting them in the middle ages; but the difficulty of ac
counting for them induced us not only to suspend our belief
until called forth by more regular observation, which was
Very prudent, but also, which was less reasonable, to carry
with us in this research a predetermination to see nothing, or
to deny what we had seen.
   Notwithstanding this disposition, instances have been so
multiplied before our eyes, and in so uniform a manner, that
it becomes difficult not to admit the general fact, whatever
opinion may be adopted in regard lo the cause.             Stone? ab
solutely foreign    to  the  soil  where   they  were found, and all
having    the  greatest  resemblance     to  each  other, have been
collected, in Portugal in 1796, in Alsace in              , in York
shire in 1796, at~Sienna in 1794, at Benares in 1798, in
Bohemia in 1753, near Paris in 1768.              Several have been
found still warm ; and uniform tradition states, that they
 were seen to fall from the atmosphere in the time os light
ning, and particularly during the bursting of luminous me
 teors, the production of which often accompanies storms.
The papers of Mr. Howard and of Count Bournon contain
 very satisfactory details in regard to every thing observed in
 regard to the nature and fall os these stones.
    The Journal de Pbjjique, Brumaire, an xi, contains a
 memoir of C. Patrin, who, denying the celestial origin of
 these stones, supposes that they have only been uncovered
 and forced from the earlh by the contact of thunder.              But
 before this hypothesis can be established, would it not be ne
 cessary that in the places where these stones have been found,
 and in others, similar ones mould have been previously dis
 covered at the'.depth of a foot, or of some inches below the
 surface ? For wrW should they show themselves at the surface
 of the earth only\fter thunder ? Why should they constantly
 escape the plough\nd the spade of the farmer, the pick- axe
 of the ditcher, and the researches of the mineralogist ?
    To admit that these stones have been thrown up into the
 atmosphere by volcanoes, seems to be attended with the fame
 difficulty; for all those analysed by Vanquelin contain a large
 proportion of iron and nickel, in the native state, mixed with
                                  A a %                      magnesia.

magnesia.     But nothing is more rare in the volcanic pro
ductions, with which we are acquainted, than magnesia, if we
except iron allayed with the nickel in the native state.       Be
sides these stones have been collected at such a distance from
all volcanoes, that the power which could so long support
and convey through the air such enormous -masses, would
be still more inexplicable than their spontaneous produc
tion.
    Chemists have proved, 1st, That these stones, collected in
places and at times distant from each other, have a resem
blance in regard to the substances of which they are com
posed, and differ only by the proportions of their elements :
2d, That they differ from all the other mineralogical com
pounds found at the surface of the globe.          It is natural,
therefore, to assign to them all an origin of the fame kind,
and very different from that by which the minerals hitherto
observed have been produced.
   Struck with these singular characters, C. Delaplace and
Biot mentioned, during the discussion which took place in
the National Institute in consequence of Vauquelin's analy
sis, a very bold opinion, but which is rendered probable by
the celebrity and character of its authors.         According to
them, these stones may be the product of a volcanic eruption
in the moon. Comparing the mass and density of the moon
with that of the earth, and calculating the distance between
our planet and its satellite, they have established that a vol
canic eruption might project a body to such a distance from
the moon as to be within the sphere of the earth's attraction.
It is besides proved, by astronomical observation, that the at
mosphere os the moon is exceedingly rare, and consequently
could oppose very little resistance to the elevation of stones
projected from the moon.        To this may be added, that a*
the moon has scarcely any atmosphere,          this circumstance
may    serve  to  explain  whv  the  metals  contained   in theie
stones are not in the state of oxide.
    But the fame observation which has discovered volcanoes
in the moon, sliews them in .1 state of luminous ignition, and
hitherto luminous ignition has never been known to take
plate without oxygen. All the gases absorb caloric, and
on becoming concrete, suffer it to escape.         Oxygen alone
possesses the property of absorbing light, and of emitting it
w hen it combines with bodies during combustion. It thence
IuHiavs, 1st, That metallic substances projected from the
moon ought to be oxidated, ai least in great part : 2d, That
the olscrvalions which prove the 'great tenuity or little ex
tent of the atmosphere of the moon, -ought to induce us to
                                                           believe

Relieve that the volcanoes       which burn at its surface arc in a
 state  of tranquil inflammation, maintained by a very thin
 stratum of atmospheric air, very different from that of our
volcanoes in a state of eruption ; and, consequently, that they
cannot be endowed with a very strong projectile force : for
on the earth this force is produced by the expansibility of
gas compressed by the weight of the atmosphere.             But gases
disengaged from the lunar volcanoes ought           to  expand with
out any obstacle, and without any explosion where there is
scarcely any atmosphere.          Besides, the existence of these
gases    is   doubtful, since  their  production would soon have
formed around the moon an atmosphere of greater density
and extent, which is contrary to observation.          This explana
tion therefore must be abandoned, or we should be forced to
admit a series of phenomena, not only foreign but contrary
to what we daily observe : a solution more simple, and de
duced from facts, which daily take place before our eyes,
will perhaps appear more proper for solving the problem.
It   is well known that there are no metals which may not
be volatilized by heat : it is known also that hydrogen gas
exercises its dissolving power on charcoal, iron, and the most
fixed substances.       If we suppose that, during the burning
process of volcanoes, or the less perceptible but more assi
duous process of the decomposition of organic bodies, iron
and nickel are sublimated by heal and elevated with the
hydrogen gas which dissolves them, this gaseous solution
will soon reach the upper regions of the atmosphere. There,
as I have fliown, with some degree of probability, in my
ConjeSlures on the Diminution           of the Waters, œc. exists,
and is continually renewed, a stratum of hydrogen produced
by the continual decomposition of the water, and which
causes the greater part of the phenomena that accompany
thunder and the aurora borealis. During storms, that is to
fay, when the equilibrium is restored with an explosion be
tween the electricity of the earth and that of the atmosphere,
what must take place? The hydrogen inflames and exhibits
some of those luminous meteors, the existence of which, ac
cording to constant tradition, ought, as appears, to precede
the formation of stones.        The gas in burning abandons the
metal it has dissolved, and reduces that which was in the
state of oxide.      The strong heat produced at this moment
fuzes the metal, and molecular attraction collects it into
masses of greater or less size, which, when they fall to the
earth, retain for some time a portion of the caloric developed
during their formation.         The surface only, which, by tra
versing     the atmosphere   in a state of ignition, may have ab-

. forbed oxygen, is slightly oxidated : the interior part is metal
   in a native state.
        C. Patrin observes, in support of his hypothesis, that the
   discharge of an electric battery, on a fragment of the stones
   fo'ind at Benares, produced on it a black trace similar to the
   blade vitrified crust with which they were covered.           This
   fact indicates what takes place in the atmosphere,           where
   these stones are formed amidst a very powerful electricity,
    winch produces the vitrification and oxidation of their
   surface.
        The same author says, with Mr. Howard, that, since no
   doubt is now entertained of thunder and the electric fluid
   being the fame thing, the idea of a thunder flone is become
   ridiculous.     Nothing could be more true, if thunder were
   never any thing more than an electric explosion : but the
   French chemilts, and particularly Fourcroy, have established
   that hvdrogen acts a considerable part in the phænomena
   by which thunder is accompanied. ,1 am even of opinion
   that its exiltence ought to be oftener employed in explaining
   the varieties which continually render the general pheno
   menon complex.
        The most remarkable and most common are perhaps those
    luminous meteors, the aspect of which is always brilliant
    and often alarming, and which uniform tradition, at periods
    and in places very distant from each other, ailign as the
    cause of the stones which have fallen from the heavens :
    whether they seem to be confounded with the stars, and
    exhibit to the vulgar eye stars thrown from their usual
    course, or whether they accompany thunder, and increase or
    modify the action of its devouring flames, or whether, under
     the form of fire balls, they rapidly traverse the atmosphere,
    and approach near enough to us to make us experience a
     heat proportioned to the vivacity of their light, they must
     be considered as the effect of the inflammation of hydrogen
     gas, either pure cr charged with substances in solution, which
     modify their appearance and products. On these principles
     we may point out the supposed causes of the difference
     which exists between stones that have fallen from the at
     mosphere at different periods.      A very violent sliock of elec
     tricity, or great heat, have produced those which are most
     vitrified •¦thole less so have been formed by a weaker degree
     of electricity, and perhaps bv spontaneous inflammation.
     Those which contain the largest quantity of metal in the
     native state, are the product of a greater proportion of hy
     drogen gas.      It may be readily conceived, that when the
     hydrogen gas has been previously combined with a great
                                                                   deal

             Decomposition    of the Acetile of Lead, &c.         359
deal   of oxygen, the inflammation must be instantaneous,
and the products very much oxidated, while the strata of
hydrogen, almost pure, burning only at the surface, form
durable meteors, the continued inflammation of which gives
rife to very different compounds.
    It will perhaps be asked, how the other substances, such
as (ilex and magnesia, are found in these stones combined
with the metals ? I might, in answer, mention the height
to which earths reduced to an impalpable powder are vo
latilized by volcanoes, so as to be carried away by the winds.
I might observe, also, that magnesia, soluble in the hydro-
sulphurets, is soluble also, in all probability, in sulphurated
hydrogen. But, as I have nothing as yet except conjectures
to offer on this subject, I must here stop. I, however, flatter
myself that I have done some service, by shewing that a phæ-
nomenon, observations of which had been rejected because
thought impossible,, has received, at least in part, a plausible
and natural explanation perfectly rational ; and that, when
placed beyond a doubt, it will be arranged among those
series of facts of which science is composed.
    That I might not render the hypothesis complex, I have
said nothing of the different gases, such as sulphurated hy
drogen, carbonated hydrogen, and carbonous oxide, which
must be continually conveyed into the regions of the atmo
sphere by the decomposition of bodies.              The existence of
the first of these gases explains, however, the pyritous state
of the iron, and the presence of sulphur in some one of its
parts.
LXIV.      Observations   on   the Decomposition     of the Acetite of
    Lead,   by Zinc in    the   metallic State.      Read in the So
   ciety of Pharmacy      by  L. Anthony Planche*.
J.N    consulting the different authors who have treated on
the history of metals, and their chemical action on different
bodies, we cannot help considering zinc as exceedingly va
luable, both on account of its utility in the arts, and the es
sential services which it daily renders to chemistry.
    C. Fourcroy, who in his Syjleme des ConnoiJJhnces Chi-
miques. has collected the most numerous and best attested
facts of this science, has described all its properties with that
clearneso and method which are peculiar to him.

   It is therefore not so much a new fact that here present
as a development of one already known, which, as it forms
part of a general theory, deserves to be particularly noticed
as one of the curious phænomena in chemistry.        But to pro
ceed in order, I think it necessary to refer to the work of that
celebrated chemist already mentioned, where it is said, in the
sixth section on metals, under the head Zinc, that
     "Zinc, by its strong attraction for oxygen, decomposes
the greater number of salts and of metallic solutions; and that
it precipitates from them the metals under the metallic form
by completely unburning them, or under that of oxides less
oxidated than they were oefore."
   This definition is no doubt just, and seems to be perfectly
complete.      It is susceptible, however, of the greatest deve
lopment; and particularly in regard to the different phæno
mena exhibited by zinc in contact with acetite of lead.        It
is the union of these phænomena which forms the principal
subject of the present observation, or rather the result of the
ingenious experiment of Dr. Black, which was communi
 cated to me a few years ago, and to which I have made some
additions.
    Dr. Black put into a glass jar, containing about four and a
half pints, twelve or fifteen decagrammes of crystallized ace
tite of lead.   The jar was filled with water, and the mixture
being stirred, it was left at rest for fifteen or twenty minutes,
or until the greater part of, the superabundant      salt, after the
saturation of the liquor, was spontaneously precipitated. A
piece of zinc of an indeterminate weight was then suspended
in the slightly turbid liquor by means of a hemp or silk
thread fixed to the cover of the jar, and the vessel was depo
sited in a place where it was not exposed to be shaken.           At
the end of from twenty to twenty-five days decomposition
was completely effected ; the zinc, suspended in the middle of
the liquor, become diaphanous, was covered by a kind of very
brilliant metallic vegetation, which was often continued to
the bottom of the vessel, and which Dr. Black called the
tree of Saturn.
    Having bad occasion to repeat this experiment a great
number of times, it conducted me to several observations, in
consequence of which I resolved to make some changes in           it,
which, as they do not alter in any manner the chemical na
ture of the operation, contribute in    a   singular manner to the
beauty of the result.      These changes chiefly relate to the
hemp and silk threads, which, being easily destroyed         by  re
maining   in  the liquor, must necessarily suffer the zinc to fall,
and along with     it  the new metal which covers them.           I
f-             5                                          therefore

                      by Zinc in tie metallic      State.                361
therefore     substituted for these threads a piece of brass wire-
which appeared to me to unite all the necessary conditions)
both on account of its strength, and the property it has as
containing zinc to exercise its attraction on the acetite of
lead      A second inconvenience arises in strictly following the
process above described.           It often happens, when the size of
the piece ot zinc is too large, or when the vessel is not ex
actly of the proper form, that the decomposition takes place
with irreat rapidity; each niolecula of the new metal proceeds
immediately to the zinc, aiheres to it in a confused manner,
and at the end of two or three days, and sometimes of twenty-
 four hours, the crystallized portion suddenly detaches itself
 and is precipitated to the bottom of the vessel to give place to
 a new crystallization.         The process is then divided into se
 veral periods, which appears to be a matter of indifference in
 a chemical point of view, but greatly lessens the interest ex
 cited by this curious experiment.
     I obviated this inconvenience by fixing, in a perpendicular
 direction, to the lower part of the piece of zinc, the fame
brass wires twisted into a spiral form, and disposed in such a
 manner as to be about three centimetres distant from the                       .
 bottom of the vessel.
     By adopting this modification, as each molecula of the
 zinc formed a portion of the brass, the surface of which was
 in contact with the saturation, it became covered with a
         number of small, brilliant, metallic laminae, disposed at
treat
   rst alternately and horizontally, and then crossing each other
 in every direction *.
     When it is required that the brass, though covered with
 metal, should retain the forms it has first acquired, it will be
 proper to diminish the quantity of the acetite of lead.
     About fix mouths ago, T repeated this experiment with
 common and with distilled water, in order that I might exa
 mine the products. The result of this examination is as fol
 lows :
     Having selected two glass jars of equal capacity, I intro
 duced into each four decagrammes of very pure crystallized
 acetite   of lead.
     The two vessels having           been marked No. I. and IT.,             I
 poured into the first 54 decagrammes of common water, and
 as much distilled water into the second.                 These quantities
    * The configuration of these laminae is subject to an infinite
                                                                      variety,
 which seems to depend, 1st, On the form and different dimensions of the
 vessel in which the experiment is performed : id, And perhaps also on
 regular quantities of the zinc and acetite of lead employed.     I have seen
 the laminae sometimes circular, sometimes hexagonal,      and sometimes   also
 affecting the figure of a leaf of fern or of oak.
                                                                         were

  ifiz           Decomposition    of the Acetite of Lead,
  were sufficient to fill each jar to .the commencement of the
  neck, the height oF which was about three centimetres.                   I
  then fixed to two pieces of cork destined to close the mouths
  of the jars a bit of zinc weighing 22'g4^6 grammes (fix gros)
  by means of a piece of brass wire exceedingly fine, but of
  such a length as to allow the metal to be immersed only some
  millimetres in the solution.
      I then adjusted, and luted to the aperture of each vessel, a
  bent tube, which proceeded under the receiver of a pneu
  matic tub. These two experiments, begun on the 29th of
 Thermidor, year 9, the centigrade thermometer being at 140
  above zero, exhibited the following phænomena.
     Six hours after the apparatus was arranged, the jar No. I.
  was still somewhat turbid, while that of No. II. was trans
  parent, and the whole superabundant salt, after the saturation
  of the liquor, was entirely precipitated. At this period the
  zinc in the second jar was covered with small metallic scales,
 which could not be perceived in the first.
     Next day both liquors were perfectly transparent, and the
 decomposition seemed to have made equal progress in both
 vessels.     1 only remarked, that the interior fides of the jar
 No.    I. were  lined with a whitish saline stratum, which ex
 tended from the middle of the vessel to the bottom.                  The
 small scales adhering to the sides and bottom of the piece of
 zinc, by increasing in volume, had assumed the form of a
 leaf of fern in the jar No. I., and was exceedingly delicate in
 No. II.
     I observed  also at the upper surface of the bit of zinc a kind
 of metallic    moss *, having that livid aspect which charac
 terizes plates of lead expoled for some lime to the contact of
 the air.     The saline stratum of No. T. daily decreased to the
eighth,     when   it entirely disappeared.      In the course of these
two experiments there was disengaged a very small portion of
elastic fluid, which when examined was found to be atmo
spheric air. The quantity of this air appeared to be more
considerable in the apparatus marked No.              I.;  and this ap
peared     to  me   to arise  from   the   common     water    employed,
which always contains more or           less of it.  The remainder of
the operation exhibited nothing remarkable but an increase
in the volume of the reduced metal until the period of the
    • This metallic moss in a tree of Saturn, prepared a year before, was
found to be covered by a very fine red powder, which occupied both the
surface of the zinc and that of a portion of the undecomposed acetite of
lead which covered the horizontal bottom of the glass vefl'el.   1 consider
this red powder as produced by carburet of iron, from which zinc is never
free, and which during the operation has been carried to the state of car
bonate.

stilled water on the 16th of Fructidor, year 9, and in that
with common water on the 24th of the same month. During
the whole time the temperature varied only one or two de
grees.
     As the results appeared to be the fame in regard to the
rest    of the operation, I (hall proceed to examine the experi
ment made with dillilled water.
     ist, The piece of zinc, weighing 22*9456 grammes before
its immersion in the liquor, was completely freed from all
the metal with which it was covered. In this state it weighed
 no more than I5'9345 grammes (4 gros 12 grains). Its sur
 face was covered with a gray pulverulent stratum, the greater
 part of which still retained its metallic brilliancy, while the
other seemed to have undergone a commencement of oxida
 tion.      When entirely freed from this stratum, which could
 be easily detached with the finger, and which appeared to me
 to be nothing but zinc, having its moleculæ in part sepa
 rated, it was reduced to the weight of 13*380 grammes
 (3 gros37 grains).
      ad, The portion of the new metallic alloy, zinc and lead *,
 arising from the decomposition of the acetite, was washed
 several times in di (tilled water. Being subjected to the action
 of a good press, and then to gradual percussion on a piece of
 steel, it possessed greater ductility than lead alone.              When
 dried in close vessels, and then exposed to sudden heat in an
  iron spoon, a portion of it was. speedily converted into a
 greenish yellow oxide.           The other portion, reduced without
 any addition, furnished a small metallic button of the weight
  of 9-0183 grammes (2 gros 38 grains), and containing zinc,
  but much less weight for weight than was contained in the
  above matter before it was heated.
      I mult observe, that, notwithstanding all the precautions;
  which I took to separate, either by the help of a press and
  unsized paper, or by desiccation, all the water interposed be
  tween the moleculæ of the metal, I was not able to succeed.
  It appears probable, that under this circumstance the speedy
  oxidation of the new metallic alloy was owing, ist, To the
  decomposition of the last moleculæ of water, which could
  not be entirely expelled : 2d, To the presence of the atmo
  spheric air of the vessels : 3d, To the contact and decomposi
  tion of the fame fluid during the fusion of the metal.
     •  The formation of this metallic alloy agrees with the experiments of
  Vauquclin, from which it results, that in li;veral cafes, when a metal is
  precipitated from. its solution by another, the precipitated metal partakes
  in some degree of the precipitant.    This phenomenon takes place in par
  ticular during the precipitation of the white metals by zinc.

      1st, The liquor taken from the jar was colourless and     per
  fectly transparent.
      ad, It cave a strong green tint to blue vegetable colours.
     3d, Wlien tried with very pure sulphuric acid it formed
 no precipitate, which convinced me that it held in solution
  no lead.
     4th, A portion properly evaporated furnished small crystals
 of acetite of zinc in argenteous leaves, which affected no re
 gular form.
     5th, Ammonia produced in it a white flaky precipitate,
 not very abfindant.      At the moment even of contact there
 is emitted a strong odour of flour paste, which is speedily dis
 sipated by agitation.
     6th, This precipitate at the end of some hours had ac
 quired a semi-gelatinous consistence, and the addition of a
 new quantity of alkali rediflblved it in part.
     7th, The carbonates of potash, soda, and ammonia, formed
 in it white precipitates more or less abundant.
     8th, Lime water recently prepared precipitated from it the
zinc in the state of a white oxide, paler and more homoge
 neous than the preceding.
    9th, The precipitate obtained by carbonate of potash,
washed several times with distilled water, and carefully dried,
was exceedingly white and light.
     10th, Being brought into contact with concentrated sul
phurous acid, it dissolved in it completely, with a disengage
ment of carbonic acid, and a total disappearance of the sul
phurous odour ; which seems to (how a very great relation
between the new salt resulting from this combination and the
sulphate of zinc, for the discovery of which we are indebted
to Vauquelin and Fourcroy.
                        RECAPITULATION.
    It  results from these facts, 1st, That the decomposition of
the acetite of lead by zinc exhibits several phænomena not
observed in that of other salts and metallic solutions, by the
fame metal.
    ad, That distilled water seems to favour this decomposition,
as   it is effected in that fluid a third sooner than in common
water.
    3d, That common water may, however, be preferable in
experiments of mere curiosity, as it checks the decomposing
action of the zinc, and disposes the metallic moleculæ to as
sume that arrangement which is peculiar to them ; a phæ-
nomenon which agrees with the laws of crystallization.
    I shall terminate these observations by proposing to the

     J. HE    meetings of the iath and 19th of May were occu
  pied by the reading of a paper, by Mr. Chenevix, on a me
  tallic substance, of which we have spoken in our lail Number.
   It was announced to the public by its author as a new simple
  metal sui generis, under the title of Palladium, or new Silver.
       Mr. Chenevix made a number of experiments on this sub
   stance, and found that, in most respects, it was really different
   from all the known metallic bodies.         In a few, however, it
   bore   some  resemblance   to  platina.  But  it was not possible to
   conceive that platina could be reduced to the specific gravity
   of x i"8 ; could be fusible at so moderate a heat; could com
   bine with sulphur; could be dissolved by nitric acid, and be
   precipitated by green sulphate of iron.        These are the pro
   perties   mentioned    in  the   printed  notice   we received last
   month, and which we inserted in our Journal. Mr. Che
    nevix found them to be truly stated.
       Reflecting, however, upon the extraordinary anomalies that
    happen when substances are united, it occurred to him that
    some metal might so far influence platina as to promote its
    precipitation by green sulphate of iron, and be itself drawn
   down along with it. Mercury was the first that presented
    itself to his mind, as the most easily reduced.         He poured a
    solution of green sulphate of iron into a solution of platina:
    no precipitate.    Into a solution of muriate of mercury : no
    precipitate.   He mixed the two solutions, and a precipitate,
    exactly resembling that produced in palladium, immediately
    ensued.    He reduced this precipitate; and, after several trials,
    at length succeeded in obtaining a substance exactly similar
    to palladium.     From all his experiments, which are much
    too numerous for this extract, Mr. Chenevix does not hesitate
    to pronounce palladium to be a scandalous imposition, and
,   an attempt to defraud the public as well as to disgrace science.
       From synthesis and analysis it appears that palladium of
    the specific gravity of it 7; contains about one-third of mer
    cury;, aud when of the specific gravity of 12-5, about one-
                                                                 fourth.

   fourth. As the quantity of this metal diminishes, the specific
   gravity increases; the ductility is less; and after 12*5 it be
   gins to be no longer acted upon by nitric acid.
      Mr. Chenevix gives many methods for preparing a sub
   stance similar to palladium ; but the following is the least
   liable to fail : — Take a certain quantity of platina, reduced
   from the triple ammoniacal salt, and dissolve it in nilro-mu-
  riatic acid : add something more than twice the weight of
   the platina of red oxide ofmercury, and take particular care
  to saturate all excess of acid : then pour it into a solution, also
  saturated, of green sulphate of iron ; heat the mixture, and
  a black precipitate will be formed after some time. This pre
  cipitate weighs rather more than two and a half the original
 quantity of the platina; but, exposed to a red heat, a part of
  the mercury is volatilized. Fused at a stronger heat, it yields
 a metallic button, which in different experiments gives a dif
 ferent" specific gravity.    This experiment is of a very delicate-
 nature, and does not alwavs succeed ; and Mr. Chenevix
 recommends perseverance and repeated trials to all who would
 form palladium.        It is not often to be obtained of the exact
 specific gravity    announced    by the author of the fraudulent
 advertisement; and the specific gravity is not constantly the
 fame in all his specimens.        The difficulty, is, to unite a suffi
 ciently large portion of mercury with the platina to produce
 perfect palladium.       It may be obtained by this method as
 low as io-5, sometimes as hiuh as 15. Mr. Chenevix men
 tions some methods of combining platina and mercury in the
dry way, such as count Muslim Puskin's amalgam fusing with
 cinnabar, lime, and borax, &c.
      He then relates some experiments upon platina ; upon its
oxides, which are two, viz. one of 7 the other of 13 percent,
of oxygen; upon the affinities of the oxide for the acid and
aromatic salts formed bv them.          He gives numerous exam-
  iles of the affinities of metals for each other; and of anoma-
r,ous precipitations!,   when two or more metals are present in
the same solution.        He says, that the fixation of mercury by
platina, together with other facts related in this paper, will
tend to make us particularly cautious in pronouncing upon
discoveries of supposed new metals, and promote scepticism
even upon our present knowledge.            He adduces instances of
the difference that exists between a solution of platina and a
solution of mercury merely mixed, and a solution of these
metals after they have been united.          In the former cafe they
are easily separated; in the latter there is no method of com
pletely disuniting them.        He concludes with a curious state
ment of the approximation of several metals and of several
earths to each other iu their chemical properties, which fol
                                                                   low

combination.
     The whole of the facts related in this paper are of the
highest interest to the science, as they prove to what a degree
the properties of simple bodies, hitherto thought to be un-
combinable, may be altered when they are united ; and (how

      Galvanic   facts, in proportion    as  they are accumulated,
  afford a hope   of the happiest results being soon obtained from
  the application of this stimulus. Thole which we are here
 about to detail relate partly to theory and partly to the me
 dical employment of this fluid.
      In a late sitting of the Galvanic Society, C. Gautherot
 mentioned an observation made by him anterior to that pe
 riod, which was both curious in itself, and of importance, on
 account of the inductions that may be drawn him it. As it
 is necessary to be known before a proper opinion can be
 formed of those by which it was accompanied, we think it
 proper to lay before the reader the two following experiments :
                             Experiment I.
     The person who performs this experiment places in his
 mouth the upper ends of two wires of platina, or of any other
metal not oxidable, and immediately brings the other two
ends into contact with the two extremities of a weak Gal
vanic apparatus, to ascertain the degree of its influence. When
this arrangement has been made, the person will experience
an effect more or less remarkable, according as the tongue is
more or less exercised in perceiving the peculiar savour of the
Galvanic fluid.       But if he places these two ends of the pla
tina wires one upon the other without deranging those placed
in the mouth, he will again experience, though in a weaker
degree,    the sensation  of the savour.

                          Experiment       II.
   If the   Galvanic apparatus has produced only a minimum of
 effect, which must be the cafe, 1st, When the apparatus con»
 fists of only one story ; a-J, When the substances which com
 pose this story are by their nature not much calculated for de
 veloping the Galvanic effect, or when they can produce it
 only in the weakest degree ; it may happen under both these
 circumstances that the organ of taste will not be affected by
any savour. But in this cafe it will be sufficient to let the two
 lower ends of the platina wires rest for a moment on the two
extremities of the apparatus, and then to apply these two wires
to each other without deranging their extremities, which are
placed in the mouth.       This new contact will necessarily pro
duce a more intense effect than the former, and if it be re
quired to increase it still further, it may be done by applying
alternately the lower ends of the platina wires, first to the two
extremities of the battery, and then to each other. These
repeated contacts will develop the peculiar savour of the fluid,
which is the certain sign of its influence.
     This ingenious process, then, puts the tongue, that dis
posable instrument, in possession         of a new galvano scope,
which, as appears to us, will be to Galvanism what Volta's
condenser is to electricity, since by its means the slightest
shades of the Galvanic effect may be detected.
     C. Nauche, president of the society, in the same sitting
communicated some facts in regard to the medical applica
tion of Galvanism in cases of hemiplegia.            It results from
them, that the means of giving a strong stimulus to the parts
affected, such as the hand or leg for example,         is,  to make
one of the extremities of the pise to communicate with the
former, and the other extremity with the spinal apophyses of
the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae.        If the leg be af
fected, the foot and twelfth dorsal vertebra must be made to
communicate with the two extremities of the pile. The vital
action will then seem to be conveyed as          ifby undulation to
all the muscular organs in order to restore motion.
     The president observed also, that in  cases of great extremity,
where   it   isnecessary  to increase  in  an  extraordinary degree
the excitement of the organic forces, one extremity of the
pile must be brought into communication with the summit
of the vertebral column, and the other with the spinal apo
physes of the first lumbar vertebrae.         The patient subjected
10 this experiment will perceive flashes, certain savours and
sensations, more or less painful, in the stomach,        in   the in
testinal canal, and in the viscera of the breast and the abdo
men.      The muscles of the trunk and those of the extremities
will be violently contracted.

 _,                           MINING.
   J- HE   mines of Cornwall and its neighbourhood now yield
so large a part    of the metals so valuable to the arts, copper
and tin, of all that the world produces of these substances,
that the present state, and probable future one of productive
ness, is highly interesting to those connected with the useful
manufactures.
     Tin, though the oldest object of the miner's search in
Cornwall, now employs by far the lesser number of hands
and amount of capital ; the quantity railed of course is much,
diminished. Generally speaking, the tin mines have not been
found to hold their richness to so great a depth beneath the
surface as copper seems to do ; consequently       many, which
were highly productive mines of this metal, now are stopped,
or are worked to little advantage.
     Polgooth, the greatest tin mine now in the world, though
it produces large quantities of ore, yet it is attended with so
great an expense from its depth, that is understood to pay
the adventurers now but very little profit. A report of cobalt
biing found in this mine has been heard, but we do not
know whether it is entitled to credit; we wish it may, but,
as far as we have had opportunities of judging of the mine
rals produced in this district, it does not appear to us pro
bable that these scarcer ones will be sound in quantities suffi
cient to repay any great expense in searching for them. The
tin mines in the western part of the county, between Pen-
zance and the Land's End, are doing well for their proprie
tors in general ; and though they have for a few years pro
duced but little, they now arc throwing up good quantities
of   ore.

    The quality of the metal lately brought to market has been
found, we understand, much inferior to what it ought to be :
this may be accounted for in the following wav: — Grain tin
particularly has been greatly in demand; in order to get more
of the metal under this form the smelters have of late applied
ores to produce it from, which are generally understood not
to be sufficiently free from other metals for this purpose, and
thus the grain tin, though increased in quantity, has been less
pure : at the fame time the common tin, being robbed of the
better part of the ores from which that has generally been
smelted, has suffered a like degradation in quality.           It is to
be hoped that the smelters will lee verysoon their true interest
in this respect, and that the risk of injuring the trade may
no longer be continued for the prospect of temporary gain.
   The quantity of copper produced has not much fluctuated
of late, though on the whole it may he expected, unlels un
looked-for discoveries be made, to lessen ; as several large
mines have alreadv stopped, the produce not being sufficient
to counterbalance the enormous outaoinirs their great depth
occasioned.     Some other mines that have for many years,
and even of late, produced almost as much as any in this
part of the world, are expected soon to be abandoned, partly
for the reason above stated, and partly because they have
failed in quantity of ore in the lode or vein. On the other
hand, some mines have bettered in their prospects : Dolevath,
after having been brought into work at an enormous expense,
has afforded a course of copper of areat magnitude, and
though the ore is not rich in proportion of metal, yet its
quantity is large enough to make this discovery highly valua
ble. Wheal Towan, in St. Agnes, continues its productive
state; and Wheal Crowndale, <U+2666>ear Tavistock in Devon, is
yielding a great deal of copper ore from a small depth under

   Like tin, it has been found that      copper is of late inferior
in purity to what it was formerly,       at least it is asserted that
the sheathing of -ships would a few     years since remain in use
a much longer time than any that can now be got will do.
This probably arises in both metals from the fame cause,
from the greatness of the demand, which tempts the smelter
to let improper allovs remain in a certain degree in his me
tal ; but it well becomes them to reflect, whether this may
not sooner than they expect be the means of destroying the
demand all together, by driving the consumers to some substi
tute which may answer their purpose better.              F. P. M. S.

of  the Persepolitan Inscriptions.     The author thought it ne-
cessarv  to prefix to this memoir an explanation of other larger
inscriptions, in order tint an opinion may be easier formed of
it. Ill the first place, the alphabet of the wedge-form writing
of the first fort has two fundamental strokes, which may be
called the bow and the arrow, or rather the chisel and the
rule.    It appears to have been invented chiefly for lapidary
inscriptions.     It has no round strokes, and is not only very
convenient for that purpose, but very beautiful, on account
of its simple and regular composition. The author mentions
as particular properties of this alphabet : ist, The principal
strokes of the letters are perpendicular; the horizontal are
the accessory strokes.     The latter are always on one side, or
over the former ; only in the letter g, there are at the top two
wedges which cross each other.            2il, The points of the ar
 rows, or wedges, are always turned to the bottom or to the
 right, when the characters are written proceeding from the
 left. This position is natural.     3d, Each letter has no more
than three wedges, or two angles, as principal strokes, and at
 m-st three accessory strokes; however, when an angle forms
 the principal stroke, there is at times an accessory stroke on
 the other (ide.    4th, The angles and principal wedges are all
 of an equal height, only that in two letters, m and 0,- the
 middle wedge is stiorler, in order to prevent their being con
founded with the t and the a, which are similar.            In regard
to the transverse, or accessory strokes, one of them is often,
 shortened ; or one stroke, which ought to be at the top, is often
 placed at the side for want of room.          5th, In letters which
 have onlv one principal stroke, the transverse strokes are always
 on one fide ; where there are two principal strokes, the trans
 verse strokes are in general at the top; where there are three,
 these accessory strokes are also on the fide.       6th, When se
 veral transverse strokes are over one or two principal strokes,
 the latter are shortened that the litter may not pass the line.
 The alphabet itself is represented under a double point of
 view ; first, according to the composition of the strokes, where
 they begin by the simplest signs, the wedge with one or two
 accessory strokes; and then according to the order of the let
 ters of the Zendic alphabet.      In the last table of Anquetil
 the author observed letters which he thinks defective, accord
 ing to a comparison with the plates of Bruyn and Niebuhr.
 In the last place, the author remarks, that this wedge alpha
 bet has no resemblance to any of the known alphabets ; and
 that it would be vain to attempt to determine the meaning
of the. single letters according to their resemblance with the
 Zendic or other letters i the author, however, finds that the
letters which resemble each other in the Pehlvi writing at
                                                             Nakschi

Nakschi Rustan, resemble each other also in the wedge
                            '
writing.
    Secondly, What the author observes in regard to the
Zendic language may be reduced to the following objects :—
ist, The Zendic among the Persian dialects is what the Shan-
scrit is among the dialects of the Hindus, and has a great re
semblance to that language.      Neither of them is formed, but
they are abundant in words ; both have a great many ele
vated vowels, and, on the other hand, have very harsh com
binations of consonants. The two languages have also several
things common in the radical words and in the flexions, and
are very different from other languages.        2d, The Zendic
has a great variety of grammatical forms, and a construction
without rules ; like the Greek and the German it abounds
in compound words. The most important thing in this sec
tion is an example of the declension of the noun taken from
inscriptions, and which in several parts deviates from the de
clension of Anquetil.     The singular, for example, has in the
genitive and dative the termination dbe, (Anquetil has tsebao
or ao;) the accusative has o, (Anquetil has m,) c, and etsebao,
 (instead of the bio and bietseba in Anquetil.) These differences
would be striking did we not reflect, that the two forts of de
clination are taken from partial examples, and that we are
less acquainted with the Zendic grammar than with its dic
tionary.

 When two naturalists study the same subject without
communicating to each other the result of their labours,
two certain advantages arise to science.         The first     that               is,
when they agree in their manner of considering the same
object, their opinion excites      greater degree of confidence
                                           a                                              :
the second         is,
                  that when their opinions differ          induces          it
them to make new researches.
   The important discoveries published            Saussure, Hed- by
wig, and other botanists, in regard to the organization of
leaves, inspired me with        desire of examining after them
                                       a
objects  so interesting.      therefore
                                 I       repeated their observa
tions, and made new ones, which gave me different results.
Of these proposed to publish
          I                             detailed account, when
                                                   a                                     I

   Though the opinion of the celebrated men above men

botanists have given the name of epidermis, is not a simple
membrane, but a real bark composed of three distinct parts;
namely, an epidermis properly so called, a cortical reticula
 tion, and cortical glands **
    He defines the epidermis in the following words : —" It             f
is an exceedingly fine membrane, always transparent and
 colourless, in which no fibre, no pore, and no organiza
tion can be discovered ;" though he allows that this mem
brane opens opposite to absorbent and excretory vessels.
    Hedwig gives the name of pellicle of the leaves to what
Saussure calls their bark.     The cuticular lymphatic vessels
of the former compose the cortical reticulation of the latter ;
and the evaporating pores or conduits of Hedwig are the
cortical glands of Saussure. . In regard to the epidermis, as

    To enable the reader to comprehend better what             have
to say in regard to the epidermis, shall define what

                       I

    The utriculæ are membranous vesicles filled with           par          a
ticular juice, and contiguous to each other,            greater or
                                                               in   a
less extent of their surface, according to the form which
they affect.     The utriculæ constitute the greater part of
leaves.    They vary in their form and size       some of them
                                                           ;
being round, elongated, prismatic, or irregular.
    All leaves seem to have       bark or exterior covering de

                         Organization os Leaves.                         S
  I  was able to separate a pellicle, which carried with it only
  the exterior face of these utriculæ, as seen fig. 3 and 4.*
      To find the epidermis of Saussure I repeated the same
  processes which he employed, varying them different ways j
  but instead of epidermis I always observed that the surface
  of the leaves was formed only by the external face of the
 exterior utriculæ; that this face was distinguished by slight
  rugae, produced, no doubt, by exposure to the air ; that it
 was indeed a little thicker than the other faces of the same
 utriculæ, and on that account exceedingly proper for dis
 charging the functions of an epidermis.                It needs not be
 objected that this thickness supposes an epidermis con
 nected with the exterior face of the utriculæ, for in this
 manner we ought to admit nothing which is not supported
 by rigorous proof i but though I was never able to separate
 the epidermis from the surface of the leaves, I am in doubt
 whether I should thence conclude that it does not exist.
     C. Mirbel entertained the same opinion as I do t in re
 gard to the non-existence of the epidermis in leaves, and
                                                   "
 expresses it in the following manner : — The exterior cells
 (which     are my utriculæ) closely       united   exhibit contiguous
 surfaces, which many authors have considered as an epi
 dermis. It was natural that they should believe in the ex
 istence of this organ, since they considered the vegetable
 as composed       of fibres, vessels, and utriculæ.           All these
 parts, in their opinion, being only joined or weakly united,
 ought to have a common connection or covering to retain
them in their respective places : but, according to the facts
which I have established, the existence of the epidermis does
not appear to be necessary; and the more I observe, the
more I am convinced that it does not exist. The sides of
the cells exposed to the contact of the air and of the light
undergo an alteration to which the interior parts are not
exposed 5 they become dry, and are even separated some-i
times from the cellular tissue.          It is thus that they become
a distinct covering, and it is then that they are destroyed :
but if this pretended epidermis be carefully removed in the
green parts, its continuity with the cellular tissue will be per
ceived ; the vascular reticulation of Saussure is seen adher
ing to that exterior membrane ; and this reticulation, when
better observed, appears to be only the lateral sides of the
cells, while the epidermis or membrane, which serves them

as a base-, is   nothing else than the junction of the exterior
sides*."
    The observations       even of Saussnre seem to confirm my
opinion     in  regard   to  the non-existence of the epidermis,
since he expresses himself in this manner t >— " The system
of the vessels which constitutes the bark of the leaves, and
\yhich touches on the one hand the parenchyroe and the
ribs of the leaves, and on the other the epidermis properly
so called— this system of vessels generally adheres to its
epidermis much stronger than to any thing else.                It, how
ever, sometimes happens that a part of the reticulation re
mains ftdhering to the parenchyme of the bark ; but this is
very rare. Continued maceration in cold or boiling water
till the leaf is dissolved, separates very rarely the cortical
reticulation from its epidermis. I never saw this separation
take place but in the sonchus spinosus."
    May it not thence be inferred that this author was never
able to separate the epidermis without removing with it the
vessels, except in the leaves of the sonchus ? This appears
to me evident. But if I have always found in thia fine pel
licle the utricular organization, and if I am able to prove
that the vessels of its cortical reticulation arc nothing else
than the lateral faces of the exterior utriculæ, may I not
reasonably conclude that this epidermis is merely the ex
ternal face of the exterior utriculæ ?
    The cortical reticulation of Saussure, covered by the epi
dermis, is composed of fibres or filaments, which by ana
stomosing form the meshes of this reticulation, and the form
of these meshes varies according to the different plants.
    This author says % :      "In   all the leaves which I have ob
served, four, five, six, and even seven filaments terminate
at one and the same mesh : though six be the most frequent
number, it does not thence follow that these meshes are re
gular hexagons ; for the fibres which compose this reticula
 tion are subject to such frequent inflections, and proceed
winding in so irregular a serpentine manner, that in tlie
greater number of species the meshes have no regular or
 constant form. The filaments which compose these meshes-
    * In my opinion, C. Mirbcl is mistaken when he applies to the epi
 dermis of k.Hvcs what Malpighi said respecting the epidermis of trees,
 namely, that it is formed by the desiccation of the utriculæ.   Malpighi
 expresses himself in regard to leaves as follows, p. 37: '• Tota exara-
 totum moles quibus folia coagmentantur, lævi superextensa cuticula stu
 epidevmide abducitur, qua: subjectorum colorem refert, ipsaijue contents

                                                                  appear

                    Organization as Leaves*                     1
appear transparent in their axes, and they are seen to ana
stomose with each other wherever they meet, and not to cross
or to form knots in any manner. As these characters are
suited to vessels filled with a transparent fluid much rather
than to simple solid fibres, I have always considered them
as vessels, and shall give them that, name in future.         The
fineness and transparency of these vessels induce me to
consider them as lymphatic vessels."
    Hedwig observed the same reticulation, which he says is
formed by vessels to which he has given the name of arti
cular lymphatic vessels.
    These two authors have committed an error in taking for
vessels the lateral faces of the utriculæ which form the sur
face of the leaves ; but this error, which is owing to an op
tical illusion, was easily committed.        If the pellicle of a
leaf, indeed, be removea, and be examined with the micro
scope, it will readily be conceived, that if the utriculæ
which compose this pellicle be viewed from above, their
lateral  or perpendicular faces will appear shortened ; and'
besides, as these membranes        may be more or less inclined'
on account of their flexibility, the result will be, that the
lower ridges will appear to be close to the upper correspond
ing ones, which will give the illusion of vessels of different
diameters, the transparency of the axes of which will depend
on that of the membrane comprehended between these ridges.
    Fig. 10 will serve to give a better idea of the optical illu
sion which I have here endeavoured to explain.
    As the lateral faces of the exterior utriculæ thus present
themselves under the appearance of vessels, it is seen that
 the result will be a kind of reticulation, the meshes of which
will vary according to the form of the utriculæ : for ex
ample, they will be rectangular, hexangular, or irregular,
 according as the utriculæ represent a parallelopipedon, a
 hex ac dial prism, or any other irregular form.
    From what has been said, I entertain no doubt that if
 the authors I have quoted had examined the pellicle of the
 leaves in profile or in vertical sections, instead of observing
 them in front or from above, they would have found that
 what they take for vessels are merely the lateral faces of
 the utriculæ.
    C. Mirbel in his memoir above mentioned seems to
 ascribe the errors committed on this subject to the same
 cause.    He says, " The difficulty of observing, by the help
 of the microscope, the relation which exists between the
 planes placed in different directions, and at unequal di-
                               A  4                       stances,

 8                   Researches respecting  the
 tances, has fascinated the eyes of observers.        The mem-<
 branes which form the sides of the cells have always been
 taken for vessels or for fibres."
     The utriculæ which compose the surface of the leaves
 have in general a form different from that of the utriculæ
 of the parenchyme, and a direction which is often opposite
to them.      In the fritillaria, for example, the form of the
exterior utriculæ approaches that of a parallelopipedon very
much elongated, in the direction of the length of the leaf
 (fig. 1. A, and fig. 5.), while the interior utriculæ are nearly
spherical, as seen in fig. 7, 8, and 15.
    The erythronium dens canis has its exterior utriculæ also
elongateain the direction of the length of the leaf; they
cross at right angles those of the parenchyme, which are
cylindrical, and which consequently have their direction
according to the breadth of the leaf.         This disposition is
not well observed but in the superior surface of the leaf.
    The leaves of the lavatera triloha have their exterior utri
culæ festooned like those of fig. 14; but the interior ones
exhibit the form of a cylinder, the length of which is in the
direction of the thickness of the leaf.
    The exterior utriculæ of the leaf of the silphium perfo-
liatum are also festooned ; while the utriculæ of the paren
chyme are cylindric on the superior side of the leaf, and ir
regular on the inferior, like those of fig. 1 8.
    In the orchis maculata the exterior utriculæ of the leaf
are remarkable by their size, and particularly by their
height : they alone constitute a great part of the thickness
of the  leaf.
    I might multiply these examples ; but I think I have said
enough to prove what 1 have advanced, namely, that the
exterior utriculæ of the leaves are in general very different
from the utriculæ of the parenchyme.
    Having examined the existence of the epidermis and that
of the lymphatic vessels which form the cortical reticulation
of the leaves, I shall proceed to the cortical glands of Saus-
sure, or the evaporating pores of Eledwig; but I shall first
say a few words of the manner in which the exterior utri
culæ   of the petals present themselves.
    In most flowers the exterior utriculæ of the petals are
conical ; they rise in the form of teats, move or less promi
nent, on which the rays of light arc broken and reflected in
such a manner as to produce to our eves that dark rich vel
vety appearance which gives them so beautiful an aspect.
    To give an idea of the effect produced by these ununiiicl-
                                                             lous

                     Organization   of Leaves.                  9
  Ions utriculæ I shall compare them to that of velvet, which
   exhibits that appearance merely in consequence, of the pro
  jection of the threads of silk above the woof.
      Petals with a smooth surface do not exhibit the same
   phænomenon, because their exterior utriculæ being plane
  do not reflect the rays of light like the conical utriculæ ;
  and in flowers, the petals of which are velvety above and
  smooth below, the utriculæ are seen to exhibit both these
  forms.
      The surface of leaves is furnished with a very large quan
  tity of small whitish points, which are scarcely apparent to
  the naked sight, but which may be clearly distinguished by
  the help of a good magnifying glass.        These points are the
  cortical glands of Saussure, the military glands of Guettard,
  the evaporating pores of Hcdwig, and the cortical pores of
  Decandolle.
      Saussure says that the cortical glands are small oval bo
  dies, often transparent and at other times opake, surrounded
  by a fibre or vessel of the same form, and with which se
 veral vessels of the cortical reticulation anastomose.         At
  the two extremities of each gland is a very delicate vessel,
 which traverses in a straight line the interval between the
 gland and the vessel that surrounds     it,   with whichit   ana
 stomoses.     He considers these glands, on account of their
 constant position near the surface of the leaf, as organs de
 stined for preparing or secreting the peculiar juices which
 form the matter for transpiration, or for preparing and assi
 milating to vegetables the vapours and exhalations which
 they absorb  by   their leaves.
     Guettard, without penetrating into the organization of
 these glands, contents himself with giving them the appel
 lation of military, on account of their great number in cer
               *
 tain leaves.
     Hedwig first found that these organs are so many small
apertures, which he calls evaporating pores or conduits.       He
 says that each pore   is   surrounded bya    circumference, and
that the interval comprehended between the pore and the
circumference   is   the reservoir of the pore.   In regard to the
use of these pores, he has no doubt that they serve for eva
poration or absorption;
     Decandolle has also given them the name of cortical
pores, and seems to have adopted the opinion of Hedwig
in regard to the uses of them.
     Senebier, in his Treatise on the Physiology of Vegeta

the help of the best microscopes, the pores of Hedwig,

 10                     Researches respecting        the
 which      I can ascribe only to an ambiguity occasioned by the
 meaning of the word, since the pores of Hedwig are only
 the cortical glands of Saussure, with which the Tllustrious
 author of that physiology seems to have been very well
 acquainted.
     Mirbel calls these pores exterior pores, in contra-distinc-
 tion to those with which the interior cells are perforated * i
 " Each pore f," says he, " is an oblong fissure surrounded
 by an elliptical area at which the neighbouring cells termi
 nate. In these pores I can see only cells having a parti
 cular disposition, the exterior side of which is rent in a
 longitudinal direction.         When the vegetable is exposed to
 the air and to light, circumstances necessary for transpira
 tion, the fluids proceed in abundance towards the surface,
 the cells become elongated to receive them, and pierced to
 afford them a passage.          Hence the formation of the cortical
 pores : but this elongation of some cells is, in a certain
 measure, only accidental ; it is not invariably determined by
 rite organic plan of the vegetable."
     The diversity of opinions which prevails among the au
 thors above mentioned induced me to study these organs
with great attention, that I might endeavour to discover
 their real structure, and in this manner facilitate the ex
 planation of their uses.
      I have found that the surfaces of almost all leaves are
 perforated with a great number of small apertures, to which
 I shall retain the name of pores.
     The size of these pores varies very much, according to
 the plants.       In the orchis and lily kind they are very large,
 while in the sow -bread, the jessamine, the oak, 8cc. they are
 very small.
     The number of them varies also according to the leaves.
 Hedwig counted 577 in a square line of the lilium lulbi-
ferum. I counted 140 in the same extent of a leaf of the
  fritillaria, aud 1 50 in that of the aloe ; but in leaves where
 they are very small I was not able to count them very ex
  actly, because they are too numerous.
      In most plants the pores have an oval form, the direction
 of which seems to be subordinate to the form of the exterior
  utriculæ.      Thus in the lily kind, the utriculæ of which are
  elongated, the large diameter of the pore proceeds in the
  direction of the length of the utriculæ, fig. 1 and 5 ; and
  in the leaves, the utriculæ of which are festooned, the pores
  extend in every direction, fig. 14.              This rule, however, is
              *

not constant ; for in the white serapias, the utriculæ of
which are also festooned, the pores are disposed very re
gularly in the direction of the length of the leaf.
    All leaves are not in the same manner provided with
pores : some have pores on both surfaces, others have them
only on one ; and some are entirely destitute of them. At
the end of this memoir I shall give a catalogue of most of
the plants which I have examined, and which I have ar
ranged in three tables according to these divisions.
     Trees in general have pores only in the interior surface of
their leaves.     Those, however, of the sir and the larch have
them on both their surfaces ; and the juniperus sabina and the
common juniper exhibit pores only on the upper face.
     But pores are not found in leaves alone : they are found
in the seminal leaves, in most herbaceous stems, and in
 that of the cactus Jlagelliformis which has no leaves ; they
are also disseminated throughout the bracteæ, stipulæ, ca
 lyces, and in the corolla without a calyx : I have even found
 them in the corolla with a calyx, though in less quantity ; but
 I will not assert that they are all provided with them. In a
 word, I have observed them in the antheræ, the pistils, and
 pericarpium of the lilium lulbiferum ; and I have no doubt
 that they are found also in the parts of fructification of
 other plants.
     The existence of pores in the leaves having been fully
  established by various observations, I shall now show the
  manner in which I found them to be formed.
      Were we to suppose that the pores are apertures formed
  bv chance in the surface of the leaves, we should be in an
  error. Nature had some end in fonning them, and the at
  tentive observer w ill soon perceive that it has given to these
  pores a peculiar organization.       Each pore indeed, when
  observed with the microscope, seems to be placed in the
  middle of a body nearly spherical, composed of two small
  uniform utriculæ, perfectly similar, opposed to each other
  by their concave face9 and united by their extremities, the
   result of which is a vacuity or interval of an oval form, to
  which I have given the name of pore, fig. 1,5, and 6.
      These reniform utriculæ, which I shall call conjugate, con
   cur with the exterior utriculæ towards the formation of the
   surface of the leaf; they are so closely united, that when the
   pellicle is removed they are removed with      it,except in the
   fritillaria and aloe; which arises, no doubt, from the pellicle
   being formed, as already said, merely     by  the superior face
   of die utriculæ, the lateral surfaces of which adhere to the
                                                        parenchyme

      12                  Researches respecting     the
     parenchyma of the leaf, and thus retain the utriculæ con
   jugate or conjoined.
         To enable the reader to comprehend better what is here
     said, I shall refer to fig. 1 , which represents a portion of the
     leaf of the fritillaria with the pellicle removed at B.           It
     will first be observed that the leaf is greener in that part;
    that the lateral surfaces of the exterior utriculæ remain ad
    hering to the parenchyme, and that they retain the utriculæ
    conjoined, in the centre of which the pore is seen.
        Fig. 2 exhibits this pellicle removed, and pierced with as
    many oval apertures as there were conjugate utriculæ in the
    leaf.
        The size of these apertures clearly proves that, besides
    the pore, a part of the conjugate utriculæ remains exposed to
    the air, which thus concurs with the exterior utriculæ to
   the formation of the surface of the leaf.           Fig. 5 and 6 give
   a pretty correct idea of the manner in which the conjugate
   utriculæ are enveloped by the exterior utriculæ, and of the
   part of these utriculæ which remains uncovered.
        The apertures here mentioned are not of the same form
   in the different plants: in the fritillaria they are always
   oval, while in the aloe they are square, fig. 13, which lean
   ascribe only to the form of the exterior utriculæ, which
  are elongated in the fritillaria and hexagon in the aloe.
       The conjugate utriculæ are not united to the parenchyme
  by their lower part, as the exterior utriculæ are ; below them
  is found a vacuity, as seen fig. 7, which communicates on
 one side with the pore, and on the other with the utricular
  interstices,   which I shall speak of in describing the paren
 chyme. This vacuity is very remarkable in the leaf of the
 aloe, both on account of its size and its funnel-like appear
 ance.
       The conjugate utriculæ      are filled with a juice which seems
 to be     of the same nature      as that  of the utriculæ of the par
 enchyme;       in general   it is green   and  sometimes transparent.
 It often contains a great number of small globules, which
 render these utriculæ opake : but if the utriculæ be slightly
 compressed,       all .these globules unite as several globules of
oil would do, and thus communicate to the utriculæ a part
of their transparency.
      Every time I observed the pores with the microscope,
taking care to moisten the pellicle, they always appeared to
me to be almost always filled with a black matter, tig. 1 and
14, which is nothing else than a small bubble of air retained
there, and which I was enabled to detach by slightly com

                       Organization    of Leaves.                      13
pressing the pores with a fine needle, which restored to
them their transparency. Are these bubbles atmospheric
air, or a peculiar air produced by the plant itself?                  The
following experiment may serve as an answer to this ques
tion.
    I examined different pellicles taken from the surface of
the leaves.      I successively compressed the pores, and al
ways observed the bubbles of air which issued to decrease
gradually in volume, and at length disappear entirely. Whe^
ther they remained attached to the utnculæ, or to the point
of the needle, or whether they rose to the surface of the
water in which these pellicles were immersed, is not the
absorption of this air by water peculiar to carbonic acid
gas?
    Hedwig entertained no doubt that the pores had the fa*-
culty of being able to shut themselves, to oppose the intro
duction of the floating particles disseminated in too great
quantity throughout the atmosphere.
    Krocker asserts* that the contraction of the pores of the
leaves of the amaryllis formosissima takes place in a very
evident manner ; which induced me to examine this fact.
For this purpose I placed in the focus of the microscope a
fragment of the pellicle of one of these leaves, moistening
it sufficiently to obviate its desiccation, and I viewed it very
attentively without observing any contraction in the pores j
but having substituted for it another fragment of pellicle,
placed dry on the glass, I then saw the pores gradually con
tract and close themselves entirely ; which I can ascribe ohly
to the shrinking of the conjugate utriculæ, produced by the
evaporation of their juices : for, having moistened this pel
licle, the pores gradually returned to their natural state.
    The result of this observation may give us an idea of
what the pores of vegetables may experience when exposed
to continued drought; and make us comprehend, at the
same time, the beneficent influence which rain and abun
dant dews have on leaves.
    We have considered the pores and conjugate utriculæ
under a general acceptation : let us now speak of an excep
tion which relates to the family of the gramineous plants,
and which did not escape the acuteness of Hedwig.

  14    Researches respecting    the Organization of Leaves.
     The   conjugate utriculæ of gramineous plants represented
 in   the pellicle of maize, fig. 9, form a narrow elongated
 body, instead of being nearly spherical as in other plants.
  It is placed in the middle of a kind of square area, produced
 by the disposition of the surrounding utriculæ. The conjugate
 utriculæ are applied to each other bv their interior faces so
 exactly, as to make the pore disappear, and to exhibit in its
 place nothing but a longitudinal line, at the extremities of
 which is observed a small circle, which Hedwig considered
 as an aperture, and which, in my opinion, is formed only
 by the juice contained in the utriculæ, since I was able to
 make the appearance of this circle vanish by slight com
 pression. Though the form of the conjugate utriculæ in the
                 plants is always such as I have described, I have
    owever remarked, both in the leaves which envelop the
 framineous
 ear of maize, or in the interior face of the sheath of the
 leaves, and also in that of the leaves of the sugar-cane, con
jugate utriculæ sufficiently reniform to construct the pore,
 as seen fig.     II.   I have even observed some which had a
 perfect resemblance to the conjugate utriculæ of other
 plants, as represented fig. 12. Such a variety in the form
 of the conjugate utriculæ of the same plant is very remark
 able. The details I have given, in regard to the structure of
 pores, seem to prove that these organs arc essential to the
 greater part of vegetables : I however foresee that it may be
 objected, that they arc not indispensably necessary ; since
 it is said that by blanching a plant may be deprived of its
 pores. I shall observe in reply, that this assertion is not ve
 rified by my observations ; for I have found pores on the
 blanched leaves of an orchis, which had vegetated below a
 piece of blackened pasteboard, on the blanched leaves of let
 tuce taken from the heart of the plant, and on the blanched
 stems of radishes, French beans, and potatoes, which had
 grown up in a dark cellar.
     It may be objected also, that pores exist only eventual'^
 in vegetables, since aquatic plants, which never have any J
 assume them in those parts which are exposed to the air,
 anjd that plants which have pores lose them by vegetating
 in water.
     I shall observe in reply, 1st, Thst if the leaves of the
 flower of the mesophvllum have pores, while those of the
 stem are without them, it is a proof that this flower was de
 stined to rise above the surface of the water, and not a con
 sequence of its vegetation in the air ; that if the pedicle of
 the water-ranunculus has pores, while its stem is deprived
 of them, it is because it ought to live in the air, and not
                                                          because

      General View    of the Coal Mines worked in France.    15
because it has lived there : 2d, That if the leaves of the ne
nuphar have pores on their superior surface and not on the
inferior, it is because the former is intended to exist in the
air, and the other in the water.
    I shall here add, that the leaves of the nenuphar are pro
vided with pores in the upper surface before they reach the
surface of the water; and I have observed that the lower
surface of the same leaves had not acquired pores, though
 they vegetated a long time in the air, in consequence of the
desiccation of marshes ; which proves that the contact of the
air has no influence in the formation of pores which are
seen on vegetables destined to be provided with them.
    We are told by C. Decandolle, that having caused mint
to vegetate under water, it shot forth leaves destitute of
 pores. To this observation I shall oppose one which I
 made on the leaves of the narcissus, which after having
shot forth in water were furnished with as many pores as if
 they had vegetated in the open air, as I had reason naturally
 to expect, since the leaves, still contained in the bulb, ex
 hibited to me their pores already completely formed.
    It appears then that the existence of pores does not de
 pend either on the light or the air; but that these organs are
 co-existent with the other parts of the vegetable.

      No coal mines are worked in this country.            A great many
  indications    have been announced, and some of them de
 serve to be examined, particularly that in the environs of
 Seez, at Fontaineriaut, which has already been partially
 worked, and afforded some hopes.
                         Department      of Ourthe.
     This country (33) is one of the richest in coals m Eu
 rope, and the' mines have been worked since the earliest
 periods. A great many coals are dug up in the neighbour
 hood of Liege, and even within the precincts of that city the
 pits are carried to a great depth ; and powerful machines are
 employed to clear these immense cavities of water, and to
 draw up the coals.
     The product of these mines is estimated at 43 millions
 of myriagrammes. They furnish coals of every kind. The
mean price of those of a good quality is ten cents per my-
 riagramme at the pits.
     The coal mines in the department of Ourthe ought to
supply Batavia; at least in competition with the English
mines.       If the suppression of the numerous tolls which
shackle the navigation of the Meuse is strictly maintained,
it will secure this advantage to the country of Liege.
                 Department      of the Pas-de-Calais.
    The coal mines of Hardinghen (34), seven leagues north
east   of the port of Boulogne, are the principal ones worked
in this department. The annual product of the mines in
this department amounts to from six to nine millions of
myriagrammes.          The coals in general are not of so good a
quality    as  those   of  the departments      to the north of Jem-
mappes;      but  mixed    with  a little of  these   coals they are of
excellent use for forges : when delivered at the ports of
Boulogne, Gravelines, and Dunkirk, they are sold tor eight
cents per myriagramme.

    The cantons of Montgic, Brassac, Auzat-sur-Allier              (35)
situated    above    the  Issoire, exhibit several important coal
mines, worked tor a long time, and particularly those of
Sallcs, Combelle, and Barre. That of Grosmenil, which
had been long abandoned on account of its being inundated
with water, has been lately resumed by a company who
have found means to overcome this difficulty.                 The pro
ducts of these coal mines amount to about a million of

    These three departments have no coal mines worked.

 in that of the Lower Pyrenees, at a small distance from
 Salies ; but hitherto they have afforded very little hopes.
          Departments    of  the Upper and    Lower Rhine.
    The   coal mines worked in these two departments (36)
 are not of much importance.          They are, however, valuable
 for the resources which they afford to the cantons where
 they are situated.    The product of them amounts to about
 200,000 myriagrammes per annum.
    At Lamperlosch, in the canton of Soultz, in the Lower
 Rhine, strata of sand containing asphaltum are worked.
This bituminous substance is separated, by particular pro
cesses, from the earthy matters with which it is united, and
employed in commerce.           It is applied to the same pur
poses as pitch, and when mixed with grease is used for
daubing over the pivots of machines, axles, &c.

    Several researches have been made in this department in
the hope of meeting with coals ; but it does not appear that
any mines have yet been worked in it. Some of the coals
it consumes are brought from the departments of La Saarre
and La Roer, but the greater part come from the mines
situated on the right bank of the Rhine. It is estimated that
these mines furnish annually 150,000 myriagrammes.

    Coal mines are known in          several places of this depart

the department of La Loire.           The annual product, how
ever, of these mines amounts         only to 50 or 60,000 myria
grammes per annum.

  III.    Observations and Experiments on the Light emitted by
      rotten Wood in the different Kinds of Gas, and in Fluids.
      By C. W. Bookman, of Carlsruhe *.
  .[Notwithstanding             the great number of accurate expe
  riments and of ingenious observations which have been al
 ready made known by several eminent philosophers in re-
           to the light emitted by rotten wood in the different
 fard
    inds of gas and other mediums, it is still difficult to ex
 plain this phænomenon in a satisfactory manner ; and this
 difficulty is increased, because great variations occur both in
 the observations, and in the consequences                 deduced from
 them.
      Thus Spallanzani found a perfect analogy between the
 luminous appearance of rotten wood and that of phospho
       f
 rus ; and conjectures, that by the putrid fermentation of the
 wood its hydrogen and carbon come more readily into con
 tact with the oxygen of the atmosphere ; and that this com
 bination is a slow combustion, which occasions the luminous
 appearance of the wood.             In the non-respirable gases this,
 according to Spallanzani's opinion, cannot take place for
 want of oxygen ; and he infers that every kind of rotten
 wood is not luminous, because the necessary quantity of
hydrogen and carbon does not always happen to be extri
cated at the same time.
      On the other hand, Mr. Carradori            J  is of opinion, from
other experiments, that rotten wood emits light without this
slow combustion taking place, and that the non-respirable
          make on the wood only a transient impression capa-
   le of preventing the efflux of light, which, on the con
fases
trary, is promoted and increased by the peculiar action of
oxygen gas. The observed decrease in the volume of the
oxygen gas he considers as not decisive, because this de-

crease is produced by many substances without combustion,
or without being exactly phosphorus.              The above theory
respecting this luminous appearance he thinks not altoge
ther improbable, because the wood at the period when it
begins to be luminous has, for the most part, lost its re
sinous particles, and therefore contains little hydrogen or
carbon.      He is of opinion also that rotten wood approaches
nearer to phosphorescence the more it loses its inflammable
matter, and that on this depends its susceptibility of ab
sorbing and retaining light.             According to Carradori's
meaning,      however,    there   is  a greater difference between
this natural phosphorus and that of Kunckel.
   Humboldt *, that assiduous and philosophic observer,
deduces from his well known experiments that the lumi
nous appearance of rotten wood in general is possible only
during its contact with oxvgen gas ; and that the wood,
which loses its phosphorescence in the non-respirable gases,
acquires it again immediately by the access of new oxygen
gas.
    In the last place, M. Gartners, in consequence of his
interesting experiments on the luminous appearance of rot
ten wood, considers a certain degree of moisture as a ne
cessary condition, and is of opinion that oxygen gas is less
essential, even though the phosphorescence is promoted by
it. But as this phenomenon differs so much from all the
hitherto known processes of combustion accompanied with
an extrication of light, he proposes this question : May not
this phenomenon have more relation to the process of ani
mal respiration than to realBconibustion ? Or whether the
 luminous appearance of wood be not produced by the union
of phosphorus and carbon in a certain proportion still un
 known to us f        But even if it should be admitted that
during the process of emitting light water is decomposed,
it is difficult, according to his opinion, to determine what
becomes of the liberated hydrogen.             M. Gartner therefore
considers it as still impossible to give a satisfactory explana
tion of the phenomena which occur during this process.
    In consequence of the numerous experiments which I
have made for several years past on Kunckel's phosphorus
in the different kinds of gas, the most remarkable of which
 1 have already communicated to the public in a particular
treatise, I was desirous to see what phenomena would be
 exhibited in them by phosphorescent wood, and also in

SO             On tlie Light entitled by rotten iPbod'
other mediums : I hoped also that during these researches f
might fall upon some new fact or idea, as is often the case,
which might serve to confirm or to throw some new light
on either the one or the other of these opinions.       As soon
therefore as I had procured some phosphorescent wood I
began with it a series of experiments, a part of which, with
the consequences deduced from them, I shall here lay before
the public, after 1 have made a few previous remarks.
    In regard to the wood itself, it was part of the old rotten
trunk of a beech-tree, moderately moist, and without any
              mouldv smell.    It was not luminous throughout,
  ut emitted light only from its surface to the depth of a
Particular
few lines. The luminous parts appeared to have lost in a
considerable degree their resinous particles. They were fria
ble, full of fibres, and whiter than those parts of the wood
which emitted a weaker light, or had no light at all. I
preserved the rotten wood in moist filtering paper in a cellar
the temperature of which was from 10 to 12 of Reaumur;
and in this place I made my observations during the night.
The colour of the light was exactly the same as that exhi
bited by the light of artificial phosphorus in atmospheric
air.
   I used for my experiments, in general, small bell glasses
capable of containing from 8 to 14 cubic, inches each, hav
ing a neck at the top exactly shut by corks boiled in wax,
through which passed a varnished wire.         I stuck a piece of
phosphorus on the wire in the inside of the bell ; filled the
vessel, according to the nature of the gas to be employed,
either with water or quicksilver ; and then placed it on the
pneumatic tub. By the pressure which these fluids exer
cised on the wood, small air bubbles, which must have been
contained in the substance of the wood, from time to time,
escaped ; and therefore before each experiment I took care
to immerse the wood in water till no more air ascended,
and by these means prevented the gases from being rendered
impure.
                           Experiment I.
    I filled a bell with atmospheric air, and preserved it closed
by means      of water.   During the first two days the rotten
wood remained luminous; on the third the light was some
what fainter ; on the fourth it had considerably decreased ;
and on the seventh the light had entirely disappeared.        The
wood, when taken out and exposed to the atmospheric air,
emitted no light either when dry or when moistened with
water. I then introduced into the remaining gas a piece
of wood which was strongly phosphorescent : it emitted a
                                                           briiriit

          in the different Kinds        of   Ga<, and in Fluids.              21
bright light, and even at the end of twenty-tour hours I
could observe no decrease of any consequence.
   The remaining gas, when subjected to examination bv
means of Fontana's eudiometer, in which I mixed it with
the same quantity of nitrous gas, showed a decrease of 30
degrees.   A taper immersed in this gas was immediately
extinguished.   Phosphorus evaporated strongly in    and           it,        it
rendered lime water pretty turbid, without     considerable
                                                          a
quantity of the gas being absorbed.
                                Experiment     II.
 I   silled   bell glass with oxygen gas prepared from oxide
              a
of  manganese well washed with milk of lime.               The wood
immersed in        did not emit
                  it                 stronger light
                                        a             than   in atmo
spheric  air or  water.    At  the   end' of  forty-eight   hours   the
light  seemed    to  decrease     little,
                                    a     and   on  the  sixth   day          it
was about     athird weaker. The phosphorescence afterwards
slowly decreased      on the 14th day
                       ;                       ceased entirely, and
                                                it
was not afterwards revived in the open air.             The volume
of the gas decreased very little, scarcely 0"2. Having put
another piece of wood into the remaining gas,              continued
                                                              it
to emit light without being weakened.
   On trying the gas which remained                  in
                                                  an eudiometer,              it
showed only       decrease of 21 degrees; and in about 15 se
                  a
conds, when the red vapour of the nitrous acid had disap
peared,I   observed     faint whitish vapour from the gas float
                           a
ing over the water. For the sake of comparison                  tried
                                                                   I          a
portion of the same oxygen gas in similar bell closed in
                                                 a
the same manner with water, but in which no wood had
been immersed, and found that in the same eudiometer                          it
showed    a diminution of 266 degrees. Artificial phosphorus,
when placed in the remaining gas, became luminous and
evaporated.     A taper immersed in           was immediately ex
                                                it
tinguished    :   was not inflammable, had no considerable
                  it
smell of mouldiness, and rendered lime water turbid but                  ;
                               by
it was not absorbed           in any considerable degree.
                               it
   Having repeated this experiment several times, obtained     I
similar results, or results very little different. The phos
phorescence     of the wood, however, decreased once on the
fourth day, and ceased totally on the seventh             though the
                                                          ;
gas, when subjected to proof, showed            diminution of from
                                                     a
80 to 120 degrees.      This difference may have arisen chiefly
from  a  difference       the nature of the wood; for
                           in                                       not
                                                                   it    is
possible to obtain two pieces exactly the same in- every re
spect. On the wood which had emitted light                in
                                                         oxygen gas
I  observed no mouldiness, nor any perceptible alteration.

82             On the Light emitted    ly rotten Wood
It  did not appear that the want of moisture was a principal
cause    of the cessation of the phosphorescence; for I found
the wood often moist in a greater or less degree, and espe
cially when it came in contact with the water by which the
mouth of the bell was closed.
                          Experiment    III.
    I filled several bell glasses with azotic gas as pure as pos
sible, which I had separated from atmospheric air by long
continued agitation of an amalgam of lead, or by six months
action of a solution of alkaline sulphuret, or by moist gar
den earth, and which tried in an eudiometer mixed with
nitrous gas exhibited no diminution.         The phosphorescence
of the wood in this gas continued at first without any de
crease, and as strong as in oxygen gas ; but after from one
to four hours it became weaker in the different bells : in
some it ceased entirely at the end of an hour and a half, in
others not till the end of from five to fourteen hours ; the
 cause of which, in all probability, was the unavoidable di
versity in the nature of the pieces of wood. After 24 hours
 I introduced into several of these bells from half a cubic
 inch to an inch of fresh azotic gas ; but in neither of these
 cases was there the least appearance of light.       But having
 introduced, with proper care, a new piece of wood, it emit
 ted, in these as well as in the other vessels which had received
 no mixture of new azotic gas, as strong a light as in at
 mospheric air, and continued undiminished for some time.
 In some of the bells it was not extinguished till the end of
 S, 4, or 5 hours, though no oxygen gas had been intro
 duced.
                           Experiment IV.
    I put into some of the bells along with the rotten wood
 small bits of phosphorus ; and having introduced some of
 the above azotic gas, the wood and the phosphorus both
 began to be luminous.        At the end of an hour the lumi
 nous appearance of the wood was considerably weakened,
 and it at length decreased so much that its light could no
 longer be distinguished any more than that of the phos
 phorus.      At the end of 24 hours, when the light of both
 substances had already ceased tor a considerable time, I in
 troduced, with proper caution, a new piece of wood into
 the gas in which the former still continued luminous.          A
proof that by this operation no atmospheric air had been
 introduced was, that the phosphorus remained dark, and
 I could observe no luminous vapour in the glass. In about
                                                                an

          in tlie different Kinds of Gas, and in Fluids.      23
an hour and a half the phosphorescence of the wood hud
for the most part ceased.       At the Ind of 24 hours I there
fore introduced another piece of wood, which exhibited the
same phænomena as the preceding.            This operation was
often repeated in the same gas. When the luminous ap
pearance of the wood became weak, it recovered nearly its
original splendour, in the course of a few minutes, on
placing it in atmospheric air. I tried the remaining gas in
the eudiometer, but could observe no decrease ; which proves
that the gas had remained free from any mixture of oxygen
gas.
   When a piece of luminous phosphorus is placed near the
wood, it is difficult to determine the moment when the
light of the latter becomes entirely extinct : for I found
that the phosphorus generally remains luminous a consi
derable time longer than the wood, and even after its light
is extinguished a somewhat luminous vapour arises; so that
on account of this vapour it is not easy to ascertain when
the phosphorescence of the wood ceases.        It is equally dif
ficult to observe, whether, on the admission of oxygen gas
to azotic gas containing wood and phosphorus, the light of
which is extinct, both these substances begin to be luminous
at the same time, or not; for at first the gas is entirely illu
minated by the luminous vapour; and besides this, the
surface of the rotten wood becomes entirely luminous, in
consequence of the phosphoric particles deposited on it ;
and hence it is difficult to determine whether the light pro
ceeds from itself or from these particles. I often found such
pieces of wood when taken out entirely penetrated with
particles of phosphorus. This observation may be of utility
to the future observer.
                           Experiment  V.
   I filled a common bell glass with phosphorated azotic gas,
in which a considerable quantity of phosphorus had re
mained several weeks, at the temperature of from 14 to 24°
of Reaumur, and in which fresh phosphorus neither eva
porated nor became luminous.          A piece of wood placed in
this gas continued at first luminous, without any decrease of
intensity.     In about half an hour however its light became
weaker, and in an hour entirely disappeared.       Next evening
I introduced into the same gas a fresh piece of wood, and
observed the same phænomena. On introducing more phos
phorus it emitted as little light as before.
                                 B 4                 Experiment

84             On the Light emitted by rotten Wood
                            Experiment     VI.
     I
    prepared impure phosphoric azotic eas by combustion
and long exposure to heat, with a sufficient quantity of
phosphorus shut up in a close vessel with atmospheric air.
In this gas a piece of rotten wood continued luminous for
an hour.     Having introduced another piece of wood, the
phosphorescence was the same as before ; and at the same
time artificial phosphorus emitted no light.
                            Experiment    VII.
   Rotten wood appeared phosphorescent in hydrogen gas,
prepared from iron and sulphuric acid, in which phosphorus
emitted no light ; but in the course of 30 or 40 minutes it
considerably decreased, and at length became entirely ex
tinct.  By the contact of atmospheric air the light was in
some measure revived.    As often as a fresh piece of rotten
wood was introduced into the remaining gas, it became lu
minous.    This experiment I several times repeated with the
same result.
                            Experiment    VIII.
     Having   placed rotten wood in carbonic hydrogen gas,
prepared   from the saw-dust of the beech tree, it became lu
minous at first, as in atmospheric air; but after 45 minutes
the phosphorescence gradually decreased, and in about an
hour entirely ceased. Every time I introduced a fresh piece
of wood into the remaining gas I observed the same result.
Artificial phosphorus in this gas gave no signs of light
whatever.
                         Experiment IX.
     I   introduced   rotten wood into phosphorated hydrogen
gas above a year old, during all which time a considerable
piece of phosphorus had remained in             it,
                                        and which had been
continually exposed to the solar heat. In this gas the wood
continued luminous without any decrease of its intensity.
At the end of an hour the light began to decrease, and in
an hour and   half had almost entirely ceased. Fresh wood
                a      it
introduced into the remaining gas exhibited the same phæ-
nomena     :   artificial phosphorus however          gave no signs   of
light.
                             Experiment    X.
 I   prepared fresh phosphorated hvdrogen gas, which, as              is
well known,      so unfavourable to the luminous property of
                 is
phosphorus,  even   in small quantity, in azotic gas or atmo
                                                               spheric

           in the different Kinds   of Gas, and in Fluids.     25
spheric air: in this gas the rotten wood was exceedingly
luminous.        Even at the end of an hour and a halt" I ob
served no decrease of the light; and it did not cease en
 tirely till the end of several hours.       Having introduced a
piece of fresh wood, at the end of 24 hours it was as lumi
nous as in atmospheric air, and the case was the same with
the 4th and 5th piece which I afterwards brought into con
tact with it.      At the conclusion of this experiment I could
easily   inflame  the   single bubbles of gas by means of a burn
ing   coal.
                             Experiment XI.
    I  introduced into a common bell glass over mercury
strong fuming sulphurized hydrogen gas, disengaged from
a solution of alkaline sulphuret and tartaric acid.       A piece
of rotten wood placed in this gas immediately ceased to be
phosphorescent. • If taken out when the light began to be
extinguished, the light could in some measure be revived by
washing it with water in atmospheric air. A fresh piece of
wood introduced exhibited the same phænomenon.              Want
of oxygen gas was not, in some cases where this experiment
was repeated, the cause of the light being suddenly extin
guished ; for the gas was not always perfectly pure.        Arti
ficial phosphorus would even at times emit in it a faint
¦vapour.
                            Experiment  XII.
    In carbonic acid gas prepared with proper care from
chalk and sulphuric acid diluted with water, and in which
phosphorus, partly by a natural heat and partly by gentle
heating in a vessel with hot water, had entirely ceased to be
luminous, a piece of rotten wood retained at first its full
phosphorescence:          the phosphorescence however in the
course of tour or five minutes considerably decreased, and
in 15 or 20 minutes no light was to be seen. Wood which
had thus lost all its luminous appearance, when washed with
water, seldom recovered its phosphorescence : if however it
retained     any light when taken out, it was somewhat
strengthened in atmospheric air, but after some time
greatly decreased, and at length entirely disappeared.
    Rotten wood exhibited almost the same phænomena in
carbonic acid gas, prepared with great care, but in which no
phosphorus had previously been exposed.
                           Experiment   XIII.
    Having brought nitrous gas, mixed with about 0*11
parts of azotic gas, into contact with a piece of rotten
                      /                                     wood,

 SO         Relation between the Specific Gravities and
 wood, it at first appeared perfectly luminous:                the light
 however speedily decreased, and in general ceased entirely
 at the end of from a minute and a half to three minutes :
 it was seldom renewed by washing the wood with water in
 atmospheric air. When a fresh piece of wood was intro
 duced into this gas, its phosphorescence and the duration
 of the light were the same as before.
                           Experiment      XIV.
    I   brought muriatic acid gas into contact with phosphor
 rescent wood, and observed that in the course of from one
 minute to a minute and a half its light ceased entirely. This
 phænomenon took place several times, as often as anew
piece of wood was brought into contact with the gas.                    It
 appeared    to  me,   in this  experiment,    that moist   wood  sooner
 became dark than dry wood.               The phosphorescence could
not be revived by the usual means.
                            Experiment      XV.
    Rotten wood, placed in ammoniacal gas newly prepared,
shone from one and a half to six minutes ; and the decrease
of the light was pretty speedv. When I took the wood
from the gas, I observed that it had a strong smell of am
monia; and after being washed with water it assumed, in a
considerable degree, its luminous property.                 The moister
the wood, the more the phosphorescence decreased; and
the gas was absorbed by it in the same proportion.
                           Experiment      XVI.
    Rotten wood appeared phosphorescent in newly prepared
muriatic gas a shorter time than in ammoniacal gas ; and
when the Tight became extinguished, I was not able to revive
it. A part of the gas was absorbed by the somewhat moist
wood.

alcohol, or pure spirit of wine, and water; and as differing

                                                                    only

only from each other in the proportion in which these sub
stances enter into their composition.              The former of these
fluids, considered as in a state of chemical purity, or alto
gether unmixed with any heterogeneous substance, is, how
ever, by no means well known.              The most highly rectified
spirit which has ever yet been procured has probably still
contained no inconsiderable quantity of water, which it is
the. object of the process of rectification to separate ; and
though we obtain spirit which is more and more dephleg-
mated as we advance in our knowledge of practical chemistry,
yet we have reason to believe that the ultimate point of ab
solute purity has never yet been attained.
    § 2. The latter of these ingredients being of no value, it
follows that every such compound must, cœteris paribus,
be appreciated by the quantity of the former which it con
tains ; and we could therefore at once estimate its value if
we could determine that quantity.              It is not, however, ab
solutely necessary      for this   appreciation that we should be in
 possession    of  the   actual   quantity of alcohol which is con
 tained in any given liquor : if we can discover the propor
 tion which that quantity bears to the quantity entering into
the composition of any other given liquor, we shall be in
 possession of its relative value, when compared with that of
 such other.
     § 3. This proportional value, therefore, will be no less
 truly ascertained,   if,   instead of considering alcohol as our
 standard in this respect, we should take spirit of an inferior
 strength as being so, and appreciate all spirituous com
 pounds   by   reference to the quantity of such standard spirit
 which would be capable of producing or being produced
 by   the given compound,            by the addition of water to the
 strongest   of  the   two  till  they  were  reduced to the same de
 gree   of strength.     The   real  quantity   of alcohol, properly so
  called, which  is  contained in any mixture, being, from our
 ignorance of this fluid in state of chemical purity, impos
                                 a
  sible to be ascertained, we have naturally been obliged to
  have recourse to the latter mode of appreciating the values
  of spirituous liquors     by   reference to the relative proportions
  in which this hitherto unknown substance enters into their
  composition, which are obtained             by comparing all of them
  with some other spirit of known strength as standard     a          ;
  and this has accordingly become the practice in every coun
  try in which these kinds of liquors form an important article
  of commerce. The strength of this assumed standard                  is
  merely arbitrary,   it   being sufficient for all purposes that    it
  be only certainly and precisely fixed.            This, however, has
                                                           unfortunately

 unfortunately not hitherto been the case in this counts)-,
 and is still less so in any other : the cares of government,
 in general, afford to those who are occupied by them but
 little leisure for abstruse research ; and the appreciation of
 quantity and quality in general has hitherto, therefore, been
 in a great measure left to individuals.
     § 4. Flavour, odour, colour, and consistence, are the
 objects of our external senses, and the quality of a liquor in
 these respects is discoverable by their assistance alone ; but
 a minute difference in the strengths of two kinds of spirit,
 which are otherwise similar, is not so easily detected : there
 are means of communicating to a liquor an apparently dif
 ferent strength from that which it really possesses, so long
 as its taste, smell, and appearance, are relied on as criteria
 by which it is to be estimated.
     § 5. Water and spirit of wine are of very different spe
 cific gravities : that of the former being, in a great measure,
 fixed and invariable at given temperatures,              whilst that of
 the latter is liable to so much uncertainty that it has not
 hitherto been ascertained what is the real weight of alcohol,
 properly so called ; the thing itself being, as we have before
 stated, scarcely known.          A very few years ago it was con
 ceived that a spirit whose specific gravity was 620* at 601
 of Fahrenheit's thermometer was as , erfectly free from any
 admixture of water as it was possible to render it ; and yet
 we are now able with ease to procure it lighter : the specific
 gravity of the best alcohol from Apothecaries' Hall being
 very commonly considerably less.              In some cases even a
 much greater degree of dephlegmation has been attained.
 Mr. Lewis, of Ilolborn, a very scientific rectifier, has ob
tained spirit whose specific gravity was less than 81 1 at 60°;
and Dr. Black is said to have procured it so light as 800, or
weighing only 4-5ths of the weight of an equal measure of
water.
     § 6. When two fluids of different weights are mixed to
gether, we may easily conclude that the specific gravity of
the compound will bear some relation to that of its compo
nent ingredients ; and it appears, therefore, to have been a
very obvious idea that the relative proportion of each in such
a mixture would be thus to be discovered.                In the present
improved state of science we see so much further than our
    * It has been most usual with writers on
                                              specific gravities to consider
that us distilled water as unity : we, however, have found it more con
ducive to the facility of denominating them, to consider it as iooo, and
which is accordingly done throughout tl is tract. " Eight hundred and
twenty," f»r example, is more easily expressed in. words than -^o.

          the Strengths and Values   of Spirituous Liquors.   69
predecessors,   that, without considering the elevation of the
 ground on which we stand, we are almost induced to doubt
 whether their intellectual powers were equal to our own.
The want of resource which our ancestors seem to have dis
 covers) in their attempts to ascertain the strengths of these
 liquors, by the shaking them in a phial, firing them over
gunpowder, and a thousand other still more fallacious
 means, wrhen the object which they had in view was so
 much more accurately and easily attainable by the simple
operation of weighing them, really appears, at first sight,
 somewhat remarkable. The consideration of all the details
relative to this subject involves a number of intricate points j
yet the merely ascertaining the weight of a given measure
of any liquor by a common pair of scales would doubtlessly
have afforded a better indication with regard to its strength
than any of the other modes of estimating it which are un
connected    with the consideration of this property.      It is
now, however, sufficiently agreed upon, that the best me
thod of ascertaining the relative values of spirituous liquors,
with regard to their difference of strength, is by means of
their specific gravities ; and the principles of this method,
therefore, will form the subject of the present tract.
    § 7- If a given bulk or measure of water and alcohol re
mained unchanged in everv temperature, and whether these
two fluids were mixed or separate, the ascertaining the real
specific gravity of the latter itself, or the estimation of the
quantity of each in any compound of the two, would be a
matter of no difficulty : the simple rules of alligation would
give all that could be required in this respect.    This, how
ever, is not the case: a variation of temperature,       or the
mixture of two spirituous compounds of different strengths,
or of any such liquor with water, occasions a change in
the aggregate bulk of the whole which is necessary to be
taken into consideration; and it will therefore be requisite
to treat separately of the effect of each of these operating
causes.
    § 8. It has long been known that all bodies in general,
whether solid or fluid, expand bv heat and contract by cold ;
and it follows that the same quantity of any fluid which,
when at an elevated temperature, would fill a measure of
given dimensions, must fall short of doing so if the tempe
rature should be lowered ; and, e converso, the same quan
tity which would be contained in the measure when cold
would when heated be more than sufficient to sill      itj
                                                     though
the absolute weight of the whole of the fluid would still
continue unchanged.      In speaking, therefore, of measure
                                                       a
                                                              of

30              Relation between the Specific Gravities and
of any liquid, we indicate nothing with        respect to its real
quantity, unless we at the same time express the tempera
ture at which it is to be measured.
    § 9< If an equal change took place in the bulks of alco
hol, and of water, and of every compound of them, by the
same elevation or depression of temperature, the application
of the necessary correction for this circumstance would be
still easy. The difference in this respect            is,
                                                   however, very
considerable: water increases only about l-300dth of its
bulk by an elevation of its temperature from 40° to 80° of
Fahrenheit's thermometer, whilst alcohol would,              simiby
                                                                  a
lar change of temperature, increase in measure no less than
l-43d of the whole, or seven times as much as the other;
and liquors of intermediate strengths would be affected in
some intermediate degree.      To estimate, therefore, the dif
ference in the measure produced by this cause, we must
know the strength of the liquor; whilst this, on the other
hand,      only to be determined with reference to the former.
           is
 §     10. The effect of which we are next to speak           of      is    a
still more curious nature. When two fluids which are ca
pable of chemical combination are mixed together,           gene  it
rally happens that either heat or cold      produced, the tem
                                                is
perature of the compound differing from the mean tempe
rature of its ingredients.     The former        most commonly
                                                     is
the case     and, when so,
               ;                happens in the greater number
                                 it
of instances, and perhaps in all, that diminution of the
                                                 a
bulk or measure of the compound also takes place, which
is  proportional to the heat so produced     probably in conse
                                                :
quence of this separation of caloric.
    If 18 gallons of water be mixed with the like quantity of
the strongest spirit of wine, the mixture will become consi
derably warmer, and we shall only get about 35 gallons of
the diluted spirit instead of 36 and this kind of effect
                                           :                                is
 also produced in less degree         by
                                   the addition of water to any
weaker spirit, or the mixture of two such liquors of dif
 ferent strengths     the resulting compound being always
                        ;
 found to occupy less space than the substances tormina:                    it
 did when separate      and its specific gravity being therefore
                            ;
 greater than would be inferred            by
                                        mere arithmetical calcu
 lation from those of its ingredients. This " concentration,"
 as  it   verv properly called, must of course be considered

 of liquor and the consideration of

                                                                       §   11"

      the Strengths and Values    of Spirituous Liquors.          31
    §11. The uniformity of the relation between the specific
gravities and the strengths of spirituous liquors depends on
a supposition that they are cither altogether composed of
alcohol and water, or at least in such a state of purity as to
be free from every adulteration which can materially change
the specific gravity, whilst the quantity of the former con
tinues the same ; for, unless this be the case, we shall of
course be unable to deduce their strength from their weight.
'she substances likely to be found in spirituous liquors,
where no fraud is suspected, are, essential oils, sometimes
empyreumatic, mucilaginous or extractive matter, and per
haps some saccharine matter. The effect of these, with the
exception of the latter, is perhaps scarcely such in the course
of trade as to be worth the cognizance of the excise, nor
could it easily be reduced to any certain rules. Essential
and empyreumatic oils are nearly of the same specific gra
vity as spirit, or generally rather lighter; and therefore,
notwithstanding the mutual penetration, will probably make
but little change in the specific gravity of any spirituous
liquor in which they are dissolved. The other substances
are all heavier than spirit ; the specific gravity of common
gum being 1482, and of sugar 1606, according to the ta
bles of M. Brisson.     The effects of them, therefore, will be
to make spirituous liquors appear less strong than they
really are.    With a view of determining this matter, Dr.
 Dollfuss evaporated 1000 grains of brandy, and the same
quantity of rum, to dryness : the former left a residuum of
40 grains, the latter only of 8 J- grains. The 40 grains of
residuum from the brandy, dissolved again in a mixture of
  100 of spirit with 50 of water, increased its specific gravity
•00041 : hence the effect of this extraneous matter upon
the specific gravity of the brandy containing         it,
                                                       would be
to increase the fifth figure     by six nearly, which     about
                                                             is
equal to the effect which would be produced in the above-
mentioned mixture,    by  the addition of     apint of water to
 100 gallons of the spirit; a   quantity much too minute for
the attention of government.      It appears, indeed, somewhat
 remarkable, both that so large       aproportion of residuum
 should have been left, and that upwards of -4th  1         by
                                                         weight
of this extractive matter should not have occasioned a
 greater difference than -2000th part in the specific gravity
                        1
 of this diluted spirit.    Saccharine matter operates much
 more powerfully in this respect.     If quantity of sugar be
                                          a
 dissolved in proof spirit, it  will become very considerably
 increased in its weight, and consequently diminished in its
 apparent strength and value.     There will perhaps, however,
                                                                  be

 be but little danger          of fraud of this nature, if the purchasers
 of spirituous liquors            are to use the same      means         of   ascer
  taining their strengths as the officers of the revenue ; since
  that which would apparently diminish them to the one,
  would also lessen their value in the estimation of the other.

  known that when alcohol         distilled with any of those acids
                                      is
  which retain their oxygen least powerfully, the former                           is
  converted into æther         very different fluid, which

     Effects, simple Means of eradicating, &c. : and Obser
     vations on. Bleaching, the BeSult of long Experience. By
     Nicholas Giumshaw, Esq. Member of the Dublin
     Society*.
JI/very       one who has attended to the process of bleaching,
must have observed a buff hue in the cloth after it had been
spread on the field, or immersed in oxygenated                         muriatic
acid (bleaching liquor).
     Having thought much on the subject, tried experi
ments innumerable, and being of opinion that irons was
the cause, I, on the 22d of September last, cut a yard of
calico off one of the pieces then in the first bleaching-
liquor, which had been previously boiled in potash, which
piece (as well as many of the 100 then in the same kieve)
was a deep buff. The yard of calico was put into a hot so
lution of sumach (astringent), and it soon became a deep
     * From the
                  Transactions of the Dublin Son' sty, vol. i. part 2.— That iron
is verv generally diffused throughout the globe, being frequently found
 mixed with s.md, clay, chalk, and 111ihe ashes of vegetables, and even in
the bl od of animals, in such abundance, that-some authors have attri-
 ruted both the colours of vegetables, and of the vital fluid itself, to the
 iron c mtained iu them, is no new discovery: but, that the bad colour of
 linen and cotton cloth is owing to the evii edicts of the iron contained in
 the le^crab'cs, was. first tiioug. t of by the author of the following es
 say, wtiich is a strong proof of the great utility of chemical knowledge
 in bringi.ig manufactures to perfection.
     f Since my arrival in Oubl'ii, Mr. Hig'gins, professor of chemistry, &c.
 accompanied me to a neighbouring bleach green; we cut a bit of calico
 off- a piece then in the first bleaching liquor, and which had had one boil
  in potash ; it whs hurt, and "ii tryingit with marine acid and prussiate of
 potash it became blue; a convincing        proof that iron was present.     The
 following expeiimcnts al-o were made iu the presence of Mr. Higgins,
 and his verv respscuble operating pupils, in the elaboratory of the
  Dublin Society.      Six ounces of unbleached calico was burned to tinder
  in a crucible i digested it with marine acid, and filtered it; poured prus
  siate or potash on the solution, and tound a copious precipitation of prus
  siate of iron; filtered the liquor, having previously        weighed the filter
  (45 grains), and found when dry it had retained eight grains of the
 prussiate of iron.
      Six ounces of linen, treated in the same manner, produced six grains
  of prussi it<-of iron.

drab colour: it was then dyed in madder, which brought it
to a deep purple; and on bleaching it for a fortnight,       I
found the colour as permanent as if a solution of iron
(iron-liquor), or sulphate of iron (copperas), had been used
as a  mordant, but more muddy.
    I was then satisfied that a considerable quantity of iron
was present, not only in the raw material of cotton, but in
consequence of some weavers making or allowing their
dressing to remain in iron pots, which they generally call
sowings in Ireland, and sowlings in Lancashire.
    The dressing is nearly the same in both countries, as it
consists of the farina (flour) of wheat, oats, or potatoes,
and, when sour, is capable of dissolving iron.    This is well
known from iron liquor used by calico printers being
made with vegetable acid, in which they put iron hoops.
This iron liquor is the mordant for black and purple, and is
dyed in logwood or madder; and when, in consequence of
accident in printing, it is necessary to discharge the black
or purple colour before they are dyed, if recourse is had to
oxygenated muriatic acid, an iron mould is produced, that
is, the colour becomes buff or gold ; but use sulphuric or
marine acid, and the colour is discharged. I have men
tioned this circumstance for the purpose of showing why
some pieces assume a much deeper buff than others, when
put into the oxygenated muriatic acid, as the quantity of
iron put on the warp by the weavers will depend on their
using or not using iron pots, the strength of the acid of
their dressing, the rust or cleanness of their pot, and con
sequently the quantity of iron it holds in solution.
    The experiment however, before mentioned, induced me
to take loo pieces which had been once boiled in potash
 and washed, and immerse them in sulphuric acid (bleachers
sours), and after remaining about 12 hours they were
washed, and again boiled in potash.
     After being washed and without being put on the bleach-
green, they were put into the oxygenated muriatic acid tor
 tfie usual time (about 12 hours), and came out perfectly
 free from any buff appearance ; which convinced me, as it
must every one who knows its use, that the sulphuric acid
 had divested them of iron, and consequently had left none
 to be oxidated by the oxygenated muriatic aeid, or the
 oxygen of the atmosphere. They were again boiled and
 immersed in the bleaching liquor alternately, until they had
 six boils, and live bleaching liquors; and on the seventh
 day, without being put on the grass, they were the whitest
 and strongest pieces I had ever seen : and during the pro
 cess appeared uncommonly clear; for after the fourth boil
                                                          they

                           On Bleaching.                     35
  they were sufficiently white for every purpose except print
  ing.   More than 5000 pieces have been bleached at my
  works (at White House, near Belfast) in the same manner,
  without any appearance whatever of buff, as before men
 tioned : only half the usual quantity of oxygenated muriatic
  acid has been used; the receiver affording sufficient for
 seven to eight parcels of calicoes, which before was only
 equal to three or four — So much less was required to bring
 the liquor in the kieve to its usual strength, (which was
 ascertained by the test of solution of indigo in sulphuric
 acid,) and so little had the liquor been exhausted by oxidat
 ing the iron in the cloth, &c. in lieu of acting on the co
louring part.
     It has been long known, and as long lamented by the
 calico printers, that yellow stains have appeared after the
 printed pieces have been dyed, and that such stains cannot
 be bleached out without reducing and materially injuring
the colours.     Prior to the commencement of the process      I
have described (I mean, the use of sours previous to the
cloth being exposed to the oxygen of the atmosphere, by
being spread on the field, or immersed in the oxygenated
muriatic acid) a considerable quantity of calicoes had those
stains ; but I am happy to state, that on dyeing in the same
parcels, and the same coppers, pieces of the old process, and
pieces of the new, the latter were perfectly clear, and the
first stained.
    This defect continued as long as any of the old bleach
remained, but with them stains entirely disappeared.      The
new bleach were perfectly clear, by lying two or three days
on the grass, after dyeing : the old not in as many weeks. ,
    It is unnecessary to say to men of practice and science,
that the same process of bleaching is applicable to linen and
to cotton, linen requiring only a stronger process and more
time, or that iron oxidated and iron moulds are the same ;
and that the quality of cloth is in consequence injured, as
they are generated bv combustion in consequence of the
union of oxygen gas : hence the quantity of bucks (rotten
linens) and linens also resuming a yellow hue after being
bleached and exposed to the air, which acts on the iron re
maining in the cloth,
    The eye of the scientific mind will discover at the first
glance, that a solution of sulphuric acid will take up or dis
solve iron in the cloth, and render it miscible, or soluble in
water, if applied previous to its becoming an oxide.
    Let us then look at what the bleacher has to contend
with and to eradicate : and it will be found he has the resin
or colouring matter of the flax or cotton, iron, and the
                               C  2                   weaver's

 weaver's dressing as before mentioned ; to which mav be
 added a little butter or tallow. An addition of the last article
stakes place by the dropping of the candles during the winter.
    The first object then is to divest the cloth of the sowing*.
 This is done by steeping in water, summer heat (76° of
 Fahrenheit), ana washing.
    The second is to dissolve the grease applied bv the
 weaver,      and some of the resinous part. This is done by a
 boil or buck in alkali, and washing.
    The third is to divest the cloth of iron ; which is most
 effectually done by steeping in sours for JO or 12 hours,
 and washing immediately.
     After another boil, the bleacher may proceed as before
 mentioned; or proceed in any other manner his experience
 or opinion may direct— as he will derive all the advantages
 stated to result from the use of sours previous to exposure,
 to air or bleaching liquor : let his after-process be any one
 of those now in use.
     But I by all means advise him to throw his cloth loose
 into the steeping-kieve, furnace, sours, and bleaching li
 quor, during the early part of the process, so that the cloth
 may be equally acted upon ; by which means he will avoid
 those dark clouds which must alwavs appear when the cloth
 has been kept in the band during the above processes.
    Those who use the rope-net and crane (and every one
 ought to use them) will find no additional trouble, and will
 be much pleased with the evenness of the pieces.
     Let the first sour be strong, and wash well: the other
 sours mav be continued in the usual stages of bleaching,
 using one less in consequence of the previous sour*.
    The strength of the boils should be proportioned to the
 quantity of resin or colouring matter of the cloth ; conse
 quently the first should be the strongest, as the resin or co
 louring matter of the cloth is capable of saturating a greater
 quantity of alkali than it is afterwards: and it should~bc re
 collected that the cloth possesses, in the first instance, the
 grease of the weaver's dressing, which, by uniting with the
 alkali, becomes saponaceous (soapv), and is in consequence
 easily washed off.
    The alkaline hydrometer should by all means be used by
 the bleachers to ascertain the strength or* their leys: they
 will in a moment see the number of ounces of alkali to a
 gallon, and can by a simple tables see how many gallons
 arc necessary, so as lo give them a certain weight to each

jiiccc, and which should always be proportioned to the
thickness of the cloth, and, as before mentioned, to the
quantity of colouring matter to be dissolved.
    Those who use the bleaching liquor, either early or late
in the process> should immerse or steep the cloth in it after
it had been boiled and washed, but never to put the cloth
from the field into       as they will find, as
                        it,                        have done, that

the quality will be destroyed.
 I    have likewise found that cloth, either linen or cotton,
neither stiffens with the callender or beetling,         dried after
                                                                 if
being only washed out of the bleaching liquor                  must   ;

to be put on the grass for      few days previous to finishing;
                                   a
and  I  advise the linen bleachers to give at least one boil in
ashes after the last bleaching liquor, not only to prevent the
cloth being soft or slack after finishing, but as the best
means of preventing mildews (so much complained of)                              by
the attraction of moisture.
    If any further proof was necessary to confirm what has
been before stated relative to the utility of early souring,                     it
will every day be found        the process of dipping or dyeing
                               in
china blue, which    is  performed       alternate immersion in
                                               by                                 a
solution of lime or ashes and sulphate of iron (copperas),
by   which the iron      precipitated on the cloth;
                        is                                    easily
                                                                  it   is
removed    by  immediate souring      but  :  the cloth
                                                    if      exposed   is
for some time to the air, the iron cannot be dissolved with
out injury to the texture or fibres, and the colour.
 I     therefore entreat the bleachers of linen, calico, or
muslin, will try the effects of souring after the first boil, in
the manner before mentioned; and after the second boil
that they will pursue such process as they have most im
proved on (cither bleaching on the field entirely, or the                       al
ternate process of bleaching on the field after           few boils,
                                                                  a
and then using the bleaching liquor with lime or ashes, in
their receivers):   this will most effectually enable them to
compare the relative progress, &cc, and which will be very
obvious in favour of early souring.
    In a conversation     afew davs ago with Mr. Whiteman,
of LUburn, on the subject of bleaching, he told me that his
 muslins had the buff appearance        had described, not only
                                           I
 in the process of bleaching, but that he had then some un
 saleable, even at  a loss of lo per cent., in consequence of
that buff or muddy appearance,            specimen of which he
                                               a
gave   me,  and  in which     considerable
                               a             quantity of prussiate
of iron has been found.
    The muslins, calicoes, and linens, bought in the white for
 printing at my works, are generally stained and bad whites

 On Soap, substituted for Bran in Bleaching*              By   the same.
     The legislatures of Great Britain and Ireland have adopted
 wise and salutary measures for increasing the quantity of
 food,    byoffering bounties on importation         ;they have like
 wise lessened its consumption         by stopping the distilleries.
  It becomes then the indispensable duty of all, especially in
  periods such as the present, to avoid the smallest waste or
 misapplication of food. Bran,             given to horses, saves
                                           if
 corn ;if  to horned cattle,   it produces milk, butter, or beef;
 but when used      by calico printers,    it worse than throwing
                                                is
it  away  ; for  in  most   casesit   isnot  only unnecessary ana
 expensive,   but  injurious.    There      still
                                           is        astronger reason
 for avoiding the waste of     it,on which at present it       isbetter
 to be silent.     Prejudice,  therefore,  will   give place to public-
 good, and the calico printers may rely on the following pro
 cess, as  it  has been practised for more than           a year     by   a
 house of long experience and proficiency in that business.
     Let six or seven pounds of black or soft soap be well
 dissolved in hot water; pour about two-thirds of the above
 into a  copper of hot water (180 to 100° of Fahrenheit):
 when the calicoes or muslins which have been dyed in mad
 der are washed as for branning, give them five or six ends
 over the wince, taking only three pieces of calico or six of
 muslin at time, that they may be even. Renew your cop
               a
 per with the remainder ot the soap, and through one cop
 per may be done twenty-seven or thirty calicoes, and about
double the number of muslins.            Let them be washed as
after bran, and pinned on the grass if the cloth has been
                                            :
well bleached, muslins will be white, on an average, in two
days, calicoes in four. The colours will have             amuch finer
hue than        the use of bran.
               by
    N. B. Soap has been used for taking out stains, but by
branning before soaping the stain has been more fixed                     :
therefore bran should not be used.

VI.       Of   the   Herring Fishery.      Translated from an Essay
     in Dutch,        entitled   "   Beschryving van de Haringvis-
     scherye*."
J.   he herring inhabits the Northern      seas, and probably
amidst the great Ice islands, spawns     in the months of Au
gust and September, and multiplies      so  astonishingly, that
notwithstanding the great destruction ot' them by the fish
of prey and men, the species is not sensibly diminished.
The herring belongs to that class which emigrate. They
make their appearance yearly in prodigious numbers. The
great shoal, in its progress from the North, divides into two
principal branches; the right wing goes westward, falls
towards the coasts of Iceland in the month of March ; the
left inclines to the eastward.    These two grand divisions
are afterwards split into several subdivisions : some bend
their course towards Newfoundland,          others towards the
coasts of Norway, and partly fall into the Baltic through
the Sound; while another part turns the north point of
Shetland, where it stretches along the coast, until it joins
the division (through the Belt) which entered the Baltic.
They separate again, to cover the coasts of Holstein, the
Texel, the Zuiderzee, &c.
   The westerly column, or right wing, which is also the
greater, goes on straight forward towards the Orcadcs (where
the Dutch fishers impatiently lie in wait for them), and
from thence to Scotland, where they again separate, one
wing steering by the coast of Holland, England, and France,
the other taking the route of Ireland.         After passing all
these islands, they again meet, and form into a column,
which stretches alona; the Atlantic ocean and disappears.
But what justlv challenges our admiration          that after se   is,
parating into so many different branches, they know how
to rally their scattered squadrons, and find the way back to
their native abode.     The time of meeting, and the place of
rendezvous, arc settled, so that after the general retreat not
one straggler     to be met with
                     is              these seas. in
     How regular   soever the period of yearly emigration ap
pears,    it  not
               is free from anomalies.         may appear sur
                                                            It
prising that, these  animals, who   are secured from the perse
cution of their enemies, in the unfathomable depths of the
Northern ocean,           by
                        an impregnable rampart of ice, should
forsake their safe retreat yearly, in myriads, exposed on our
coasts to great and imavoidable havoc.       Is   not  striking   it           a

 instance of the goodness of divine providence, to draw this
 prodigious swarm of useful fish into our nets? This expla
 nation, however pious, affords little light to the natural
 historian, who may be inclined to ask : Since divine provi
 dence is so gracious in this respect, why does it not send us
 a troop of whales to furnish us with train oil at less labour
 and cost than we can now procure it? The celebrated
 burgomaster of Hamburg, Mr. Anderson, is of opinion,
 that the emigration of herrings is owing to the overflow of
 young ones, who, not finding sufficient room in their old
 habitations, sally out in quest of new settlements, as so
  many colonies.        This opinion does not at all account for
  the phænomenon.           How can periodical emigrations, al
  ways taking place      at stated seasons, proceed from so uncer
  tain a cause as the mere accident of an overflowing popu
  lation ?
      How will this hypothesis account for the constant ad
  herence to the same track, the separation and reunion of
  the main body, at stated places and at stated times?
  Whereas mere want of room would drive them indiscrimi
  nately towards any or all places.        2dly, So far from being
  the effect of excessive multiplication,        it seems to be the
  motive of it. They are not the only species which under
  goes long voyages for the sake of propagation. Many birds
   of passage, such as the woodcock, wild-goose, &c. do the
   same.     In fact, the herrings multiply more on the route
   than they do before it ; we Know that many kinds of fish
   leave the sea, and seek the rivers to deposit their spawn : so
   that one very probable cause of the emigration is, the in
   stinct of emigration; the second, the plenty of food which
   the quickening influence of spring prepares, by the swarms
   of insects and flies. The king or leader of herrings is
   much larger than the common, being two sect long; fishers
   think it criminal to destroy it; the whole column follows
. and observes       his motions.     In a streight they contract, in
   an open sea they expand their order of inarch with admi
    rable dexterity, without slackening their pace.        They live
    on small fishes and young crabs, as appears from their
   jaws being furnished with teeth.        Lewenhoeck found in the
    stomach of a herring the indigested remains of a little fish.
       To form some conception of the innumerable multitude
    of herrings that sill the seas, extending more than the
    breadth of England and Ireland together, and in order to
    give a clear insight into this profitable branch of trade, we
   .shall first treat of the ships and implements used in the fish
    ery: 2dly, of the time and manner of taking them : 3dly,
    of the regulations and right of earning on the fishery, the

gutting, salting, packing, &c. ; 4thly, of the different sorti
and appellations of herrings, which make an article of
commerce : 5thly, of the inspectors and overseers of this
commerce.
   The vessels employed in this fishery are, time out of
mind, called buizxeni.      The English use a kind of vessels
carrying from 60 to 70 tons. The Dutch vessels are from
25 to 30 lastsj some are 40, but seldom so much.          Each of
these has ten, twejve, or fourteen men aboard, who are
hired at so much per week, except the steersman, who re
ceives five florins for each last ot herrings.      The crew re
ceive, over and above their pay, a present of herrings pro
portioned to the take, which present is the only wages of
the younger part of the crew or apprentices. A Dutch
fishing smack cos^s new about nine thousand florins; the
costs of fitting for two voyages are about six thousand
florins, and for three voyages, about eight thousand.         Mr.
Semeyns computes the expense       of fitting out  a vessel of  66
lasts (including prime cost) to amount to 7,530 florins, to
make three voyages in the course of a year.
   Here follows an accurate list of all the vessels sent out
yearly, from 1 763 to 1776, on an average of thirteen years.

                   Os   tlie    Herring Fishery.             43
    In 1774, the number of vessels sent out amounted to
 165, and in 1776 to 176.         From this brief exposition of
the number of vessels employed in the fishery, it appears
that a great decline has taken place since the year 1601,
when 1500 vessels were sent out yearly from the United
Provinces.       The cause of this decline seems to be, the
          attention which other nations pay to this branch of
freater
   shery.    It remains, however, certain, that the Dutch me
thod of curing is superior to that of their neighbours.       The
diminution of trade was necessarily accompanied by a pro
portional diminution of national prosit ; formerly thousands
were supported by this branch who are now out of employ
ment.      Government omitted nothing that could revive this
declining branch of trade. Thus, on the 19th of May 1775
the government offered a premium of five hundred florins
for any ship which should be employed two years succes
sively in the herring fishery, and for the second two years
four hundred florins : yet some abuses happened in conse
quence ; for some, having got the premiums, discontinued
to send out their vessels.     As the selling prices of herrings
Vary with     the season and  plenty, it is scarce possible to as
certain with exactness the profits of one voyage. We shall,
however, attempt an average account, from which it will
appear that the herring fishery is worthy of every encou
ragement, as a branch of industry highly advantageous to
the community.        A buss of thirty-two lasts, fitted out for
three voyages, costs, as we already observed, between six
teen and seventeen thousand florins ; each last of herrings
contains twelve tons, and each ton about eight hundred
herrings : the whole lading then of the buss amounts to
about 3S0 tons; and if each herring be estimated at half a
stiver (i.    e. twenty florins the ton), the amount will be
 7600 florins, which multiplied           by
                                          three voyages yields a
sum total of 22,800     ;  from which      7000 florins being de
                                               1
ducted for prime cost, a surplus remains of 5800 florins for
each buss, all net profit
    Which multiplied     by :160, the number of busses yearly
sent out to the fishery, yields little short of    a   million of
florins.
    Let us in the second place examine, with what instru
ments, and after what manner, this amazing quantity of
herrings     is taken as soon as the busses are all assembled.
They take their course from Shetland, N. N. E. and cast
 the nets off Fairhill on St. John's night, the 25th of June,
after midnight.       The fishery    always carried on at night,
                                     is
as well to obviate the inconvenience of the fish discovering

the nets, as also to entice them by the light of the lantern*/
of which they are fond, and towards which they make*
Mr. Spon, in his Travels through Italy, makes mention of a
similar artifice used by the fishers'on the coast of Dalmatia ;
they carry lanterns in order to entice the sardines, which are
there in great abundance.
   The nets are very long, consisting of fifty or sixty webs,
fortified with narrow net meshes, in order that the herring
may be entangled by his gills.       The mouth of the net may
be fortified with good hemp, or strong Persian silk, as being
more durable than hemp, being capable of holding good
three years i moreover they are tanned, or coloured brown
with smoke) that they may be the less perceptible by the
fish. The nets are thrown out at sun-set, betwixt two
busses, which, on account of their size, require much time
and labour.     They are fastened, and buoyed up with casks
to prevent sinking, which serve as a distinguishing mark,
and also, by reason of their weight, instead of an anchor.
To prevent them from getting entangled in one another,
the busses should be so arranged that each may preserve its
nets free.    During night the fishes run into the nets spread
out for them> and about five or six in the morning they are
hauled up.      This labour will give full employment for
three hours, as the take is commonly from three to ten
lasts, and sometimes even fourteen lasts.      The day is taken
up in dressing the fish : they begin the operation by cutting
out the gills, as those parts are liable to speedy putrefaction :
they are then put into barrels and salted : all that are taken
under five lasts are thus prepared for the market.           The
overplus, which they call stabers, are also gilled, lightly
salted, and thrown into boats to be sent ashore after the
first salting. The herrings are left on deck throughout the
following night. On the second morning (hey are pro
perly packed, and the barrels, being silled up, are plated in
the hold. In the beginning a part of the take is sent ashore
in the lighters called jaagers. When the herrings are fully
cured, the buss herself goes towards land, discharges her
freight, and lays in provision for a second expedition.       As
experience    has taught, that  herrings caught   at certain sea
sons keep longest and are best for use, the time for begin
ning the fishery is fixed by law. Before the 25th of June,
all masters of fishing smacks, previous to their departure
from Holland, are bound over not to trespass this ordinance,
and at their return are obliged to declare upon oath, that
they have not, by their own deeds or by the ministry of
others, contravened the law. Testimonials of this are given
                                                               to

to each ship, marked with the place of destination, to the
end that none be deceived, or the trade suffer by improper
goods. The place of the fishery changes with the seasons.
From St. John's to St. James's, i. e. from the 24th of
June to the 25th of July, the seat of the fishery is between
Fairhill and Shetland ; during this period herrings of the
best quality are taken : from St. James's day to the 14th of
September, the pursuit is carried on to the north of Scot
land, and from thence to the 25th of November, along the
coasts of Yarmouth and Norfolk.         All the herrings taken
the first three weeks after the 25th of June are cured
and packed up together, unsorced, and sent to Holland
by swift-sailing vessels called jaagers, after which all
the herrings taken are carefully sorted and separated into
three divisions : maatijes herrings, full, and shotten her
rings, which are all separately cured and packed up in di
stinct barrels.
    In the maatijes herrings is found neither roe nor milt.
They are very fat and palatable, but do not keep well.     Full
herrings are those that are full of milt or roe, and in their
most perfect state : this sort is fittest for market and pre
servation,      The third sort consists of such as having
9ast their spawn or roe are spent, or are on the point of
spending : this last sort is inferior in quality, and cannot be
kept so long as the former, or full herrings.
    The lading of the busses on their return to Holland con
 sists of those three sorts, which arc again inspected, packed,
 and salted afresh, before they are sent to any foreign mar-
Ted.    By this fresh packing fourteen sea barrels are reduced
 to twelve, which make up a last.        In order to bring this
 branch of commerce to a flourishing state, the governments
 of this and many other countries have made sundry regula
 tions concerning the manner of cutting out the gills, salt-
 ine, and packing.
    The English have always looked on the commerce of
 Holland with an eye of envy, which often bursts out into
 open acts of violence, never omitting any opportunity of
 disturbing, and, if possible, of ruining our herring fisheries;
 the more so as Dutch herrings have always had the pre
 ference of the English, as well as of those of every other
 nation.     In order to cut oft' all pretext of quarrel, our
 fishers are forbidden to cast their nets within ten miles of
 the English shore; v. hich prohibition is the less detrimental
 tp the fishery, as herrings of the best quality are taken at
 such a distance from the shore.

46                  Of the Herring Fishery,
and Ireland,      being of an inferior quality, are less fit for
 preservation    or salting ; for which reason it is forbidden by
 an   ordinance,   dated  1620, to take any herrings at the fore-
 mentioned places.        Among the regulations that have been
 made for the support of the herring fishery, the following
 are the principal ones.
    The appointment of a hearmeester, or overseer, at all
 the landing places where herrings are brought in, to take
 Strict care that the herrings should get a second salting and
 packing : to him is also intrusted the inspection of the salt
 and coopers' work, or barrels in which they are packed.
Their province is in a special manner to prevent foreign
 herrings being mixed with our own (in case any foreign
 cargoes arrive), and to have the barrel branded with such
 marks as may prevent a mistake on this head, that our
 trade may not suffer from the quality of such fish.
    2dly. — He is to take care that all damaged herrings or of
 bad quality, e. g. such as take sick after having cast their
 fry, or on the eve of doing     it,  in word, unmerchantable^
                                       a
be thrown aside in the packing, lest such bad fish corrupt
 the sound, or give them     a     bad flavour.   That, moreover,
 the fish be properly salted and packed. — 3dly. That the
masters and crew of ene buss do not put any hindrance in
 the way of another.        In case they were unlucky, or could
 not succeed where they had cast nets, they must not re
 move to the ground of others to disturb their operations,
nor damage their nets, boats, or other implements       :   in case
 they do, they must make good the damage.             No buss em
ployed in the fishery can be sold to foreigners, or hired out
to them for the purposes of fishing.         4thlv. — That the said
overseer do inspect all the barrels before they are taken on
 board the busses, reject such as shall appear unfit, and
mark such as he approves with the name of the cooper, and
 his place of residence  ;    after having examined the quality
pf the timber, construction, hoops, 8cc. &c. 5thly. — Ik*
shall nut suffer anv bins out on the fishery before the 24th
of June, and he shall require      a    declaration upon oath, be
fore any of the herrings are landed, that there are none
abroad taken before that period.
    flthly-. — He must take care that in salting herrings   a   di
stinction should be made. Thus, for example, the herrings
taken between St. John's and St. James's day shall be
salted with coarse and chosen salt.         Those taken from St.
James's day to the 14th of September must be packed up
with the best sine salt.      No herrings can be packed except
such as are taken from the 14th of July to. the 1st of Janu
                                                               ary.

J#y,     Each sort to be packed up separately in barrels proi
 nerly filled up, stopped, hooped, &c. Lastly,-^No herrings
 can be sold or brought to market in this country that are
 not picked and sorted in the following manner, By this
 sorting and marking, the different kinds of herrings, and
 the time they were taken, are discriminated and named ac
 cordingly.    Thus are to be met with in the market, St.
John's herrings, St James's herrings, St. Bartholomew's
 herrings —none but these can be packed. The take of St,
John is sent ashore in lighters, in order to be sold immedi-
 lately for consumption.     The St. James's herrings undergo
 a second packing, are reduced       from fourteen barrels to
 twelve, then marked by the overseers : these are sent off
 in a commercial way.
    The take of St. Bartholomew, the 28th of August, are
 marked with the arms of the city, and commonly sent to
 Cologne in Germany.        The take of the 14th of September
 are likewise marked with the arms of the city, and sent ge
 nerally to Rouen in Normandy : they are not marked until
 they hav« remained in the first pickle eight or ten days.
 Lastly.— They must have remained in salt ten days before
 they can be sold. No Scotch or other foreign herrings can
 be worked, cured, and packed, as if they were Dutch : they
 may be simply packed up in barrels without any stamp.
The precaution on this head is carried so far, that no empty
 barrels of ours, marked as above, can be exported to any
 other country.     This extract of regulations concerning the
 important    commerce    of the herring fishery, possessed as
 well by the States General as by the states of the province
 of Holland, is drawn from the Great Placart book, from
 the treaty with the city of Hamburgh,        from the book of
 Handvoesten, all which the reader must examine, if he re
 quires a more exact knowledge of the matter.
    We have said above, that the inspection of the curing,
            &c. is intrusted to overseers, who are appointed
Cacking,
   y government, and take up their residence conveniently
 to the harbours, or place where the business is going for
 ward.
    I have said already, and the common suffrage of all na
 tions confirms it,  that the Dutch herrings arc the best. No
 other cause can be assigned for this general preference, than
 the scrupulous adherence to the regulations and provisions
just now mentioned,       it being  by  no means true, that the
art of curing, salting, and packing herrings     is confined to
 the Dutch alone. Other nations are as expert at doing all
 that as we can bej     but in no other country is so much at

as the necessary expenses of stores and sitting for the whale
fishery are almost all defrayed from the profits of it. As
long as these wise ordinances and regulations are punctu
ally observed, and no breach of them allowed, notwith
standing the high wages, which may be considered as one
cause of its decline, it may still flourish.
VII.   On the Boiling Point      of Mercury, and tlie Fixing
   Points of Lead and Tin.        By   Mr, James Crichtqn,
   of Glasgow*.
                        To  Mr. Tilloch.
T S1R'
i. have to.  request that you will correct a small error in the
account of my thermometer, inserted in number LVIII,
(p. 147).   The bar is composed not of iron and zinc, as
printed by mistake, but of steel and zinc. The engraver
has also made the scale to read from right to left, instead of
the contrary ; but this is not material.
   I have it now in my power to send you the results of a
number of interesting experiments respecting the boiling
point of mercury, and the fixing points of lead and tin, which
I think may answer some important purposes to the philo
 sophical world.    A detail of all the steps followed, which
were similar to those stated in my last communication,
would only take up time unnecessarily.
   The steady uniform point at which block -tin fixes sur
passes my expectations, and is far more determinate than
that of water. Lead has not, like tin, the property of in
stantly depressing and as instantaneously raising the ther
mometer at the moment of congelation.
   Having had occasion, in constructing some very high-
ranged thermometers, to take for the purpose of graduation
some point much higher than that of boiling water, as in
prolonging a scale to 500 or 600° from so comparatively
contracted a scale, errors must unavoidably be introduced,
I had recourse to the writings of the most respected British
and foreign chemists, to find from them the fixing points
of lead and tin. In this search I was greatly disappointed,
for they do not agree amongst themselves, varying so much
as 30, 40, sometimes 70 degrees.          Besides, having good
reason to suspect that none ot them were near the truth, I

 resolved   lo determine the fact by actual and careful experi
 ments, the results of which were so different from what
 have been received, that I think myself called upon to state
 them.
     In order to obtain the more certainty, I made on purpose
 three accurate thermometers, on which I could perfectly
 rely ; and from their agreements I can with confidence say
 that mercury boils at 656°, lead sixes at 612°, and tin at
 442° ; — their specific gravities being respectively thus : mer
 cury 13,568, lead 11,346, tin 7,278, taken in distilled
 water at 62°.    The gravities attributed to them by authors
 are nearly the same ; which is so far satisfying.
    When the experiments were made the barometer stood at
 29-3, 24 feet above the sea.

   VIII.   On the new Planet     Pallas. Bij Baron Von Zach.
  J. he proofs on which the improvement of our astronomy,
 both theoretical and practical, is at present founded, can
 not be more conclusive; and the triumph which this sci
 ence has obtained, even in the eyes of the public in gene
 ral, cannot be greater than it is at present by the re-appear
 ance of Pallas.
    This small planet, after its discovery last year by Dr.
 Olbers, was scarcely observed four months when it ap
 proached so near the solar rays as to become lost in them ;
 and having now emerged from them, after being invisible
for six months, it has been again found, like a small point,
 hardly perceptible, among myriads of worlds, and exactly
 in the spot where its place was announced by theory. To
this new discovery of the re-appearance of Pallas, the great
est possible physical and intellectual powers of man have
 contributed.
    On the 18th of February, about 14h 50', Harding, that
expert observer of Lilienthal, was so fortunate as to find
again Pallas, exactly in the place where it ought to be ac
cording to the calculations of Dr. Gauss, inserted in the
Monatliche Correspondent for December 1802.             The fol
lowing night he had the pleasure to ascertain its exist
ence in the most satisfactory manner.            On the 15th of
February, about 15'1, he found it nearly over No. 36 of
Poniatowsky's Bull, as a small star of the 12th or 13th
magnitude, and knew it to be the planet, as he had observed
    Vox.. XVI. No. (Jl.                 D                     very

very accurately the night before No. 36 and the surrounding
stars ; but now saw a star in a place where 24 hours before
none was visible. The next night this luminous point had
moved as theory required, and on the 20th of February,
about 15h 30' 13" meantime, had advanced 55 seconds from
No. 36 of the Bull, against which he saw it on the 15th of
February.
     Mr. Harding had the goodness to communicate to us im
 mediately his important discovery. He informed us in his
 letters that he was not able to distinguish this planet with
 a three feet achromatic telescope, through which stars of
 the eleventh magnitude were clearly seen. Dr. Olbers, who
 on the 21st of February had the pleasure of again seeing his
 planet, wrote to us that he could distinguish Pallas very di
 stinctly with a five feet telescope by Dollond ; but at that
 time he considered it equal to a star of the twelfth or thir
 teenth magnitude, and its light equal to that of the fourth
 satellite of Saturn.
     Dr. Gauss therefore, in the same manner as last year in
 regard to Pallas, is entitled to the greatest praise, and de
serves our warmest thanks for the wonderful accuracy of his
 calculation, by the correspondence of which alone it was
            to discover again this planet among the innumera-
   le host of telescopic 'Stars.
 Eossible                           " Had there been an error of
 only from 30 to 40 minutes," says Mr. Harding, IC in the
 calculations of Dr. Gauss, I much doubt whether I should
 have been able to discover Pallas again."
     In the Monatliche Correspondent, for the month of March,
 pac;c 277, we estimated the real apparent          magnitude of
  Pallas, on its first re-appearance, to be equal to a star of the
 twelfth magnitude, and this conjecture has been found to
 be confirmed.       In that number we gave Harding's chart of
 the probable orbit of this planet, in order to facilitate the
 finding of   it,  and this chartis   now found to be its actual
 orbit; for the difference between the calculations and the
 observations hitherto made     is   so small, thatit    not per
                                                        is
 ceptible on our chart, though constructed on      a   very large
 scale, and nearly four times as great as that employed           by
 Professor Bode for his celestial atlas.    By the help of these
 charts, and the calculation of the orbit of this planet given
 in the Monatliche Correspondent for December 1802,           will
                                                             it
 be possible, even without knowing that this calculation cor
 responds within two minutes with observation of the hea
 vens, to find Pallas at all times when searched for with good
telescopes.

still further from new observations.

 IX.    On the Management and Improvement by Tillage of
     strong wet Loams in which the Clay greatly predomi
     nates*.
  .H. ere acain I can meet the wishes of the Board, and give
  them the information they require from actual experiment,
 and on a very large scale.      This soil, of which there are
 thousands of acres in Suffolk, is in that district called clav;
 but I believe there is no pure clay in that county.        The
 lands having a greater or smaller portion of calcareous mat
 ter in them, are consequently of a better quality than the
 clays in Surrey and Sussex, though they were in no higher
 repute until within these twenty years. A manor farm near
 Eye was offered for sale about fifteen vears since, when I
 purchased      much against the inclination of my friends,
                   it,
 who joined in the general cry of the fanners, and pro
nounced the lands the poorest that ever crow flew over.
This did not discourage me.        found    proportion of cal
                                               I          a
careous earth intermixed with the clay on the surface, and
at two and three feet below the surface        stratum of fine    a
marl in almost every field. The estate was so depreciated
that  I  did not attempt to let it. Of the two hundred and
thirty-five acres, of which the whole consisted, the major
part was old sour grass lands, full of water quitch, over
run with black and white thorn, bushes, and pollard trees.
I  began my operations               by
                             grubbing the thorns and trees,

fields were squared ; new ditches cut, four feet and a half
wide at the top, one at the bottom, and three sect six inches
deep, and planted with white thorn : expense per rod two
shillings and three pence, exclusive of white thorn and
bushes. Drains were then drawn out as deep as possible by
the plough, dug with the common spade ten inches, then
with a narrow spade ten inches*, and with a small grip
ping spade fourteen inches, filling the latter trench with
haulm, and putting bushes on the ton of               covering the

preferable.    Expense per score vards four shillings and six
pence.    Marl pits were then opened, when possible, at the
point where four of these new ditches met, by which the
distance of carting wasreduced           and with
                                          ;          few posts and

water secured to each field, after the marl carting was
finished.    Eighty loads was the quantity per acre, at two
pounds   twelve   shillings and six pence per hundred loads.
    This marl was spread on the old sour crass, and left to
be pulverized       by
                    the winter's frost, and incorporated with
the surface    bythe feet of the cattle and sheep. Early in the
spring the lands, thus prepared, received one clean deep
ploughing, and were drilled with oats produce about thir

  S  I            Management     os strong net Loams

   thousand hve hundred pounds.           The gross produce per
  acre of these old sour grass lands could not exceed twenty
  shillings; and little or nothing was expended on productive
  labour.     Ever since they have been converted into tillage
  double the former gross income must have been expended
  for labour, and the aggregate produce at least six pounds
  and six shillings on every acre, including the whole rota
  tion of crops.        You have here, gentlemen, one strong
  proof   of  the  utility of converting certain portions of grass
  lands into tillage. This farm is now in such a high state of
  cultivation, that any part of it might be converted into mea
 dow land by the mode recommended in my former chapter,
 and would be worth two pounds per acre, as I shall demon
 strate from actual experiments on rather inferior, though
 soim-what similar, soils.
      When first I became rector of               in the county of
            there were two fields of fifteen acres much impo
 verished by constant cropping and tillage, valued in that
 state at sixteen shillings per acre ; soil a strong loam, and
 very wet. These fields I drained, to take off" the surface
 water, as recommended in my first chapter ; then fallowed
 and dressed them, sowing the hay seeds, &c. in August.
 The produce the first vear was estimated by many farmers
 at four tons per acre'; it was so stout that the mowers had
 double their usual wages, and it was impossible to spread it
 on the land. I have ever since, viz. for eight or nine years,
 let these lands at two. pounds two shillings per acre.          As
 the tenants have been frequently changed, the lands have
 been mown almost every year, and are now somewhat ex
 hausted, but may be made as good as "ever by a dressing,
 and bv being fed with sheep one summer ; or, if ploughed,
 would produce abundant crops for eight or ten years, and
 might then be converted into meadow by the process                I
have     before recommended : the course of crops will be
 found at the end of this essay as be*t adapted to claved
loams. By the mode of cropping there recommended, a
farmer mav continue sowing wheat in any season.              If too
wet to work his pea, bean, or vetch land, his clover lands
will be in order; if too dry for the latter, the former will
work well, and he may be sure of putting m his seed in
good time.        It will be obvious, that when clover is sown
with the spring corn, the three feet ridges, on which the
turnips or cabbages grew, must be levelled, and five or ten
feet ridges formed. The clover seed should be sown imme
diately before the last horse -hoeing.       I could bring proofs
                                                                 ad

            in which tlœ Clay greatly predominates.          55
ad infinituni  to demonstrate the folly of old grass lands to
remain unfilled, under the foolish idea of not impoverish
ing the land. So far from being improved by sueh a state
of rest, the lands, by being saturated with stagnant water,
become worse and worse every year ; and one hundred acres
in this state, at seven shillings and six pence per acre, would
starve the tenant and his cattle, bring a very poor rent to
the landlord, and produce nothing to the public. Under the
management I have recommended, the income of the land
lord may be nearly tripled, and the produce to the tenant
and the public increased in a tenfold degree. But I will, as
the Board requires, substantiate these assertions by further
experiments made under my direction on some lands in
Sussex, belonging to his grace the duke of Richmond,
and on others in Suffolk, the property of lord Rous.       One
will be an additional proof of the utility of breaking up old
sour grass lands ; the other, of the advantage of restoring
lands exhausted by constant tillage into good and produc
tive meadows.      It may be necessary to say, that I applied
to my two noble friends for an account of the following ex
periments, and received permission to transmit them to the
Board.    The- farm of lord Rous consisted of two hundred
acres of land, half of which was old sour grass, let lor
ninetv pounds a year ; but previous to mv riding over it with
his lordship, his steward had valued it at one hundred and
fifty pounds a year, allowing a specific number of acres to
be broken up every year, on condition that the tenant laid
down with hav seed an equal number of acres of the old
arable lands. I slated to lord Rous, that he could not have
a full and fair rent for his farm under covenants, or with
out allowing the whole to be cleared, ditched, drained,
marled, and ploughed, except about ten acres near the
house. To these conditions he readily, and from convic
tion, acceded ; and I valued the estate (which was then let
at ninety pounds a year, and estimated with a partial privi
lege of breaking up the old pastures at one hundred and
fifty.) at two hundred and twenty-five pounds ; for which
sum it was let to an unexceptionable tenant, so much ap
proved of, that at the end of three years, before he had
reaped the fruits of his own industry, his lordship oiVered
him a much larger occupation, if he could find a tenant of
character to repay him for his expensive improvements.
Several candidates offered, out of which lord Rous selected
one who paid the outgoing tenant five hundred and fifty
pounds lor his ditching, draining, and marling, and ex-
                                D 4                      pended

30                 Management       of strong wet Loams
pended about two hundred more in similar improvements.
Precisely the same system was adopted by these spirited
fanners for improving these lands, as I have before given the
particulars of in the account of the estate            I purchased ; and
a recapitulation would be protracting this essav, which I
wish should contain, in the most concise and plain terms,
as great a mass of information as I am capable of furnish
ing. As his grace the duke of Richmond, with that exact
ness which marks his conduct in all matters of business,
has furnished me with an account of his experiment, at
tested by his signature, I should not feel myself justified in
deviating from it, even in form, but shall transmit it in the
very words in which I received it :            "I  do certify, that some
years ago above fifty acres of land that I wished to convert
from tillage into pasture, which had been* attempted several
 times by the common mode of sowing grass seeds with
 corn, without success, were (after two vears successive tur
 nips fed off) sown with hav seeds in a very large proportion,
 in August, without corn, as advised by the Rev. Mr.                      ;
 and the result was, two crops ot hav the first year ; one esti
 mated at two tons per acre, and the other at one ton and a
 half.     The land has since been dressed with old mortar
 and other manures occasionally, and the permanent im
 provement on the value of the land is estimated to amount
 to at least listen shillings per acre*.

      These experiments exactly correspond in their result
 with    those which I have stated from my own practice ; and
 being made in different situations, they seem to be conclu
 sive on the most important subjects selected by the Board
  as objects of their premiums.             The characters of the no
  blemen under the sanction of whose approbation I have
  given you the particulars of the two last experiments, stand
  too high in the estimation of the country for honour, vera
  city, and minute exactness in every transaction of the least
  importance, to need any encomium from me. For the par
  ticular management of these experiments I shall refer you
  to those similar ones made upon my own lands, from which
  no variation was made except in the mode of draining the
  duke of Richmond's lands ; which, to the best of my recol
  lection, were made with bricks.               Though the querv re

be answered     by its being the foundation of all the advan
tages which      1 have so minutely detailed, yet I must urge
the necessity    of this operation as the sine qua non of agri
cultural improvement ; and add, that though the particular
method of surface-draining strong clays and of clayey loams,
where the substratum was less retentive of water, has proved
both cheap and effectual, yet in all bogs, peats, gravels, or
sands, where a large tract of land may be made firm and
dry by one cut, Air. Elkington's mode of tapping and boring
is a very superior method of effecting this necessary and pri
mary improvement.         Upon rich black loams, sandy loams,
good deep lands with a chalky substratum, peats, &c. (all
soils capable of producingthe natural grasses of this country)
the same system as has been recommended in the preceding
experiments will be found effectual for converting them
into meadows or pastures; only varying the rotation of crop9
according to the table at the end.
 Objections   to sowing Grasses with any Crop of Corn, when it
     is required to obtain a Meadow ; and a comparative Esti
     mate of the two Methods.
     Here again I can give you, my Lord, and the Board, in
 formation from actual experiment. A friend of mine wished
 to procure a good meadow or pasture around his house: he
 fallowed the land for barley; but the spring proving wet,
 and the soil being a strong loam, he could only put half of
 it in order for that crop, which was sown, and laid with
 clover and rye grass.       The other part was fallowed, and
 sown in August with the sweepings of hay chambers, as I
 have recommended.         The barley was a good crop, and the
 clover and rye grass were probably equal to the first year's
 cut of hay. The second year the artificial grasses began to
 fail ; worse the third, fourth, and fifth. The sixth year, after
 having received two dressings, the spontaneous product of
 the soil began to give a fleece over the surface of the land.
 About ten years after these lands were sown, I saw this
  field, when the part sown in August was worth at least fif
  teen shillings per acre more than the part which had been
  sown with artificial grasses in the barley. Thus from actual
  experiments, numbers of which I could adduce, I conclude
  that sowing the sweepings of hay chambers in August is
  preferable to sowing artificial grasses in the spring with any
  crop of corn. Suppose the corn worth five pounds per acre,
  the difference in the produce of hay or feed in the second,
  thirds fourth, and fifth years, would more than counterba
                                                            lance

58             Management         of strong   wet I^oarns
 lance this ; and the proprietor would find a permanent iin-»
provement in his land of from fifteen shillings to twenty
shillings per acre *.
    Many object to sowing such rubbish as the sweepings of
hay chambers produce ; and I wish most sincerely any me
thod could be devised for procuring clean seeds of our best
and natural meadow grasses. It is a great desideratum; aud
premiums to encourage agriculturists to save seeds of the
fescues and poas, &c. and for the largest quantity of land
sown with these seeds, and kept distinct, might be of infi
nite service. Until this can be effected, the plan I have
submitted to you, my lord, appears to me the most eligible.
It certainly has been crowned with the greatest success.
Sowing rubbish in August is not of so great importance as
in the spring. In the former season all the annual seeds
vegetate ; and if the beginning of the winter be mild, they
will blossom ; but they cannot perfect their seed, and the
first frost destroys them.   If sown in the spring, they ve
getate, blossom, perfect and shed their seeds, and thus stock
the land with noxious weeds. The facts I have stated must
do away the objections to sowing rubbish.        It is immaterial
what you sow, if you do but obtain an abundant crop, and
leave your land clean and in good order.         Should      how   it,
ever, be thought proper to sow the seeds with any corn,
barley must have the preference.       If sown with oats, and
the land be prepared as      should be, viz. in high tilth and
                             it
order, the oats will be so luxuriant as to smother and de
stroy the young plants. Lands intended for grass or mea
dow cannot be in too high       state of cultivation.

advised the landlord to provide the hay seeds, that he might
be sure, not only of the quality, but that the quantity should
be sown. Indeed, as the improvement              permanent one,

 preparing the land bv a complete highly pulverized fallow,
and sowing the hay and other seeds of the landlord's pro
curing, the first week in August ; and after the first crop of
hay to dress the lands with twenty loads of good dung, or
compost, per acre, if the soil was of such a quality as not
absolutely to require dressing previous to sowing the hay
seeds.     A dressing before sowing, or after carrying the hay
the first year, is absolutely necessary.
    The additional rent must be regulated by the quality of
the land, from ten shillings per acre to fifteen and twenty
shillings.    If the land be naturally very sterile, and difficult
to till, as in the wilds of Sussex, and the tenant be obliged,
by paring, burnine, and fallowing, to purchase his first crop
very dearly, no additional rent should be required, but he
should be tied to such a judicious mode of cropping as
would leave the lands in an improved state for the landlord.
See ihe Table at the end.      If the land, after being drained
and marled, will produce a good crop of oats with one ef
fectual ploughing, the tenant may pay an additional rent of
ten shillings per acre.      Where the lands will produce a
good crop from one effectual ploughing, without the ex
pense of draining and marling, the rent may be advanced
fifteen shillings per acre ; and on lands naturally very good,
a landlord may expect an additional rent of twenty shillings
per acre of grass land he may allow to be converted into
arable.
    The depth at which grass lands should be at first ploughed
must depend cm the nature of the soil.         In my directions
for improving sterile clays, I have, I trust, proved the uti
lity of moving such soils to a great depth. Similar obser
vations will apply to all clayey loams, where the surface and
the substratum consist of the same component parts.            On
deep rich loams of all denominations deep ploughing will
be advantageous ; but when there are only four or five inches,
or less, of trood earth, and the under stratum be a rubbly
chalk, gravel, or other unproductive soil, it should never be
brought to the surface ; and, being naturally pervious to
water, it will not require being moved below the action of
the plough.
    In my practice I have almost invariably mown the grass
the first year, and immediately dressed it well and fed it
the second. My success, in even- instance, has been great,
and no inconvenience ever arose from this system. In some
few cases I have seen much injury arise from feeding the
first spring : the lands being in a high state of cultivation

grasses before mentioned in the spring ; the flock wanted
the food, and there was an abundant crop.                 So urgent was
the man, that the duke, who had promised that my direc

but to this plan I positively objected, declaring that, should
the stock be allowed to feed the lands the Tirst spring, I
would not answer for the success of the experiment.                      His
grace,   who  is  always    firm   on    such    occasions,     would    not
therefore give his consent to his bailiff's request.              The re
sult of the experiment was such, that neither the duke nor
his steward ever regretted adhering to my advice.

AN    endeavouring to class insects which have not been ac
curately described by those who saw them, nothing more
can be offered than conjectures.           The few characters which
are given must be employed in order to deduce from them
something nearer the truth ; and it then becomes the duty
of future observers, when they have an opportunity of see
ing new insects which have any similarity to those imper
fectly described, to examine and establish the points in
which they correspond. It is by these means only that we
can attain to certainty in things which have before rested
only on conjecture.
   I have for some time past read, in different authors, ac
counts of insects, which attracted my attention the more,
as noxious qualities were ascribed to them : I wished that
I  might be able to obtain better information than 1 found
in the books where they are described respecting the genera
to which they belong ; and, having taken the trouble to de
termine this as far as possible, I here give the result of what
appeared to me most probable.             I am far from giving these
Observations  as  strictly agreeable     to  truth : on the contrary,
I consider them as very unperfect ; but it is only by making
them known that I can obtain more certainty in regard to
my conjectures.

    The following account is to be found in Ulloa's Voyage
to South America * : — " In the valleys of Popayan, in South
 America, there are found insects which are very remarkable
 on account of the poisonous juices contained in their bodies.
 Among these there is one called coya or coyba, of a fiery
 red colour, and not larger than a common bug. It is gene
 rally found under stones, and in the fields between the grass
 and other plants.     When this insect is bruised on the skin
 of any animal its pernicious juice penetrates into the pores,
 becomes mixed with the blood and fluids, and occasions
 ulcers, which, if a remedy be not speedily applied, soon
 produce death.      The only remedy for this evil is to set fire
 to the dried steins of a certain plant, and to keep the body
 of the patient over the flame till it begins to swell ; an ope
 ration which the inhabitants of these districts can perform
 with great dexterity.      It has been observed that no bad
 consequences    ensue  when    this animal has been bruised on
 the palm of the hand; from which it is inferred, that the
 small quantity of poisonous juice is absorbed by the callous
 parts of the skin in the palm of the hand, and cannot pe
 netrate into the blood.      The natives, who travel through
 these districts, often bruise the insect in their hands in
 order to gratify the curiosity of travellers. But there can
"be no doubt that the coya, if bruised in a less callous hand,
 the skin of which is thinner or tenderer, would produce
 nearly the same effects as when bruised in other parts of the
 body.
    " Those who travel through these valleys, when they
 feel a sensation of puncture by an insect in the face or
 neck, take great care not to rub or to touch the part, be
 cause the least pressure bruises the coya, which when not
 bruised is harmless. On such occasions, they cause the
 natives who accompany them to examine the place ; and
 if the latter observe a coya, they blow it off with their breath
 without touching   it;   bywhich means the travellers are freed
 from danger.      The cattle in these valleys are led   instinct by
 to use the same precaution         they breathe strongly on the
                                    ;
 herbs and grass on which they are about to feed.             The
 mules, however, often eat the coya after which they gra
                                                ;
 dually swell, and at length die."

At   any rate, very little can be gathered from this description;
 but, as the insect is compared to the bug, there is rea
 son to conjecture that it may have some affinity with that
species.    It       is,

 therto no instance that any insect belonging to this species
 can produce so noxious effects and            the coya really exists,

  rapidity : it does not lonst remain on the cattle, but throws
  itself on the grass, and therefore can with difficulty be
  caiiirht.   M. Sehroter was able only once to obtain one of
  these insects. It is fond of frequenting those fields which are
  interspersed with clumps of trees.        The head is oval, and
  tapers towards the mouth ;         the mouth consists of two
  moveable jaws, and the pincers are like those of the beetle.
  The whole head is covered with hair, but more so around
  the mouth than on the forehead.            The hair on the upper
  part of the head stands erect like bristles, but that around
  the mouth hangs down. Its colour is whitish.            Two large
  eves stand on each side of the head, and two small ones
  in the centre. The large eyes are cut into facets, the small
  ones are plane.     It has a white hairy band, which passes
  round the whole neck and ends at the extremities of the
  first two legs.   The corslet is round, very black, and at the
 extremity towards the body covered with single, crooked
 hairs, white at the points.        The two wings are white, a
  little brownish, and not much longer than the body. The
  hind part of the body is entirely covered with hair; the
 upper part towards the corslet is entirely black, interspersed
 with single white hairs; but the lower part and the rump
 are yellow. The whole body terminates in a point. On the
 lower part the insect is completely hairy and black, except
 on the rump, where it is yellow.          The six legs are black :
 the hind thighs are covered with hair, and the tarsus has
  six joints.
      M. Sehroter reckons this kind of gnat among the Lin-
 næan flies with silk-like naked feelers ; and it certainly de
 serves to form a peculiar variety.        He has given a repre
 sentation of     it,

   LepecFiin, in the first part of the Journal of his Travels
through different Parts of the Russian Empire *, describes
a spider, which, on account of its remarkable characters,
deserves a place in our systems, of which it has hitherto
been deprived.         It has, perhaps, been overlooked, because
Lepechin      calls it  a tarantula; a name very improper, since
the spider described by him differs very much from the ta
rantula (aranea tarantula). At anv rate, on account of this
difference it ought to be distinguished by the name of the
Tartarian tarantula.         His description is as follows :
    On account of the saline nature of the districts around
Usolia, a very dreadful kind of spider is fond of frequenting
them.      These animals reside in holes under the earth, and
the passage which conducts to them does not seem to be
above a quarter of an arschine in depth. They extend their
webs on the ground before their hole, and devour without
mercy the insects which fall into them.               The exterior part
of the body is entirely covered with soft hair, which gives
them a horrid appearance.             The head has the figure of a
half pyramid, the sharp side of which represents the mid
dle of   it, and the bottom the forehead.             The breast       co       is
vered by     a roundish shield, whitish on the edges and fur
nished in the middle with black hair.                Small white and
almost imperceptible veins, which proceed from the white
edge of the shield, meet in the centre. On the top of the head
there are eight eyes, the smallest of which, four in num
ber, occupv the lowest place before the mandibles                   above   :
these there are two large eyes, and above these two others
of moderate size. Besides these there are large, bright
     a
red eves on the sides above the mandibles.                       The two
mandibles are covered with soft hair, blackish at the
ends, armed with small pointed and stiff hooks.                       The
feelers consist of four joints           three of them are reddish
                                             ;
brown    ;  the other, which          the last,
                                        is            black, and has
                                                           is                        a
blunt point.        On the back there are two rows of whitish
points between the black ones.

Though I made inquiries among the inhabitants with the
greatest care, I could not find that there ever had occurred
any instance of people being hurt by this formidable animal.
   In p. 257 of the same work Lepechin gives a further
account of this spider in the following words: — " In this
place we learned some further particulars respecting the ta
rantula.     Having dug up some of their nests, we observed
what this animal uses as weapons against its enemies.
When it finds itself deprived of every means of flight, it
remains quiet, puffs itself up, and ejects from its back, as
if through a syringe, a white juice to the distance of two
arschines. I cannot, with certainty, say whether this juice
be poisonous or not, because none of us were inclined to
make the dangerous experiment.            But we were assured by
one of the cossacs who were on guard at Woguti, that a
woman of Little Russia had the misfortune to feel the ef
fects of this juice.      She dug up a spider of this kind, and
on turning it with a stick it squirted some of the juice on
her hand, which in a short time became inflamed : the part
swelled with unsupportable pain, and the most serious con
sequences might have ensued had not a remedy been speed
ily applied. The best antidote to this poison is the animal
itself.   It is put alive into oil, and kept in that manner for
use.    If the part exposed to the action of the juice be rub
bed over with this oil, a cure takes place without any need
of employing music ; which, indeed, could not be obtained
in these districts, as the whole music of the country people
consists of a screeking noise produced by reeds, or the stem
of the wild angelica (angelica sylvestrh).            These spiders
were so quarrelsome, and greedy of devouring each other,
that of twenty of them confined in a glass only one re
mained alive as conqueror. The black sheep, it is said, are
great enemies of the tarantulas.          These animals dig them
up from the earth, and readily eat them ; on which account
these sheep are highly esteemed by the Calmucs, who are
much afraid of the tarantulas, so that they never encamp in
places frequented by them, but proceed to some other di
strict, however tired their cattle may be.
   Lepechin calls this kind of spider a tarantula, and conse
quently it must have some similarity to the tarantula of the
 system. According to Fabricius the tarantula has ten eyes,
in  the  following form,      •• • •
                                     ;  whereas that of Lepechin
has onlv    ciehr,  as  the  large   red eves above the mandibles

will hardly     be considered by entomologists as real eyes,
but   as  prominences which have the form of eyes without
possessing their properties.         If this conjecture, which ap
pears to me very probable, be well founded, and as the eight
real eyes of Lepechin's spider, according to his own ac
count, are arranged        in this manner,        ....     it belongs to
Fabricius's sixth family of spiders, where the aranea clavipes,
saccata, and fumigala, are placed.                In regard to form, it
seems to have the greatest similarity to the aranea clarifies;
from which, however, it is so diilerent in many respects,
even without taking into account the diversity of country,
that few entomologists will be inclined to consider both as
varieties of the same kind. The parts of the mouth are not
different from those of spiders in general : what Lepechin
calls feelers are, in all probability, nothing else than what
entomologists have long and much better distinguished by
the name of palpi ; for it may with certainty be affirmed,
that no antennœ have ever yet been found in spiders.                  It is
seen, from what has been said, that Lepechin's tarantula
certainly deserves to form a new kind in the system, which
may be placed after the aranea clavipes as follows :
   Aranea tartarica oculis        ....
A.   hirta atra, thorace albo marginato, rotundato, abdomi-
   nis dorso seriebus duabus punctorum albicantium, pedi-

   It  is not improbable that this spider is of the same kind
as that    described by Laxman * under the name of aranea
Siiigoriensis : at any rate there is great reason to make this
conjecture, from what Gmelin says of this spider, in de
scribing the aranea tarantulas : should this be the case,

Laxman's aranea Singoriensis ought not to be considered as
a variety of the aranea tarantula, but rather as a variety of
Lepechin's spider, or as a particular species.          Whether the
large   red pair of eves  be really eyes,  still  remains   a problem
which deserves to be an object of future research to natura
lists ; and the question, whether the proper tarantula (ara
nea tarantula auctorum) be found in the southern parts of
Russia, requires further proof before it can be answered in
the affirmative.
    In A Voyage to Madeira and the Leeward Caribean.
Islands, by a ladv, London 1792, 8vo. mention is made also
of a tarantula, which, according to every probability, is
nothing else than the aranea clavipes, or a large American
kind of earth spider. It does not appear to be the aranea
avicularia, at least according to the description of             which        it,
is  very defective, like all the descriptions of natural objects
found in books of travels written                   by
                                           ladies. There        reason,   is
however, to conjecture that            not the real aranea taran
                                          it   is
tula, because this spider has never been found in the                                    di
stricts which the authoress visited. Of her spider she gives
the following account —" A kind of tarantula
                                 :                            found in   is
Antigua       in
               stony places  and  under  old  ruins.     Its bite  pro
duces convulsions with strangury, and sometimes                  proves
mortal. Music, however, produces no sensible effect on those
bitten    byit."      It
                     certainly       worth while to make some

sider Bnmelli's insect as a little known species of this genus
till the natural history of it has been better explained. The
following is his account of it : — " The Brasilians give the
name of condiru to an insect shaped like a small worm,
which, when stroked with the finder in one direction, is
smooth, but when stroked in the other feels so rough that
it wounds the singer.         It is greedv of blood from wounds ;
it is dangerous to the crocodde when wounded in the water,
and is found in many places in multitudes.                  It makes its
way into the limbs of the natives, and cannot be taken out
without laying open the part : the men, therefore, must be
very cautious when they go into the rivers."

more perfect, by the following alteration, which has been
occasioned, in particular, by the discovery of the ornitho

chief ground of these orders, because they soonest strike
the attention, and are in the most intimate relation with the

two of them, which comprehend a great variety, into two

 Observations             on a   living    Opossum,       Didelphis marsupialis.
   Some months ago I obtained that wonder of all the land
animals, as Mr. Lawson calls             for which it, was indebted
                                                                I
to the kindness of an American friend, Dr. Tidyman, of
Charlestown, in South Carolina.
     It   about as large as
          is                        middle-sized cat. Its head
                                           a                                   is
shaped    like  that  of  the   fox    but its long snout, and the

bare flesh-coloured nose turned somewhat upwards almost
in the form of snout, are nearly like those of pig. The

aperture of the mouth            exceedingly wide
                                      is              the lower jaw
                                                                :

lar teeth, even when the mouth             shut, are visible.
                                                     is          The
head       white, with
          is                 faint blackish stripe along the fore
                                  a
head, and the part between the fore corners of the eyes and
the snout      of the same colour. Both sides of the mouth,
                     is
and   in particular the chin, are furnished with         great many a
long stiff hairs. The pupil of the eye               small, but the

this, with the dark brown colour of the iris, gives to the
animal a lively appearance.       Of a memhrana niclitans, as
amorjg   the quadrumana, scarcely any rudiment is to be seen.
The ears are large, black, naked, and, according to ap
pearance, merely membranous, without any cartilaginous
folds, and therefore nearly like those of the bat ; in my
animal also, without the white border which is ascribed to
others of this genus.
   The neck is short and thick, and the same is the case
with the rump, which is well covered with hair. Sometimes
the hair on the back is long and erect, almost as in the
badger ; its colour is white mixed with black, and darkest
on the shoulders.
   The bag on the belly is very apparent by its prominence,
especially when the singular ossa marsupialia or cornua
pelvis abdominalia lie under it. The place of its aperture is
marked only by a longitudinal fissure.
   The tail is about the length of the body ; it is almost na
ked, and as scaly as that of the rat, but a real cauda pre-
hens'dis.
   The shoulders and fore legs are black, and covered with
soft hair. The toes arc naked, and of a flesh colour.      The
hind feet are furnished with detached toes with a small flat
nail, but on all the other toes there are hooked claws of a
white colour.
   A figure of the animal, drawn from the life, may be seen
in my Abbildungen naturhistorischer Gegenstande, tab. 54.
   It is a real animal omvivorvm, and can feed upon any
kind of fruit ; it is fondest of plums, and of other food,
next to flesh, of fowl, game, and in particular of soup and
bouilli. It chews its food with great deliberation, and
catches the large pieces very dexterously with its fore feet ;
and it uses these feet with great address for dressing its
snout, on which occasions it sits on its hind legs like a
squirrel.
   Its cry, which it seldom emits except when irritated, is a
weak kind of grunting.        It drinks very little, and some
times not for several days.        It seldom makes water, and
even when in good health voids its excrements only once
in four or fiveTiays.     It however does neither in the place
where it lies, but always retires to a coiner of its kennel.
   In general it preserves itself very clean ; and on the
whole is a quiet, good-natured animal ; slow, and as it
were cautious in all its motions ; and of so strong a consti
tution that the people in America are accustomed to say,

" If      a cat,according to the proverb, has nine lives, the
opossum has nineteen."
    I shall now say a few words respecting the oldest ac
counts and figures of this animal, which were published in
Europe after the discovery of the New World.
    The first person who made mention of            as far as    it,            I
know, was V. Pinzon, who accompanied Columbus on
 his first voyage of discovery. This notice       to be found  is
in Herwag's Collection (Novus Orbis, the first edition of
 1532, p. 121*.)
    About the end of the fifteenth century one of these ani
mals was brought alive to Seville, and presented to the
king of Granada.
    Peter Martyr, who saw       dead specimen of this animal,
                                        a
gave     amore accurate account of the opossum, which he
thus describes     " Monstrosum animal, vulpino rostro, cer-
                      :
copitheca cauda vespertilioneis auribus, manibus humanis,
                          ;
pedibus simiam æmulans, &c."
    The name of simivulpa was first given to          Gylli, init   by
his edition of Ælian, 1553, 4to. p. 209; and this denomi
nation was afterwards adopted        Gessner.by

given as brought from the eastern coast of Terra Fir ma,
with this inscription    " Reperitur hie animal habens reser-

   The first tolerable figure was given           Nierenberg,  by
p. 156,        we except the woolly hair and the hind feet,
              if

             The third Generation           of   the Porcupine      Man.
   The well-known astronomer J. Machin gave in the Phi
losophical Transactions for 1732s the first account of boy                  a
of 14 vears of age, afterwards called the porcupine wan,
whose whole skin, the head, the palms of the hand, and the
soles of the sect excepted, was covered with corneous pegs,
which gave the body an appearance as         covered with if                    a
coat of mail.    He  was not born with this cuticular defor

 mity, which first made its appearance seven or eight weeks
 after birth, at which period the skin became yellow, and
 gradually continued to grow darker, till at length it became
 black, and soon after thicker and more corneous.
    In his fiftieth year this man, who was now married and a
 father, exhibited himself in London, together with his sop,
 who had the same deformity of skin.                The celebrated
 Baker, who wrote on the microscope, gave at that time
 in the Philosophical Transactions* an appendix to M.
 Machin's paper ; and as the latter had given a representa
 tion of the hand of the father, the former gave a figure of
 that of the son from a drawinc, an engraving of which may
 be seen also in Edwards's Gleanings of Natural History,
 p. 1, tab. 212.
    This son afterwards married ; and in the month of Sep
 tember 1801 I saw two of his sons perfectly like their fa
 ther and grandfather, and consequently the third genera
tion of this family so singular on account of this cuticular
 deformity.
    The oldest was twenty-two years of age and married, the
 younger was fourteen. Both were stout, well made, and of
an athletic constitution.      The older was a good pugilist like
his grandfather, who is said to have excelled in this gymnastic
art. His face, the palms of the hands, and the soses of the
feet were of the usual appearance, but seemed to me to be
uncommonly red. The skin of the remaining parts of the
body was covered with corneous excrescences,            or pegs of
greater or less size, and of a more or less horny nature.
The longest, strongest, and hardest, were on the fore arm
and thighs ; the finest were on some parts of the lower
belly. They were in general smaller on the younger bro
ther, and in many places, such as the breast, soft. The
largest excrescences were from four to five lines in length,
and of an irregular prismatic form, with blunt edges, al
most as if pressed flat.     The thickest were about three lines
in diameter; at the extremities in general split, and many
of them diverging like a fork.               On the other hand, I
scarcely observed one of them of that cylindric form ascri
bed to them by Baker, who besides supposed them to be
hollow ; at least such was the opinion of Haller, who con
sidered this as a confirmation of Boerhaave's opinion in re
gard to the construction of the epidermis, as he says :
                                                              "  In

certe exemplum quasi de industria         ad confonnandam prae-
ceptoris    sententiam  factum   est."   Boerhaave        says expressly
of the epidennis :    "  Constat rasorum exhalantium et inba-
lantium innumerabilium extremis annulis, inter se connatis."
    Where the excrescences were longest and thickest, thev
appeared to me to be like those which I have seen in the
elephant under the forehead and above the trunk.
   The colour of them in general appeared to be a chesnut
or coffee brown. This however was the case at the surface,
for in other parts the larger ones were rather vellowish
    The hair of the skin appeared sometimes as if grown into
the horny substance of these excrescences.
    Both the brothers, as well as the father and grandfather,
had had the smallpox, in the last stage of which they lost
the greater part of their excrescences ; but thev were soon
gradually reproduced. In general they drop off singly from
time to time, especially in winter ; but new ones gradually
grow up. When thev are in anv manner torn off, the skin
which lies under them readilv begins to bleed.
   The skin on the top of the head before, and especially in
the oldest, forms a kind of broad callosity, which has some
resemblance to the tofis of the camel.
    The perspiration of these two brothers exhibits nothing
uncommon, no perceptible           smell, Sec. and during great
heats or violent exercise they sweat like other men.
    I am acquainted with onlv two cases which have a real
analogy to that of the porcupine men from Suffolk.                  The
one is the boy from Biseglia, of whom Stalp van der Wiel
has given a figure and some account, in his Observations * :
the other is a female child, three years of age, at Vienna,
whose history and an account of the cure have been pub
lished by J. A. von firambillasf-            In both the face was
free from these excrescences,        but the palms of the hands
and the soles of the feet were the most covered with them.
An observation made in regard to the boy corresponds ex
actly with a circumstance related of the porcupine man : ,fDe-
lapsis veteribus, novæ illico snecedebant squamæ, quibus
avulsis mox effluebat sanguis :" and the case is the same
with what Branibilla says of the girl : " she was born with a
smooth and somewhat yellow skin, but in six weeks it be
came brown, and in the course of a year black and bristly."
The last-mentioned child was freed from its bristly warts

told bv Baker that the first porcupine man twice employed
salivation to cleanse his skin ; that by these means the ex
crescences dropped off, and that the skin continued for
some time as white and smooth as that of other people; but
that soon after the cure it became covered with these horny
excrescences as before.
   Other instances of singular deformities in the skin are
mentioned bv Fabricius, Hildanus, Fourcrov, &c, but
these are so different from that here alluded to, that they
cannot be placed in the same class.
XII. A    Survey and Report of the Coasts and Central High
   lands of Scotland; made by the Command of the Right
   Honourable the Imds Commissioners of His Majesty's
   Treasury in the Autumn of 1802.           By Thomas Tel-

                          The Fisheries.
Xn what    regards the fisheries, I beg leave to quote a pas
sage  from  my last year's Report.      " I believe it is genemly
admitted, that in the improvement of a country, the inter
ference of government should extend only to the removing
obstacles, and affording conveniences which are of a na
ture not easily to be surmounted by individuals, or any
body of men who can be brought to act together ; and
where it is evident that by removing those obstacles and
affording these conveniences, the exertions of individuals
will be greatly facilitated, so as to promote the general good
of the empire."
   The objects connected with the Fisheries, which seem
to come under the foregoing description, are, 1st, the want
of a ready communication by water between the east and
west coasts ; 2dlv, the want of communications by land
from the low countries and the east coast, with the shores
and fishing lochs of the west coast ; 3dly , the inconveniences
arising from the operation of the salt laws; and 4thly, the
want of a harbour in Caithness.
   The first and second of those objects have already been
fullv discussed under the heads of the Caledonian Canal, and
the proposed Bridges and Roads. The third has been so
often and thoroughly investigated, that I shall only in this
place take the liberty of mentioning that all the information
                                                            I have

76                  A   Survey and Report         of   the Coasts
I have received tends to confirm the justice of the com
plaints against the laws now in force which regard salt.
   As to the fourth object, the harbour of Wick, in Caith
ness, which I examined, estimated,    and reported upon last
year, will remove  the just complaints of want of protection,
on the N. E. coast.
                                      The Emigrations.
                      have already taken place from various
     That eniisrrations
parts    of   the        is a fact upon which there does not
                    Ifighlands,
remain room to doubt : from the best information I have
been able to procure, about three thousand persons went
away in the course of last year ; and, if I am rightly in
formed, three times that number are preparing to leave the
country in the present year.
   I shall not encroach upon your lordships' time by inves
tigating all the remote or unimportant collateral causes of
emigration, but shall proceed to that which 1 consider to
be the most powerful in its present operation ; and that is,
converting large districts of the country into extensive
sheepwalks.     This not only requires much fewer people to
manage    the same  tract of country, but in general an entirely
new people, who have been accustomed to this mode of life,
are brought from the southern parts of Scotland.
   The difference of rents to the landlords between sheep
and black cattle             is,
                         understand, at least three to one, and
                                 I
yet on account of the extraordinary rise in the prices of
sheep and wool, the sheep farmers have of late years been
acquiring wealth.       As the introducing sheep farms over
countries heretofore stocked with black cattle creates an
extensive    demand    for the young sheep from the esta
blished farms,         possible that the high prices may con
                        it   is
tinue until     considerable portion of the country
                    a                                      fully         is
stocked after this takes place, the quantities of sheep pro
             :
duced will bear    very great proportion to the demand, and
                        a
then    it  possible the prices may fall below the average va
             is
lue: in this case        probable the farms will be subdivided,
                            it   is
and     proportion of black cattle and cultivation be intro
        a
duced in the lower grounds in the valleys, while the upper
parts of the hills continue to be pastured with sheep.     This
I consider as the most improved state of Highland farming,
and      consistent with
        is                    very considerable population
                                        a                                     :   a
beautiful instance of this      to be seen along the north side
                                            is
of Loch Tay. But improved communications,              means of     by
roads and bridges, are necessary for this state of society; and
for this reason    have said, that
                        I               these conveniences had
                                                 if
                                                           been

             and Centred Highlands    of Scotland.           11
been sooner introduced     into the Highlands, it is possible
this emigration might not have taken place, at least to the
present extent.
   The very high price of black cattle has also facilitated the
means of emigration, as it has furnished the old farmers
with a portion of capital which enables them to transport
their families beyond the Atlantic.
   In some few cases a greater population than the land can
support in any shape, has been the cause of emigrations ;
such was the island of Tirce.
   Some have, no doubt, been deluded by accounts sent back
from others gone before them ; and many deceived by artful
persons, who hesitate not to sacrifice these poor ignorant
people to selfish ends.
   A  very principal reason must also be, that the people,
when turned out of their black cattle farms to make way
for the sheep farmers, see no mode of employment whereby
they can earn a subsistence in their own country ; and
sooner than seek it in the Low Lands of Scotland, or in
England, they will believe what is told them may be done
in the farming line in America.
   What I have here mentioned appear to me to be the im
mediate causes of the present emigrations from the north
western parts of Scotland. To point out the means of pre
venting emigrations in future, is a part of my duty, upon
which I enter with no small degree of hesitation.        As the
evil at present seems to arise chiefly from the conduct of
land-owners, in changing the œconomy of their estates, it
may be questioned whether government can with justice
interfere, or whether any essential benefits arc likely to
arise from this interference.
   In one point of view it may be stated, that, taking the
mountainous parts of Scotland as a district of the British
empire, it is the interest of the empire that this district be
made to produce as much human food as it is capable of
doing at the least possible expense ; that this may be done
by stocking it chiefly with sheep ; that it is the interest of
the empire the food so produced should not be consumed
by persons residing amongst the mountains totally unem
ployed, but rather in some other parts of the countrv,
where their labour can be made productive either in the bu
siness of agriculture, fisheries or manufactures ; and that by
suffering every person to pursue what appears to them to be
their own interest, that although some temporary inconve
niences may arise, vet, upon the whole, that matters will in

78           A   Survey and Report   of   the Coasts
the end adjust themselves into the forms most suitable for
the place.
    In another point of view it may be stated, that it is a
great hardship, if not a great injustice, that the inhabitants
of an extensive district should all at once be driven from
their native country, to make way for sheep farming, which
is likely to be carried to an imprudent extent ; that in a
few years this excess will be evident ; that, before it is dis
covered, the country will be depopulated, and that race of
people which has of late years maintained so honourable a
share in the operations of our armies and navies will then
be no more : that in a case where such a numerous body of
the people are deeply interested, it is the duty of government
to consider it as an extraordinary case, and one of those
 occasions which justifies them in departing a little from the
 maxims of general policy : that for this purpose regulations
 should be made to prevent land-owners from lessening the
 population upon their estates below a given proportion ; and
 that some regulation of this sort would in the end be in fa
 vour of the land-owners, as it would preserve the popula
 tion best suited to the most improved mode of highland
 farming, such as is practised. at Breadalbane, and to the
 establishment of fishing villages, on the principle laid do.vn
 and practised so successfully by Mr. Hugh Stevenson of
 Oban, at Arnisdale on Loch Hourn.
     In whatever light the foregoing statements may be viewed,
 there is another on which there can, 1 think, be no differ
  ence of opinion. This is, that if there are any public works
  to be executed, which, when completed, will prove gene
  rally beneficial to the country, it is advisable these works
  should be undertaken at the present time. This would fur
  nish employment for the industrious and valuable part of
  the people in their own country, they would by tins moens
  be accustomed to labour, they would acquire some capital,
  and the foundations would be laid for future employments.
  If, as I have been credibly informed, the inhabitants are
  strongly attached to their native count ly, they would greedily
  embrace this opportunity of being enabled to remain in      it,
  with the prospect of bettering their condition, because, be
  fore the works were completed,   it   must be evident to every
  one that the whole face o: the cuntry would be changed.

   mentioned, are of the. description here alluded to they will

    of tide in Scotland, fit to admit ships of war, and
    in order to facilitate the intercourse with Ireland
    from this frith. The other half of this expense to

     and maintained by the town of Kirkcudbright                100
 4. To the expense of a bridge over the Dee at this
     place, provided that the surveyor of the general
     post-office shall think this the best line for a mail
     coach, the roads to be made at the expense of the
     town and county         -                               2,500

     bour, and keep it in repair         -                    2,700
 6. To part of the expense of making a harbour at
     Port Nessock, in order to obtain a more regular
     communication with Ireland than at Port Patrick,
     to afford a proper station for revenue cutters, and
     a place of refuge to vessels driven back from the
     Mull of Galloway, the remainder of the expense,

       SIR,                                  Edinburgh, May 20, 1S03.
x\.s you    have  admitted    Mr. Henry's claim in favour of
his father's discovery, I trust you will do equal justice to
an author, in whose cause 1 presume, though unauthorized,
to appear.    In your last number is a communication from
Mr. Portal on the subject of combustion : he there men
tions the opinion, that heat and light are different bodies,
simultaneously separated in this process, without their hav-

ing any peculiar connection.       This system he attributes
to Dr. Thomson, author of a verv excellent article on che
mistry, in the Supplement to the Encyclopædia Britannica,
and of a separate elementary work on the same subject.
You remark in a note that this opinion was before published
in Gren's Chemistry.
   Long before the appearance of the latter work in England,
and I believe before the publication of that shorter and
more comprehensive system, which has been translated, and
which you quote, the same opinion was published in a work
entitled " Essays bv a Society of Gentlemen at Exeter j"
and those essays, which relate to philosophical subjects,
were reprinted in this part of Britain, by what authority I am
not informed.     In one of these essays the peculiar and di
stinguishing properties of light and heat are pointed out.
The author attempts to show that they are distinct bodies,
by a variety of facts, and that, instead of being related, they
are apparently antagonizing principles, repelling each other.
He traces the principle of light, as it forms an ingredient in
many different bodies, not onlv in chemical combination,
but in a looser union, where its separation takes place with
out decomposition.
   If this opinion be then established, that author must have
the prior claim ; and it is remarkable that, in the Encyclo
pædia, it is attributed to Dr. Parr of Exeter, though the
name is omitted in Dr. Thomson's separate work. But with
this conjecture I have no business : my wish is only to state
the circumstances.
   As I have paid some attention to this subject, I may
trouble you with some further remarks on                 it,
                                                     should you
approve of the communication.           will now only intrude

         I.   On the Preparation         of   Skin for Tanning.
In   all the processes for forming leather, the skins arc de
pilated, and freed from flesh and extraneous matter before
they are submitted to the action of the tanning lixivium.

              Observations       on the Processes         of Tanning.              83
degree      of putrefaction       is induced,  for the purpose of en
abling the hair to be readily separated ; but            m general this
effect is produoed by a mixture of lime and             water.
   The process by putrefaction is so simple             as to require no
comment : the epidermis is loosened by                      it,
                                                        and the cellular
substance that constitutes the bulb of the              hair softened in
 such   amanner that        it   may be easily separated from the cutis
or true skin.

 soluble in water. This, however, does not appear to be the
 case
    :   I exposed to two ounces of lime water four grains of
epidermis, separated from cow skin, and which had been
 freed from loose moisture            by
                                 blotting paper     but, after five

matter, before the skins are submitted to any new chemical
agents.
  It   has been proposed to use the residuum of the tanning
lixivium, or the exhausted ooze, for the purposes of depila
tion;   but this liquor seems to contain no substances capa

     Skins, after being depilated and cleansed, are in this
 country generally subjected to other processes of prepara
 tion before they are impregnated with the tanning prin
 ciple.
     The large and thick hides which have undergone incipi
 ent putrefaction are introduced for a short time into a
 strong infusion of bark, when they are said by manufac
 turers to be coloured; and after this they are acted upon
 by water impregnated with a little sulphuric acid, or ace
 tous acid formed by the fermentation of barley or rye.       In
 this case they become harder and denser than before, and
 fitted, after being tanned, for the purpose of forming the
 stouter kinds of sole leather. The acids are capable of com
 bining both with skin and with tannin : and it would ap
pear that, in this process, a triple combination must be
effected on the surface of the skin, though from theory
one should be disposed to conclude, that the interior part
could be little modified in consequence of the colouring,
and the action of the acids.
    The light skins of cows, the skins of calves, and all
smaller skins, are treated in a very different way, being
Submitted for some days to the action of a lixivium, called
the grainer, made by the infusion of pigeons dung in water.
After this operation they are found thinner and softer than
before, and more proper for producing flexible leather.
When the infusion of pigeons dung is examined, after being
freshly made, it is found to contain a little carbonate of
ammonia ; but in a short time it undergoes fermentation,
when carbonic acid and hvdrocarbonate are given out by        it,
and small quantity of acetous acid formed. The alkali in

   This work is divided into two parts : the first compre
hends the calendar, that is to sav, every thing relating to
observations both at sea and at land ; a catalogue of fioo
principal stars for the l6t of January 1805, corrected by
Michel Lefrancais de Lalande. A geographical table of

   Having    already noticed the two preceding volumes of
this useful work, we shall only observe, that the one now
announced seems to be executed with the same care and
attention, and that the plates are engraved in the same style
of excellence. The two parts of this volume contain am
phibia; comprehending tortoises, frogs, toads, lizards, and
serpents. As a specimen of the work, we subjoin the follow
ing account of the Coluber Naja :
   The coluber naja, or cobra de capello, is a native of
India, where it appears to be one of the most common, as
well as most noxious, of the serpent tribe ; very frequently
proving fatal, in the space of a few minutes, to those who
unfortunately experience its bite.      Its remarkable form and
colours are such as to distinguish it with great ease from
almost every other snake.        Its general length seems to be
three or four feet, and the diameter of the body about an
inch and quarter : the head is rather small than large, and
is covered on the fore part with large smooth scales, re
sembling in this respect the majority of innoxious serpents;
the back part, sides, and neck, with smaller ovate scales ;
and the remainder of the animal, on the upper parts, with
small, distinct, oblong-oval scales, not ill resembling the
general form of a grain of rice.       At a small distance be
yond the head is a lateral swelling or dilatation of the skin,
which is continued to the distance of about four inches
downwards, where the outline gradually sinks into the cy-
lindric form of the rest of the oody. This part is exten
sile, at the pleasure of the animal ; and when viewed from
above, while in its most extended state, is of a somewhat
cordated form, or wider at the upper than the lower part :
it is marked above by a very large and conspicuous patch or
spot, greatly resembling the figure of a pair of spectacles ;
the mark itself being white with black edges, and the mid
dle of each of the rounded parts black. This mark is more
or less distinct in different individuals, and also varies occa
sionally in size and form, and in some is even altogether
wanting.     The usual colour of the animal is a pale ferrugi
nous brown above ; the under parts being of a blueish white,
sometimes slightly tinged with pale brown, or yellow : the
tail, which is of moderate length, tapers gradually, and ter
minates in a slender, sharp-pointed extremity.

     This formidable reptilehas obtained its Portuguese title
of cobra de capello, or /tootled snake, from the appearance
which it presents when viewed in front in an irritated state,
or when preparing to bite ; at which time it bends the head
rather downwards, and seems hooded, as it were, in some
degree, by the expanded skin of the neck.          In India it is
every where exhibited publicly as a show, and is, of course,
more universally known in that country than almost any other
of the race of reptiles. It is carried about in a covered basket,
and so managed by its proprietors as to assume, when exhi
bited, a kind of dancing motion ; raising itself up on its
 lower part, and alternately moving its head and body from
 side to side for some minutes, to the sound of some musical
 instrument which is played during the time. The Indian
jugglers, who thus exhibit the animal, first deprive it of its
 fangs ; by which means they are secured from the danger of
its Bite.
   Dr. Russel, in. his account of experiments made in India
with this serpent, observes, that, as a general standard for
a comparison of the effect of its bite with that of other poi
sonous serpents, he never knew it prove mortal to a dog in
less than twenty-seven minutes, and to a chicken in less
than half a minute.      Thus, fatal as it         is,
                                                its poison seems
not so speedy    in operation as that of the rattle-snake, which
has been known to kill      adog in the space of two minutes.
   In the month of June 1787,         dog bitten by

capello on the inside of the thigh howled at first as           in    if
severe pain  : after two or three minutes he lay down, con
tinuing to howl and moan after twenty minutes he rose,
                                :
but with much difficulty, being unable to walk, and his
whole frame appeared greatly disordered. He soon lay down
again, and in    a   few minutes was seized with convulsions,
in  which he expired twenty-seven minutes after the bite.
   A large and very stout dog was bitten                 by

ever, nearly an hour longer, walking on the three remaining
legs, seeming not otherwise disordered        but after this time
                                               ;
he laid himself along in great inquietude, his head and throat
being convulsed in an uncommon degree            he made several
                                                    ;

continuing in this state near an hour he expired.

  up soon. In twenty-five minutes he was seized with con
  vulsions, succeeded by stupor, in which state he lay for ten
  minutes : the convulsions, however, returned, and he ex
  pired in a quarter of an hour ; being fifty-six minutes after
  the bite.
     Aug. 9, a cobra dc capello which had lost his two long
  est fangs, but retained two of the second order, was made
  to bite a very large stout dog. At first the dog complained
  loudly, though without drawing up the thigh, or showing
  any other symptom of poison: but, happening at this time
  to break loose, he was pursued, and, after a chase of an
  hour and a half, was brought back, much fatigued and
  heated.    After resting a quarter of an hour, water was of
  fered to him, which was refused, though he ate some morsels
  of bread thrown into it. About a quarter of an hour after
  wards he became much disturbed, grew entirely outrageous,
  howling violently, snapping at and gnawing the stake to
  which he was tied with incredible ferocity. This continued
  about three hours, when, growing faint, his bowlings grew
  weaker, his convulsions increased, and he expired in about
  four hours after the bite.
     A pig bitten by a snake of this kind, which had been

          in the tail ; but that part being found too small, the
    elly was bitten, a little above the vent. The bitten snake
foodo)
  soon lost its former activity, and, when put under a glass,
  coiled itself up. In this state it was left, and after an hour
  and a quarter was found dead.        On opening the belly, the
  parts immediately beneath the bite appeared much inflamed,
  though it could not be discovered whether the fangs had
 penetrated into the cavity.
     A cobra de capello received by Dr. Russel from Gan-
 jam, under the name of saltanag, was made to bite another
  remarkably large cobra brought from the same place under
 the name of coultiah. The poison was shed on the place,
 but no marks of fangs could be perceived, and the coultiah
  remained as well as before : this experiment was repeated
 with the same result, though a little blood as well as poison
 was found on the part bitten.
     Some days after this^ a cobra de capello (of the variety
                                                           called

belly : both fangs visibly acted ; blood appeared on the
wound, but no other consequence followed.           A tar tutta
bitten immediately after in the same manner, died within
two hours.
    Chickens and pigeons bitten by a cobra de capello, whose
fangs had been eradicated, suffered no symptoms of poison;
but when poison taken from the same snake was inserted
 into their bodies, either by incision or puncture, they suf

 -L he following is a short account of experiments on the.
absorption of different gases by water, at different tempera
tures, and under different pressures, made by Mr. William
Henry, and communicated to the Society. The processes
were carried on by means of instruments invented by the
author; plates and descriptions of which are annexed to the
account of the experiments.
    Mr. Cavendish, in pursuing his first experiments in pneu
matic chemistry, ascertained many of the circumstances
of the absorption of carbonic acid gas by water ; and Dr.
Priestley had noticed the relations of this absorption to
pressure : more lately, the manufacture of artificial gaseous
waters has called the attention of many chemists to this
part of the subject ; but the power of combination of other
aeriform fluids with water, and the manner in which this
power is modified by different causes, have been but little
studied.
    Mr. Henry, in the first part of the detail of his experi
ments, states, that the quantity of carbonic acid gas absorbed
by water, is influenced materially by the quantity of com
mon air, which may be either combined with the water, or
                                                         mixed

mixed with the gas ; and the effect is in some measure pro-
             to the quantity of the residue, the absorption
Eortional
  eing  always  greatest when a large quantity of gas was agi
tated with a comparatively small quantity of water.
    From various trials made with great care, Mr. Henry
concludes, that, in judging of the influence of temperature,
the experiments should he made on equal proportions of gas,
and of water, and that in this case, with regard to carbonic
acid gas, 1 -fourteenth of the whole bulk, absorbable at 55°,
is the diminution of the quantity of absorption produced by
each elevation of 10° of Fahrenheit.
    Of sulphuretted hydrogen gas, 100 parts of water, at 55°,
absorb 86 parts, and at 55° 78 parts.
    Of nitrous oxide gas, 100 cubic inches of wrater, at 55°,
take up 50, and at 70" only 44.
    The experiments on those gases which are absorbed only
in small proportions by water the author could not conve
niently make at more than one temperature.
    He found that at 60°, 100 cubic inches of water absorb,
of nitrous gas, 5 cubic inches ; of oxygen, 2*63 ; of phos-
phuretted hydrogen, 2-14; of gaseous oxide of carbon, 2-01 ;
of carburetted hydrogen gas, 1-40; of nitrogen gas, 1-20;
of hydrogen gas, 1-08.
    Mr. Henry mentions that during the absorption of large
quantities of carbonic acid, sulphuretted hydrogen and ni
trous oxide by water, an increase of temperature of about
 3-fourths of a degree is perceived.
    From the results of a great variety of experiments made
in the more absorbable gases, and on oxygen and nitrogen
gases, the author draws the following general conclusion
with regard to pressure :
    That under the same circumstance of temperature, water
takes up the same volume of gas, whether it be condensed,
or under ordinary pressure ; but, as the spaces occupied bv
gases are inversely as the weights compressing them, it
follows, that water takes up of gas condensed, by one, two,
or three additional atmospheres, a quantity which is equal
to twice, thrice, or four times the quantity taken up under
 the ordinary pressure.                                     D.

    On  the 28ih of May the Galvanic Society made, for the

electricity, at an explosive distance, but at the point of
contact.
    2d, That Coulomb's electrometric balance does not indi
cate electric tension in the ratio of the number of pairs of
disks, or of the strength of the pile.

quired to kill a small animal.

movements of inspiration and expiration. If a lighted taper
be placed near a small aperture made in the trachea, the
flame at the moment when the Galvanism is applied is drawn
into the breast by the impulse-of the air passing into the
lungs, and extinguished when the air issues.
    5 th, That contractions can be produced in the head and
forehead of a large animal — a horse, for example — by pla
cing it at a very great distance, and making it communicate
with the pile by one conductor, while the other is formed
by the common reservoir*.

                    A  DEFENCE AGAINST FIRE.
Jl rofessor Palmer,           of Hamburgh, has lately discovered
a means by which         all inflammable matters, such as wood,
          linen, &c, can not only be secured from burning,
Eaper,
  ut also be speedily extinguished when on fire.                 These
means consist in a powder composed of one ounce of sul
phur, one ounce red ochre, and six ounces of copperas water.
To render wood incombustible, it is first daubed over with
cabinet-maker's glue, after which the powder is strewed
over it : and this operation, when the wood becomes drv,
is three or four times repeated.       When the powder is to be
applied to linen or paper, plain water is employed in the
 room of glue : in other respects the process is the same,
with this difference alone, that the operation is performed
 only once or twice.        When the powder is used for articles
 already on fire, two ounces are sufficient to extinguish a
 square foot of surface. Professor Palmer intends to publish

 SPONTANEOUS DECOMPOSITION OF A FABRIC OF SILK *.
    On the night of March 19, 1802, during the session of
 congress at Washington, Jonathan Dayton, one of the se
 nators then attending from the state of New Jersey, sus
 tained loss of
         a          pair of black silk stockings in an uncom
                        a
 mon manner. On undressing himself at bed-time, his stock
 ings were the last of his garments which he took off. The
 •weather being cold, he wore two pair, the inner of wool and
 the outer of silk.  When he stripped off the silk stockings,
 he let them drop on     woollen carpet lying
                            a                            by
                                                  the bed-sicTe            j
 and one of his garters, which was of white woollen ferretin,
 fell down with the stockings.       The under-stockings, on
 being pulled off, were thrown at some distance, near the
 foot of the bed.   He observed, on separating and removing
 the silk stockings from the woollen ones, that there was an
 unusual snapping and sparkling of electric matter. But as
he had been long acquainted with the appearance,              at      it
 tracted but transient notice.
    He fell asleep, and remained undisturbed until morning;,
when the servant entered to kindle the fire.      The man ob
served that one of the leather slippers, lying on the carpet,
and partly covered          by
                         one of the stockings, was very much
burnt.    Mr. Dayton then rose, and found that the leather
over which the stockings had lain was converted to          coat.
                                                                   is a
The stockings were changed to         brown, or what
                                           a               com-*
monly called butternut colour. And although, to the eye,
                    a
the stitches of the legs, and even the threads of their clocks,
appeared to be firm and entire; yet, as soon as an attempt
was made to touch and handle them, they were found to be
wholly destitute of cohesion, their texture and structure be
ing altogether destroyed.     Nothing but      remnant of car
                                                     a
bonic matter was left, except that part of the heel of one
                                               a
of the stockings was not decomposed.
    Though this destruction of the stockings took place dur
ing the night, when nobody saw the manner and circum
stances ot the process, yet there was evidence enough of

 the evolution of much caloric while it was going on ; for
 every thing in contact with the stockings was turned to
 coal or cinder. Beside the slipper before mentioned, the
 garter was burned.      It had fallen partly on the carpet, and
 partly on and between the stockings.         As far as it touched
 the stockings it was perfectly disorganized and carbonated,
 and immediately beyond that limit was as sound as ever. The
 part of the carpet, with its fringe, which lay between the
stockings and the floor, was in like manner totally destroyed,
just as tar as it was covered by the stockings, and no further,
 she wooden plank, which was of pitch-pine, was also con
 siderably scorched ; and beneath the place where the thick
est folds of the stockings had lain was converted to char
 coal or lamp-black to a considerable depth. In throwing
 down the stockings when they were pulled off, it happened
 that about a third part of the length of one of them fell not
 upon the carpet, but upon the bare floor.        This part of the
 stocking   was  decomposed    like the rest,  and  the floor very
much scorched where it had lain.
    There was very little fire on the hearth, and the little
 there was was eight or nine feet distant.        The candle had
 been carefully extinguished, and stood on a table in another
 direction, and about equally distant. Indeed, no application
 of burning coals or of lighted candles could have produced
 the effects which have been described. It would seem that
 the combustion, if it may be so called, proceeded from a
 surcharge of caloric, or electricity, in the silk, accumulated
by means not well understood ; and that, not being refera
 ble to any known external agent, it may,           [in the present
 state of our information, be termed spontaneous.
    The substances chiefly consumed were leather, wool, silk,
 and resinous wood.        The linen lining of the slipper was
 indeed destroyed as far as the leather        it touched was de
 stroyed. But where      it did not come in contact,      it
                                                           escaped,
 and the fire showed no disposition to burn even the linen
 beyond the boundaries prescribed to      it  on the leather.
    What   is   the theory of this phænomcnon       ?  With what
 other facts is   itimmediately connected      ? Whatever men of
 science may determine on these points, one thing seems to
 be evident, that  if spontaneous combustion can happen thus
 to bodies so little inflammable as leather, silk, and 'wool,
 that instances of its occurrence in bodies easier to burn are
 more frequent than     is generally supposed.

       MEASUREMENT OP A DEGHEE OF THE MERIDIAN.
     Astronomers long suspected that there was an error in
the measurement ofa degree of the earth, made in Lapland
 in 1736 by Maupertuis, Lemonnier, Outhier, and Celsius,
because that degree was greater than it ought to be accord
ing to all the other measurements.              M. Melanderhiolin
has found means to repeat this measurement.             He informs
me in a letter that SI. Svanberg and three other astrono
mers have found the degree to be 57209 toises in lat. 66°
So', which makes 1 96 toises less than by the measurement
of the French astronomers, and gives for the flattening of
the earth a 313th part.        This agrees better with the other
comparisons, and shows us that the figure of the earth is
not so irregular as was supposed from the northern degree.

Mechain and Delambre made a few years ago. He is ac

capable than M. Mechain to overcome difficulties ; and we

XVIII.      On the Modifications of Clouds, and on the Prin
   ciples  of their Production, Suspension, and Destruction ;
   being the Substance of an Essay read before the Askesian
   Society in the Session 1802-3.            By Luke Howard,
   Esq.*
OINCE       the increased attention which has heen given to
meteorology, the study of the various appearances of water
suspended in the atmosphere is become an interesting and
even necessary branch of that pursuit.
   If clouds were the mere result of the condensation of va
pour in the masses of atmosphere which they occupy, if
their variations were produced by the movements of the at
mosphere, alone, then indeed might the study of them be
deemed an useless pursuit of shadows, an attempt to de
scribe forms which, being the sport of winds, must be ever
varying, T>d therefore not to be defined.
   But however the erroneous admission of this opinion may
have operated to prevent attention to them, the case is not
so with clouds.       They are subject to certain distinct modifi
cations, produced by the general causes which effect all the
variations of the atmosphere : they are commonly as good
visible indications of the operation of these causes as is the
countenance of the state ot a person's mind or body.
   It is the frequent observation of the countenance of the
sky, and of its connection with the present and ensuing phæ-
nomena, that constitutes the antient and popular meteoro
logy.     The want of this branch of knowledge renders the
predictions of the philosopher (who in attending only to
his instruments may be said only to examine the pulse of
the atmosphere) less generally successful than those of the
weather-wise mariner or husbandman.
   With the latter, the dependence of their labours on the
state of the atmosphere, and the direction of its currents,
creates a necessity ot frequent observation, which in its turn
produces experience.
   But as this experience is usually consigned only to the
memory of the possessor, in a confused mass of simple apho
risms, the skill resulting from it is in a manner incommu
nicable; for, however valuable these links when in connec
tion with the rest of the chain, they often serve, when taken
singly, only to mislead ; and the power of connecting them,

98           On the Modifications    of Clouds, and
in  order to form a judgment upon occasion, resides only in
the mind before which their relations have passed, though
perhaps imperceptibly, in review.       In order to enable the
meteorologist   to apply the  key ot' analysis to the experience
of others, as well as to record his own with brevity and pre
cision, it may perhaps be allowable to introduce a methodi
cal nomenclature, applicable to the various forms of sus
pended water, or, in other words, to the modifications of
cloud.
    By modification is to be understood simply the structure
or manner of aggregation, not the precise form or magni
tude, which indeed varies every moment in most clouds.
The principal modifications are commonly as distinguish
able from each other as a tree from a hill, or the latter from
a lake; although clouds in the same modification, considered
with respect to each other, have often only the common
resemblances which exist among trees, hills, or lakes, taken
generally.
   The nomenclature is drawn from the Latin. The reasons
for having recourse to a dead language for terms to be
adopted by the learned of different nations are obvious.       If
it should be asked why the Greek was not preferred, after
the example of chemistry, the author answers, that the ob
jects being to be defined by visible characters, as in natural
history, it was desirable that the terms adopted should at
once convey the idea of these, and render a recourse to de
finitions needless to such as understand the literal sense,
which many more would, it is concluded, in Latin than in
Greek words.
   There are three simple and distinct modifications, in any
one of which the aggregate of minute drops called a cloud
may be formed, increase to its greatest extent, and finally
decrease and disappear.
   But the same aggregate which has been formed in one
modification, upon a change in the attendant circumstances,
may pass into another.
   Or it may continue a considerable time in an intermediate
state, partaking of the characters of two modifications ; and
it may also disappear in this stage, or return to the first mo
dification.
   Lastly, aggregates separately formed in different modifi
cations may unite and pass into one exhibiting different
characters in different parts, or a portion of a simple ag
gregate may pass into another modification without sepa
rating from the remainder of the mass.
   Hence, together with the simple, it becomes necessary -to
                                                           admit

         their Production, Suspension, and Destruction.       99
 admit intermediate and compound modifications^          and to
 impose names on such of them as are worthy of notice.
    The simple modifications are thus named and defined :
    1. Cirrus. Des.       Nubes cirrata, tenuissima, quæ un-
 dique crescat.
    Parallel, flexuous, or diverging fibres, extensible in any
 or in all directions.
    2. Cumulus. Des.         Nubes cumulata, densa, sursum
crescens.
    Convex or conical heaps, increasing upward from a ho
rizontal base.
    3. Stratus. Des.       Nubes strata, aquae modo expansa,
deorsum crescens.
    A widely extended, continuous, horizontal sheet, in
creasing from below.
   This application of the Latin word stratus is a little
forced. But the substantive, stratum, did not agree in its
termination with the other two, and is besides already used
in a different sense even on this subject, e. g. a stratum of
clouds ; yet it was desirable to keep the derivation from the
verb sterno, as its significations agree so well with the cir
cumstances of this cloud.
   The intermediate modifications which require to be no
ticed are  :
   4.  Cirro-cumulus.       Des.   Nubcculæ densiores    subro
tundæ et quasi in agmine appositæ.
   Small, well defined roundish masses,     in close horizontal
arrangement.
   5. Cirro-stratus. Des. Nubes extenuata sub-concava
vel undulata.     Nubeculæ hujus modi appositæ.
   Horizontal or slightly inclined masses, attenuated towards
a part or the whole o£ their circumference, bent down
ward, or undulated, separate, or in groups consisting of
small clouds having these characters.
   The compound modifications are :
   6. Cumulo-stratus.         Des. Nubes densa, basim pla-
nam undique supercrescens, vel cujus moles longinqua vi-
detur partim plana partiin cumulata.
   The cirro-stratus blended with the cumulus, and either
appearing intermixed with the heaps of the latter or su-
peradding a wide-spread structure to its base.
    7. Cumulo-cirro-stratus vel Nimbus. Des. Nubes
vel nubium congeries pluviam efTundeas.
   The rain cloud. A cloud or system of clouds from which
rain is failing.   It is a horizontal sheet, above which the

from beneath.
                          Of the Cirrus.
    Clouds in this modification appear to have the least den
sity, the greatest elevation, and the greatest variety of extent
and direction. They are the earliest appearance after serene
weather.     They are first indicated by a few1 threads pen
cilled, as it were, on the sky. These increase in length,
and new ones are in the mean time added laterally.          Often
the first-formed threads serve as stems to support numerous
branches, which in their turn give rise to others.
    The increase is sometimes perfectly indeterminate, at
others it has a verv decided direction.       Thus the first few
threads being once formed, the remainder shall be propa
gated either in one, two, or more directions laterally, or
obliquely upward or downward, the direction being often
the same in a great number of clouds visible at the same
time : for the oblique descending tufts shall appear to con
verge towards a point in the horizon, and the long straight
streaks to meet in opposite points therein ; which is the op*
tical effect of parallel extension.
    Their duration is uncertain, varying from a few minutes
after the first appearance to an extent of many hours.       It is
long when they appear alone and at great heights, and
shorter when they are formed lower and in the vicinity of
other clouds.
    This modification, although in appearance almost mo
tionless, is intimately connected with the variable motions
of the atmosphere. Considering that clouds of this kind
have long been deemed a prognostic of wind, it is extraor
dinary that the nature of this connection should not have
been more studied, as the knowledge of it might have been
productive of useful results.
    In fair weather, with lieht variable breezes, the sky is
seldom quite clear of small groups of the oblique cirrus,
which frequently come on from the leeward, and the direc
tion of their increase is to windward.     Continued wet wea
ther is attended with horizontal sheets of this cloud, which
subside quickly and pass to the cirro-stratus.
    Before storms they appear lower and denser, and usually
in the quarter opposite to that from which the storm arises.
Steady high winds are also preceded and attended by streaks
running quite across the skv in the direction thev blow in.
    The relations of this modification with the state of the

 have not yet been attended to.
                               Of   t lie   Cumulus.
   Clouds in this modification are commonly of the most
dense structure : they are formed in the lower atmosphere,
and move along with the current which is next the earth.
  A small irregular spot first appears, and    as   were, the is,    it
nucleus on which they increase.     The lower surface conti
nues irregularly plane, while the upper rises into conical or
  hemispherical heaps      ;which may afterwards continue long
  nearly of the same bulk, or rapidly rise to mountains.
      In the former case they are usually numerous and near
  together, in the latter few and distant but whether there
                                                        ;
  are few or many, their bases always He nearly in one hori

  portionate to the extent of base, and nearly alike in many
  that appear at once.
     Their appearance, increase, and disappearance, in fair
 weather, are often periodical, and keep pace with the tem
 perature of the day. Thus they will begin to form some
 hours after sun-rise, arrive at their maximum in the hottest
 part of the afternoon, then go on diminishing and totally
 disperse about sun-set.
     But in changeable weather they partake of the vicissitudes
 of the atmosphere sometimes evaporating almost as soon
                    ;
 as formed, at others suddenly forming and as quickly pass
 ing to the eompound modifications.
    The cumulus of fair weather has              moderate elevation
                                                       a
 and extent, and  a     well defined rounded surface.       Previous
 to rain it    increases more rapidly, appears lower in the at
 mosphere, and with its surface full of loose fleeces or pro
tuberances.
    The formation of large cumuli to leeward in               strong   a
wind, indicates the approach of           calm with rain. When
                                                a
they do not disappear or subside about sun-set, but conti
nue to rise, thunder        to be expected in the night.

     Independently of the beauty and magnificence            adds to  it
the face of nature, the cumulus serves to skreen the earth
from the direct rays of the sun,                by
                                          its multiplied reflections
to diffuse, and, as   it were,  economise    the light, and also to
convey the product        of  evaporation   to    distance from the
                                                         a
place   of its  origin.  The   relations of  the  cumulus  with the
state of the barometer, &c. have not yet been enough at
tended to.

 102          On tlie Modifications     of Clouds, and
                           Of  the Stratus.
   This modification has a mean degree of density.
   It is the lowest of clouds, since Us inferior surface com
monly rests on the earth or water.
   Contrary to the last, which may be considered as be
longing to the day, this is properly the cloud of night;
the time of its first appearance being about sun-set.                 It
comprehends      all those  creeping   mists  which   in  calm   even
ing ascend in spreading sheets (like an inundation of water)
from the bottom of valleys and the surface of lakes, rivers,
&c.
   Its duration is frequently through the night.
   On the return of the sun the level surface of this cloud
begins to put on the appearance of cumulus, the whole at
the same time separating from the ground.             The continuity
is next destroyed, and the cloud ascends and evaporates, or
passes off with the appearance of the nascent cumulus.
   This has been long experienced as a prognostic of fair
weather*, and indeed there is none more serene than that
which is ushered in by it. The relation of the stratus to
the state of the atmosphere as indicated by the barometer,
&c. appears notwithstanding to have passed hitherto with
out due attention.
                       Of  the Cirro-cumulus.
   The cirrus having continued for         some time increasing or
stationary, usually passes     either  to the cirro-cumulus or the
cirro-stratus, at the same time descending to a lower station
in the atmosphere.
   The cirro-cumulus is formed from a cirrus, or from a
number of small separate cirri, by the fibres collapsing
as it were, and passing into small roundish masses, in which
the texture of the cirrus is no longer discernible, although
they still retain somewhat of the same relative arrangement.
This change takes place either throughout the whole mass
at once, or progressively from one extremity to the other.
In either case, the same effect is produced on a number of
adjacent cirri at the same time and in the same order.                 It
appears in some instances to be accelerated by the approach
of other clouds.
   This modification forms a very beautiful sky, sometimes
exhibiting numerous distinct beds of these small connected
clouds, floating at different altitudes.

    - The cirro-cumulus        is frequent in summer, and is attend
  ant on warm and dry weather.                It is also occasionally and
  more sparingly seen in the intervals of showers, and in
  winter *. It may either evaporate,               or pass to the cirrus or
  cirro-stratus.
                             Of  the Cirro-stratus.
      This cloud appears        to result from      the subsidence of the
  fibres of the cirrus to     a  horizontal position, at the same time
  that they approach towards each other laterally. The form
  and relative position, when seen in the distance, frequently
  give the idea of shoals of fish. Yet in this, as in other in
  stances, the structure must be attended to rather than the
 form, which varies much, presenting at other times the
 appearance        of parallel bars, interwoven streaks like the
 grain of polished wood, &:c. It is always thickest in the
 middle, or at one extremity, and extenuated towards the
 edge.      The distinct appearance of a cirrus does not always
 precede the production of this and the last modification.
     The cirro-stratus precedes wind and rain, the near or di
 stant approach of which may sometimes be estimated from
 its greater or less abundance and permanence.                  It is almost
 always    to   be  seen   in the    intervals   of  storms.     Sometimes
 this and the cirro-cumulus appear together in the sky, and
 even alternate with each other in the same cloud, when the
 different evolutions which ensue are a curious spectacle, and
 a judgment may be formed of the weather likely to ensue
 by observing which modification prevails at last. The cirro-
 stratus is the modification which most frequently and com
 pletely exhibits the phænomena of the solar and lunar halo,
 and (as supposed from a few observations) the parhelion and
 paraselene also.         Hence the reason of the prognostic for
 foul weather, commonly drawn from the appearance of
 halo f.

104              On the^lodifications          of Clouds, and
   This modification is on this account more peculiarly-
worthy of investigation.     Little is yet ascertained ot* the re
lations of this and the last modification with the barometer,
&c. although, as may be readily supposed, they have been
found to accord with opposite indications of those instru
ments.
                    Of the Cumulo-stratus.
  The different modifications which  have been just treated
of sometimes give place to each other, at other times two.
or more appear in the same skv ; but in this case the clouds
in the same modification lie mostly in the same plane of
elevation, those which are more elevated appearing through
the intervals of the lower, or the latter showing dark against
the lighter ones above them. When the cumulus increases
rapidly, a cirro-stratus is frequently seen to form around its
summit, reposing thereon as on a mountain, while the for
mer cloud continues discernible in some decree through it.
This state continues but a short time. The cirro-stratus
speedily becomes denser and spreads, while the superior
part of the cumulus extends itself and passes into           the "     it,
base continuing as before, and the convex protuberances
changing their position till they present themselves late
rally and downward.        More rarely the cumulus alone per
forms this evolution, and its superior part constitutes the
incumbent cirro-stratus.
   In either case   a  large lofty dense cloud    formed, which
                                                         is
may be compared to mushroom with
                             a                  very thick short
                                                     a
stem. But when          whole sky
                        a              crowded with this modifi
                                          is
cation, the appearances are more indistinct.       The cumulus
rises through the interstices of the superior clouds, and the
whole, seen as     itpasses off in the distant horizon, presents
to the fancy mountains covered with snow, intersected with
darker ridges and lakes of water, rocks and towers, &c.
The distinct cumulo-stratus          formed in the interval be
                                      is
tween tbe first appearance of the fleecy cumulus and the-
and that degree of continuity of substance which seems requisite to the
phenomenon.      There   is also probably some additional peculiarity of
structure init not yet attended to.

spect, like the other modifications, it affords much room
for future observation.
             Of t fie Nimlus,  or Cumulo-cirro-stratus.
     Clouds in any one of the preceding modifications, at the
 same degree     of elevation, or in twa or more of them, at
 different elevations, may increase so as completely to ob
 scure the sky, and-at times put on an appearance of density
 which to the inexperienced observer indicates the speedy
 commencement of rain.          It is nevertheless extremely pio-
 bable, as well from attentive observation as from a consi
 deration of the several modes of their production, that the
 clouds while in any one of these states do not at any time
 let fall rain.
     Before this effect takes place they have been uniformly
 found to undergo a change, attended with appearances suf
 ficiently remarkable to constitute a distinct modification.
 These appearances, when the rain happens over our heads,
 are but imperfectly seen.       We can then only observe, be
  fore the arrival of the denser and lower clouds, or through
  their interstices, that there exists at a greater altitude a
  thin light veil, or at least a hazy turbidness. When this
  has considerably increased we see the lower clouds spread
  themselves    till they unite in all points and form 6nc uni
  form sheet.        The rain then commences, and the lower
  clouds, arriving from the windward, move under this sheet
  and are successively lost in it.       When the latter cease to
  arrive, or when the sheet breaks, every one's experience
  teaches him to expect an abatement or cessation oi rain.
      But there often follows, what seems hitherto to have been
   unnoticed, an immediate and great addition to the quantity
   of cloud. At the same time the actual obscurity is lessened,
   because the arrangement, which now returns, gives freer
   passage to the rays of light : for on the cessation of raiu
   the lower broken clouds which remain rise into cumuli,
   and the superior sheet puts on the various forms of the cirro-
   stratus, sometimes passing to the cirro-cumulus.
      If the interval be long before the next shower, the cumulo-
   stratus usually makes its appearance,        which it also does
   sometimes very suddenly after the first cessation.

     If the cumulus be the only cloud present at such a time,
 we may observe its superior part to become tufted with nas
 cent cirri.    Several adjacent clouds also approach and unite
 laterally by subsidence.
    The cirri increase, extending themselves upward and la
 terally, after which the shower is seen to commence.              At
 other times the converse takes place of what has been de
 scribed relative to the cessation of rain. The cirro-stratus
 is previously formed above the cumulus, and their sudden
 union is attended with the production of cirri and rain.
    In either case the cirri vegetate, as it were, in proportion
 to the quantity of rain falling, and give the cloud a cha
 racter by which it is easily known at great distances, and
 to which, in the language of meteorology, we may appro
 priate the nimbus of the Latins *.
    When one of these arrives hastily with the ivind it brings
 but little rain, and frequently some hail or driven snow.
    In heavy showers, the central sheet once formed,            asis,    it
 were, warped to windward, the cirri being propagated above
 and against the lower current, while the cumuli arriving
with the latter are successively brought to and contribute to
 reinforce it.
    Such are the phænomena of showers.                In continued
gentle    rains     does
                    it    not appear   necessary  for the resolution
of the clouds that the different modifications should come
into actual contact.
  It    issufficient that there exist two strata of clouds, one
passing beneath the other, and each continually tending to
horizontal uniform diffusion.            will rain during this state

interval of many hundred feet in elevation. See an instance

    As the masses of cloud arc always blended and their ar

                    is                              The thin sheets
of cloud which pass over during wet day, certainly receive

any given day of wet season, the more cloud the less rain.

    108               Researches respecting      the
   idea of it. Saussure expresses himself as follows : — " In
   observing the cortical reticulation I have often had occasion
   to study another reticulation which is placed immediately
   below the former; it is the parcnchymatous reticulation.
  This reticulation has larger and straighter vessels, and its
  meshes are generally greater than tho»e of the cortical reti
  culation. The vessels of the parenchyme are besides almost
  always coloured, and for the most part green. They are
  very rarely cylindric ; in general they grow narrower and
  larger in succession, so that they resemble vessels conti
  guous to each other."
      Hedwig says * that he has seen in the leaves of moss
  small ducts, disposed according to the length of the leaf,
  which anastomose laterally with other transverse or lateral
  ducts in such a manner as to form arcolæ sometimes square
  and sometimes oblong, pentagonal, or hexagonal, which
 almost all contain a parenchyme, the form of which is glo
 bular, and which gives to leaves their colour.
      Senebier gives his opinion in the following terms t : —
 The appellations of cellular tissue, cellular covering, and
 parenchyme, are given indifferently to that reticulation
 formed by transparent fibres or vessels filled with a green
juice, which are anastomosed at the places where they meet,
 and swelled up in the intervals.          Utriculi will in all pro
 bability be found there, though nothing is seen with the
 best glasses but the meshes of a reticulation.           If we con
 ceive some parts of vegetables composed of fibres, forming
 meshes with a granulated substance, we shall have some
 idea of the matter which constitutes the greater part of
 leaves and fruits.    The parenchyme I am about to describe
will be found in that in particular which fills up the
meshes of the greater part of reticulations.
     C. Mirbel considers the parenchyme of leaves as a cel
lular tissue formed of cells which are filled with a juice
almost always coloured green.          It docs not consist, he says,
of small bags or utriculi ; it is a membrane which uti
lities itself in some measure to form vacuities contiguous
to each other.
     In all the leaves which I have examined I have always
found that their parenchyme was composed only of an ag
gregation of utriculi closely united to each other, filled with
a green juice by which they are coloured, and of which the
form varies according to the different plants.            For exarn

pic, they arc nearly spherical in the fritillaria, elongated or
cylindrical in the lavatera triloba and the erythronium dens
leonis, prismatic in the aloe, and irregular in the sylphium
perfoliatum.
    The utriculi of the parenchyme of the same leaf are seen
to vary also in regard to their form and size. Thus the
leaves of the sylpnium and the impatiens balsamina have
the utriculi irregular on the inferior side and cylindric on
the superior. Those of the nenuphar have them small and
 elongated on the upper side, and large and prismatic on the
 lower.     Those of the narcissus and others of the lily kind
have them round and small on both sides, but large and
 prismatic in the interior part of the leaf.
     From what has been said, if we suppose the parenchyme
 of a leaf to be composed of spherical utriculi adhering to
 each other, it will readily be conceived that, as these utriculi
  cannot touch each other throughout their whole surface, the
 necessary result will be vacuities or intervals between them,
  which will have a communication with each other, as seen
 fig. 15.    If the utriculi are irregular, as those of fig. 18,
 the vacuities in this case will be larger ; and if the utriculi
 approach the cylindric or prismatic form, the vacuities will
  be the less sensible as the utriculi touch each other in a
  greater extent of their surface.
     It is of importance to comprehend properly the aggrega
  tion of the utriculi ; the vacuities resulting from      it,which
  in future shall call utricular interstices
              I                                ;  and the commu
  nication of these utriculi with the pores, in order to account
  for the circulation of the air in the leaves.
     That air exists in leaves   is   atruth fully confirmed     for,
                                                                 ;
 by    compressing them in water, the air    is  seen to issue from
  them.     By exposing them under water to the action of an
  air-pump they emit air; and     if  they be left in the water for
  some time they soon lose their opacity, become transparent
 by    the introduction of water, which assumes the place of
  the air, and are precipitated to the bottom of the vessel.
  In word, these leaves when again exposed to the air gra
      a
  dually resume their opacity and their natural colour; which
  can be ascribed only to the air which re-enters as the water
 is  evaporated.    But where   is this air lodged ?   I shall reply
  from my observations, that     it   is contained in the utricular
  interstices of the parenchyme.

tains will be seen to circulate with rapidity, following the
different inflections of the interstices.
 I    have already said that the pores communicate with the
utricular interstices. This will be proved           the following       by
experiment.
  I    subjected to the action of an air-pump the leaves of the
 geranium peltatitm and of the rumex sanguineits, which                                      I
 placed in     avessel filled with water.    On the first stroke of
 the piston the two surfaces of the leaf were covered with                                   a
 dew arising from small air bubbles;          then ceased to pump;

 and re-establishing the communication between the exterior
 air and the receiver,       examined with attention these bub

 bles, which    I saw decrease and entirely disappear        whence                :
I  conclude that this air had returned into the utricular in
 terstices     by
                the same way that        issued, that
                                                  it      to say, by          is
the pores.      To convince myself of this, repeated the same I
experiment on the leaves of the olea flagrans, the upper
surface of which        destitute of pores and on the first stroke
                               is                      ;
of the piston the inferior surface alone was covered with
bubbles, which re-entered into the leaf in the same manner.
    C. Mirbel reproaches Malpighi with having admitted
utriculi in the formation of vegetables          he denies the ex

is only    acellular tissue, more or less elongated, composed
of one piece, the cells of which arc formed             the cellular      by

membrane unlining itself. By adopting this idea I do not
know how we can explain the existence of utricular inter
stices, and assign a place to the air, since the parenchyme
of the leaves will be only a continued whole formed of cells
the sides of which are common.
    The utriculi are filled with a particular fluid which I call
the utricular juice.    In leaves exposed to the action of light
the utriculi assume a green tint, which seems to depend in
an essential manner on small green globules which abound
In the juice, as seen fig. 15, where the utriculi of the fri-
tillaria are represented.    These coloured globules arc found
also in the utriculi of the stems ; and 1 have seen them
very distinctly in the cucurbita and tropæolium, where
they are less numerous than in the leaves, but larger and
more apparent.
    In the greater part of thick and fat leaves, the most in
terior utriculi, which are not coloured, seem to be desti
tute of these globules, or at least if they exist they are not-
sensible.
   In the utriculi           of              of
                                the lilv kind, and in those

of the      root of      the
                    potatoe, these globules are very large,
often angular, but transparent and colourless.   It is pro
bable that they constitute the farinaceous part of these
roots.                                             t
    I imagined for a long time that these globules were dis
seminated     in the utricular juice; but by a more attentive
examination I found that they were applied to the mem
brane of the utriculus without adhering to                     it,

sperse   themselves     in the   liquid.
  It   is to these globules alone that Hedwig applied the de

   These globules engaged also the attention of Saussure                 ;
but he saw them only as small brilliant points, and the re
searches he made to discover their intimate nature and uses
proved to be fruitless.
   This author detached from an asparagus-leaf fragment              a
of its bark     and having viewed
                ;                            with it microscope in the

                                       reflection or transparently, he
observed      multitude of small brilliant points nearly circular,
                a
surrounded         an opake circle and almost contiguous: the
                    by
first idea he conceived was, that the bark of the asparagus
was perhaps pierced with             multitude of small circular holes
                                      a
which afforded        free passage to the sun's rays; but having,
                         a
found       agreat quantity of these brilliant points in the
parenchyme and cortical reticulation, he concluded that they

did not belong to the epidermis.           The result of his observa
tions showed that these brilliant points were neither holes
nor the orifices of vessels, for they were not altered by de
siccation and maceration.           " As they are not," says he,
"     resinous or gummy moieculæ, since they are unalterable
in water and spirit of wine, what can they be ?"
      It appears to me that the formation of these globules is
not owing to an inspissation of the utricular juice, and that
the green colour which they assume by exposure to the
light is only a modification depending on the effects of that
fluid.
     Besides the globules here mentioned, there are found in
the utriculi of some plants singular organs with the uses
 of which I am unacquainted. These organs, represented
 fig. 15, A, and fig. 16, are small, prismatic, smooth, and
 transparent filaments of equal length, terminating in a point
 on each side, and united in a bundle to the number of forty
  or fifty, and even more.
       In a leaf of the fritillaria which had been macerated for
 some time, these bundles are distinguished by the naked
 eye through the utriculi, like small, elongated, whitish, ar-
 genteous bodies, disposed in the direction of the length of
  the leaf.
       I found them in the bulb of the leucojum vernum, of the
  scilla bifolia and maritima, in the stem of the phytolaca
  decandra, and in its leaves, where they are very apparent,
  especially when the pellicle has been removed from the in
  ferior surface.
       In the aloe, besides these bundles there are seen a great
  number of other prismatic filaments similar to the preced
  ing, but insulated, larger, and lodged, as appeared to me,
  between the utricular interstices.
       I saw also in the stem of the nenuphar other insulated
  filaments lodged also between the utriculæ, but cylindric,
  shagreened on the outside, and from the middle of which
  there proceed in general two or three ramifications, fig. 17-
       Having accidentally touched my face with my hands
  while I was examining the aloe, I soon experienced a vio
  lent itching, which I ascribed to the entrance of these
             into my skin.      To ascertain this fact, I rubbed the
     ack of my hand with a piece of a leaf of that plant ; which
   Erisms
   occasioned a strong smarting pain followed by a cutaneous
   eruption.      I repeated this experiment with the parencftvme
   of the scilla maritima, and found the same result.
        If the leaves of the narcissus, hyacinth, amaryllis formo-
   fissima, and scilla bifolia, be cut transversely, there will be
                                                                  seen

seen to issue from all the proper vessels a viscous and trans
parent juice, which contains a multitude of these prismatic
filaments, which give to this juice an argentine colour.
    Rafn, in his Physiology of Plants, says he found small
prisms in the milky juice of the euphorbia.       I found them
also, but only in small number.
    What are these prismatic filaments ? How are they
formed ? Why are they found in some plants and not in
others ? In the last place, What is the use of them ? These
are questions which it is impossible for me to answer, and
respecting which I have no data.        I shall now proceed to
the communication of the utriculi with each other.
    Senebier says that " the utriculi form a kind of vessels
composed of vesicles bound together. They have a pretty
exact resemblance to a flexible tube, slightly choked at di
stances nearly equal, and nevertheless retaining a free com
munication throughout the whole length of the canal."
    C. Mirbel discovered that " the membranous sides of
the cellular tissue are in general perforated with pores, the
apertures of which are certainly not the hundredth part of a
line ; that these pores are bordered with small, unequal, and
glandulous rolls, which intercept and strongly refract the
Fight when they receive its rays ; that they establish a com
munication between one cell and another, and serve for the
transfusion of the juices, which in this tissue is exceedingly
slow.
    To ascertain whether there was a direct and sensible com
munication between the utriculi, I employed various means.
I cut a very thin piece of the parenchyme of the leaf of the
fritillaria, which 1 chose in preference on account of its
spherical utriculi, which are frequently united by a pro
longation in the form of a neck, fig. 15^and which on that
account have a greater resemblance to the choked tubes
mentioned by Senebier. I placed it in the focus of the mi
croscope ; and having observed several complete utriculi,
I compressed one of them slightly with a very fine needle,
presuming that the liquid it contained would pass imme
diately into those adjacent to  it,and which were open      but
                                                              :
the pressure I     continued to exercise on      made
                                                it        burst,
                                                         it
and the juice  it    contained was instantly dispersed.      re
                                                              I
peated this operation several times, following very atten
tively the impulse of its utricular juice that       Imight ob
serve its passage into the neighbouring utriculi, which, in
my opinion, would have taken place had          free communi
                                                a
cation existed between them.
I      repeated this experiment on other leaves the utriculi
   Vol. XVI. No.     62.       H                                   cf

114                  Researches respecting tfie
«f which     were  silled with a red juice,  and always  with as
little effect.
    As I was not able to succeed by these means, I had re
course to injection.      I immersed the fresh cut extremity of
different leaves, for twenty-four hours, in a decoction of
Brasil wood : I then observed them, and found that the li
quid had not penetrated the parenchyme beyond the cut
surface.
    I again immersed several fragments of leaves in the same
decoction : I dissected them with attention, and observed
that the colouring liquor had penetrated beyond the sections
into the utricular interstices, that the membranes of the
utricuii had been a little covered bv them, but that the
utricular juice had retained its natural colour.
    I substituted for this decoction ink and a solution of the
acetite of lead, which I precipitated by sulphate of potash,
without obtaining from this process a more satisfactory re
sult. I then placed in a decoction of Brasil wood, under the
air pump, large fragments of the leaves of the aloe and of the
fritillaria, and of the leaves of the mcsenibryanthemum and
cactus, I exhausted tlie receiver; and taking the leaves from
the liquid, I observed that in the leaves of the aloe the injec
tion had penetrated at the sections only to the depth of an
inch ; that the leaves of the fritillaria were almost entirely
penetrated by the injection, which in colouring it had given
it that transparency which is observed in leaves that have re
mained under water; that in the cactus and the mesembry-
anthemum the injection had not penetrated beyond the cut
part.
    Though these injections had succeeded better than the
preceding, the result however was the same, since 1 ob
served that the coloration of the leaves depended only on
the liquid introduced into the utricular interstices.
    If we admit that there is a free communication between
one utriculus and another, how can we explain the different
colours bv which the streaked leaves are shaded ? In the
spotted orchis, for example, the spots are produced by utri
cuii which contain a red juice, while those found between
the ribs have a green juice.      In the red cabbage the juice
of the exterior utricuii is violet, and that of the interior
ones is transparent.
    These observations induce me to believe that the utricular
juice does not circulate in the utricuii, but that it is rather
stairnant in them.       How, indeed, can we suppose that the
¦globules found in so great abundance in this juice, and the
prisms met with in most plants, should pass from one utri

culus to another, when we are not acquainted with the aper
tures proper for affording them a passage?   It cannot, how
ever, be doubted that the utriculi receive, by some way or
other, the juice destined for them, since they are full of

lopment.    But what     the method employed
                             is                    nature forby
this purpose    ? confess that
                    I             do not know, having never
                                        I
been able to discover        it,   notwithstanding the perseverance         of
my researches.
    C. Mirbel, having observed that the membranes of his
cellular tissue were perforated with pores, established by
their means the communication of the cells between each
other, and the slow transfusion of the juice into that tissue.
    A discovery of so much importance was worthy of attract
ing my notice   j   I therefore paid particular attention to it.
I  first examined the utriculi of the sugar-cane, and          in      I
deed found that their membrane seemed to be perforated
with    a  great number of small pores        but, decreasing or
                                                         ;
shading the light        by
                          placing my  hand  before  the reflecting
mirror, these pores appeared to me to be nothing else than
elevated, whitish, and opake points, which reflected the
light;    and this doubtless would not have been the case had
they been apertures.
 I     examined these pores in the stems of the asparagus and
the horse-tail, in consequence of what had been announced
by C. Mirbel        but they are much less sensible in these
                    ;
plants than in the sugar-cane.         perceived them very di*
                                                I
stinctly in the utriculi of the stem of the white poppy,
fig. 20, and in those of the pith of the elder, where they are
large, elongated, and disposed in the direction of the breadth
of the stem. Though these points, on the first view, have
the appearance of apertures, there        reason to believe that
                                                    is
they are only prominent semi-transparent points, since                     I
have seen the shadow of them change its place according as
I  varied the light     by
                        moving the reflecting mirror.
    These points appeared to me to form part of, and to be
long to, the- utricular membrane for           could not detach
                                                ;        I
them without tearing that membrane.
    Though my opinion in regard to these pores be different
from that of C. Mirbel,        do not pretend to give
                                    1                      as cer it

    ;       I  must confess that the inspection of objects so
small may be accompanied with some optical illusion.                        I
shall however add, that         could not discover these pores

examining these parts, the globules above mentioned, which
are found affixed to the utricular membrane, but which can
very readilv be detached.
   I do not consider the existence of these pores as certainly
proved. In my opinion, these organs still require to be exa
mined by naturalists ; and if thev find means to prove their
existence, a considerable step will be made in the system of
vegetation in regard to the circulation of the juices.
   The leaves at their birth are composed of utricuK so
small that they cannot be distinguished even with the help
of" a microscope; but in proportion as these leaves grow,
the utriculi expand, and are distended by the addition of
the juices with which thev are penetrated.
   I have several times followed the rapid development of
the utriculi in the voung leaves of the lilv kind of plants,
where it is verv remarkable ; and I have been astonished in
particular, in examining the nenuphar, to see the utriculi
of the umbilical cord of the seed, which are scarcely sensi
ble at the time of dowering, develop themselves so much
between that period and the time when the seed attains to
maturity, that this cord is capable of surrounding     and even   it,
of supplying   itwith   double covering.

after a certain term        sometimes
                            it          happens, especially in
leaves where the vegetation      strong, that the utriculi be

     C. Mirhel.
I by examined with great care in some plants of the lily
kind  the formation of the spontaneous lacerations, and of
the vacuities thence arising, to which this author gives the
name    of lacunœ, and the following     the result of my ob
                                                   is

   These lacerations are effected      the parenchvmc of the
                                              in
leaves according to the direction of the vessels, so that in            a
transverse section of the leaf thev appear as irregular holes
separated from each other bv bundles of trachea;        in ob       :
serving these holes with the microscope, rags of the torn
utriculi arc verv well distinguished, so that       mav be asit
serted that in these leaves the lacunae are only accidental.
   The young leaves of the sciila tifolia have no lacuna;

where the lacunæ terminate there are then observed large
transparent reticulæ of a very loose texture, which become
lacerated in their turn when the leaf acquires more increase.
I observed the same disposition in the leaves of the narcis
sus, the hyacinth, and of leeks.
    Were we to apply this system of lacerations and lacunæ
to all stems and leaves which have canals in their interior
part, it would, in my opinion, be giving it too much ex
tent.
    Since there are several which issue from the root with
these canals, and the smooth close sides of which never ex
hibit any laceration of the utriculi, I therefore entertain no
doubt that the canals found in some aquatic plants, such as
the nenuphar, the mereophyllum, &c. are essential to their
organization, and that they depend on a particular and pre-
determinate arrangement of the utriculi.
                  Explanation of the Figures.
                      (See Plates I  and II.)
    Fig. 1. This figure represents a piece of a leaf of the fri-
tillana seen through the microscope.        The side A is in its
natural state, and shows the exterior utriculi, the form of
which is a parallclopipedon elongated in the direction of the
length of the leaf.      Between these utriculi are remarked
some of those small spherical bodies formed by the conju
gate utriculi which constitute the pores.
    The side B, deprived of the pellicle, which is transported
to fig. 2, shows the parenchyme of the leaf of a green co
lour much more intense than it appeared in A through the
pellicle.   This pellicle, which is formed merely by the up
per   face of the exterior utriculi, could not be removed but
by the laceration of these utriculi : their lateral faces, which
have remained adhering to the conjugate utriculi with which
they are intimately united, are therefore seen on the paren
chyme.
    The bright points seen here and there dispersed on the
surface of the figure, represent small brilliant points observed
in the parenchyme, and which are produced by the air con
 tained in the utricular interstices.
    Fig. 2. This figure, as already said, is the pellicle re
 moved from the surface B, fig. 1 .        The upper surface of
 the exterior utriculi of which it is formed exhibits slight
undulations, produced, in my opinion, by its exposure to
the air. The oval holes with which it is perforated corre
 spond to the conjugate utriculi which have remained on the

 parenchyme, and show that it is the part of these utriculi
 which concurs to the formation of the surface of the leaf.
     Fig. 3. This figure represents a thin slice of the leaf,
 which has been cut perpendicularly in the direction of its
 length.      The lateral faces of the exterior utriculi are seen
 lengthwise, united to the utriculi of the parenchynie by
 their lower face.       The conjugate utriculi are seen in the
 direction of their height and large diameter : they are not
 united to the parenchyme.
     Fig. 4. This figure exhibits also a very thin slice of the
 leaf, but cut across"or in the direction of the breadth : for this
 reason the exterior utriculi appear in their small diameter
 as well as the conjugate utriculi, the union of which is
 shown by a line of separation.
    The pellicle A, which has been detached from the exte
 rior utriculi by laceration, shows that it is formed only by
 their superior face : it however sometimes happens that the
 conjugate utriculi remain -adhering to it.
    Fig. 5. This figure represents nearly the same object
 as fi<r. 1 , but much larger in its dimensions.      It is chiefly
 destined, as well as the following, to give a precise idea of
the conformation of the conjugate utriculi, and of their
 connection with the exterior utriculi.       The exterior utri
 culi arc disengaged from the parenchyme to show more
distinctly how the lateral faces of these utriculi, seen short
ened, may have been taken for vessels: slight wrinkles, or
undulations, as observed in fig. 1, are remarked on their
upper face.
    This figure shows also the part of the conjugate utriculi
 which is not covered by the exterior utriculi, and which
thereby concurs to the formation of the surface of the
leaf.
    Fig. G. This figure represents a slice cut vertically in the
direction of the length of the leaf, with a certain inclina
tion.     The exterior utriculi are seen at the same time on
their exterior face, and in the direction of their height ;
which evidently shows that what was taken for vessels is
nothing else than the lateral or vertical faces of these utri
culi.     It is seen also how the exterior utriculi are applied
to, and cover the conjugate utriculi.
    Fig. 7. The section represented in this figure is the same
as that in fig. 4 ; it has been magnified, to exhibit all its par
ticulars.      It may be considered the same also as the pre
ceding, if we suppose it to be inverted to exhibit it in pro
file.

   in the other faces.
      The conjugate utriculi are seen in the direction of their
  height and of their small diameter.         They are united by
  their extremities, and as they are seen shortened they ap
  pear under the form of two spherical bodies applied to each
  other : they are not united to the utriculi of the paren-          .
  chyme, and therefore a considerable vacuity, which esta
  blishes a communication between the pore and the utricular
  interstices, is found below them.
      Fig. 8. This figure is a repetition of fig. 3. It exhibits a
  very thin slice cut vertically in the direction of the length
  of the leaf, but it is seen under a scale of proportion much
  larger.
     The conjueate utriculi which are seen in the direction
  of their height and large diameter mutually conceal each
  other ; so that only one of these utriculi is seen on its la
 teral face, covered by that of the exterior utriculus to which
 it is united.
     Fig. 9. This figure represents the pellicle of maize, and
 exhibits an exception in regard to the pores which belong to
 the family of the gramineous plants.        No pores indeed are
 seen ; and the conjugate utriculi, which are found lodged
 in a kind of square area produced by the disposition of the
 exterior utriculi, instead of being reoiform as in the other
           are cylindric, and applied to each other by their cy-
 filants,
   indric faces, in such a manner as to conceal every appear
 ance of pores.      At their extremity is seen a small circle,
 which is closed, as far as I could ascertain, by the juice
 contained in these utriculi.
     The exterior utriculi, the form of which is a very elon
 gated parallelopipedon, have their large sides festooned, and
 their small sides straight or rectilinear.
     Fig. 10. This figure shows more distinctly than fig. 5
how the lateral faces of the exterior utriculi exhibit them
 selves under the appearance of vessels which form a kind of
 reticulation, the meshes of which are here hexagonal in con
 sequence of the hexagonal prismatic form of the utriculi.
     Fig. 11 and 12. The conjugate utriculi represented in
 these two figures evidently differ from those seen in fitr. Q,
though found in the same plant, either in the leaves wnich
surround the ear, or in the interior face of the sheath of the
leaves.     In fig. 1 1 the pore begins to appear, because the
utriculi become a little reniform; and in fig. 12, where
they are entirely so, the pore is verv evident.

aloe,  which is composed of hexagonal         utriculi, between
which appear several square apertures.         These apertures,
similar to those ot' the fritillana, fig. 2, correspond to as
many conjugate utriculi which have remained on the paren-
chvme.      The square form which these apertures constantly
aflect, seems to depend on that of the exterior utriculi.
   Fig. 14. This pellicle belongs to the leaf of the digitalis
purpurea : it consists of utriculi very much festooned, be
tween which are seen the conjugate utriculi, the pores of
which seem to be obliterated by a black matter, which is
nothing else than air.
   The surface of this pellicle is furnished with some conical
hairs, very strong, and composed of several rings : they pro
ceed from the middle of the utriculus, as if they were a pro
longation of it.
   Fig. 1j. This figure represents the utriculi of the paren-
chynie of the leal of the fritillaria: their form is nearly
spherical ; they are united to each other by a sort of pro
longation in the manner of a neck, and separated in the rest
of their extent by pretty considerable vacuities, which have
a communication       with each other. To these vacuities I
have given the name of utricular interstices.      Each of these
utriculi is filled with a viscous juice, in which is found a
great number of small green globules applied to the mem
brane of the utriculus : the upper ones appear more distinct,
and the lower ones fainter.
   The utriculus A is remarkable on account of the bundle
of small prisms contained in its inside.
   In lig. 1(5 these prisms are seen insulated and larger.
   In fig. 1 7 is represented a different kind of these organs
found in the nenuphar.       Its exterior side is covered with
points, and two ramifications proceed from its middle.
   Fig. 18. On account of the singular form affected by the
utriculi which compose the parenehyme of a great number
of leaves, they have been called irregular utriculi.       From
their bodies proceed several arms in different directions,
which unite with similar prolongations of the other utri
culi ; so that the parenchvme which they form becomes
very lax, in consequence of the large interstices which they
constitute.
   These utriculi were taken from the parenchvme of the
nectary of the narcissus.
   Fig. 19. This figure exhibits the pellicle of a petal the
utriculi of which rise above the surface in the form of co
nical papillae, which produces a kind of dull velvety appear
ance, remarked in most petals.

JVIr. John Grey,          merchant, living at Newport in the
Isle of Wight,      was   attacked by spasmodic asthma four
teen years ago, and has had paroxysms of this dreadful
disorder, returning at first at uncertain intervals, until the
year 1 797, when these fits of difficult respiration recurred
usually once, sometimes twice a week, leaving him in the
intervals very languid and dispirited.     The smallest exertion
was a pain to him, and, to use his own expressions, life a
burthen.      Various physicians had been applied to without
any   essential  benefit, and he despaired of ever getting free
from this disease, when he was advised to come to London
to be under my care.        Upon his arrival in town, tonic me
dicines, such as he had taken before, were ordered, and he
commenced with daily inspiration of four quarts of oxygen
or vital air mixed with thirteen of atmospheric air. The
immediate effect was a diminution of the violence of the
paroxvsms, which before lasted from two to three days ;
the expectoration was earlier, and the sits subsided sooner.
Continuing this plan for a few weeks, the paroxysms of asth
ma wholly disappeared, and Mr. Grey was recommended
to return home, and take down with him an eighteen gallon
cask, with a tin pneumatic apparatus for inhaling the same;
which arrived safe by the Newport waggon, the air being
found to have lost none of its peculiar properties ; as re
kindling a match when blown out, and burning iron like
wood.      Another cask was sent down, medicines disconti
nued, and for six months Mr. Grey continued perfectly free
from asthma, at the expiration of which time he had a
slight return ; but resuming again the oxygen air sent for
 from town, he was again re-established in health. For five
 years Mr. Grey has continued free from asthma, except in
 the month of August, when he is slightly indisposed ; but
 having always had recourse to the inhalation of the oxygen
 air, sent to him in an eighteen gallon cask, the disorder has
                                                            been

 been prevented forming, and be has continued free from
 asthma during the rest of the year.
     Observation. — It is surprising that a remedy which is so
 «afe, pleasant, and efficacious, and which recommends it
 self so strongly by innumerable facts, and the analogy of
 ordering sick people into the country, should not have
 made more progress in the medical world, especially in cases
 of asthma, which is so materially affected by changes in
 the atmosphere.      At this time I shall only          add   another
 case.
     Miss          was recommended to my care by the late
 Mr. CFuikshank for     a humour she had been afflicted with
upwards of twenty years.        It was not an ordinary case, for
the tumefaction of the legs was such as to make the leg the
thickness of one's thigh ; and so great was the discharge
from this part, and the whole body, that the servant has
been kno.vn to come in the morning with the mop, to mop
under the bed, the whole of the under part of the bed bein?
wet through.       For more than two years this amiable lady
daily inhaled the vital air, and the benefit was progressive
until a complete cure was accomplished.             This was more
than five years ago, and the patient has since continued in
perfect health.
    At another opportunity I will trouble the readers of your
Masazine with other facts of the same sort.

                       Professor Proust *.
XI. Rouklle       was the first who discovered in feeula a sub
stance analogous to the gluten of farina.             This substance
since that time appeared problematical, only because few
chemists tried to ascertain its real characters.           The feeula
of which it is the basis is, according to Fourcrov, either a
supposed substance, or a substance too little examined to be
placed among the number of the immediate products of ve
getables.    He even goes so far as to suppose that albumen,
an animal substance which no one before him had supposed
to exist in plants, is that which ought to be substituted for
the glutinous part of green feeula.
    Are albumen and feeula, then, found together or separate
in the juice of plants ? Such is the question            I  have pro
posed to myself, and which        I shall   endeavour    to resolve in

  the course of my observations on the System of Chemical
   Knmvledge.
     To save the reader from the trouble of recurring to that
  work, I shall copy the passage where the author collects
  the facts and arguments, in consequence of which he thinks
  himself authorized to entertain this opinion.      This passage
  is very remarkable, by the opposition discovered in it be
  tween the manner in which he and the modern chemists
  characterize other vegetable products.
     "  Rouelle junior, who examined and carefully compared
 it with other animal matters, asserts, that he found it in
 coloured fecula, and particularly in that called the green
 fecula of plants. But the expression of fecula, given indif
 ferently to the fibrous matter contained in the juice of
 plants and to starch, having induced chemists to consider the
 latter as a part of the remains of solid vegetable substances,
 there is reason to think that it was merely by analogy,
 and in consequence of some ambiguous properties, that
 Rouelle was of opinion that the green matter contained
 gluten.     At least the experiments made since that period,
 and those which I repeated several times on these coloured
 feculae, did not confirm this assertion; and nothing has
 really proved that gluten is one of the principles of the
 latter fecula."
     "  The expression fecula," says Fourcroy, "given indif
ferently to the fibrous matter contained in the juice of plants
 and to starch, having induced an opinion that the latter is a
 part of the remains of solid vegetable substances, there is
 reason to believe," &c.
     I shall first observe that this opinion is not correct. For
 example, chemists at present will never agree with Fourcroy,
 that the confusion which has been so justly ascribed to the
 improper use of words has induced those who preceded us
 to adopt these ideas.       Our masters, it must be allowed,
 gave to things bad denominations ; but they did not con
 found them more than we do.
     At times even when every vegetable deposit was consi
 dered by them as fecula, the resemblance of names never
 deceived them so far as to make them compare starch to
 the remains of the solid parts of plants.      In the first place,
 we are acquainted with no remains of that kind to which
 chemists could with reason compare it ; and in the se
 cond, if any of them took the green fecula for a residuum,
there was not one of them who was not perfectly acquainted
with the whole difference between these feculæ or remains
and starch : and since no confusion of this kind is found
in their works, it is not just to reproach them with it ;
                                                                for

1*4              On the Fecula os Green Plants.
for we need only cast our eves on those of Rouelle, Mac~
quer, Baume, Sage, Parmentier, &c, to be convinced that
the word fecula has not led these authors into comparisons
so unworthy ot' their judgment as to arrange in the same
class green fecula, the remains of solid parts, and starch.
    We shall now proceed to green feculæ, and shall observe
that in laboratories, in apothecaries' shops, and still less in
the hands of a chemist so celebrated for exactness as Rou
elle, the chopped straw of green plants has never been con
founded with that beautifulliquid velvet expressed from their
leaves, or with the emulsive product which passes in com
plete freshness through the cloth, and which by its exces
sive fineness, and the splendour of its colour, is so superior
to their herbaceous filaments.
    If it were true that the fecula is a bodv homogeneous
with the rest of the plant, if it were possible to consider it
only as a part which differs in no other respect than that of
having been better pounded, would not complete trituration
of the remainder be sufficient to convert it also into fecula ?
When a fresh herb is pounded, the pestle breaks and bruises
its tissue, but does not pulverize it.
    And this contusion of a few moments is too far from re
sembling dry pulverization to admit of any comparison be
tween its fecula and moistened powder.          If an aqueous
plant, such as sedum for example, be bruised on a piece
of marble bv means of a roller, its expressed juice will give
fecula.    It is not to trituration that fecula is indebted for
its velvety appearance, its fineness, and impalpability, which
distinguish it from powder : it is molecular bv its nature,
and perhaps even crystallized in the fibrous meshes where
vegetation deposits it.
    " Rouelle asserts," says Fourcroy, " that feculæ con
tain a principje which may be compared to animal matters,"
kc. Rouelle has done more: very little disposed to be
satisfied with simple assertions, he proved it not by analo
gies and ambiguous properties, but bv a series of convincing
 facts, by comparisons which obtained general assent only
because they united the greatest characters       then known,
and which arc yet known, in animal substances. Otherwise
whence could Rouelle deduce analogies to compare, as he
does, green fecula to the gluten of wheat? What is there
 common in the appearance of these two products to serve
 as a basis for comparison ?     To find points of comparison,
 it would be necessary to examine in an intimate manner
 their composition and chemical properties ; and this is what
 this laborious chemist does.     Comparisons of this kind de
 duced from analysis served as a basts for the memoir which
                                                              he

he gave on green fecuhe, and of which no mention is made
in The System of Chemical Knowledge ; no doubt because,
according to the ideas of this illustrious author, Rouelle had
confounded albumen with gluten, and the detail of his mis
take must have appeared to him a matter of indifference to
the history of chemistry.
   Rouelle, however, found in the feeula of sorrel a pro
duct so strongly possessed of the chemical properties of al
bumen, that he particularly insisted on                   it,
                                                     to call the atten

 I  know only that alcohol applied to pungent cheese de*
prives it of all its savour. An analysis directed to this point
might give us curious results : but let us return to the green
feculæ ; let us try them by the test of modern chemistry J
and, in particular, let us endeavour to discover whether al
bumen really exists where Beccari and Rouelle found gluten.
                           Green Fecula.
    I.  Fecula exposed   to  heat experiences a change capable
of furnishing it alone with a decisive character in regard to
its nature. I allude to that concrescibility of which there
are few examples among vegetable products ; that aggluti
nation which attaches its moleculæ to each other, and gives
them the appearance of caseous curd.        If fecula before this
change passes easily through the cloth, it can no longer do
so when boiled ; a peculiar crispation has then deprived it
of its tenuity ; but heat does not coagulate the fibrous tissue.
The fecula, therefore, in this point of view, cannot be com
pared to the torn straw of green plants.
    II. Fecula separated from juices by filtration assumes in
drying a corneous and elastic consistence. It becomes soft
with difficulty in boiling water, but it does not acquire soft
ness even at the end of a month : notwithstanding its nu
meration it always retains its corneous nature. It recovers
its former state if bent, but absolutely refuses to crumble :
all these are qualities which are not observed in dried lig
neous pulp.
    The feculæ of green and white cabbages, cresses, hem
lock, &c. do not by these means lose their property of co
agulating by heat. In warm water between 145 and 165 de
crees, if two equal matrasses be immersed, one with diluted
fecula and the other with the water of the white of an egg,
the fecula becomes crisp and is collected in flakes, such as
those seen in any juice exposed to heat in order to be cla
rified ; but at that temperature albumen does not even lose
its transparency.
    III. Green fecula is nearly of the same weight as water;
for that of plants which are not acid employs more than
eight days to deposit itself.
    If fecula washed and diluted be poured into three jars,
and if a little alcohol be added to the first, a few drops of
acid to the second ; and if the third be placed between the
other two for the sake of comparison, the fecula in the
two former will be completely deposited in less than half
an hour, while that in the third scarcely begins to fall. Al
cohol and acids then have the power of coagulating fecula,
but they do not exercise the same action on woody remains.

    IV. A hundred parts of the dry fecula of hemlock trans
mit to alcohol from 15 to 1 6 of green resin. When taken
from repeated infusions to which it has been subjected, it
remains of an earthen gray colour, and alcohol is never able
to bleach it. Sage, who was well acquainted with the na
ture of feculæ, found some which gave even a third of their
weight of resin : to exhaust them with ease, it is necessary
to throw them still moist into spirit of wine; the spirit
then penetrates and attacks them in every point : but this
is much more difficult when they have been rendered cor
neous by desiccation.
    Parmentier, I think, was the first who doubted, and with
reason for his time, that alcoholic tincture of feculæ is re
sinous, because it is not precipitated by water. However, if
it be considered that water can never detach it from gluten,
that alcohol, oils, and fat, have exclusively this property ; and
that this substance, when separated from alcohol and con
centrated in itself, is a fat tenacious body insoluble in water,
it will be found that there is no product in vegetables which
it approaches so much as the resinous : but we shall here
show, that to determine in it more perfectly this character,
nothing is necessary but to furnish it with a little oxygen.
    The oxygenated muriatic acid in a few days renders green
resin white and firm ; it then suffers itself to be drawn out
 in threads like boiled turpentine, and its dye mixes rea
dily with water : but if the green part of feculæ belonged
to those coloured juices which are found in the ingredients
 proper for dyeing, oxygen would not convert it into a resin.
But at present, since observation has taught us that we ought
 no longer to establish between vegetable products such ri
gorous limits as formerly ; since we see them so often con
 founded by intermediate qualities, we are not astonished to
 find that a resin carried to its maximum of divisibility can
 associate with water.     Do we not see camphor, essential,
 animal, and vegetable oils, sarcocolla, &c. dissolve com
 pletely in water ? We shall not, however, for this reason,
 take such products from that classification which has been
 assigned to them by analysis.
     Green feculæ assume in oxygenated muriatic acid that
 colour of dead leaves which forms the mourning of vegeta
 tion during the winter, and their dye becomes very turbid
 in water. Let us deduce then from all this, that if the co
 louring part of feculæ cannot resist water when transmitted
 by alcohol, it is no less in regard to its other qualities a sub
 stance absolutely resinous; and though this product, one
 of the most curious in the vegetable kingdom, since it em
                                                          bellishes

 128              On the Fecula os Green Plants.
bellishes it with its different shades, has not been introduced
into   the System of Chemical Knowledge, various chemists,
such as Rouelle, Danel, Sage, Parmentier, &c. thought it
¦worthy of their researches.
   This resin, dissolved in potash, abandons it to attach it
 self to silk, and to give it a bright green dye ; but it fades
 too much to become useful : its shade, however, resists
verjus : but the preference which it at length gives to gluten
over the vegetable fibre is agreeable to known principles ;
for it is to animalized substances in general, rather than to
the fibres of flax, hemp, or cotton, that colouring bodies
attach themselves.      Fecula then has something in its na
ture analogous to wool, silk, &c: it is gluten.
    V. Let us now examine fecula in points of view more
proper for unveiling new characters of animalization.
    If fecula, cither boiled or raw, be kept under water, it
begins in less than twenty-four hours to emit a bad odour.
It soon exhales an excrementitious putridity, which always
soes on increasing, and to which one perhaps could not
long be exposed without danger.             The infectious miasm
which it diffuses around it instantly obscures metallic writ
ing, and its liquor speedily blackens plates of silver.
   It is to the corruption of this principle, no doubt, rather
than to any other, that arc owing the pernicious exhalations
of hemp and flax when watered. As running water, which
is equally proper as stagnant for separating the filaments,
speedily carries off their extractive juices, nothing but the
green fecula which unites the fibres is susceptible of being
destroyed bv watering.
   The liquor which at the end of a year floats above putrid
fecula contains sulphurated hydrogen, carbonate of ammo
nia, and gluten dissolved bv means of the latter.
   It has this peculiarity also, that it retains its stercoraceous
odour after long ebullition.     The product of its distillation
contains carbonate of ammonia joined to a principle of in
fection which does not blacken metallic solutions, and with
the nature of which I am not acquainted.             Acids are not
weakened bv precipitating feciJa and becoming saturated
with ammonia ; which induces me to think, that if tlje ef
fluvia of a mass of animal putridity can serve as a vehicle
to the phosphorus and sulphur it contains, it is not in
debted for its infectious quality to these combustibles alone ;
that there is a great difference, for example, between the
odour of rotten fish or flesh, corrupted fecula or putrid
cheese, and that of phosphorated and sulphurated hydrogen.

    Highlands of Scotland ; made by the Command of the

                           Appendix.
        Report from the Highland Society        of Scotland.
           Queries referred to in the annexed Report.
1st,   .L/oes it consist with your knowledge, that        the pro
gress   of improvement in    the northern    parts of Scotland   is
much retarded by the want of roads and bridges ? If so,
what lines would tend most effectually to open the country
and promote the public good ? •
    2a, Does the valley, which passes through the north of
Scotland from the Murray Frith on the east to Loch Eil,
and the Linnhe Loch on the west, appear to you to be well
calculated for an inland navigation, if formed of a size suf
ficient to admit of large trading vessels and frigates,?         (I
have, for the sake of distinction, named this navigation the
Caledonian Canal.)
    3d, Would this navigation, by opening a ready and safe
communication from one side of the island to the other,
prove the means of promoting the extension of the fishe
ries, and of throwing the industry and intelligence of the
fishers who reside on the east coast upon the extensive
fishing grounds along the west coast ?
    4th, Would the undertaking these public works at the
present time, by affording employment to the people, giving
them habits of industry, and furnishing them with capital,
tend to check the spirit of emigration which now prevails,
and, connected with the powers which would be furnished
by using the water which flows down each extremity of the
valley from the extensive lochs, prove the means of laying
the certain foundation of future employment ?
     5th, If the executing these roads and bridges would prove
 the means of employing the people, improving the agricul
 tural state of the country, ana of extending the fisheries,
 the nation would evidently derive an increase of revenue
 and power ; and the land-owners through whose estates the
 lines of road passed, and indeed the whole of the adjoining
 districts of country, would enjoy improved cultivation ana
     Vol. XVI. No. 62.             I                     pasturage,

  130           A  Survey and Report   of the Coctits
  pasturage, increased incomes, and all the blessings which
  are derived from a facility of intercourse : is it not therefore
  the interest of the land-owners to unite with government
  in executing these plans ? and should not the memorials and
  propositions to this purpose originate with the land-owners,
  and    be transmitted by them to the lords of the treason-,
  who will, by comparing the memorials with the informa
  tion contained in the surveys made by their directions, judge
  how far the public aid can be with propriety extended ?
      6th, If the opening the Caledonian canal upon the scale
  I have proposed would prove the means of facilitating the
  intercourse from the west of England anc! Scotland, ana the
  whole of Ireland, with the northern parts of Europe, and
  likewise from the cast side of Great Britain to America and
  the West Indies ; is it not just and reasonable that the
  commercial interests should be united with the efforts of
  government in carrying the same into effect ?
      7th, In my last I neglected to state, in order to en
  able the Highland proprietors to contribute, without incon
  venience to themselves, a moiety of the expense of making
  the roads and bridges necessary for the improvement of that
  part of the country, that they might be empowered bv an
  act of parliament to sell land to that amount.      This is rea
 sonable, because the price would be applied to improve the
 remainder of the entailed estates, which would bv this means
 be much improved in value, though somewhat diminished
 in extent.
 Report    of a Sub-Committee of the Directors of the High
     land  Society of Scotland, on Consideration of a Letter
     from Mr. Telford, Engineer, to Henry Mackenzie, Esq.
     one of the Directors of the Society ; made to, and ap
     proved of by, the General Committee of Directors of the
     said Society, 10th December 1802: the Right Honoura
     ble Lord Macdonald, one of the Vice-Presidents in Office,
     in the Chair.
     The committee have fulhv considered Mr. Tclford's ques
 tions, addressed to Mr. Mackenzie, one of the society's di
rectors.
     In answer to the first, they are persuaded that even the
lines of communication by means of military roads in some
parts of the Highlands, have been productive of benefit to
the country, though, the motives which gave rise to their
formation having no relation to objects of commerce and
industry, the advantages derived from them are very im
                                                         perfect.

                and Central Highlands    of Scotland.           13 1
 perfect.    The committee accordingly have no hesitation in
 declaring it to be their fixed opinion, that the want of
 further roads and communications in the Highlands has
 hitherto proved the greatest obstacle to the introduction of
 useful industry there, and that every attempt for that pur
 pose must fail, until regular and easy communication is af
 forded from one part of the country to another, and more
 especially from the remote points where there is the best
 field for useful exertion to the present seats of capital and
 industry. With regard to what lines would tend most effec
 tually to open the country, and promote the public good,
 the committee humbly report their opinion as follows :
     The Highlands, as to this question, may be divided into
 three districts : the first, comprehending the west coasts of
 Argyle and Inverness-shire, as connected with each other;
 the second, including the county of Ross and a part of the
 county of Inverness ; and the third, or northern district,
comprising the shires of Sutherland and Caithness.
     In the first of these districts, the utmost benefit would
arise from drawing a direct line of communication from the
west side of the Frith of Clyde nearly opposite to Greenock
 to the Bay of Strachur upon Loch Fyne, from whence there
is already an excellent and well conducted road to Fort Wil
liam.     From this point the road mav be easily continued
by    Loch   Kit Side to Loch na Gaul, through Arisaig into
Morer. Such a communication would tend very greatly to
the success of the fisheries in the islands of Egg, Rum,
 Cana, Muck, Barra, and South Uist, all of which possess
numerous lochs and fishing banks in and around them.
The greatest advantages would arise from approximating
these various fisheries and extensive coasts to the Frith of
Clyde, where the fishing capital is at present almost ex
clusively resident.    It is evident that nothing can more dis
courage    the  employment     of that capital in those parts than
that difficulty of approach, amounting almost to inaccessi
bility, which renders the communication of intelligence
always slow and even often precarious.
    In the northern district the lines of communication
would, from the nature of the thing, be drawn to a different
point.     A central point at the south of that district is found
at or near Invershin, to which place the Frith of Dornoch
is navigable, and where a bridge can easily be thrown over,
and from whence a direct and short communication could
be made to Dingwall and Inverness. From this point seve
ral advantageous lines of road might be made, one stretch
ing by the oanks of Loch Shin through part of Assint to
                                1 2                     Kylescow,

  132          A Survey  and Report    of the  Coasts   ,
  Kylescow, another by the kirk of Lairg to the head of Loch
 Loxford, and a third from the kirk of Lairg bv the west
 of Lochnaver to Tongue.      Another road_ again would con
 nect together the western and eastern extremities of this the
 northern coast of Scotland, proceeding from Loch Eriboll
  (at which place there is one of the finest harbours in the
 kingdom) by Tongue, Farr, and Thurso, to Honna on the
 east.   From this point, where there is a ferry to Orkney,
 the road would return to Wick, and from thence along the
 east coasts of Sutherland and Caithness, crossing the river
 Fleet by a bridge, to avoid the little Ferry, till it terminated
 at Invershin.     Such lines as the above would open the
 whole of these countries to all the tradine capital of Inver
 ness and the east coast of Scotland, as well as bv the wav
of Fort William to that of the Clvde ; and it is well known
that all the wav from the vicinity of Kvlescow round to
Wick, the lishine grounds are abundant and excellent.
    As to the mid5le division, the committee would humbly
suggest the utilitv of certain lines of intersection from eat.t
to west.    One of these ought to be from the great military
 road between Fort William and Inverness in a western di
rection, such as mav best afford an easy intercourse between
both these places and the islands of Skve, Harries, and North
Uist, as well as Loch Hourn, Loch Duich, and the other
valuable fishing lochs in that vicinity.     A second will lead
from Contin (which has already a good road to Dingwall)
by the south side of Loch Garve and the head of Loch
Lickart to Achnashine, and from thence in one branch to
Ix>ch Carron and in another to Poliew.        From one or other
of these branches a road of important benefit might be
drawn to I>och Torridon, a third road will extend from the
port of Ullapool in Loch Broom to Invershin at the head
of the Frith of Dornock.
    When    the lines of road now mentioned are completed,
the course    of post will become rapid and regular. From
the   neighbourhood of Skve to Greenock the mail would be
conveyed in three davs, while from Invershin to Edinburgh
by Aberdeen, or to Greenock bv Inverness and Fort Wil
liam, it would be conveved at furthest in four, and thus
the most remote points of the Highlands would be brought
within five days course of post, at the utmost, of Edinburgh
and the Frith of Clyde.    It may suffice for contrasting such
a situation of the Highlands with that in which they are
now placed, in respect to communication of intelligence, to
relate what happened this very year.       When, after the re
turn of the Clyde vessels from a vain search for herrings
                                                               in

                and Central Highlands     of Scotland.            133
in the northern lochs, some considerable shoals having ap
peared, intelligence was dispatched to Grcenock; but owing
to the indirect course of the post, and the difficulties of some
parts of the circuitous journey, several weeks elapsed before
any advantage could be taken of the information *.
    The lines that have been suggested, or nearly such lines,
are, in the opinion of the committee, the radical lines of
road, as they mav be termed, from which in process of
time various ramifications will be formed, when the bene
fits of these begin to be perceptibly diffused.
    From consideration of the connection of the fifth question
with what precedes, the committee in so far depart from
Mr. Telford's arrangement as to put next in order the an
swer to it. They are fully persuaded of the reality of those
views, both of public and individual benefit, which the
statement of the question includes ; and they think it highly
reasonable that the land-owners should, according to their
respective abilities, unite with government in executing
these plans by contributing a certain proportional part of
the expense, varying with the different circumstances of
their several situations.       But the committee humbly report
their opinion,     that  it would be advisable for the lords of the
treasury, alter weighing such suggestions as have been made,
and. consulting their surveyor, to select the lines of road
which more immediately, and in a national view, invite the
public aid ; and then, after the selection is made known, it
will be the duty as well as the interest of land-owners, to
come forward with their proposals, stating, with regard to
each separately, those local considerations which seem to
fix the proportion of public aid that may fairly be solicited.
     In answer to query second, the committee have no doubt
that the Caledonian canal, formed on the scale suggested
 (sufficient for the passage of large trading ships and fri
gates), will be attended with the greatest national advan
tage:.    In respect to these objects, indeed, the benefit must
be so incalculably great, that this truly useful undertaking
 assuredly merits the attention and exertions of government.
 The committee have equally little doubt in concurring with
 the opinion inferred in the third question, that, by opening
 a free communication from the eastern to the western sea,
 it would be highly beneficial to the fisheries, particularly by
 transferring the skill in the cod and ling fishery, possessed
 by the people on the eastern coast, by whom it is certainly
    *  The  ordinary ccursc of the post is one week from Loxford to
 Tongue,   and   another from Tongue to Tain,  being on die line by In
 verness to EJinburgh.
                                  I 3                            better

  134           A   Surrey and Repvrt os tkt Coash
 better understood than bv the natives of the western, from
 the former to the latter of these shores, uhere the iieid for
 its action is inexhaustible.
    With regard to querv fourth, the committee are veil
 convinced that the undertaking these public works must
 produce the united good consequences ot checking the spirit
 of emigration, by affording useful employment to a great
number of people, of improving the habits of the countrv
by teaching lessons of systematic industry, and of affording
at once the excitement to undertake, and the intelligence
as well as 'to a certain moderate extent) the means required
for instituting those fishing and manufacturing establish
ments, on which the future prosperity of the Highlands
must be sounded.
    On the sixth question the committee have to observe,
that they are fully aware of the commercial as well as other
national advantages derivable from the Caledonian canal :
but with regard to the question to what extent commercial
men would he ready to contribute individually towards car
rying the same into effect, the Highland Society can have
no means of forming an opinion, other than by reference to
that general spirit of liberal enterprise which distinguishes
the commercial body.
    Adverting to a supplementary suggestion from Mr. Tel-
ford, the committee apprehend that it would be highly ex
pedient to introduce a clause into any act of parliament on
the subject, authorizing and empowering proprietors of en
tailed estates either to sell lands for defraying the expense
of contributing along with government to the making of
roads and bridges in the Highlands, or in their option to
make the same a debt, affecting the subsequent heirs of
entail.
    It has been stated to the committee, that tutors and cu
rators of minor proprietors, and trustees holding possession
of estates concerned in these improvements, might feel
some hesitation in venturing on the necessary outlays, as
entertaining a doubt of sAich acts of administration falling
within their powers. The committee are humbly of opi
nion, that it would be proper to add to the clause already
suggested,    an enactment, that tutors and curators of a
minor heir of entail, or trustees in possession of an estate
already entailed, or which is directed to be entailed, should
have the same power of selling lands or charging the estate
that is by the act conferred upon heirs of entail themselves.
As also that tutors and curators of minors possessed of un
entailed   estates,  and  trustees holding possession of such*
                                                        should

               and Central Highlands    of Scotland.       135
should be entitled by their acts in the premises to bind the
minor or trustee; and all successors to the estate.

Minute of the Committee of the Directors of the. Highland
  Society of Scotland, which formerly drew up Answers,
  in the Shape of a Report, to the Queries of Mr. Telford,
  Engineer, respecting the opening of Communications by
  Roads and Bridges in the Highlands, and by a Canal from
  Inverness to Fort William, upon considering a Letter
  from Mr. Telford, of date 14th December 1802, to Henry
  Mackenzie, Esq. one of the Society's Directors, owning
  Receipt of said Report, which he states to be able, full,
  and satisfactory, and that the " only Instance in which
  it is rather less explicit than he could wish, is with re
  spect to the Road in the Middle Division, which should
  connect the Inverness and Fort William Road with Skye,
  Sec. 8cc." as to which Mr. Telford wishes the Committee
  could say something more specific, and recommends their
  taking any Information which can be furnished by Mr.
  Donaldson, Surveyor of Military Roads, upon that Point;
  the Right Honourable Lord Macdonald, one of the Vice-
  Presidents in Office, in the Chair.
   The committee, in their former report, have pointed out
the great objects to which roads through the district in ques
tion should in their opinion apply ; but there being a dif
ference of opinion as to the precise lines of road by which
those objects would best be attained, the committee do not
feel themselves  at liberty to specify those precise lines.
They would take the liberty of suggesting the expediency of
government employing some able surveyor or engineer of
respectable character and abilities to report on the subject ;
and  if, relative to the present point of inquiry, they are to
say any thing more particular, they may mention that the
objects of this line of intersection seem chiefly twofold, vis.
to afford  a  communication to the head of Loch Hourn,       a
very  valuable   fishing loch, and also to Bernera, the nearest
point to Skye both which they apprehend may be attained
                ;

                            a

the loss of the battle of the 30th of Ventose, year o, gave
us reason to apprehend that the enemy, favoured by the
misunderstanding which prevailed between our chiefs, would
at length tear from us the most valuable of our colonies,
which had cost us so many efforts and sacrifices ; in a word,
that celebrated 'country Egypt, which we had explored in
every direction, which we had seen covered with monu
ments coeval with the heroic ages, and the fertility of
which had appeared to us superior to its reputation. At
the moment when we were informed of our disasters, and
when the report circulated of them immediately excited
against ns the whole population of Egypt, a crocodile was
brought to me which had been carried alive to Cairo, and
which had died three days before.             At a more fortunate
period I had ardently desired to dissect an animal so much
celebrated by antient authors ; but being at that time aban
doned to those painful sensations which all the French ex
perienced, I hesitated a moment whether I should under
take this labour. Foreseeing, however, that if I let slip this
opportunity I might never have another, and being per
suaded, as I always have been, that the courage proper for
travellers placed in the same circumstances as those in
which 1 then found myself, is that of resignation, I paid
no attention 'to any thing but the crocodile then before me.
But I was not able to proceed to a regular dissection, nor
to extend my researches to all those organs which appeared
to be worthy of notioe, being prevented by a commence
ment of putrefaction which the crocodile had already expe
rienced, and by the obligation I was under to save and to.
preserve the skin.      Besides, as it had already been observed

                   the Crocodile of the Nile.               137
by several distinguished anatomists, I thought it sufficient
to confine myself to the consideration ot' the organs which
might have escaped their examination ; so that what I now
publish contains only some additions to the history of an
animal known since the earliest ages.
       I. Of the Manner in which the Jaws are    moved.
   Who could believe, considering the present      state of sci
ence, that this question is still problematical ? It has been
combated by a great number of travellers and naturalists,
but none of them, as will be seen, have completely solved it.
   Herodotus is the first who asserts that the crocodile is the
only known animal whose upper jaw is moveable on the
lower, which remains fixed : his opinion has been followed
by all the antients. Aristotle, Pliny, &c, and some of the
moderns, such as Margrave, Oligerus, Jacobæus, Marmol,
the illustrious Vesalius, and some Jesuit missionaries to
Siam, who had an opportunity of seeing living crocodiles,
or of examining them soon after death, all speak of them
in the same terms ; but little attention was paid to these
testimonies.    The first anatomists of the Academy of Sci
ences undertook to demonstrate the impossibility of the fact
advanced by Herodotus,       and the names of Perrault and
Duverney tended to establish this opinion, which has been
adopted by the naturalists who have since written on the
crocodile.
   It is no doubt very surprising that Perrault, known for
his accuracy, and who carefully dissected a crocodile from
the menagerie of Versailles, did not pay sufficient attention
to the singular conformation of the head of this animal ;
and that he should have opposed with so much violence the
opinion of the antients. He gives a minute description
of the articulation of the jaws, without observing that it
furnishes proofs against the fact which he proposed to esta
blish ; and he besides supposed that he had done it in a satis
factory manner by rectifying the errors of Marmol, which
he falsely ascribed to Vesalius, and by proving, with reason,
that the upper jaw is not, as in perroquets, separated from
the cranium, but that it forms with the rest of the head one
osseous piece.
    Since men   of such merit as Perrault, Duverney, and the
other naturalists who have since examined crocodiles in col
lections, could doubt of a fact attested by so great a number
of observers, this question must certainly be embarrassed by
a difficulty which can be cleared up only by an exact de
scription of the head, and of the organs by which it is moved.
                                                            The

  138              Anatomical    Observations on
    The question here is not merely to rectify an accredited
 error, and to defend the antients from the injustice done
 them bv some of the moderns.         I must also call the atten
 tion of naturalists to a singular fact in regard to organiza
 tion.    Nothing, indeed, can be more paradoxical than the
 head of the crocodile ; all those parts which in other ani
 mals are on the sides, are in the crocodile thrown backwards.
 The temporal bone itself projects backwards a good deal be
 yond the cranium : it is elongated, and transformed into a
 double condylc, the functions of which it performs. Every
 thing has in some measure been said of the head of the cro
 codile, by considering it as composed merely of two jaws,
 for the cranium is so small and so displaced that it escapes
 the first examination.    It is found below and a little before
 the occipital plate ; the brain, or rather the ganglion, con
 tained in its cavity, which is exceedingly narrow, is conti
 nued pretty far forwards, so that the organs of sight and
 of hearing are situated below and a little behind it.
    Another anomaly equally worthy of remark is, 1st, That
 the lower jaw is a sixth longer than the upper and the cra
nium. 2d, That the lower jaw exhibits a cavity with two
 facets, where the horns of the temporal bone are articulated
by a ginglymus.       3d, That the occipital condyle is on the
 same line as the four condvles of the temporal bones, so
 that the head is really retained towards its points of articu
lation as the lid of a box is by its hinge.     4th, That as the
two jaws have only a simple motion from the top down
wards, they cannot be moved separately to the right or to
 the left, to subject the aliments to a sort of tnturation.
    On examining a living crocodile, or one prepared, as is
customary in collections, it is hardly possible to believe that
the head terminates at the extremity of the jaws; one looks
for the osseous box which contains the brain, and which
in all other animals manifests itself externally under the
form of a frontal protuberance. The observer thinks he
sees it towards the anterior part of the neck, which is sym
metrically swelled up, and which is generally taken for the
complement of the head : but this swelling arises from the
presence of- the crotaphitc muscles, which arc pretty volu
minous, and which in a great measure are lodged between
the straight and oblique muscles.
    Differences so great in the form of the head neccssarilv
occasion others in the organs which correspond directly
with it ; and it is indeed found that the cervical column is
composed of seven vertebrae, which arc distinct, but com
bined in their articulation in such a manner that they are
                                                             not

not moveablc  on each other. The apophyses of these ver-
 ebræ are so multiplied, so long, and so close to each other,
that the animal cannot bend its neck, and that the cervical
 column, in regard to its uses, must be considered as one
 bone. The straight and oblique muscles attached to            and                                   it,
 which have their second point of insertion towards the oc
 cipital ridge, raise up when they contract the head on the
 neck,          by
             making     describe an arch of 45°.

 movements given to the head        on the other hand, the lower

    The antients, and almost all the moderns, have stated
 that the crocodile has no tongue               indeed true that        :   it   is                            it

 140               Anatomical Observations on
phagus ; for it is fixed by its base to the broad piece of the
os hyoides.     When the latter then is drawn downwards,
while the muscular fibres of the tongue at the same time
contract, it forms itself into a ball, and, being drawn back
wards by the muscles of the os hvoides, it necessarily car
ries with it in the contrary movement the aliments compre
hended between it and the palate.
   The os hvoides is composed of three pieces.      The largest
0*10 metre bv C-07 is cartilaginous, and resembles the broad
part of a wooden shovel : the posterior bottom is round, and
the interior straight. The latter is inflected on the convex
surface of the large piece, and it is in the groove formed bv
this inflection that the root of the tongue is inserted.      It
results  from this disposition that the large piece projects
beyond the root of the tongue by about a centimetre. This
projecting edge or kind of ridge becomes a velum, which,
when the os hvoides is carried backwards, closes the whole
of the back part of the mouth, and sometimes also the
posterior apertures of the nostrils.
   Such is the mechanism which allows the crocodile when
pursued and frightened, as I have had occasion to observe
ki Upper Egypt, to shelter itself, and to he concealed in
the river, and to be able to respire in it. It only thrusts out
of the water the extremity of its muzzle where the nasal
apertures .are situated : the jaws are then open, without the
water being able to penetrate into the œsophagus and tra
chea.
   The horns of     the os hvoides are two small arched and
elongated   bones  about  0*07 metre in length.
   The os hyoides is drawn backwards bv four muscles, the
exterior ones of which are round and the interior flat : it is
drawn forwards by the contraction of the tongue.
   Pcrrault gives to the œsophagus of the vounsr crocodile
which he examined a greater diameter than to the stomach,
fie compares the œsophagus of this reptile to the trizzard
of a bird which feeds on errain ; and he consequently sup
poses, what would Ik an anomaly too monstrous to be found
in the animal œeonomv, that digestion is effected in a great
measure in the œsophagus. Mv observations are directly
contrarv to those of that celebrated anatomist. I found the
diameter of the œsophagus to be 0*06 metre, and that of the
stomach 0-17 by 0-15; for the. form of this bag is that of
an ellipsoid slightlv compressed      on the sides : in a word,
it did not appear to me to have anv resemblance to a gizzard.
The velvety tunic was exceedingly thick ; the muscular part
was less so : the inside was silled with a quantity of small
                                                        pebbles,

pebbles, the polish of which announced that they had served
tor the trituration of the alimentary matters. The stomach
had over it a bag, which was terminated bv the pylorus.
In the intestines, which were 3-67 metres in length, nothing
could be distinctly observed but the rectum, in consequence
¦of its great thickness. The duodenum, a little below the py
lorus, was remarkable by a double contour, which it made
from the top upwards for the extent of 0* 14 : its folds, which
touched each other, were united by an adipose membrane
split in three different places.       The rest of the intestines, in
which no trace of a cæcum is observed, was strongly at
tached to the loins by means of the mesentery.
                    III. Organs    of Respiration.
   The   flatness of the tail of the crocodile, and           the mem
branes    extended between the toes of its hind              feet,  suffi
ciently account for the decided taste which this             animal has
for rivers ; but as the ears and back part of the             mouth are
each provided with a cartilage, which, when necessary,
prevents the introduction of the surrounding liquid, I had
reason to expect a similar relation between the pulmonary
organs and those of natation.             1 therefore   always wished
that I misht be able      to  describe   these   pulmonary organs as
compared      with those of  other  lizards,  in  order to trace out the
most essential anatomical characters by which the genus of
the crocodile differs from various other families of reptiles.
 If 1 therefore give this description, it is not because most
of the preceding anatomists have omitted to do it : on the
contrary, we are acquainted with those of Vesalius, sir Hans
Sloane, Ferrault, Hasselquist, and that more minute bv the
Jesuit missionaries to Siam, to which Duverney has added,
and which might be considered as complete.
    The trachea opens in the centre of the broad piece of the
os hvoides, and accompanies it backwards nearly (that I
may employ the comparison already used) as the handle of
a wooden shovel accompanies the lower part.                 A little be
fore it divides itself into two branches, it is folded back, and
turns to the right side, as is observed in several birds.              Its
 length in a straight line, as far as the point of its bifurca
 tion, is 0-38 metre.        It is composed of complete, broad,
 cartilaginous rings, separated from each other by a very
 narrow membranous ring.           I found only the first ten rings
 complete. Duverney, in the crocodile of the Academy,
 counted sixteen, the portions of which were united by a
 membrane. The Jesuits above mentioned found a greater
 number in the crocodiles of Siam.               It is this membrane
                                                                 strongly

   142              Anatomical Observations     on
  strongly distended, and made to vibrate in the manner of
  the parchment of a drum, by the interior air of the lungs,
  which causes the crocodile to emit that cry, or rather that
  bellowing noise, mentioned by Catesby, 1a Coudreniere,
  and Bartram.      The fissure of the glottis is then shut by the
  muscular roll which borders it on each side.
     The lungs are two conical bags, the summits of which are
  turned towards the head. Their interior surfaces, which rest
  on the œsophagus, retain the impression of it by a longitu-1
  dinal furrow. Their length is 0-33 metre, and their breadth
  at the base 0*22.     The figure given by Perrault represents
  them of an elongated ovoid form.
     The lungs of lizards are only two elongated bags, 0-40 in
  length, and O- 1 1 in their greatest thickness ; the interior
 sides of which are lined with small reticular rarneous
 fibres and sanguiferous vessels.      Those of crocodiles differ
 by the size of the membranous leaves with which they are
 furnished, and which form as it were several small walls.
 It is a vast reticulation, composed of a quantity of meshes
 similar to those whish are seen in the second stomach of
 ruminating animals. Each of these meshes is the edge and
 entrance of a small bag, which opens into a second, and
 sometimes into a third. They are composed of two kinds of
 fibres : the first circular, and parallel to each other; the se
 cond perpendicular, which transversely intersect the former
 at right angles.     The centre of each pulmonary bag, en
 tirely empty,   serves in some measure as a receptacle for the
 air. The cells in opening become silled with it. They then
 compress it by shutting, and convey it to the blood, as we
 may say, without the concurrence of those organs which
press on the whole pulmonary mass. They repeat this play
until the air contained in the whole lung is vitiated. The
crocodile, then, is not forced to come and respire at the sur
face of the water till after a certain time has elapsed.     This
structure of the lungs, which makes the crocodile deviate
from lizards, brings it near to the sea-tortoise. I shall have
occasion hereafter to remark, that this is not the only rela
tion which it has to these animals.
               IV. Of the    Organs  of Generation.
    These organs arc so complex, and have so little relation
to what is known in the mammalia, that authors, as we may
say, have been afraid to describe them, and have scarcely
given a slight sketch of them.         It has been said that the
crocodile is only a lizard of a monstrous size, and Linnæus
has consequently arranged it in his system under the genus
                                                          lacerta.

                       the Crocodile   of the Nile.              143
iacerta.      What I have already said of the configuration of
the head and lungs of this reptile removes it no doubt from
that genus, but the consideration of the organs of generation
will obviate all uncertainty in regard to these natural relations.
   Most lizards, like serpents, are furnished with two yards,
situated on each side of the anus. Properly speaking, they
are only two cavernous bodies, formed by a slight cutaneous
expansion, and terminated by two cartilaginous appendices.
In the inside of them are found two glands, which pour
forth a liquor in such abundance, that it has given rise to
mistakes in regard to its nature, and made it be consi
dered as the seminal liquor.These yards move in a sheath
formed by a duplicature of the skin : they arc terminated
behind by an elongated muscle, always inclosed in a mem
branous vagina, which, by contracting, forces them to re
enter.
     If the crocodile retains any part of this general plan of
 organization, the combination is quite different. It has only
 one yard lodged at the anterior part, and in the fold of a
 common cloaca : it is imperforated, entirely cartilaginous,
 and terminated by a kind of gland 0*03 in length.           It has
 two glands on the sides of the anus, from which oozes
 a whitish liquor through two distinct orifices at a consider
 able distance from each other.         These glands produce no
 protuberance, and yet the retractor of the cavernous bodies
 of lizards exists.    It is even of so considerable a volume
 (0-40 in length, and 0*11 in its greatest thickness), that it
 is this muscle with its congenerate that swells up the anterior
part of the tail, so that it cannot be distinguished by a di
minution of volume from the rest of the body. This muscle
is terminated by a sharp edge, or ridge, where it is articu
lated with the caudal vertebræ, and by a free and round edge
on the opposite side.       What is remarkable besides     is, that.
it   is contained, like the retractor muscle of the cavernous
bodies, in proper sheath of great thickness, and of carti
              a                                           a
laginous nature. This sheath           continued forwards in an
                                       is
aponeurosis,     which   spreads and      inserted on the pelvis
                                         is                       ;
so that, as the uses of this muscle change with the general
system of organization, they are confined to contributing
merely to the lateral motion of the tail.
    The testicles in some measure approach near to those of
fishes    :they are narrow and elongated.       They are observed
a  little above and before the kidneys.
    The semen     isconveyed     two pretty large vessels, con
                                in
tiguous, and lodged behind the common cloaca.               These
vesicles are in part closed    bya cartilaginous bag they open
                                                      :

                          V. Of the Liver.
    The liver is composed of two unequal lobes : one of them
has the form of a parallelopipedon (o* 14 metre bv 0*09) ; the
other is slender and more elongated (0-19).              This viscus
exhibited a very remarkable organization, which has never
yet been noticed by any anatomist. The convex surface of
each lobe is covered bv a membrane, which is the aponeurosis
of a muscle, the use of which I can hardlv comprehend.
This muscle, which begins at the posterior and inferior edge
of  each lobe, is inserted very near the pelvis, in the last piece
of  the sternum ; for it must be recollected, that the latter is
prolonged beyond the ribs, and terminates in a large piece
articulated with the bones of the pelvis. These two muscles,
which have not yet been found in any other animal, produce
bv their contraction the depression of the liver, and thereby
give more capacity to the breast.           This use makes them
nave an affinity with the diaphragm : the points to which
they are attached might induce a belief of the same thing*.
The gall-bladder is ovoid, a-08 of a metre by 0-03, and ad
heres to the right lobe of the liver.

    As these have been already so well described by most of
the authors before mentioned,         I shall give only their rela
tive positions, because this information may furnish some
useful hints for determining the different kinds of croco
diles.
    The   heart. —Its  height is 0*07 metre, its base 0-05. The

    The spleen. —Oval elongated, 0*10 by 0-04. On the in
 ferior face it is somewhat concave ; and on the upper rises
 into two ridges, one of which is very small.

 nuosities formed by a collection of glands, O- 1 1 metre by
 0-05f.
     I had not resolved to publish these observations till after
 my return from Egypt ; and at that time, notwithstanding
the learned researches of several of my colleagues, they had
 still retained all their novelty. The object of Cuvier's ex
 cellent memoir is merely to establish the real differences be-
    * C. Cuvier observed these muscles in the crocodile of St. Domingo.
 He proposes to describe them at more length in his Comparative Ana-
                                                                 tween

old ; and Daudin * has endeavoured,                in particular, to en
rich the history of the crocodile from the relations of tra
vellers before unknown.
   Since 1 have occasion to quote the latter work, I must
rectify an error which concerns me, and which C. Daudin
introduces inconsequence of the respect which he is pleased
to entertain towards me. He announces that " 1 attempted,
during my stay in Egypt, to tame crocodiles after the example
of the antients, and that my attempts were not crowned
with that success which I expected."                It is a duty which    I
owe to truth, to assert that I never made any attempt of the
kind.
    The following is the circumstance that gave rise to this
report, which was indeed circulated at the time of our tri
umphs.        The period when the army of the East had at its
head a chief worthy of its great exploits, the English sent to
combat us could then find no opportunity of gratifying the
desire of injuring us with which they were tormented. Tired
of cruising backwards and forwards to no purpose, they
wished to amuse themselves, and thought they could reach
us with very feeble weapons, by endeavouring to turn into
ridicule the principal persons in the army. They made some
caricatures, which they sent to England, and which were
thence conveyed to France.             I had the honour of attracting
their notice. They introduced into the scene several croco
diles ; and this epnemeron production gave rise to the mis
 take to which I allude.

XXIV.      Observations and Experiments on the Light emitted
    by rotten Wood, in the different Kinds of Gas, and in
    Fluids.   By C.   W. Bockman, of Carlsruhe.
                       [Concluded from p. 26.]
                        Experiment    XVII.
J. introduced phosphorescent wood under the receiver of
the air-pump, placed a bit of it in a glass filled with water,
and another piece on a dish not immersed in water. When
the air began to be rarefied, a quantity of air not inconsider
able issued from the wood.       The light of the wood seemed
to be somewhat weaker than at first, and proportionably less
than that of a piece placed without the receiver. When the
quicksilver in the barometer connected with it sunk about
four lines, on there-admission of atmospheric air I thought
I  observed a considerable increase in the phosphorescence.
The piece of wood immersed in water was entirely pene
trated by that fluid : it therefore fell to the bottom, but
emitted as strong a light as at first. This experiment was
several times repeatea with the same result.
                       Experiment    XVIII.
    Oval glass flasks, capable of containing five cubic inches,
and of equal thickness, were filled ; some with oxygen gas,
some with azotic gas, and some with carbonic acia gas, and
well stopped with corks, to which were affixed wires sup
porting pieces of phosphorescent wood.          I then introduced
all these vessels at the same time into water at 70° of Reau
mur.     In about three-quarters of a minute the light in the
 carbonic acid gas perceptibly decreased, and then that in the
 azotic gas ; in one minute and a half it appeared weaker in
the oxygen gas ; and in two minutes and a half the least,
 phosphorescence     was not to be observed in any of the vessels-'
 It could not afterwards be revived in any of the pieces of
 wood bv any means whatever. This experiment was also
 repeated several times with the like result.
                         Experiment   XIX.
    Rotten wood emitted light in spring water, in boiled water,
 and in distilled water, kept in a close vessel till the experi
                                                             ment

           in the different Kinds  of Gas, and in Fluids.        147
  mcnt was made at the         temperature  of from 8 to      12° of
  Reaumur, the same as in common air.               The phospho
  rescence did not become weaker till the end of several hours,
  and in twenty-four hours it completely ceased.          It could,
  however, be m part revived by wrapping up the pieces of
  wood in filtering paper ; but when the water had the tem
 perature of 45° the light was speedily extinguished, and
 could not be again revived.
               •           Experiment   XX.
     Having introduced wood strongly phosphorescent into
 sulphurous acid, nitrous acid, and muriatic acid, the light
 either instantaneously ceased altogether, or in one or two
 minutes, and could not be again revived in any manner.
                          Experiment   XXI.
     I added   a considerable quantity of water to the above acids,
 in such     a  manner that only a few drops of acid were put
 into a cubic inch of water. The light of the rotten wood
 decreased in three minutes, ceased in general in from six to
 ten minutes, and was not again visible when the wood was
 washed with water in the atmospheric air.
                        Experiment    XXII.
    Rotten wood appeared phosphorescent in muriate of am
 monia, nitrate of potash, common salt, and tartaric acid ;
 and even somewhat stronger in the second and third solution
 than in atmospheric air. The light continued longer than
 in common spring water.
                         Experiment   XXIII.
    The phosphorescence of rotten wood continued in a di
 lute solution of carbonate of potash as well as in liquid am
 monia two or three minutes, and then became entirely ex
 tinct.    In linseed oil the wood appeared phosphorescent
 without any diminution eighteen hours, and in thirty was
 entirely extinguished.
                         Experiment   XXIV.
    I immersed phosphorescent wood in spirit of wine, and
found that it was extinguished in from four to eight minutes.
 In sulphuric ether the light strongly decreased after twenty
minutes, and in a short time entirely disappeared.         It could
not be again revived by the common mode of treatment.
    If these experiments, which I was not able to carry any
further for want of phosphorescent wood, be compared with
                                  K  2                           the

 148         On the Light emitted by rotten Wood,
 the experiments of other observers, the following differences
  will be found :
     1st, According to the above experiments, rotten wood
  does not emit so remarkably clear a light in oxygen gas as
  Spallanzani observed. The lie;ht also was not so speedily ex
 tinguished, that  is, in scarcely   aminute, as found byTych-
 sen.     And as my observations perfectly coincide with the
  experiments of Humboldt and Gartner, Spallanzani's and
 Tychsen's observations, which       I will not venture to doubt,
 must have been attended with peculiar circumstances.
     2dly, In regard to the diminution of the volume of gas,
'M.Gartner found       itonce in oxvgen gas two-thirds of the
 whole.     According to my experiments, however,          was
                                                            it       al
 ways much less.
     3dly, The residuum of the oxygen gas, in which the rotten
 wood had ceased to be luminous, was found            by
                                                       Gartner, on
 being subjected   to proof,  of sach    nature
                                         a       that one measure
 of mixed with sufficient quantity of nitrous gas gave
    it              a
a   diminution of 207°-     I  however found the diminution of
 the residuum in bell glass to be 20°, and that in another
                  a                      1
 only 21°, though our oxvgen gas was prepared from the same
 maicrial, namelv, oxide of manganese,           and of     quality
                                                            a
 equally good.    This  difference, perhaps,  was   owing to dif a
 ference in the size of the vessels employed, and even in the
 rotten wood.
    4thly, The sudden extinction of phosphorescent wood
 observed by M. Humboldt in carbonic acid gas purified               by
 means of phosphorus,       Idid not observe in exceedingly pure
 gas treated in the same manner.
    5thly, M. Humboldt observed the same sudden extinction
 in azotic gas which had been freed              by
                                                  means of phos
 phorus from any oxygen         might contain.
                                it                  But this was I
 never able to observe, either in azotic gas as pure as possible,
 or in the same gas exposed to the contact of phosphorus.
    Gthly, In these experiments      I did not pay very great at
 tention to the absorption which might take place of the dif
 ferent kinds of gas, because in researches of this kind in
 regard to rotten wood no accurate results can be obtained.
I  however, in general, observed no diminution          the azotic
                                                       in
 gas; which, on the other hand, according to Tychsen's ob
 servations, was greater than that experienced        by
                                                       oxygen gas
 prepared from saltpetre.
     7thly, M. Humboldt found that rotten wood was lu
 minous only for very short time in oil
                   a                              ;whereas Carra-
 dori's experiments and mine show the contrary.
    Sthly, According to M. Gartner,         piece of rotten wood
                                             a
                                                        continued

           in the different Kinds  of Gas, and in Fluids.       149
 continued luminous in hydrogen gas in which another piece
 had emitted light, a much shorter time than in gas which had
 not been before used. 1 do not remember to have ever found
 any remark of this kind in the works of others ; and as I
 paid particular attention to this point, in regard to every other
 kind of gas, I did not find Gartner's observation confirmed.
 A great part of these variations, however, are probably ow
 ing to this circumstance, that the wood employed was not
 of the same kind, and had not the same degree of rotten
 ness and moisture. All our experiments, however, coincide
 as much as could be expected from the use of a substance
 such as phosphorescent wood.                            , .
    If we still further compare the phænomena of rotten wood
with those of phosphorus, the following differences will be
observed between       these substances   :
                        Pfwspfiwescent Wood,
    1st,  Is luminous in oxygen      gas at low temperatures.
    2dly, It is phosphorescent     in  all non-respirable gases, at
least a short time, and in several of them in a pretty conti
nued manner ; as in phosphorized oxygen gas, and phospho-
rized azotic gas.
    3dly, In muriatic acid gas its light is soon extinguished.
   4thly, Its phosphorescence in rarefied air is weaker.
   5thly, It emits light in a Torricellian vacuum, according
to the testimony of Carradori.
   6thly, Its light becomes extinct both in oxygen gas and
in other gases when heated.
    7thly, By the process of its phosphorescence in oxygen
gas carbonic acid gas is produced.
   8thlv, The phosphorescence of rotten wood can be ex
tinguished several times successively in the non-respirable
gases, whether they contain oxygen gas or not, without the
property of the gas to maintain the phosphorescence of a new
piece of wood introduced into it being perceptibly lessened.
   athly, Moisture promotes the phosphorescence of rotten
wood, and is essentially necessary for that purpose.
    lOthly, Rotten wood emits light also under water, in oil
and in other liquids. Its splendour in some of them is even
heightened.
                        Kunkel's Phosphorus.
   1st,  It "becomes luminous in oxygen         gas only at a tem
perature    of about  16" to 22u  of Reaumur.
   2dly,   Of all the non-respirable   gases as pure as possible, it
                                  K  3                            is

150           On the Light emitted     ly   rotten Wood
is luminous only in azotic gas, oxidated azotic gas, and
muriatic acid gas.
   3dly, In muriatic acid gas it inflames immediately of itself,
and burns with great brightness.
   4thly, The light of phosphorus is stronger in rarefied air.
   5thly, It emits no light in vacuo.
   6thly, On being subjected to heat, it inflames and burns
with rapidity in oxygen gas ; and in the non-respirable
gases, not pure, its light is stronger.
    7thly, By its phosphorescence in oxygen gas no carbonic
acid is formed.
    8thly, When artificial phosphorus has emitted light in the
non-respirable gases not perfectly freed from oxygen gas,
a fresh piece of phosphorus does not become luminous in
them : azotic gas, however, is an exception, in which, after
being purified, phosphorus becomes luminous for sometime.
    9thly, Moisture and wet are impediments to its being lu
minous.
    lOthly, Fluids are altogether contrary to the luminous pro
perty of artificial phosphorus.
    Phosphorescent wood, therefore, differs essentially from
artificial phosphorus by the conditions requisite for its being
luminous ; and therefore the assertion of Spallanzani, that
the greatest analogy exists between the luminous phæno-
mena of these two substances must lose some of its weight.
    If I mistake not, the following probable conclusions may
be deduced from the above experiments : that the extinction
of the light of rotten wood in different mediums does not
so immediately arise from a want of oxygen gas as from
some change which the wood itself has experienced.           For
even      according to the opinion of Humboldt, Spallanzani,
        if,
and other philosophers, the oxygen gas concealed in diffe
rent mediums be the immediate cause of its phosphores
cence, in several experiments where rotten wood was im
mersed in different mediums   1   must have observed no light  :
 at any rate, the phosphorescence must always have been
weaker, and fresh wood repeatedly introduced would no
longer have been luminous in      it
                                   ;  which     contrary to what
                                                is
I   experienced.
   Besides, how difficult would   it be to prove, with any de
gree  of probability, that  the undiniinished  phosphorescence
of wood, which      is observed in distilled water and in oil,
arises from   a small quantity of oxvgen gas in tliesc fluids  ?
And    isthe luminous wood, placed in these fluids, capable
of decomposing oxygen gas with which            so little
                                               it   is    con
                                                          in
                                                          tact,

            in tlie different Kinds   of Gas, and in Fluids.        151
tact, and which, as a component part in atmospheric air,
must adhere to the azotic gas, and which is also in com
bination with the fluids themselves ? Is artificial phosphorus,
which in all probability has a greater affinity for oxygen
than luminous wood, able to decompose the oxygen gas in
water ? May not its being oxidated under water arise rather
from the slow decomposition of the water itself, than from
the decomposition of the gasiform oxygen contained in it ?
If otherwise, phosphorus would be as luminous in water as
wood ; which, in the course of my numerous experiments,
I did not find to be the case, though I had often in my hand
flasks which contained half a pound of partly fresh melted
and partly weak and strongly oxidated pieces of phospho
rus : and in regard to the luminous stars which Messrs.
Scherer and Jager.have described, and which I observed in
boiling water in which phosphorus was put, I consider them
to have been sine phosphoric particles which emitted light
in the small air bubbles separated by means of the heat from
the water. I observed also in the dark, on opening the above
flasks, in which phosphorus had remained for some months,
luminous vapours often arise from them. This luminous
appearance, however, did not take place in water free from
the contact of atmospheric air. It appears to me also, in
consequence of several experiments, made with great care,
on the quantity of oxygen gas decomposed during the com
bustion of phosphorus in atmospheric air, or in non-respira-
ble gases in which a certain quantity of oxygen gas is mixed,
possible to determine, in a certain degree, from the known
quantity of the surface of the phosphorus, from the dura
tion of the light and its intensity, how much oxygen gas is
actually decomposed ; and if this idea is not entirely ground
less, it appears to me very improbable, that in the interstices
of distilled water as much gaseous oxygen exists as is suffi
cient to account for the phosphorescence of rotten wood in
it, according to the conjecture of M. Humboldt and there
                                                       ;
fore  it appears to me more probable that wood, to produce
its phosphorescence,       in no immediate need of oxygen.

I  was induced,       some expressions of M. Humboldt, to
                       by

                                          I
done.
 I  am not much inclined to believe that wood, as        lumi   a
nous substance, produces the observed diminution of oxy
gen gas. According to my opinion this       occasioned much
                                                is
more     the degree of the rottenness, as during all processes
           by
ot fermentation and putrefaction the above gas         decom
                                                           is
posed.    M.  Humboldt    does  not  appear   to me   to   have
                                 K    4                         adopted

152              On the Light emitted   ly rotten Wood
adopted a proper method, when, in some of his processes,
he destroyed the phosphorescence by sudden heatiner, in
order that, bv comparing it with that of other wood" not
treated in the same manner, he might observe whether it
effects the diminution of the gas as a luminous or as a pu
trescent substance.    For it appears to me very probable, that
by  such  a violent exaltation ot temperature, besides the phos
phorescence,    the previous degree of putridity is changed, and
consequently that this wood can neither decompose nor ab
sorb anv more oxygen gas.
    This alteration of phosphorescent wood, by means of
which its light is more or less speedily checked by certain
mediums, appears to me, with some probability, to depend
on the circumstance whether they are calculated more or
less to check the putridity, or, on the contrary, to promote
it. The putridity, therefore, and the phosphorescence con
nected with           it,
                     must continue not onlv in oxygen gas but
also in atmospheric air, and in weak solutions of muriate
of soda and nitrate of potash. Like the phosphorescence of
wood,  it    more or less checked
            is                          bywant of oxygen gas, and
consequently         all the non-respirable gases, and particu
                      in
larly in nitrous gas, and in carbonic acid eas on account of
its peculiar property of opposing putridity        ;  also by ex
posure to heat, on account of the desiccation connected
with  it;        by
                 concentrated or diluted acids     ;     bytartarous
acid, &c. The latter acts, perhaps, so far as      it  speedily at
tracts the water, and therefore desiccates the rotten wood.
But whether sulphurized hydrogen gas, ammoniacal gas,
muriatic acid gas, which are all speedily miscible with water,
exercise   aprejudicial action on luminous wood by absorbing
its moisture and acting in the same manner as fluid ammo
 nia or acids    ;or whether,    by  means of  a   peculiar antipu-
trescent property, they extinguish the phosphorescence so
 speedily,  I  will not venture to determine.
    In word, this theory harmonizes pretty accurately with
      a
 the well known experiments on phosphorescence, which
 continues in mediums that promote putridity, and              inter
                                                              is
 rupted     byfluids that oppose it. According to the above-
 mentioned opinion of Carradori, this philosopher seems to
 have considered such action as possible, but he does not
 assign anv cause.
    The following observations of M. Humboldt, which he
 wrote however for        totally different object,
                            a                      1  found so ap

and in others is weakened or completely checked, that I
consider it as my duty here to insert them ; for coincidence
with the unprejudiced opinion of a great man is always ad
vantageous to a writer, and when thrown into the scale
adds no small weight to an assertion.       M. Humboldt says,
"  When the equilibrium between the component parts of
organized matter is destroyed, and the important chemical
process of putrefaction begins, it is variously modified by
the temperature and nature of the surrounding mediums.
Every fermenting substance, therefore, changes every mo
ment the state ot its mixture ; and as its natural phospho
rescence depends on this change of mixture, every thing
that relates to the one must increase or destroy the other.
There are two conditions, therefore, under which rotten
wood is extinguished, one of which has an immediate and
the other a mediate action.     The first is only oxygen gas;
                 COO
the other, heat, oil, acids, alcohol, See.       Decomposition
with the disengagement of light ceases until a new acces-
  ¦
sion of oxygen gas.      But the putrescent substance in con
tact with oxygen gas is brought to a new state of mixture
by elevation of temperature, and quits its former state of
putridity, which is an essential condition of the disengage
ment of light."
    If the determinate degree of putriditv is totally changed
or destroyed by certain mediums, the extinguished light of
the wood cannot be again revived ; but if these fluids have
 exercised on the wood onlv a weak r.ction and for a short
 time, and if the degree of the putridity be therefore only
 as it were superficial, the phosphorescence in this case may
be again revived and strengthened by means that promote
 putridity, and consequently by moistening, exposure to at
 mospheric air, &c.
    I, however, freely confess that it still appears to me diffi
 cult to explain, in a definitive manner, how wood in this
 phosphorescent state is decomposed, and what its luminous
 appearance really is.    1 have however formed several ideas
 on this subject, but they do not appear to me to be yet fit t6
 be laid before the public.    Nor will I venture to determine
 how near the truth the opinions' of Spallanzani, Carradori,
 Huniboldt, and Gartner, approach.            I am inclined to
 think that time and experience are still necessary to bring
 them to maturity.      This much, however, is certain, that to
 produce   such   phosphorescence several particular circum
 stances are neecssarv, otherwise this phænomenon would
 occur much oftener in nature.

                    G. J. Wright,       Esq.*
 J. he direct or indirect benefit of mankind is universally
allowed as the end of the creation of those various classes
of animated beings which inhabit our globe. Among these
some appear to be less entitled to arrangement under this
axiom than others ; or, in other words, the benefits to be
derived from a certain class may appear more than counter
balanced by the evils incurred by their ravages : but, happily
for us, the disproportionate increase of the various species
of such, and particularly of the more destructive, is in a
great measure prevented, not only by the indiscriminating
rapacity of animals whose superiority of rank carries certain
destruction wherever they haunt, but also by that wise pro
vision of nature, which, the more effectually to curtail the
diffusion of destructive animals, implants in other orders a
peculiar specific and native antipathy, prompting them to
unceasing warfare against such their appointed prey, whose
undue increase, if not by some appropriate method pre
vented, would in process of time probably depopulate the
world.
   As then (for reasons which it is not our province to ana
lyse) mankind are exposed to the ravages of such destruc
tive beings, we must necessarily allow that class as most to
be dreaded, against which we are acquainted with no effec
tual means ot opposition from other animals, not except
ing even man, who, though placed in the world as the lord
of the creation, unassisted by those skilful manipulations
in the arts by means of which he ranges unhurt amidst a
thousand dangers, actually becomes the prey of tribes over
which he is destined to rule.
   If the above precautions are necessary in an æra when the
greater part ot the globe is replete with inhabitants, how
much more requisite in the earlier ages, when, population
being at a low ebb, the continuance of the human race in
far separated climes may have hinged on the preservation of
a few, and that at a time when these scattered individuals
were unfurnished with the implements of security of which
modern improvements have put us in possession !
   And can we suppose for a moment, that while the in
crease of less hurtful creatures is limited by various means,

 left overlooked, and not provided against ? I say,       we asit'
 sent to such     supposition, we form
                     a                      chasm in zoological
                                                 a
 œconomy which the wisdom of nature throughout her va
 rious analogies stamps as unwarrantable.
    So important     query, one would imagine, would scarcely
                         a
 have been left undiscussed, as applicable to so formidable               a
 race of beings as the serpent tribe, against whose undue in
crease*, however desirable, no effectual bar seems to be
provided, no means of evasion successful, and against which
the opposition of other animals         attempted but to their
                                            is
certain fatality.
    In the primitive ages of the world, when the paucity of
mankind must have allowed of the unlimited extension of
all the classes of inferior beings    the tribes of the serpent
                                       f,
kind,      no natural means of opposition from other animals
            if
 were furnished, must have increased to an incalculable de
gree both in numbers and size.       Combining in themselves
at once insatiable rapacity with incredible abstinence, their
age and growth apparently unlimited, their amphibious na
ture allowing an extension of their ravages to the inhabit
ants of the watery element as well as those of the land, and
at the same time suffering them alike to evade the prema
ture view of their prev       with such noxious qualities they
                              ;
hold scale in the creation perhaps not less formidable than
        a
would appear the combined disadvantages of all other fero
cious beings. Nor can we suppose that the general deluge,
which at once destroyed the several tribes ot land animals,
at all diminished the numbers of the serpent kind. We have
no reason to conclude that amphibious animals were in
cluded       the ark any more than fish
             in                              and although na

of  the subsequent mixture of the quantity of rain which fell
during the awful crisis alluded to : but I am far from adopt
ing that opinion, although it would not militate against the
supposition above hazarded ; for, if a class of creatures not
included in the ark escaped the ravages of the deluge, it fol
lows that, if the same are still in existence, the waters which
composed the deluge, whether saline or not, did not prove
deleterious to them *.
     * The
            salubrity of water not depending on its containing salt, but on
 its continual agitation, my own opinion is, that the sea was scarce at all
 saline before the deluge ; and as it is necessary we should find some source
 for the saline matter therein contained, which the supposition of its rise
 from saline springs running into      or mines of salt under its bed,

wherever the external agents are most favourable to the putrefying pro
cess, there the sea   ismost salt; and this, as think, depending conjointly
                                                     I
on the greater evaporation which must needs happen wherever the tem
perature, as in hot climates,      most favourable to this process, together
                                     is
with the more speedy putrefaction of all animal and vegetable matters in
equatorial latitudes.    The deluge, in an indirect manner, was certainly
a   means of destruction of myriads of shell-fish,   which, imbedded in the
mire covering the surfare of the earth, were                 by
                                                          the induration of the

mixture of shells and earthy matters so frequently met with               but fish :
provided with fins to rise to the surface of the water, as also all that have
the faculty of swimming, could not be included in this general destruc
tion :  hence ihe tribes of serpents and water-snakes would not be dimi

                                                         ;
would present most formidable obstacle to the new peopling of the earth
                  a
after the deluge.     With regard to fresh- and saltwater fish, though the
former could not perhaps endure for         length of time so concentrated
                                                a                                                a
saline solution as    isour present ocean, yet we m.iy reasonably conclude
that both classes could exist in, and become naturalized to,          slightly sa
                                                                             a
turated mixture, as must of necessity have been the waters which com
posed the general deluge.

the decline of the deluge      ;and so far from the ocean being supplied from
mines and springs of salt,      1imagine the foimcr to be merely the pioduct
of filtration, during the very gradual subsidt nee of the waters of the de
luge into immense cavities, (which must needs have been found              the             by

             Conjectural Observations        on the Mammoth,                157
     If then the disproportionate extension of the serpent kind
 is not provided against by any known means, and we allow
as we do the superior necessity of some effectual restraint
to the same, it behoves us to attempt to define the probable
 structure and habits of the animal which should be best able
to quell this class of reptiles, not less prolific in themselves
than they are obnoxious to all other creatures.
    Such an one I presume to be the mammoth, whose stu
pendous appearance gives great air of probability that he is
destined to oppose a class of beings unconquerable by other
means. His allowed amphibious nature renders him a fit
opponent to the serpent tribe : the position and form of his
ribs, so well adapted to resist external pressure, render him
calculated to oppose this class of reptiles, whose efforts to
vanquish their prey are confined to attempts to entwine the
same, and crush, as they do by their convulsive writhings,
 the bodies of the largest animals we are at present acquainted
with. Nor can this strength, indicated in the position and
structure of the ribs of the mammoth, be supposed to be
for fitting him for resisting the pressure of water merely,
since many of the tribes of fishes which visit the deepest
parts of the ocean are unprovided with a similar barrier
                                                                               *
for that purpose ; at the same time that most of such as are
furnished with ribs have them barely more than cartilage.
    The tusks of the mammoth are admirably situated for
tearing up bushes and digging in morasses, the better to
dislodge his prey, the which if of shell-fish, as has been
suspected f, would doubtless exhibit his teeth more abraded
than they appear to be ; nor is there in our present suppo
sition concerning his diet any necessity for canine teeth,
the absence of which in the mammoth gives great counte
nance to the idea that his food has been of a more soft con
sistence than the muscular flesh of land animals : the short
ness of the neck would appear a wise provision in the case
   * Many fish are without ribs; such are rays, sharks, pipe-fish, sun-
fish, porcupine-fish,   lump-fish, &c. &c. — Cuvier, Comp. Anatomy.
    t  Several reasons lead me to object to the idea of fish being the ordinary
food of the mammoth.        Both shell and flat fish inhabiting solely the
water, the animal which might be designed to feed on such diet would
doubtless be an aquatic and not an amphibious animal.            In the class of
amphibia it is observable, that according as either the water or the land
is most genial to the habits of any one species of these, so does their
structure more or less verge toward that ot the fishy tribe, and the con
trary.    It therefore reasonably follows, that the anatomical structure of
the mammoth, if destined to Jive on fish, and of course in the water,
should approach more nearly to other of the aquatic class than its skeleton
appears to do.
                                                                              Of

  of its combating with the larger serpents, as the neck ap
  pears the only portion vulnerable in the mammoth by the
 writhings of those reptiles, which if perhaps not well de
 fended by the tusks of the former, might endanger its stran
 gulation : the prominent ridgy back, and allowance of con
 siderable motion on the part of the head, would certainly
 be favourable circumstances when viewed in the present
 light. Whether the hide of the mammoth may or may
 not have been susceptible of being pierced by the teeth of
 serpents I will not pretend to conjecture ; but if it were so,
 it is to be recollected that the bite of venomous serpents is
 dangerous in proportion as the animal bitten is more or less
 of a hot-blooded temperament * : hence the amphibious
 nature, together with the food of the mammoth, rendering
 him a cola-blooded animal, sits him still better as the op
 ponent of the serpent tribe. Tis most probable, that as the
 quickness of sight in serpents is even proverbial, the enemy
 of these formidable reptiles would be endowed with equal
 perfection in some other organ the better to search them out :
 perhaps the notorious odour of the majority of serpents will
 warrant us in concluding that the organs of smell would
 be destined for that purpose.        As a serpent when desirous
 of evading the view of its natural enemy would most pro
 bably retreat to the neighbouring swamps, burying himself
 with all possible speed therein, so the latter should be ca-
         of exerting a considerable degree of activity for at
  east a short space of time; and in this respect also the
{>able
 mammoth well corresponds.
    With regard to the strength of the opponent of this
tribe of deleterious creatures, we must at once see the pro
priety of it ; but referring to his bulk, it certainly appears
not so immediately necessary, were it not that, upon more
mature consideration, it seems requisite that this opponent
of the serpent kind should feed on the flesh of the same ;
otherwise the putrefying carcases of so bulky a class of be
ings as many of these are, would prove perhaps as delete
rious to the inhabitants of the vicinity, human or brutal, as
though their destruction had not taken place ; not to men
tion also the necessity of his feeding on some such kind of
diet to stamp him as a cold-blooded amphibious animal :
otherwise he would not be adapted for the purposes of his
creation, nor could he under contrary circumstances feed on
the flesh of the venomous classes without deadly hazard.

the serpent tribe, it may be asked, why is he not in exist
ence at this time for the same purpose ? why is he peculiar
to the new world, while serpents have always alike abounded
throughout the globe? and whence comes it that the re
mains ot* the mammoth have been usually found in higher
latitudes than are congenial to the constitution of the ma
jority of the serpent tribe ? In reply to these queries I ob
 serve, that we have no proof that the mammoth is not at
this present time in existence, although in situations remote
 from the view of man, as the classes of serpents are also ob
 served to retreat in proportion as the population of the cli
 mates they inhabit increases. But admitting that the mam
 moth has become extinct for some centuries, it argues not
 against the present conjectures ; for like instances have oc
 curred in other classes *, and this especially, as, however
 important the restraining of the propagation of the serpent
 kinds might have been in the earlier ages, it has been much
 less so in subsequent periods, when mankind have little to
 fear from the ravages of the brute creation.
     Yet I confess I suppose the mammoth to be now in ex
 istence in the north-west parts of America, and perhaps
 equally savage and unpeopled regions of the old world ; but
 till forced by famine to quit the accustomed haunts of his
 prey we must not expect to be visited by him : nor need
 we wonder that no accounts of such a formidable being
 have been handed down to us, as it is probable that few,
 and those perhaps the most ignorant and superstitious of
 savages of former times, ever witnessed the sight, of this
 stupendous animal.
     That the mammoth is peculiar to America is solely a con
jecture.     Till minute investigation warranted a contrary in
 formation, the various huge bones which have been at times
 discovered in different parts of the world have been uni
                                        f
 formly referred to the elephant ; the which, if more care
 fully examined, would doubtless many of them be found to
 belong to the mammoth class.              The bones of elephants,
 bears, whales, &c. &c. have been found in territories foreign
 to their temperament % ; so also those of the mammoth may
 doubtless be expected to be found in most climates of the
 world.
     That the remains of the mammoth should be met with
 in latitudes higher than the usual haunts of his prey, as sup
 posed in the case of serpents, is not to be wondered at ; for
 an animal., unless worn out with age, or prematurely de-

160       Conjectural Observations   on the Mammoth.
stroyed, must not be expected to die in the midst of plenty.
But, in fact,   the serpent tribe inhabit every climate more or
less : hence it is probable that the rapacity of the mammoth,
no longer to be satisfied with the sparing diffusion of the
serpent class in the tropical countries, which for a lapse of
time had supplied them with their, perhaps, only diet, re
duced by their ravages to almost perfect extinction, induced
the mammoth to visit regions unfavourable to his constitu
tion, or at least to that of his prey : hence, in process
of time, the class would be, perhaps, wholly annihilated
through want of food, and the ills of an inhospitable cli
mate. But such as have lately been found on the banks of
the Ohio must indubitably have perished there through
some sudden and unnatural cause, perhaps a partial deluge
or hurricane; for, if an animal dies by natural causes, the
carcase remaining on the'surface of the earth putrefies and
disappears, the skeleton only remaining, which in its turn
also moulders away, leaving the teeth, as the portions which
longest resist the action of air and moisture : but so small
a substance as a tooth of the mammoth, especially if lying
in swamps and morasses, may long escape detection, even
till such time as the decomposition of its constituent parts
leaves no further trace of its original form.
    Thus, the mammoth may have existed in the old world as
well as the new, although its remains should never have been
found in the former: a circumstance, as above affirmed, de
pendent on the nature of the soil and situation of the place
wherein the same may have perished, conjointly with the
manner in which its destruction may have happened. Thus,
if the period of the mammoth be referred to some centuries
back, we cannot expect to find its remains except in situ
ations unfavourable to the process of decay ; that        is,
                                                           totally
defended from the action or external agents     : of course such
only must be expected to be met with as have perished in
warmer climates      by some convulsion of nature, or in those
frigid  regions  where  putrefaction is  unknown.
    But now that naturalists are perfectly convinced of the
existence of the mammoth, the remains of huge animals,
will not, as formerly, be referred to the elephant tribe with
out more accurate examination; the result of which will,
in  my humble opinion, prove that the mammoth has existed
in most climates of the world holding
                                ;           a  scale in the crea
tion not less beneficial to the animal world at large, than     il
lustrative of those wise dispositions of the Creator which at
 once draw forth our admiration and gratitude.

XXVs. Catalogue of Animals belonging to the Class Vermes,
 found on the Coasts of Scotland. By Robert Jameson,

  ber of the Royal Irish Academy, &c*
 JL he animals belonging to the class vermes, although
holding so low a rank in the animal kingdom, are in many
respects deserving of our particular attention.     Firs*) they
point out to us the intimate connection that exists between
the animal and vegetable kingdoms.        It has been supposed
by many naturalists, that the most perfect plants, and the
least perfect animals, form the link by whicn these two great
classes of organic beings are connected together. On a nearer
examination, however, we discover that their greatest ap
proximation is in the lowest members of each class ; in the
vermes of the cue, and the cryptogatnia of the other.
   2dly, By tracing the difference of their structure, from
the most simple of all the monas to the more complicated
rnollusta, many curious anatomical discoveries have been
made; and there is reason for believing that the study of
their œconomy will throw light on philosophy.
   3dlv, Bv an extensive and critical acquaintance with the
animals of tins class, the geognost will be enabled to deter
mine many of the petrifactions he meets with ; and this know
ledge w illalso, when other data fail, enable him to determine
with certainty to what formation the rocks that contain
these petrifactions belong.
   On the natural history of the British vermes little has
been written.     Pennant's outline contained in his British
Zoology, and Ellis's excellent treatise on Corallines, are           al
most the only works that treat professedly on this subject.
Dr. Shaw,     by means of his interesting work The Natu
ralist's Miscellany, has contributed much in exciting       taste

for such inquiries; and        to be hoped that the concluding

mical analysis of several has been very ably executed by
Mr. Hatchet, as detailed in his masterly memoirs in the
London Transactions.

   It is interesting to observe the gradation from the coarse
tube of the animals of this genus through all the varieties
of more regular form observable in other mollusca, and in
many insects, to the finished cell of the bee. Dr. Steffens is
of opinion that these different figures are caused by the cry
stallization of the exuded matter. The reader is referred for

that the frigate Astigarraga, which was not to set out before
the end of a fortnight, has hastened her departure for Cadiz,
and will sail this very night.       This is the first opportunity
we have had during five months of writing to Europe from
the solitude of the South Seas; and the want of time ren
ders it impossible for me to write as I ought to the National
Institute, which has given me the most affecting maiks of
the interest and kindness with which it honours me.           A few
days before my departure from Quito for Jaen and the river
Amazon, I received the letter dated Pluviose 9th, addressed
to me, through you, by that illustrious bodv. This letter
employed two years to reach me in the Cordillera of the
Andes : 1 received it the clay after a second excursion which
I made to the crater of the volcano of Pinchineha to carry
thither a Volta's electrometer, and to measure the diameter
of    it,
        which     found to be 752 toises, while that of Vesu

        is

  dried.   Dr. Mutis, who showed me a thousand marks of
  kindness, and for whose sake I went up the river in forty
  days, gave me a manuscript of nearly a hundred magnifi
  cent drawings representing new genera, and new species of
  his Flora of Bogota.    I have thought that this collection,
 as interesting to botany as remarkable for the beauty of the
 colouring, could not be in better hands than in those of
 Jussieu, Lamarck, and Desfontaines ; and I have presented
 it to the National Institute as a small mark of my attach
 ment. This collection and cinchona were sent on for Car-
 thagena of the Indies about the month of June this year ;
 and Dr. Mutis took upon him to transmit them to Paris.
 A third letter for the Institute was dispatched from Quito
 with a geological collection of the productions of Pinchin-
 cha, Catopaxi, and Chimborazo.         It is distressing to re
 main under a melancholy uncertainty in regard to the ar
 rival of those objects, as well as to that of the collection of
 rare seeds, which three years ago I addressed to the Jardin
 des Plant es at Paris.
    Want of time at present will not allow me to give you an
 account of my travels and occupations since our return from
 Rio Negro.      You know that at the Havannah we received
 the false intelligence of the departure of captain Baudin for
 Buenos Ayres.      Faithful to the promise which I made of
joining him wherever I could, and persuaded that I should
 be more useful to the sciences by uniting my labours to
 those of the naturalists who accompanied captain Baudin,
 I did not hesitate a moment to sacrifice the little glory of
 finishing my own expedition ; and I immediately freighted
 a small vessel to Bataban, that I might proceed to Cartha-
 gena of the Indies.      This short passage was lengthened
 more than a month by stormy weather; the winds had
 ceased in the South Seas, where I expected to find captain
 Baudin ; and I entered on the difficult route to Quito by
 Honda, Ibasue, the passage of the mountain of Quindin,
 Popayan, and Pastos. My health continued in a wonderful
 manner to withstand the change of temperature to which one
 is exposed in this route, descending every day from snowy
 regions of 2460 toises in height to scorching valleys where
 the thermometer does not fall below 26"' or 24°.      My com
 panion Bonpland, whose knowledge, courage, and immense
 activity were of great assistance to me in mv botanical re
 searches and comparative anatomy, was afflicted for two
 months with a tertian fever.     The season of the great rains
 came upon- us in the most critical passage, the high plain
 of Pastos, and after a journey of eight months we arrived
                               L4                             at

at Quito, where we learned that captain Baudin had pur
sued his voyage from west to east by the Cape of Good
Hope.     Accustomed to misfortunes, wo consoled ourselves
with the idea of having made so great sacrifices for an in
tention of doing good : casting our eyes on our herbals, our
barometric and geodc.se measurements, our drawings, and
our experiments on the air of the Cordillera, we did not
regret our having traversed that country, a great part of
which has never been visited by any naturalists.      We were
sensible that man ought never to depend on any thing but
what is produced by his own encray. The province of
Quito, the highest land in the world, and torn by the grand
catastrophe of the 4th of February 1797, furnished us with
a vast field for physical, observations.   Volcanoes so enor
mous, the flames of which often rise to the height of 500
toises, have never been able to produce a drop of liquid
lava; they vomit up fire, sulphurous hydrogen gas, mud,
and carbonated     argil.   Since 1797 this whole part of the
world has been in agitation ; we every moment rx^erience
frightful shocks, and the subterranean noise in the plains
of Kio Bamba resembles that of a mountain cn.mbling
to pieces under our feet.      The atmospheric air and moist
ened earth (all these volcanoes arc in decomposed porphyry)
 appear to be the grand agents of these combustions and
these subterranean fermentations.
    It has hitherto been believed at Quito that C4 70 toises
is the greatest height at which men could resist the rarity
of the air. In the month of March lb02 we spent some
days in the large plains which surround the volcano of An-
tisana at 2107 fathoms, where the oxen, when hunted,
often vomit up blood.       On the lrith of March we found
put a passage over the snow, a gentle acclivity, on which
we ascended to the height of 2773 toises.        The air there
 contained O'OOS of carbonic acid, 0-218 of oxygen, and
 0-774 of azote.    Reaumur's thermometer was only at 15";
it was not at all cold, but the blood issued from our lips and
eyes.    The situation did not permit me to make a trial of
Borda's compass but in a grotto lower down at the height
of 2-167 toises : the intensity of the magnetic forces was
greater at that height than at Quito in the ratio of 230 to
218 : but it must not be forgotten that the number of oscil
lations often increases when the inclination decreases, and
that this intensity is increased by the mass of the mountain,
the porphyry of which affects the magnet.       In the expedi
tion I undertook on the 2.'id of June 1S02 to Chimborazo,
we proved that with patience it is possible to sustain a
                                                        greats

         Letter from    M. Humloldt   to C.  Del amir es.      169
 greater  rarity of the air. We ascended 500 toises higher
 than Condamine (on Carazon), and on Chimborazo we
 carried our instruments to the height of vS031 toises, where
 we saw the barometer fall to 13 inches 11-2 lines : the ther
 mometer was at 1-3° below zero. We still bled at the lips j
 our Indians deserted us as usua1 : C.Eonpland, andM.Mon-
 tufar, son of the marquis de Salvalegre of Ouito, were the
 only persons who remained. We all experienced an unea
 siness, debilitv, and desire to vomit, which certainly arose
 as much from the want of oxvgen in these regions as from
 the raiity of the air.   At that immense height 1 found only
 0*20 of oxygen.        A frightful chasm prevented us from
 reaching the summit of Chimborazo, of which we were
 within 236 toises.      You know that a great uncertainty still
 prevails in regard to the height of this colossus, which La
 Condamine measured onlv at a very great distance, assign
ing to it the height of nearly 3220 toises, w hereas Don Juan
makes it 3380 toises ; nor does this difference arise from the
different heights which these astronomers adopted for the
signal of Cavabura. I measured in the plain oi'Tapia a base
of 1702 metres.      Pardon me if I speak sometimes of toises
and sometimes of metres, according to the nature of my in
struments.      You ' now that in publication every thing may
be reduced to the metre and centigrade thermometer.          Two
geodosic operations gave me for Chimborazo 3267 toises
above the level of the sea ; but the calculations must be recti
fied bv the distances of the sextant from the ai tificial horizon
and by other circumstances.        The volcano of Tunguragua
has decreased a great deal since the time of La Condamine:
instead of 2620 toises I found no more than 2531 ; and, in
my opinion, this does not arise from an error in the opera
tions, because in my measures of Cayambe, Antisana, Co-
topaxi, and Iliniza, I seldom differ ten or siiteen toises"
from the results of La Condamine and Jiouguer.            The in
habitants of these unfortunate countries alt say that Tungu
ragua has visibly decreased in height : on the other hand, I
find that Cotopaxi, which has been subject to such immense
explosions, is of the same height as in 1 744, or rather
somewhat higher,        But the stony summit of Cotopaxi in
dicates that ft is a chimney, which resists and retains its
figure. The operations we made from January to July in
the Andes of Ouito gave to their inhabitants the dismal in
telligence that the crater of Pinchincha, which La Conda
mine saw full of snow, burns again ; and that Chimborazo,
which was thought to be so peaceable and innocent, has
been a volcano, and perhaps will one day be so again. We
                                                           found.

. found   burnt rocks and pumice-stone at the height of 303 !
  toises.   It will be unfortunate for the human race if the
 volcanic fire, for it may be said that the whole high land
 of Quito is one volcano with several summits, should force
 a passage through Chimborazo.          It has often been said
 that this mountain is granite, but a single atom of it is not
 to be found : it is porphyry, here and there disposed in
 columns inclosing vitreous feld-spar, corncerre and oli-
 vin.     This stratum of porphyry is 1900 toises in thickness.
 On this subject I could mention a polarizing porphyry
 which we discovered at Voisaco near Pasto ; a porphyry
 which, analogous to the serpentine I described in the Jour
 nal de Physique, has poles without attraction.          I might
 mention other facts relative to the grand law of the paral
 lelism of the strata, and of their enormous thickness near
 the equator : but this is too much for a letter, which perhaps
 will be lost ; and besides, I shall recur to this subject an
 other time : I shall only add, that besides the elephants
 teeth which we sent to C. Cuvier from the land of Santa-
 Fe, 1350 toises in height, we have preserved for him others
 more beautiful ; some of the carnivorous elephant, and
 others of a species a little different from those of Africa,
 brought from the valley of Timana, the town of Ibarra,
 and trom Chili.      Here then we have confirmed the exist
 ence of that carnivorous monster from the river Ohio from
  50° northern latitude to 35° south latitude.    I spent a very
 agreeable   time  at Quito.  The  president of  audience   baron
 de Carondelet loaded us with kindness, and for three years
 I have not once had reason to complain of the agents of the
 Spanish government, which have every where treated me
 with a delicacy and distinction of which I must ever retain
 a grateful remembrance.      How much the times and man
 ners have changed ! I have paid particular attention to the
 pyramids and their foundation, which I do not think at all
 deranged in regard to the mill-stones (pierres molaires). A
 generous individual, a friend to the sciences, and to those men
 who have done honour to them, such as La Condamine,
 ( jodin, and Bouguer, the marquis de Salvalegre, at Quito*
 thinks of reconstructing them ; but this leads me too far.
     After passing Assonay and Cuenca, where they gave us
 bull-fights, we pursued our way by the Oxa to complete
 our labours on cinchona.       We then spent a month in the
 province of Jaen de Bracamorros and among the Pongos of
 the river Amazon, the banks of which are ornamented with
 the andiva and bumnvillœa of Jussieu;       It appeared to me
 of importance to fix the longitude of Tomependa and Chu-

 neous plants, on which C. Bonpland has made                very ex
                                                                 a
  tensive work.      We have at present 3764 very complete de
  scriptions      Latin, and nearly
                      in                 third more of plants in
                                               a
  herbals which for want of time        we   have not been able to
  describe.     Of every vegetable     we  can   indicate the rock
  ¦where     resides, and the height in toises at which
             it                                               grows

  so that       our manuscripts will be found very correct ma
                 in

  and Bonpland have often described the same plant sepa
  rately. But two-thirds and more of the descriptions belong
  to the assiduity of Bonpland alone, whose zeal and devo
  tion for the sciences cannot be too much admired. Jussieu,
  Pesfcntaines, and Lamarck, have in him formed                 pupil  a
                                                                 who

 who will do great things.       We compared our herbals with
 those of Dr. Mutis, and we consulted a great many books
 in the immense library of that great man. We are con
vinced that we have a e;reat many new genera and species,
but much time and labour will be required to determine
what is really new. We shall bring with us also a siliceous
substance analogous to the taba.scher of the East Indies,
which M. Mace has analysed.            It exists in the knots of a
gigantic gramineous plant which is confounded with the
 uambou, but which in its flower differs from the bambusa
of Schreiber. I do not know whether Fourcroy has re
ceived the milk of the vegetable cow, a tree so called by the
Indians.      It is a milk which when treated with nitric acid
gave me a caout-chouc of a balsamic odour, but which, in
stead of being caustic and hurtful like all vegetable milks,
is nourishing, and agreeable to drink.           We discovered it
in the road to Oronoko, in a plantation, where the negroes
drink a great deal of it.        I have sent also to Fourcroy by
the wav of Guadaloupe, as well as to sir Joseph Banks by
Trinidad, our      dapiche, or white oxygenated caout-chouc,
which exudes from the roots of a tree in the forests of Pi-
michin in the most remote corner of the world towards the
sources of the Rio Negro,
    I shall not go to the Philippines. I shall proceed to Eu
rope by Acapulco, Mexico, and the Havannah ; and I hope
to have the pleasure of seeing you at Paris in September or
October 1803.

XXVIII.      .Account  of the Marine Spencer for the Preservation
    of Lives in Cases    of Shipwreck or other Occidents at Sea.
    By Knight Spencer, Esq. of Bread-street, Cheapside.
F or     this invention, which seems likely to be of great uti
lity, the Koval Humane Society were pleased to award to
Mr. Knight their honorary silver medallion on the 25th of
March     1603.
                             Explanation.
    A (Plate IV.)    is a girdle of a diameter to sit the body, six
inches broad, composed of about 800 old tavern corks,
strung upon a strong twine, well lashed together with lay
                                                             cordji

                       On the Electric Fluid.                     1 73
cord, covered with canvas, and painted in oil, so as to
make it water-proof.
     BB are tapes or cords about two feet long fastened to
the back of the girdle with loops at the ends.
     C is another tape or cord about three feet long, in the
middle of which a few corks are strung, covered with can
vas, and painted as above.
     D is a pin of hard wood three inches long and half an
inch diameter, fastened to the front of the girdle by a tape
or cord about two inches long.
     E  the same.
     When the marine      spencer is to be used, slide it from the
feet   close  up under   the arms ; bring the tapes or cords B B
one over each shoulder, and fasten them by the loops to the
pin D; bring the tape or cord C between the legs, and fasten
 it to the pin E.
     A person thus equipped, though unacquainted with swim
ming, may safely trust himself to the waves; for he will
float head and shoulders above water in any storm, and by
 paddling with his hands may easily gain the shore.
     N. B. A marine spencer constructed as above, and co
 vered with strong canvas unpainted, will have nearly the
 same buoyancy, though more liable to damage from the
 effects of sea water.
                  XXIX.     On the Electric   Fluid*.
   JL he hypothesis of the electric phænomena being caused
 by two fluids is now nearly given up for the more simple
 one of a single fluid. Cavallo in his Treatise on Electricity,
 4th edit. vol. i. p. 106, 107, says: " When a body does
 not show any electrical appearances, it is then supposed to
  contain its natural quantity of electric fluid (but whether
  that quantity bears any proportion to the quantity of matter
  in general or not, is uncertain, and therefore that body is
  said to be in its natural or non-electrified state) : but if a
  body shows any electrical appearances, it is then said to be
  electrified, and it is supposed that it has either acquired an
  additional quantity of electric fluid, or that it has lost some
  of its natural share. A body having received an additional
  quantity of electric fluid is said to be overcharged, or posi
  tively electrified ; and a body that has lost part of its natural
  quantity of electric fluid is said to be undercharged, or nega
             * Communicated  by a Friend to Physical Inquiries.
                                                                tively

                          electricians, and      probably true as far
                                                          is is

    it       :
electrical effects do not only depend on an additional quan
tity in one ca.=e, and      /<?« of the fluid in the other, but on
                                 a

and rarefaction (including dilatation) of the fluid, the con
densed state beine what         usually called the positive or plus,
                                     is
and the rarefied    the negative or minus state.                   If
                                                         the electric
fluid be,   as     commonly thought,
                  is                         elastic, there      little      is
doubt   but  that,  when    an   additional  quantity     thrown    ortis
to   a body,      suffers
                 it        compression      and,  on ;the   contrary,
when     portion
         a             taken away, that the remaining fluid
                       is                                                         if
dilated.   With non-elastic substances        state of condensa
                                                             a
tion, or rather density, may exist without compression       and,            ;
on the contrary, rarefaction without dilatation,       the parti       if
cles of such matter are of different sizes    for suppose    ;box             a
were filled with wooden balls of an inch diameter, there
would be manv vacancies between, which might be filled
up with smaller balls, and the bulk not increased            here            :
would be density without compression       take the small balls
                                                         :
awav, and there will be rarefaction without dilatation. Tbi»
case we can hardly suppose to exist amongst elastic sub
stances, though certainly possible,      each of the particles

were at their greatest state of compression or dilatation, and
were of different magnitudes.
   In the Philosophical Magazine, vol. xii. p. 186, an optical
experiment was suggested which might perhaps give some
insight into the two electric states     hitherto there do not
                                                     :
seem any decisive experiments which determine the state of
the course of the electric fluid.   In order to illustrate the
hypothesis here advanced, let the conductor which           con              is
nected to the cushion, commonly called the negative con
ductor, and the other, or positive conductor, be compared
to the receiver of common (rarefying) air pump and the
                       a
receiver of  acondensing machine (or condensing air pump,
as  itmight be called), fcoth united, as they sometimes are,
on one frame here, whilst the air in one receiver
                 :                                          rare             is
fied, in the  other    becomes
                            it   condensed.            according  It   is,
to the opinion now brought forward, the equilibrium of
condensation and compression, not simply of quantity, which
produces the shock, the spark, and other electrical effects.
   Would not the terms supplying conductor and receiving
conductor be preferable to positive and negative conductor?
Perhaps electrical supph/er and receiver alone would be suffi
cient when sncakinsi °f the machine.

                           Arts, &c.
    BATAVIAN SOCIETY OF THE SCIENCES AT HAARLEM.
 JL his society held its fifty-first yearly general meeting on
the 21st of May, and, after examining the answers sent in
to prize questions since the last meeting, resolved to continue
the following to which no answers had been received :
    1st, What light has the new chemistry thrown on our
knowledge of the nature of the human body ?
    2d, How far have physicians, in consequence of the
light thrown on the nature of the human body by the new
chemistry, become better acquainted than before with the
nature and causes of certain diseases ? and what conse
quences, more or less confirmed by experience and useful to
the practice of medicine, can be thence deduced ?
    3a, How far has the new chemistry made physician*
fully acquainted with the action of certain medicines which
have either been long used or lately recommended ? and what
advantages arise from this knowledge in the treatment of
 certain diseases ?
    As some celebrated philosophers, in their application of
the fundamental principles of the new chemistry to the
knowledge of the human body, to diseases and to the cure
of them, have indulged too much in hypothesis not found
ed on experience ; and as great injury must thereby arise to
 the practice of medicine, to which the new chemistry seems
 to promise so much advantage, provided Lavoisier's rule of
 admitting nothing in it which is not founded on experience
 be observed ; the society requires that, in answering these
three questions, a distinction will be made between what is
fully proved and what rests on weak grounds, and that the
uncertainty of the latter only will be briefly pointed out.
    4th, How far are the causes of the corruption of stag
nant water known? And from what is already known and
 can be proved on the subject, what are the best and least
 hurtful means which can be employed to preserve stagnant
 water from corruption ?
    The answers to these questions are to be sent in before
 the 1 st of November, 1804.
    The following questions are again proposed to be an
 swered before the 1st of January, 1804:
    A natural history and description of whales, to serve as
 the means of tracing out the places where these animals
 are to be found j together with the safest and best methods

   either already known or practised, or which can be brought
   into practice, to kill them with the grea est speed and safety.
      To be answ ered before the 1st ot N >vember, 1 S04 :
      I. How far can the meteorological observations made in
  the Netherlands serve for acquiring a knowledge of the
  nature of the winds of these countries ? which are the most
  prevalent winds ? what is their regular or general succes
  sion ? from what previous circumstances can the inhabit
  ants on some occasions, and with any degree of certainty,
  foretel changes of the winds ? and what influence have they
  in general or sometimes on changes of the weather ?
      II. An accurate nomenclature of the mammalia, birds,
  and amphibia, not formerly introduced, which are found in
  the Netherlands,       with their synonyms and the charac
 teristic marks of the species and genera arranged according
 to the Linnæan system, with an indication of one or more
 of the best figures of each animal.
     The following is proposed in consequence of the fund
 established by the late director, N. W. Kops:
      III. As it is of great importance to the diffusion of each
 branch of natural knowledge to have the principal truth9
 of it briefly and clearly exposed, the society requires that,
 from the great number of writings on the action of the
 Voltaic pile, whether given in journals or other periodical
 works, an essay may be composed containing an account of
 what has been learned in regard to the Voltaic pile and the
 experiments made with it.
     The following questions are still proposed to be answered
 under the usual conditions :
     For an unlimited period.
     I. What have we been taught by experience in regard to
 the utility of some animals which appear to be noxious,
 and especially in the Netherlands ? and what precautions
 are to be employed in order to extirpate them ?
     II. What indigenous plants, hitherto not tried, can be
 employed w ith advantage in the materia medica in the room
of exotic plants ?
     III. What indigenous vesretabks, never yet used, can be
employed as wholesome and cheap food? and what foreign
vegetables, not used in this country, can be introduced tor
the same purpose ?
     IV. What indigenous plants, not yet used, are capable,
according to well established proofs, of furnishing good
dve-sturls, which can be prepared and employed with ad
vantage? and what exotics, fit for the same purpose, can be
introduced and cultivated on waste land with advantage?

French, Latin, or German (but not in German characters),
accompanied with a scaled billet containing the author's

   It must be highly gratifying to the lovers of the fine arts,
to those who know their powerful influence on the public
mind, to be informed that a society of engravers has been
formed under the immediate patronage of his royal high
ness the prince of Wales.    To alleviate the misfortunes and
miseries resulting from sickness and the decays of nature,
is the immediate object of the institution; and we have no
doubt but the funds arising from the subscriptions of
artists, aided by the support which it merits, and will no
doubt obtain, not only from the lovers of the arts, but from
those who entertain liberal and enlarged views of the true
interests of their country, will prove equal to the support of
 those who, in spite of their exertions, may need such aid.
    To the public this institution promises the most solid
 advantages ; advantages impossible to be commanded by
 any other means. Talent, energy, and power, with the pe
 culiar acquirements and excellencies of each artist in each
line, united and concentrated in single productions, must
give them a degree of excellence which could never be ob
tained from insulated talents, however splendid, and (must
increase in proportion the commercial interests of the
country.
   The institution had its first anniversary dinner on Wed
nesday, the 6th of July, at the Crown and Anchor, in the
Strand.     It was numerously and respectably attended, and
the afternoon was spent amidst that social enjovment which
arises from a mutual interchange of sentiments enlivened by
genius, and polished and corrected by taste.       Great har
mony prevailed during the whole evening, and the company
separated highly gratified with the result of their meeting,
and animated by the hope of that success to which, by their
laudable exertions, they are so well entitled.

  Notice of the Labours of the Mathematical and Physical
         Class of the Sciences since the last Public Silting.
     The name of tautochrones is given to curves in which
  the oscillations of a heavy body are always of the same
  duration, whatever maybe their extent. Tautochrones have
  been rendered celebrated by the labours of the greatest
  geometricians, who have successively endeavoured to over
  come the difficulties exhibited by the different hvpotheses
  which may be formed in regard to the laws of gravity and
  resistance.   But though their formulae had all the gene
  rality possible, they sought only for plane tautochrones,
  while for each hypothesis there exist an infinite number
  which are of a double curvature.
     An examination of these new tautochrones, and their re
  lation wilh plane tautochrones, form the object of a me
  moir by C. Biot. From a consideration of the formulæ
  the author has deduced some theorems remarkable For their
  simplicity. But whatever may be their elegance or novelty,
  we shall not enter into any detail respecting a matter so ab
  stract, that Bossut in his Essay on the History of the Ma
  thematics thought it his duty to give an exculpation of
  those geometricians who have employed their powers and
  their genius on these problems, which are merely theoreti
  cal. Nothing can be added to the solidity of the reasons
  which he adduces in favour of these speculations, which on
  the first view appear barren, but which in the end may be
  epplied to useful purposes. But this may be rendered more
  sansible by a striking example. When the antient geo
  metricians were endeavouring with so much care to disco
                                                              ver

                    French National Institute.                1 79
ver all the properties of the conic sections, and when Apol-
lonius made them the subject of a profound treatise, the
books of which have been long regretted, and which have
not been handed down to us; might not the same reproach
of the loss of time in meditations which might have been
better employed, have been addressed to them ? Who could
then foresee the numerous applications which have been
made of these curves to several branches of the mathema
tics? and who could suspect that the ellipsis is the figure of
all the planetary orbits ?
    Of the most useful elementary problems, none has re
ceived more solutions than that the object of which is to
correct the apparent distances of the moon from the sun
and stars, in order to deduce from it the longitude at sea.
This problem is not irideed very difficult; but it is of daily
use, and those who have occasion to employ it are not al
ways well versed in calculation : on this account, the easiest
approximations sufficiently exact for practice have been
substituted for the rigorous methods. The subject was
thought to be exhausted, and yet very simple considera
tions, which never before occurred to any one, have fur
nished C. Legendre with an entirely new solution.             His
formula possesses a remarkable symmetry, which serves to
engrave it on the memory.        Nothing was wanting but a
little brevity in the calculation ; and the author has found
means to give it this merit by including in two tables se
veral terms, the suppression of which shortens the opera
tion a third.     Other known formulae possessed the latter
advantage; but the new solution has, above all others, the
merit ot elegant symmetry; which ought to be considered of
great importance, since it contributes to facilitate the ope
ration.
    If the phænomena of the tides were subjected only to
the combined action of the sun and moon, they might be
predicted with the same precision as the celestial phæno
mena. With a few data obtained by observation, one
might announce before-hand, both the exact moment and
the precise elevation     of the waves.    The action of the
winds, which will doubtless »al way 3 escape our calculation,
may serve indeed to account for the principal and periodi
cal causes of the tides : but it at least modifies their effects ;
it can increase or diminish, accelertta or retard them ; and
if the sun and moon shall happen to be so placed as to
produce the strongest tide, and if the wind conspire also to
raise the waters, they may then produce extraordinary in
undations, of which it is of importance to be forewarned

in order that the   necessary  precautions may be taken.      It
is on -this account that for some    time  the Connoissante  des
 Terns has announced for all the new and full moons the
 force of the tides, abstracting from every local and acci
 dental circumstance.      The tides of Ventose and Germinal
 last were announced     as  about to be the highest in the
 course of the year.    They attracted the attention of ob
 servers and of the curious.    If the expectation of the latter
was not fully answered, the former had reason to be more
 satisfied. These tides, indeed, were the highest of any re
 membered : but the atmosphere was calm; and consequently
none of those accidents, the possibility of which only was
 foreseen, could take place. C. Rochon communicated to
 the class what he observed at Brest, and C. Septfontaines
 has transmitted to us what he saw at Calais.      Their notices
 induced C. Laplace to read a memoir; at the conclusion of
which the class, sensible of the necessity of a series of ob
 servations made at different ports, and according to an
uniform method, appointed a commission charged with
drawing up instructions proper for serving as a guide to
observers.
    The report of the commission has been printed, to be
distributed in the ports. The ministers have promised to
give their orders; and the series of observations destined to
make known what part of the phænomena of the tides de
pends on periodical and general causes, and what depends
on local or accidental causes, will soon be begun.
    The new planets discovered by Piazzi and Olbers conti
nue to engage the attention of astronomers.            Notwith
standing the smallness of the arc which they have passed
through in our sight, and notwithstanding the consider
able perturbations which they experience       from Jupiter, we
have already obtained the elements of their orbits with suf
ficient precision to find again these bodies in the place in
dicated by calculation, when they become visible, after hav
ing been several months lost in the rays of the sun. The
greatest difficulty arises from their extreme         smallness,
which sometimes causes us to doubt whether we have them
in the field of the telescope.      This is .true in recard to
Pallas in particular, which appears sometimes like a star of
the 10th and 11th, or even the 12th magnitude, while
Ceres appears of the 7th or 81 h.       But as there is some
thing too arbitrary in this distribution of the stars accord
ing to ihe order of their magnitudes, it will be better to
say with Messier, that Pallas is the smallest object that can
be distinguished with an excellent telescope.

    An extraordinary circumstance     has given to this imper
ceptible  star  for  a moment  a  more   sensible diameter ar.d a
stronger light.      On  the 28th  of  May,   the weather being
very  fine,  C.  Messier   was surprised   to  find in it a light
doable to that which it had before ; and yet, according to
calculation, the distances of the sun and moon being
nearly the same, the brightness of the planet ought not to
have changed.       The cause of this appearance was soon dis
covered.    The small planet in its course met with a star, to
which it appeared to be so close that the least interval could
not be observed between them.         Forty-two minutes after,
a separation took place, and, according to the known mo
tion of the planet, the interval must have been \b". The
position of the small star may be determined at leisure ; and
from the repeated observations which may be made of                  it,
there will result for the moment of the observation of
Messier   a    determination of the place of the planet more
exact than any of those which could have been procured in
a   direct manner.       Those observations known under the
name of appulses are exceedingly rare.         However numerous
the small stars may appear, the intervals which they leave
between them are sufficiently large for the planets to make
the tour of the heavens without concealing one of them, or
at least any of those which can be observed.            The moon,
however, ought to eclipse some           of  them   every day :   but
their faint light becomes extinct on the approach of                 a
Stronger light and the observation of these eclipses
                ;                                              is  too
difficult and too uncertain to induce astronomers to attend
to them  :    they pay no attention but to stars of the 4th or
5th magnitude, and below.
   The arc of the meridian employed           by the French astro
nomers for determining the fundamental unity of the me
tric system was the greatest ever measured.            C. Mechain,
during    his  residence   in Spain,  remarked   that it  could still
be extended two degrees        by  forming   two  triangles,  which
touching     the  coast of  Spain between   Barcelona  and   Tortosa
should terminate at the islands of Majorca and Ivica. The
difficulty was to measure the angles, and perceive in                a
telescope not half   a   metre in length signals at the distance
of two hundred miles. These observations could succeed
only under the most favourable and consequently the
rarest circumstances;       they could not be attempted but in
the middle of winter, and then they could have been at
tended only with half success.         C. Mechain found himself
obliged to abandon       a   project highly interesting, the plan
of which was already drawn up. The reciprocal disposi-

tions of France and Spain were not then sufficiently ami
cable to allow us to flatter ourselves with the hope of ob
taining that aid and concert indispensably necessary for
operations so difficult ; but these dispositions having hap
pily changed, the French government gave orders tor the
continuation of our meridian to the Balearic islands.              C.
Mechain is already at Barcelona with instruments the best
suited to the difficulty of the observations, which will be
begun as soon as he has concerted the proper measures
with (he Spanish commissioners. This new enterprise pro
mises two advantages.          The first is, that it will add two
degrees to the arc already measured, which will be sufficient
to indemnify us for the time and labour it may cost.             An
other advantage, still more important in the eyes of some
persons,     is, that we shall have    a whole arc equally divided
into two in the parallel of 45", and from which, without
any supposition on the figure of the earth, we may deduce
the whole extent of the meridian.
    The fame of these operations, of which France set the
example, has more than once excited the emulation of
neighbouring nations. Hence, after the measurements per
formed   by    the French in Peru, at the polar circle, in France
itself,   and  at the Cape of Good Hope, we have seen de
grees    measured     at Rome, Turin, Vienna, Hungary, Penn
sylvania,    and   Milan.   The Swedes have lately repeated and
extended with instruments made in France, and with all
the means furnished          bythe present state        of
                                                         the sciences
and the arts, the operations performed in           1736 at the polar
 circle.    The details of the new measurement have not yet
 been published but we learn
                   :                   byletters from M. Melander-
 hielm, perpetual- secretary of the Academy of Sciences at
 Stockholm, and the projector of the new operation, that
 the conclusions deduced from          it do not accord with what
 resulted from the first.       The latter gave         degree which
                                                        a
 was considerably different from all the rest, and supposed
 so great a   flattening, that     excited some suspicions in re
                                  it
 gard   to  the   exactness of  the measures.       The new one re
 conciles the whole.        This degree, compared with that of
 France, gives for the flattening nearly the same quantity as
 the degree of France compared with that of Peru.                This
 result would be so satisfactory that we scarcely dare to give
 credit to it. There were some doubts in regard to the cor
 rectness of the operations performed in 736 but the error

duced complete conviction,     we have reason to think that
the irregularities of our globe are not so great as has hi
therto been believed, and that the curve of the meridian,
abstracting some local circumstances, deviates much less
from the regular elliptical figure.
    It is acknowledged by the ablest naval officers that the
port of Brest in time of war cannot be supplied with pro
visions and stores by sea, and the burthensome method of
employing carts can be recurred to only on the most ur
gent occasions.     The counsellor of state Bruix has already
proved, m a printed memoir the indispensable necessity of
an internal communication between Brest and the Loire,
Boats of the burthen of ten tons at most, and a canal,
would be sufficient for the continual wants of the navy.
C. Rochon, who has been long occupied with projects of
internal navigation proposed to the states of Brittany, has
given more extent to his ideas in a memoir which he read
to the class.    He shows in what manner a highly useful
communication might be established           between    Nantes,
L'Orient, and Brest, by rendering navigable the rivers
Erdre, Isac, Ourt, Blavet, and Chateaulin.
    We shall take this opportunity to say a few words re
specting some experiments, lately made by C. Rochon with
a telescope,   of which he gave a description, with an ac
count of its uses, in a memoir printed in the year 9.
    It is well known that rock crystal has the property of
double refraction, and of producing two images. This pro
perty C. Rochon has found the ingenious means of con
verting to advantage.    A prism of this crystal placed in the
interior part of a telescope causes two images of the ob
served object to appear, and these images, approach or re
cede from each other according as the prism is brought
nearer to, or removed from, the eye.         When the images
are brought into contact, a scale engraved on the outside of
the telescope indicates to the observer how many times the
diameter of the observed object is contained in the distance.
Hence, when the distance is known the diameter can be
determined, and the diameter when known will give a suf
ficiently correct idea of the distance. If you observe a ship
at sea, which you wish to come up with or avoid, bring in
contact the two images ; if you are approaching the vessel
the two images will encroach on each other: but, on the
other hand, if the two vessels are receding from each other,
the images will be soon separated.     It is easy to distinguish
the rate of the observed vessel, and by these means you
may know very nearly the dimensions of her masts : bring
                              M-l                            into

into contact, and end to end, the two images of the main
mast, and you will know how many lengths of that mast
you are distant from the vessel.             At land, you observe the
images    of  a  corps   of  the  enemy,     and  place these images in
such a manner that the feet of the one may stand on the
heads of the other ; and if you estimate the mean height of
a soldier at five feet ten inches, the telescope will show how
many times that quantity is contained in the distance you
 are from the enemy. — This short explanation sufficiently
 proves of what utility this instrument may be, and which
would even be interesting were it only an object of mere
 curiositv.     Experiments on this subject were repeaterftat
 Saint-Cloud on Tuesdav, the 31st of May, before the
 First Consul, who ordered several telescopes of this kind to
 be constructed.       This discovery may be of great use also to
 astronomv.        C. Rochon has already employed it to mea
 sure the diameters of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.                At first
 he was not able to apply it to the sun and moon, the dia
 meter of which is about 30', because the angle of refrac
 tion is only 20'; but Rochon and Torclli de Narcy, by cut
 ting the crystal in an ingenious manner, were able to dou
 ble and even to triple the angle of refraction.             There is no
 planet,   therefore,     the  diameter     of  which   cannot  be mea
 sured in this manner, provided it be sufficiently luminous;
 for it is evident that the two images are necessarily weaker
 and fainter than one image would be.                There is no incon
 venience of this kind in regard to the moon and sun, which
 have always too much light ; and one of these prisms is
 going to be adapted to the best telescope in the national
 observatory.

I was desirous of burning in the same manner an arsenical
mixture along with an equal quantity of the same powder,
that I might compare their flames and duration : but
scarcely had I time to retire a little, after having set fire to
the two cannons, when the first made an explosion and
burst, breaking the glass vessel, and throwing the water in
all directions like radii from a common centre. Though
the mouth of the tube was not confined, so that the escape
of the flame was free, the cannon split from the top to the
bottom, and unrolled itself like a card. This powder is so
violent in its effects that in my opinion it would be danger
ous to try to make any application of it. If two long trains,
one of gunpowder and the other of the above mixture, be
formed on a table, and if they be made to coincide at one
extremity in order to set fire to them at the same time, you
w ill be astonished to see the one disappear like lightning,
w hile the other seems to burn exceedingly slow.

    NEW METHOD OF PREPARING           FULMINATING MERCURY.
                          By Brugnatelli.
     The process described by Mr. Howard for obtaining ful
  minating mercury, which I have several times prepared in
  my laboratory, suggested to me the idea of preparing this
  singular production by making ether by nitric acid on mer
  curial oxides without the application of heat, which fre
  quently produces so rapid and so spontaneous an efferves
  cence that it occasions the loss of a great part of the mate
  rials. My process is as follows :
     On two gros of the oxidulous sulphate of mercury called
  turbith mineral pour an ounce of pure alcohol, and add at
 two different times ten gros of concentrated and rutilating
  nitrous acid. The mixture will immediately enter into effer
 vescence, and the alcohol becomes etherized and is reduced
 to vapour.     These vapours are at first rare and light, but
  they gradually become more copious and dense : they pass
 into the receiver, whence they issue in clouds and occupy the
 lower parts of the apartment, diffusing themselves in the air
 to a great distance.    I never saw any effervescence produce
 so many vapours.      The mercurial mass loses its yellow co
 lour and becomes gray. When the matter has been suf
 fered to cool, collect the concrete part on a filter, and wash
 and dry it.    This substance fulminates like Howard's mer
 cury, and possesses all the other properties of that prepara
 tion.
     By treating in the same manner the other mercurial ox
 ides, I was able to convert them all into fulminating mer
 cury.
     The quantity of white vapours disengaged during this
 process, and their singular gravity, which far surpasses that
 of air, induced me to make researches respecting their na
 ture. For this purpose I proceeded in the following man
 ner: — I put into a glass tubulated retort two gros of turbith
 mineral, adapted to it a double-necked retort, and to the
 latter a second large tubulated receiver.      Having luted the
joinings, I poured over the mercurial powder in the retort an
 ounce of alcohol, and then a gros of concentrated rutilating
 nitrous acid, closing exactly the tubulature.       An efferves
 cence took place, and the white vapours soon silled the
 lower part of the receivers.      When the effervescence had
                                                        subsided,

         Detonating oxygenated      Muriate of head, &c.        187
subsided, and the apparatus had cooled, there was found in
the retort a mercurial mass of a very white colour and
highly fulminating.       The receivers contained an ethereous
oily liquor,    and crystals  of salt, which were carefully col
lected, were observed on their sides.         They were exceed
ingly soluble in water. On examination I found them to
be nitrate of mercury.
    The vapours disengaged during this operation are there
fore composed of ether by nitric acid and nitrous gas hold
ing in solution nitrate of mercury. The latter circumstance,
on which the great gravity of these vapours depends, is truly
worthy of attention.        I was not able to ascertain whether
there was a concomitant formation of ammonia, as Berthol-
let supposes.
  DISCOVERY      OF A DETONATING        OXYGENATED      MURIATE
                     of lead.      By  the same.
    I  obtained an oxygenated muriate of lead by saturating
 with   oxygenated    muriatic acid a solution of lead in nitric
 acid. This solution, which was transparent and colourless,
 acquired by the addition of oxygen gas a yellow colour.           I
 reduced it to two-thirds by slow evaporation, and left it at
 rest.    By cooling, it gave a quantity of very small brilliant
 cubes, having a sweet and cool taste.           These crystals at
 tract humidity in humid air, and become dry in dry air.
 Sulphuric acid decomposes them with a disengagement
 of simple muriatic acid gas : when struck with a small bit of
 phosphorus they detonate violently, and are fused on burn
 ing coals.
     If simple muriatic acid gas be made to pass into a solu
 tion of muriate of lead impregnated with a little oxygenated
 muriatic acid gas, the metal is precipitated under the form
 of very small crystals of muriate of lead : on evaporating
 the liquid there are obtained small needles of the same salt.
  Crystallization   then furnishes the two salts above men
 tioned.      Simple muriate of lead neither detonates with
  phosphorus, nor fuses on burning coals.
                           NEW ANIMALS.
     A  letter from Paris says :     " A couple of living quadru-
         entirely unknown to naturalists, have been <ent home
  Eeds,
   y captain Baudin, in the Naturaliste lately arrived.         Pro
  fessor Geoffroi calls them jvscolomes.         They conic from
  the western coast of New Holland ; their fur may be of
  some utility; and their flesh, in the opinion of captain
  Hamelin and his crew, affords excellent food. The Jasco-
                                                               lomes

   1 88                        Galvanism.
  lomes are interesting to naturalists in particular on account
 of the singularity   ot' their organization.   They resemble the
 mirmot in the form of the head ; the number, the nature,
 and arrangement of their teeth ; and by the conformation
 of their fore-feet, which they employ for burrowing in the
 earth   : but they differ by the existence of a bag under the
 belly   of  the female, and by the whole apparatus of the or
 gans   of  generation, which are like those of the sariqve of
 Buffon. The hind-feet also are formed like those of that
 animal, the thumb being separated from the other toes, and
 destitute of claws. The tail is so short that it remains con
 cealed among the hair : the latter is brown, tufted, and very
  lonS-
      " The                in the menagerie are still young, and
              fascolomes
 larger than rabbits. They are remarkably gentle. They
 may be touched, and carried from one place to another,
 without showing the least fear, anger, or discontent. Their
 gait is heavy and embarrassed : they live under the earth,
 sleep in the day-time, and in the night go in quest of food :
 in general they have little activity and energy : they scratch
tlu'insolves like apes.      They are fed with bread, milk, roots,
 and all sorts of herbs."
                              GALVANISM.
     A letter from Turin, dated 25th June, contains the follow
 ing particulars : — " The experiments made by the Galvanic
 Committee of Turin, and by several members of the Aca
 demy of Sciences, have greatly contributed lo the rapid pro
 gress made by this part of the physical sciences : but what
 ought to distinguish the success of the learned philosophers
of which this committee is composed, is the advantage with
which they have applied Galvanimn to the animal ceconomy,
and the well-arranged series of experiments they have made
to determine its influence on the different diseases with which
man may be afflicted. Of the various trials made with great
success by Rossi, Vassalli-Eandi, and Giulio, we shall men
tion that only of Rossi with Galvanic piles of a new com
position.       Animated by the most ardent desire of rendering
Galvanism useful to suffering humanity, Rossi constructed
disks with the cancerous tumours extirpated from a man in
the hospital of St. John.        He varied this apparatus by em
ploying these new disks sometimes without moistening
them, and sometimes moistening them in water mixed with
a tenth of its volume of oxygenated muriatic acid.             He
compared the results produced by these two different piles
with those obtained by means of the common pile, and by
                                                         a fourth

                                 Galvanism.                         189
 a fourth and fifth pile composed one of disks of flesh suf
 fered to putrefy in the sun for fifteen days, and the other
 formed of disks of the same substance moistened in oxyge
 nated muriatic acid mixed with nine parts of distilled water.
 The results of these experiments, by demonstrating more
 and more that the Galvanic fluid, drawn from the different
 substances which compose the pile, has the power of carry
 ing with  it, in its ciiculation, different matters analogous to
 the respective bodies through which         passes, have induced
                                               it
 Rossi, Vassalli-Eandi, and Giulio, to conclude,
   lstly, That Galvanism, though arising from electricity,
 which, as we may sav,   its basis,
                             is     not simple electricity,
                                              is
but electricity so modified, that its effects are in no manner
similar to those of electricity properly so called.
    2dly, That the oxygenated muriatic acid combined with
distilled water, in proportions always determined         by
                                                       the diffe
rent cases in which     it   employed, may be used with the
                             is
greatest advantage in the cure of various maladies.
   The latter discovery made        by
                                  C. Rossi has been applied by
him with the completest success. He has employed oxyge
nated muriatic acid externally      in
                                  the manner above mentioned
for the cure of very extensive gangrenous ulcers. Theeffccts
of this new remedy have been exceedingly great, bo,th in the
hospital of Moncalieri, where several individuals, treated
without success    by the common means for several months,
were entirely cured     bythis method and     ;  the hospital of
                                                    in
St. John, where the effects were so speedy, that in the course
of twenty-four hours gangrenous ulcers of the legs were re
duced to the state of simple ulcers.
                         ELECTRICITY.
     Vassalli-Eandi has confirmed,        by
                                           series of experiments
                                               a
 publicly repeated before Lelievre the celebrated mineralogist,
 member of the National Institute of France, what he had
 proved in the year 1790,
     lstly, That metals and their oxides, thrown on his elec
 trometer, bring thither     contrary kind of electricity
                             a                                 the
                                                               :
tnetal positive electricity, and its oxide negative.
    2dlv, That the electric fluid does not affect the fluid of the
Voltaic pile, the action of which      not altered
                                         is              by
                                                        the union
of positive electricity to the negative of the pile, nor       by

other combination of electric and Galvanic conductors.              It
is  from these and other experiments of the same kind that
he has deduced the theory of Galvanism and its effects, which
he. explained in the last sitting of his public experiments at
the Athenæum of Turin.

               EXPEDITION     OF CAPTAIN BAUDIN.
 Copy of a Letter     addressed  to C. Gregoire, Member         of  the
                          French Senate.
                                       Straits of Basle, Kind's Island,
                                               Nov. 27th, 1802.
    You have certainly heard the result of the expedition of
captain Baudin since our departure from France. You must
have seen that, after staying forty days at the Isle of France,
we proceeded to the coast of New Holland, which we ex
plored from Cape Lew in to the Bay of Seals. All this sandy
coast, nearlv destitute of fresh water, is almost uninhabited.
The few inhabitants who reside on it are still as savage a9
in the time of Dampierre. Being nearer to the state of na
ture than any other people, they are almost as fierce, and
possess no art except that of sharpening sticks to defend
themselves    from their enemies, or to procure those provi
sions with which they can be supplied either by hunting or
fishing.
    On quitting this coast we proceeded to Timor, one of the
islands to the south of the Moluccas, where we found a mild
and lively people in a state of demi-civilization.                The
inhabitants of the coast have become hospitable towards
strangers by their commerce with the Dutch ; but those who
reside in the interior, to whom an European visage is still
unknown, behave with cruelty towards those who venture
to penetrate into their country.
    From Timor we directed our course to Van Diemen's
Land. This island is inhabited by people of a different race
from those of New Holland. The latter have long hair
like the Asiatics, though their skin is as black as that of the
African negroes, while the former have woolly curled hair
like the inhabitants of Congo.           The difference between
them is shown by other characters also : the former, habi
tuated to see European vessels from time to time on their
coasts, are less savage than the other tribes of these coun
tries.
    From Van Diemen's Land we proceeded to Port Jackson.
This infant colony is the first the inhabitants of which have
no cause of complaint against the Europeans.               Here they
are treated with every kind of attention, but they have always
rejected   civilization : though they have lived for fifteen
years  with   the English they have not yet adopted anv of
their customs. Clothes are still to them a superfluity : they
sometimes, though seldom, wear any thing to defend them
from the cold, but never to conceal their nudity.               Their
language   alone   has undergone   some   changes.
                                                                  The

                                Flre-lall.                               idi
    The English, in the course of the fifteen years they have
 been settled here, have carried cultivation to a very advanced
 state.  The antient forests have disappeared, and nothing is
 seen but fields of wheat, which are remarkably productive.
 We have found here towns and villages where every Euro
 pean article, and even superfluities, are to be had in abun
dance. The population amounts to nearly 8000, without
any slaves.    I have sent you a specimen ot the wool of the
sheep of this country.      They came originally from Peru,
Paraguai, the Cape ot Good Hope, and Bengal. They have
already improved in a singular manner, and still promise
more. Those of Bengal, which were clothed only with
hair, have already produced young ones covered with rich
fleeces.   A residence of five months enabled me to traverse
the whole country.    We have just left it in order to explore
those parts of New Holland which we have not yet visited.
The commodore has sent the Naturaliste back to France laden
with the collections we have made.       I have left that vessel
to go on board the Geographe, and to supply the place of
my friend Depuch, who returns to France on account of his
health.

                                FIRE-BALL.
  On the 4th instant (July) a ball of sire struck the White
Bull, public-house, kept by John Hubbard, at East Norton.
The chimney was thrown down by               it,
                                       the roof in part torn
off, the windows shattered to atoms, and the dairy, pantry,
&c. converted into        heap of rubbish.
                            a                       appeared like

luminous ball of considerable magnitude           and, on coming
                                                   ;

                                                   a
a very oppressive sulphureous smell.          Some fragments of
this ball were found near the spot, and subjected to che
mical analysis     by gentleman in the neighbourhood, who
                        a
found them to consist of the same ingredients as those stones
of similar origin analysed         byMr. Howard and other che
mists,  and  nearly in  the same    proportions.     The surface of
these stones  isof dark colour, and varnished as

                           SINGULAR CAVERN.
    A singular cavern has lately been discovered two leagues
from Nizza, in the district of Falcion. It has a narrow
entrance, and the interior divisions, which have not yet
been sufficiently explored, contain natural temples sup
ported by columns formed by crystallizations.                      Some of
these columns are so large that 400 persons cannot encom-
       them. On account of the great reflection, very little
   ght is required to illuminate this cavern.

                                ASTRONOMY.
    The astronomers Delalande junior and Burckhardt observe
with great assiduity the planet discovered by Dr. Olbers on
the 28th of March 1802. Its longitude on the 1st of July at
 1 lh 45' was 9 signs 7° 14' 25", and its latitude 46° 23' 1 s".
Burckhardt has thence deduced its revolution to be 1682
days, or four years seven months and twelve days; which is
a day less than what was found some months ago, as may be
seen in my Bibliographic Astronomiqite just published; but
at present there is scarcely an uncertainty of a few hours. He
is employed in calculating the derangements it must expe
rience from the attraction of Jupiter, and which are very
complex ; but he has presented to the Institute a learned
memoir which leads to this research.

  XXXII.     Materials towards a more intimate Knowledge of
     Native Molybdena, containing a very advantageous Me
     thod of extracting Molybdic Acid from that Sulphuret.
     By C. F.    Bucholz*.
 After      the repeated labours of a great many chemists,
 such as Quist, Seheele, Bergman, Heyer, Ilsemann, Pelle-
 tier, Richtcr, 8cc. on sulphuret of molybdena, both in re
 gard to a better method of extracting molybdic acid from
 that mineral, and in regard to the phænomena it exhibits
 with other bodies, one might believe that no further re
 searches remain to be made on this subject.                 But by re
 flecting properly    on  what     has  been   done,  we  shall  soon be
 convinced of the contrary.           As my principal object in this
 memoir is to make known a more advantageous method of
 preparing molybdic acid, it will be requisite, to justify the
 necessity of such a method, to recapitulate the old and new
 processes, in order to show their defects, and to compare
 them afterwards with mine.
     The first process for extracting molybdic acid from mo
lybdena consists in separating the sulphur from the molyb
 dena by a strong heat, and converting the remaining metal
 into acid bv continuing to heat it in the air. The vapours
 of the molybdic acid are received in a proper vessel, where
 they are condensed under the form of yellowish white
 scales, which are alone considered to be molybdic acid.
 As these scales are formed very slowly and in small quan
 tity, and as the volatility of the molybdic acid in a mode
 rately strong heat on the one hand, and on the other the
 property of the same acid of fusing in a very strong heat,
 and of penetrating, during its fusion, the matter of the cru
 cible, render it impossible to obtain in this manner a certain
 quantity of acid, this method cannot in any point of view
 be considered as advantageous or even practicable : we shall
 therefore proceed to examine the second method.
    The second process, which like the first belongs to
 Scheele, consists in distilling off at different times nitric
 acid of a moderate strength from molybdena until the sul
 phur and the metal are both converted into acid. This ope
 ration requires from 20 to 24 parts of nitric acid for one
       of sulphuret of molybdena, and it leaves with the mo-
  ybdic acid the iron and earths which the purest molybdena

  194           Method   of extracting Molybdic Add
  always contains in greater or less quantity.           This process,
  which    was  considered    as the  only  one proper for obtaining
  pure molybdic acid,      besides  its not  answering the proposed
  end,  is too  expensive   to  be followed,   and therefore another
  more ceconomical and more proper for obtaining an acid
  free from foreign mixture is desirable to be substituted m
  its stead.
     The third process consist? in distilling the sulphurated
 molybdena with arsenic acid, and in expelling by volatiliza
 tion the oxide and sulphuret of arsenic which are formed.
 This method also is so expensive and so dangerous that we
 shall not enter into any further discussion ot it.
     The fourth process, which belongs also to Scheele, is
 that which furnishes the acid in the speediest manner; but
 it does not furnish it pure. It consists in causing the mo
 lybdena to deflagrate with nitrate of potash in proportions
 respecting which authors vary. Scheele

 recommends six parts of nitrate to one of molvbdcna, and
 Fourcrov J three parts of nitrate to one of molvbdcna.
     The sulphur and the metal are here converted into acids,
 and in that state combine with the potash.               A portion of
 the nitrate remains undeeomposed, and there is formed at
the same time deoxygenated nitrate : the remaining mass is
 dissolved in warm water ; and the molvbdate of potash, still
mixed with its other salts, is decomposed (or this may be
 done after it has been separated by crystallization) by means
of the nitric, muriatic, or sulphuric acids. The molybdic
acid, when the solution is not too dilute, separates under
the concrete form : this precipitate is not pure molybdic
acid, but, as Scheele before announced, molybdic acid hold
ing potash, or, according to Tourcroy, acidulous molvbdate,
of that alkali.
     This acidulous molvbdate is much more soluble in water
than pure molybdic acid, which for its solution requires 500
parts of that liquid, whereas acidulous molvbdate dissolves
in three or four parts of water. The latter fuses in the fire
sooner than the acid, and more readily corrodes the cruci
ble. After cooling, it is of a beautiful yellow colour: the
acid, on the contrary, exhibits a radiant mass of a whitish
gray colour, having a slight metallic brilliancy. The acidu
lous molvbdate does not suffer itself to be sublimated ;
whereas the pure arid is vaporized by heat, and deposits it-

                                    It
has often been employed for pure molybdic acid.       Thus
Lampadius    gives reason to believe that the acid which he
prepared     by
             the above process was not pure acid but acidu
lous molybdate.    He recommends decomposing the mass
which remains after deflagration                      by
                                     muriatic acid in excess.
It will be seen        by
                   the following experiments that the mo
lybdic acid cannot be entirely freed from the potash. To
remove this obstacle to the preparation of pure molybdic
acid, Scheele recommends dissolving the precipitate ob
tained in the smallest quantity of water possible, and boil
ing    for some minutes with
      it                        new quantity of nitric acid.

                      is
to me far preferable to the rest, being much shorter and
more ceconomical,      wished to try whether

                            and to render    common in the      it
preparation of the molybdic acid.
   As the proportion of nitre, even in the process of Four-
croy, appeared to me still too great,   was desirous to exa I
mine whether something might not be saved in this point
of view.

grains  of this  mineral, the deflagration was still very brisk.
I maintained the matter in fusion for some minutes longer,
after which   I   dissolved the mass in water. The solution
was complete,      few grains of oxide of iron and of silex ex
                      a
cepted.    On   proceeding to the crystallization of the salts
contained in this mass,        obtained some small crystals of

    According to the indication furnished    the preceding           by

10(5         Method os extracting Molyldic Acid
When the whole quantity of molybdena was introduced, a
verv brisk deflagration took place.          I dissolved the saline
mass in distilled* water.     The whole dissolved except about
ten gros, which were oxide of iron and silex. The ley fur
nished by crystallization a little undecomposed saltpetre-,
nitrite of potash, and gaso-nitrous sulphates and molyb-
dates of potash, or holding nitrous gas.
    These experiments prove that Cf parts of nitre are suffi
cient to deprive of its sulphur one part of sulphurated mo-
Ivbdena, and to oxygenate the metal. This quantity might
even be diminished, were it not to be apprehended that the
small portion of undecomposed sulphur which is found in
the mass towards the end of the operation would with diffi
culty be attacked by too small a quantity of nitre.
    To find the means of separating the molvbdic acid from
the acidulous molvbdate of potash thus obtained, I made
the following experiments.
                         Experiment      III.
    To a portion of the above solution I        added sulphuric acid
till nothing more was precipitated and          the mixture had ac
quired strongly
         a          acid  taste,  after which    it was digested cold
for two hours. The precipitate obtained was washed several
times with distilled water, and it was heated with twenty
parts of the same water. The \\ hole of it readily dissolved.
    To this solution I added nitric acid until there was a con
siderable excess.     No precipitate was formed. 1 evapo
rated the liquor to dryness.          The residuum contained no
crystallized part, had no taste of saltpetre, and did not de
flagrate   when thrown on burning coals. This residuum,
 which was yellow, easily fused in an ignited crucible with
out being evaporated by a strong heat.              After cooling, it
was found to have assumed a yellower colour.                 This ex
 periment evidently proves that acidulous molybdate of pot
 ash is not decomposed either by sulphuric acid assisted by
 a digesting heat, or by nitric acid ; for the precipitate ob
 tained was exceedingly soluble, and was not volatile at a
 white heat.
    As I had evaporated the solution of molybdate conjointly
 with nitric acid, it was possible that the nitrate of potash
 formed in the first instance might afterwards be decomposed
 bv the inolybdic acid separated.        I therefore resolved to re
 peat the same operation with nitric acid.

 niolybdate, adding an excess of nitric acid. A large portion
 of the precipitate was redissolved.      After some hours di
 gestion I tried the nature of the precipitate, after having
 collected and washed it on a filter. On putting a little
 oi the precipitate, still moist, into a Hessian crucible, and
 exposing it to heat, it resolved itself into a transparent li
 quor^    When the whole, moisture was dissipated, and the
 crucible had begun to be red, the matter entered into fu
 sion ; but only a very weak volatilization was observed by an
 increase of heat.    The fused mass was of a yellowish gray
colour.     A great part of it had passed through the crucible.
 It resulted from these phænomena, compared with those
which the free acid exhibited with water and in the fire,
that the precipitate obtained in this experiment was a mix
ture of free molybdic acid and acidulous niolybdate of pot
ash.
    After this imperfect success I resolved to try the muri
atic acid to decompose acidulous niolybdate of potash.
                         Experiment    V.
    I decomposed     the above-mentioned     solution by means
of muriatic acid.     An abundant precipitate   was formed.     I
added a strong excess of acid, which dissolved a remarkable
quantity of the precipitate. I digested the mixture for some
hours in a warm place, which completed the solution of al
most the whole it. After cooling, there was formed in the
liquor a considerable number of very small crystals. I tried
these crystals, and found that they were almost entirely so
luble in three or four parts of warm water; that they rea
dily fused in an ignited crucible without emitting much va
pour ; that they penetrated the matter of the crucible ; and
that after cooling they had a grayish yellow colour,            I
thence concluded that the precipitate obtained by the mu
riatic acid contained scarcely any free acid, but was almost
entirely composed of acidulous niolybdate.         I then evapo«
rated to one-half, in a moderate heat, the solution which
still contained molybdic acid. During the evaporation, but
in particular after cooling, there was separated a quantity
of small yellowish white crystals : there, however, remained
in the solution a still greater quantity of molybdic acid, as
was indicated by its acid taste and the trials to which it was
subjected. The crystals obtained exhibited the same phæno
mena with water, and in the fire, as pure molybdic acid.
    These experiments did not furnish a method of preparing,
¦with safety and advantage,    pure molybdic acid, and of ob
taining   the  whole quantity contained in the sulphurated

able  by any of the known means to separate the acid com
pletely from the alkali.    therefore resolved to recur to the
                                   I
old method, which consists in oxygenating the sulphuret by
nitric acid, taking care to correct the process        separatingby

   Five ounces and      ahalf of sulphuret of molybdena in sine
powder,    and  which   were  perfectly pure, few small particles
                                                      a
of quartz and oxide of iron excepted, were introduced into
a  large Hessian crucible, which, for the greater conveni
ence, was placed obliquely in         furnace and surrounded by
                                       a
charcoal.     When the matter was red          was stirred inces

                               by
whom   I   was indebted for the molybdena employed in these
different experiments. During the first hour, and before
the greater part of the sulphur was dissipated, the matter
retained its lightness    :   then united into
                               it                  mass, and its
                                                            a
black colour passed successively to gray, reddish gray, and
then to whitish gray.
   When the whole sulphur was driven off, which required two
hours, the mass     by an increase of heat coagulated more and
more, and even began to fuse at the bottom of the crucible,
and   itappeared   by the vapour which rose that the molybdena
was volatilizing.    Having maintained moderate fire for half
                                                  a
an hour,      took the crucible from the fire and examined the
matter.    It Ihad a   whitish gray colour, exhibited here and
there splendour and      acrystalline form, and weighed      little          a

phenomena of an acid, made me suspect that this molyb
dena might be molybdic acid like that sublimated.               In this
ease the nitric acid might have been spared ; which would
have rendered the process still shorter and more oecono-
mical.                          »
    To clear up my doubts in this respect I made the follow
ing preliminary experiments.
                           Experiment   VII.
    I reduced to fine powder some grains of calcined molyb
dena, poured over it a gros of water, and heated it above a
lamp.      I then instilled into it some drops of a solution of
carbonate of soda : on each new instillation a strong eifer-
vescence took place, and a great part of the matter was dis
solved. For the moment this result was sufficient to en
able me to conclude from it the acid nature of the calcined
molybdena.        The solution was filtered, and decomposed by
nitric acid. There was formed a precipitate of molybdic
acid, which placed it bevond a doubt that there was formed
a combination of this acid with soda.
                           Experiment   VIII.
    I  pulverized some grains of calcined molybdena, and
boiled them for some minutes with an ounce of water. The
taste of the liquor, which was sensibly acid and metallic, as
well as the red colour it communicated to turnsole paper,
again proved the nature of the acid of calcined molybdena.
    It gave me great satisfaction to have found so short and
go ceconomical a method of obtaining molybdic acid. I can
not help wondering, as the experiments of Scheele, Heyer,
and Ilsemann,have been so long known, that chemists have
not followed this method indicated to us by the nature of
calcined molybdena, and to which they had so nearly ap
 proached.      In order to ascertain more fully whether cal
 cined molybdena is pure molybdic acid, and to determine
 the means of separating from it the heterogeneous                 sub
 stances with which it might be still combined or mixed, I
 made the following experiments.
                            Experiment   IX.
    As the molybdic         acid  has the property of combining
 easily  with  a   portion  of  potash, and of retaining that base,
 if not entirely, at least in a great part, against the action of
 all acids, this salt could not be of any use for purifying that

 200            Method os extracting Molybdic Acid
 acid. The alkaline earths, and earths which with the mo-
 lybdic acid form salts difficult of solution, could not answer
 my purpose to separate the acid from the insoluble sub
 stances with which they are mixed.             It remained to try
 soda and ammonia, which I found to be both equally pro
 per under circumstances peculiar to each of them, for ac
 complishing the proposed end.
                            Experiment     X.
     I boiled two   gros of calcined molybdena with eight ounces
 of water,    and instilled into the solution a ley of carbonate of
 soda until no more effervescence took place.          An excess of
 alkali was added, and the matter was left to boil for half an
 hour : it was then filtered, and the concrete matter which
 remained on the filter was edulcorated.          The different li
 quors were evaporated to two ounces, and nitric acid to
 excess was instilled into the warm liquid.          During the in
 stillation of the nitric acid a crystalline white powder was
 deposited, and after cooling there were formed in the liquor
 crystals of a certain size. A new quantity was obtained by
 evaporation.       The different salts were washed and dried.
 The residuum on the filter, after being washed and dried,
 weighed thirty grains, and had the reddish colour of oxide
of iron.
                           Experiment XI.
    The preceding experiment        was repeated, with this differ
ence    : the  liquor, after  the  effervescence   had ceased, was
boiled for half an hour longer. The matter, aster being re
 duced to two ounces, and filtered, was suffered to coolbe-
fore the nitric acid was added.           The addition of this acid
caused to be precipitated a larger quantity of the white pow
der, which had a more crystalline aspect, and which after
edulcoration and desiccation had the splendour of mother-
of-pearl.          I
               As did not add so much acid in this experi
ment as in the former, the liquor was less charged with
molybdic acid.         The residuum, when washed and dried,
weighed     also  thirty grains.
    As I suspected that this residuum might contain a por
tion of molybdic acid less soluble than the preceding, I tried
to extract this acid by boiling the residuum with nitric acid.
With this view I made the following experiment.
                          Experiment     XII.
    The thirty grains of the residuum of the two last experi
ments were boiled with an ounce of nitric acid of the spe
cific gravity 1-250 and half au ounce of water, until the

¦whole   moisture was dissipated.       During the evaporation I
observed    no disengagement of nitrous gas, from which I
could conclude that there was in the residuum a little mo
lybdena not yet acidified.        I then boiled the residuum for
half an hour with a ley of carbonate of soda, after which
there was added to the solution nitric acid to decompose it ;
but I observed no precipitation of molybdic acid, though an
excess of nitric acid had been added.       The solution had only
a metallic acid taste.       On examining the residuum more
closely, it was found to be composed of alumine, oxide of
iron, and a few fragments of silex, which, if I except the
oxide of iron contained in the sulphurated molybdena, arose
in part from the molybdena and partly from the crucible.
                         Experiment     XIII.
    The white precipitates of experiments X.          and XI. were
put   into   an  ignited  crucible.   JBy an increase  of heat they
first entered into fusion, and were then volatilized and con
densed, partly under the pulverulent form and partly under
the crystalline.      By continuing the fusion the matter pene
trated through the crucible.        The fused matter was very li-
         and on cooling it formed itself into a crystalline ra-
auid,
  iant mass of a whitish gray colour having a slight metallic
splendour.      In other respects it exhibited the same phæno-
mena as pure molybdic acid.
    This last method furnishes a yery short and ceconomical
method of obtaining molybdic acid. There can be no doubt
that if the molybdena had been entirely free from matrix
the calcined mass would have entirely dissolved, except an
atom of iron, from which sulphuret of molybdena is never
free.
    I was desirous also to try the separation of the molybdic
acid by the help of ammonia.          With this view I made the
following experiments.
                         Experiment     XIV.
    I digested for twelve hours, in a moderate heat, a gros of
the calcined mineral in fine powder with half an ounce of
concentrated liquid ammonia, shaking the matter from time
to time; after which the liquor was filtered.           It had still
a strong odour of ammonia.           The half of it was decom
posed by nitric acid, which precipitated from it molvbdic
acid in abundance. The other half was evaporated in a
small porcelain capsule, aud then heated to a slight degree
of incandescence. The ammonia was entirely dissipated,
and left a grayish blue residuum, which entered into fusion
                                                                 in

  202           Metlwd os extracting Molyldic Acid
 in    a stronger heat, and which, after cooling, exhibited      i
 radiant whitish gray mass perfectly similar to fused pure
 molybdic acid. The residuum collected after the digestion
 of the calcined molybdena with the ammonia weighed twenty
 grains : I subjected it to the following experiment.
                          Experiment   XV.
     I  boiled the residuum above mentioned with two gros of
 nitric acid   to perfect evaporation, and digested the new re
 siduum with two gros of liquid ammonia.           The residuum
 was then filtered, washed, and dried. It weighed sixteen
   rains. The liquid was evaporated, and after incandescence
 f  obtained four grains of molybdic acid.       The residuum of
 this experiment, like those of Nos. X. XI. and XII. con
 tained oxide of iron, alumine, and quartzy sand.
     After these experiments I will not hesitate to prefer the
 method of separation by ammonia to that by soda, espe
 cially in operating with pure soda. For it may happen that
the molybdena will enter into vitreous fusion with the fo
 reign bodies contained in its ore, and then ammonia would
not be capable of separating the molybdic acid from that
combination.        However, this inconvenience may be pre
vented by not making the fire too strong towards the end
of the calcination. When the method by ammonia is pro-
         considered, it will be readily perceived that it would
Eerly
   e impossible to devise one more expeditious and less ex
 pensive.
     The molybdena may be deprived of its sulphur without
 the aid of the nitric acid or of nitrate of potash. The mo
lybdic acid formed is purified from the oxide of iron with
 which it is naturally united, and from the quartz and argil
with which they are accidentally mixed, by digesting it with
 ammonia ; which can be done only with difficulty by means
of nitric acid. Molybdate of ammonia is decomposed by a
heat of incandescence, which separates from it the alkali in
the state of purity and without being decomposed. It may
therefore be collected without great loss in a distilling ap
paratus, and the acid, almost without any decrease, will be
found in the retort. So many advantages united are cer
tainly not to be. found in any other method, not even in
that of separation by soda.
    By following these different indications we are led to the
following process, which is the most advantageous for pre
paring molybdic acid.
         New Method     of preparing pure Molyldic Acid.
    Take the purest sulphuret of molybdena that can be found,
                                                             and

                    from Native Mohjldena.                                   203
and reduce it to powder ; introduce it into an inclined re
tort, and torrefy   it,to separate the sulphur, and to oxygenate
the metal, in   a heat which must be immediately raised to                    a
very high degree.       When the molybdena has lost its bril
liancy, and its black colour has changed to gray, lessen the
heat, and continue to expel the last portions of the sulphur,
and to complete the oxygenation of the metal at                more      a
moderate heat, continually stirring the matter with an iron
spatula. By these means the matter will be prevented from
entering into fusion with the oxide of iron and                small     a
quantity of alumine with which they are mixed, and from
forming   a  mass which the ammonia can afterwards decom
pose only    with difficulty, and nothing will remain adhering
 to the crucible. The mineral         then to be reduced to
                                            is                  very     a
 fine powder, and         must be digested several times with
                          it                                                   a
Sufficient quantity of liquid ammonia to extract the whole
molybdic acid. The different liquids are then to be united,
and being poured into         glass retort are distilled to dryness.
                                   a
Molybdate     of ammonia     will remain in the retort. The heat              is
increased to incandescence, in order to expel the ammonia.
 If the retort be too large, the matter must be removed into
a   smaller.
    This process would not answer where                  required to
                                                           it   is
analyse ore of molybdena.          In this case    would be neces
                                                      it
 sary to oxygenate the sulphur and the metal bv the help of
 nitric acid. This method will contribute in all probability
 to ameliorate and render easier the analysis of sulphuret of
 molybdena.
              Addition     to the preceding Experiments.
 I  had undertaken four times, and with the same success,

liquor was  left at rest for  some  days,  to see whether   any
thing would be deposited        which actually was the case.
                                        ;
Some flakes which exhibited the same phænomena as oxide
of iron were deposited.        again placed the liquor on one

side, to see whether    new separation would take place.

the solution of molybdate of ammonia equal to     sixteenth          a
part of the whole liquid.  The residuum exhibited the same
                                                                    phænomena

 204       Method os extracting Molybdic Acid,      &c.
 phænomena exactly       as that obtained in experiment      XIV,
 and was pure molvbdic acid.         Numerous occupations pre
 vented me from undertaking new experiments with the so
 lution of molybdatc of ammonia until six weeks after.
 Having evaporated the solution to dryness, I put the saline
 mass into a new Hessian crucible in order to expel the am
 monia by incandescence. To my great astonishment I ob
 served that the mass deprived of ammonia, which under
 other circumstances fuses so readily, and which, after being
 some time in fusion, penetrates into the substance of the
 crucible, could not this time be brought into fusion even
 in the strongest white heat, and was only softened, emit
 ting vapours of molvbdic acid. On examining the cooled
 mass, I found at its surface several irregular depressions.
 It had an argentine splendour inclining to gray. On its
 fracture it exhibited a cupreous blue colour of steel with a
 metallic tint ; its texture was scaly and very compact ; it
was difficult to be broken and pulverized.       Its specific gra
vity was 5050. By pouring        over it moderately concentrated
sulphuric acid the mass acquired a considerable heat, emit
ting nitrous gas in abundance, and transforming itself into
white oxide.
    After all these phænomena, it can be considered only as
metallic molybdena, or oxide of molybdena very near to the
metallic state.     I can explain this in no other manner than
by admitting,    that  in consequence of the long contact of
the ammonia with the molybdic acid the latter was decom
posed.     I dare not, however, assert that this was actually
the case, and that some other cause which I did not observe
may not have concurred to produce the same effect.          How
ever this may be, it is remarkable that under the circum
stances above mentioned the molybdic acid, the reduction
of which is so difficult, should be reduced so easily and by
so weak a fire ; and that the metallic molybdena, which is
so little fusible, should be fused, or at least softened into a
homogeneous mass of a scaly texture. The want of mo
lybdena has hitherto prevented me from making the experi
ments necessary to ascertain the cause of this singular effect.

                     Of  the Standard    of Proof.
§ 14.    J. he standard of comparison which, in conformity to
the principles already spoken of in § 3 has been established
in this country, is called proof spirit ; and it appears that
some such standard was in use long before we were in the
possession of any means of correctly appreciating its strength,
 shis, indeed, has never yet been done ; and it is from the
want of correctly defining the strength of this standard that
a great part of the uncertainty at present existing, with re
gard to the relative strengths and values of spirituous liquors
in general, has originated.
    § 15. When a spirituous compound of any kind contains
about a certain quantitv of alcohol (which quantity, however,
varies considerably in different liquors, and even in liquors of
the same description, but differing in their puritv), it will
 afford, on shaking it in a phial, a crown of small bubbles of
 a peculiar appearance,       which gradually go off, or subside
 without breaking; and which has generally been called by
 the French the chapelct, and by us the proof.            Liquors of
 any kind which were capable of exhibiting this phænomenon
 have, for upwards of two centuries past, been denominated
 of proof strength.
     Upon the average, perhaps, an experienced person may by
this means guess within about C or 8 per cent, of the real
 Strength of such liquors as are capable of being examined in
 this way, if in a tolerable state of purity.
    The following; curious account of the processes for prov
 ing spirituous liquors, which is extracted from Mr. High-
 more's Treatise on the Excise Laws, published in 1796,
 vol. ii. p. 283, may, perhaps, serve to give a better idea of
 the degree of reliance which ought to he placed on them,
 and of the necessity which there is for a total revision of this
 important subject:
     " Proof spirits, or common saleable goods, are spirits of
 any kind of a determinate strength, being the same with
 those of good brandy, and the malt and sugar spirits of the
 distillery, as they are usually sold, containing equal quan
 tities of rectified spirit and water."
     •' The best
                   proof spirit is that distilled from French wine ;
                                                                 but

So6       Relation between the Specific                Gravities and
but for common use may be employed the spirit drawn fronl
melasses."
   " The common method of judging of the due strength is
by striking the bottom of the sample phial, filled half way
with common malt spirit, with the palm of the hand j the
bubbles raised on the surface will go off again in a strong
manner, without breaking or swelling ; and this is the method
constantly used by the traders : it is said to be fallacious, and
easily open to deception ; for if a little treacle, syrup, Sec,
be added to a quantity of highly rectified spirit of wine, it
will give a brandy proof to that spirit. The true strength
may, however, always be known by carefully burning away a
measured quantity of brandy, &c; since if it leaves one half
water, it is right ; if more or less, it is too strong or too
weak."
     "Perfect proof is that crown of bubbles before mentioned,
of a certain size, arising  as a head upon a small quantity of
a well qualified spirit shaken in a slender phial."
     fProof more than perfect is that in which the bubbles-
raised by shaking the spirit are larger than those on the com
mon or perfect proof, and go off more suddenly ; that         ac            is,
cording   as  the spirit    higher,
                             is     or approaches   more  to  the
nature of rectified spirit, or, as      usually
                                             it called,
                                                  is    spirit of
wine."
  " Proof    less than perfect      that wherein the bubbles are
                                        is
smaller, and go off quicker and fainter than in perfect proof;
the spirit, in this case, being mixed with more than its own
Quantity of phlegm, or being too poor for sale."
    '* The most exact of all methods of
                                                  determining the
strength of any spirit       is    by
                               distillation, rectifying   up to anit
alcohol, or totally inflammable spirit; but this, though liable
to no error,   istoo tedious to come into common use. And,
upon the whole, the best method of all others seems to be
that of deflagration     namely,
                         ;                   by

it will no longer burn, the remainder          half as much as tha
                                                       is
quantity measured out for the trial was, then the spirit tried
is found to consist of half water, and half totally inflammable
                   is,
spirit; that       exactly perfect proof: and according as the
remainder     ismore or less than half the original quantity,                     it
is so much below or so much above proof, or the due strength
pf brandy."
     " In commerce, with regard to spirits,         would certainly
                                                             it
be   a much better method to abolish such uncertain proofs,
and to make all the goods of the strength of what            called    is

                              totally inflammable spirit, whose
                                   a
purity   ismuch greater, whose strength may always be found
                                                                              with

for   be mixed into great variety of extemporaneous liquors,

known."
  " This operation, indeed, in       the common way, proves so
 tedious and expensive, and, after all, so short of expectation,
 and so generally unsatisfactory, that      it  not to be expected
                                                 is
that the common distillers, till they have fallen into better            a
manner of working, should come into the proposal. But                             if,
instead of the common way of rectifying               by
                                                  the hot still, they
would try the using      large balneum Marice, made of large

rectangular boiler, and set of tall conical vessels, they will
                              a
 find that little tire and little attendance, and consequently
very little expense, will, in this manner, furnish them with
spirits reduced at once to this standard, and greatly superior,
in all respects, to the common ones of the same strength.
In this case there would be no need of any addition of salts                      ;
but the distiller may work more perfectly and more expedi-
tiously without them, and thus preserve the sine essential vi-
nosity of the spirit, which in the common way of working
 they constantly lose."
    " The advantage of this method would be yet greater to
apothecaries, to the makers of compound cordial waters,
who want only       apure spirit of such     astrength, and suffer
greatly in the fineness and perfection of their commodities
 by  the spirit they are obliged to use having in           fulsome

and nauseous oil of its own, which will always mix itself
with their compositions, and the oils of the aromatics, 8cc.
which they add to it.      If spirits were brought to this stan
dard for the market, there would be no possibility of deceit;
and no further examination need be made of                      by
                                                          the buyer

  208       Relation between the Specific Gravities and
 curacy of the above definition.      The weight of the avefdu-
 pois pound, and    the length  of the inch and consequent solid
 content of the wine-gallon, neither of which was at the time
 of making the statute appreciated with sufficient accuracy,
 we shall for the present take to be so, and assume that the
 former is ei)ual to 7000 grains troy ; and that the general
 relation between the measures and weights of this country
 is such, that the cubic inch of distilled water, at 60° of Fah
 renheit's thermometer, would weigh, in air at the same tem
 perature when the barometer stands at 2Qv, 25-2J of the same
 grains. \Vide vol. xv. p. 278.] There still remain, however,
 two very important questions which require to be answered
 before we can ascertain the real strength of proof spirit.
     Istly, What is meant by one to sis under proof? Is it in
tended to signify that compound which would be produced
 by the addition of one part of water to six of proof spirit bv
measure — or that of which a given quantity by mcasu.e shall
contain and consequently be equal in value to six-sevenths
 of that measure of proof spirit ? These are by no means
 convertible terms, as will be easily perceived by considering
what is before mentioned in § 10. We must take one sup
position or the other ; and we shall, for the reasons which are
stated hereafter in § -24, adopt the latter.
    2dly, What is the temperature at which it is intended that
this spirit should weigh seven pounds thirteen ounces ? A
compound of this strength would vary in its weight upwards
of two ounces per gallon in different temperatures in this
climate, and still more in some other countries ; and every
liquor of which a gallon a* any possible temperature would
be of that weight, would answer equally to the description
of the statute.     A compound apparently 12 percent, under
         at 35°, would, if judged of hv this criterion, appear to
Eroof
   e over proof at 70° ; and vice versa.
    § 17. The omission to fix the temperature, therefore, at
which the compound mentioned in the statute is to weigh
seven pounds thirteen ounces per gallon, coupled with the
circuitv of describing a mixture differing from proof strength
rather than proof spirit itself, and from which the strength
of the latter can only be determined bv a calculation in which
different data may bv: assumed, are the leading causes of .ill
the uncertainty relative to this subject. Something must be
guessed at with respect to each ; and the following is the
mode in which the authors of this work have hitherto pro
ceeded in the appreciation of the strength of proof spirit.
    Assuming that the avoirdupois pound and the content ot*
the wine-gallon of 23 1 cubic inches bear such a relation to
                                                             each

       the Strengths and Values            of Spirituous Liquors.         209
each other as is already described in the last section, the spe
cific gravity of a liquor weighing seven pounds thirteen
ounces avoirdupois, or 54687*5 grains per wine-gallon, will
be 937'59.     Now sir Charles Blagden tells us, that, although
no temperature is mentioned in the statute, yet the under
standing of the trade      is,
                             that     means that the diluted spirit
                                      it
thus spoken of should be considered as being at 55° whilst           ;
others contend that the temperature should be rated higher,
for the following reason.        Itseems that, at the time of mak
ing the fundamental experiment on which the statute was
founded, the spirit which         there described was produced by
                                 is
lowering either alcohol, or some other kind of rectified spirit,
to the strength there spoken of with water, and immediately
weighing it; under which circumstances              was then found
                                                      it
to weigh     7 pounds 13 ounces per gallon, and to be one to
six under proof. Now,        if this was really the case, the mix
ture could not probably be lower than 60°.           We will how
ever suppose that the truth lies somewhere between them,
and that the temperature was in fact 57i°.            Now we find,
from Mr. Gilpin's tables, that spirit whicha              of the spe
                                                           is
cific gravity of 937*59 at 57£°           similar to one composed
                                           is
of 100 parts of water       byweight, and 86J of his alcohol of
the specific gravity of 825. at 60°, and of which            contains
                                                                it
a  quantity   which  would   be       by
                                      measure,   when  at 6o°,  equal
to *5278 of the bulk of the compound at 57i°. But proof
 spiritis,   by the directions of the act, according lo the con
 struction of     itwhich we adopt, to contain 7-6thsofthis
 proportion, or *6 157 of its quantity of such alcohol          mea  by
                                 is,
 sure when at 60°; that          it  will be equal to compound
                                                           a
 which will be found       by the same tables to have exactly the
specific gravity of 920 at 60°. This appreciation, therefore,
 of proof spirit has been adopted           the authors of this tract
                                               by
 in all the instruments which they have made for many years,
 and appears now to have become that of the trade in gene
 ral. The wine gallon at 60° of spirit of this strength weighs
7  pounds 10 ounces and 10*47 drachms avoirdupois; and
the same measure at 55°,              pounds 10 ounces and 15*59
                                      7
 drachms.
    The commissioners of the customs have, however, (ac
 cording to the statement of Mr. Ramsden, in his
                                                          " Account
 of Experiments to determine the Specific Gravities of Flu
 ids, thereby to obtain the Strength of Spirituous Liquors,"
 printed in 792,) been in the habit of considering proof
             1
 spirit as weighing    7pounds 12 ounces per gallon, at 55°,
 which would, according to the foregoing estimation of the
 relation between this weight and measure, give no less than

  S10        Relation between the Specific Gravities and
'  928 for its specific gravity at 60°. In fact, the real standard
   of proof spirit has never yet been tolerably defined, and it
   is therefore nugatory to talk about it. The language of the
   legislature, hydrometer proof, perhaps,    conveys  a more ac
   curate idea of it than any other ; for it has hitherto been
  just what the hydrometer-maker chose to consider it.
      § 18. The real strength of proof spirit, which was al
   ready so indefinitely described by the act of 2 Gco. III. c. 5.
   w as, however, rendered still more doubtful by a clause which
   was inserted into a subsequent act (27 Geo. III. c. xxxi.
   § 1 7) enacting and declaring,
                                      " That, until the fifth dav
   of April one thousand seven hundred and eighty -eight, all
   spirits shall be deemed and taken to be of the degree of
   strength at which the said hydrometers called Clarke's hy
   drometers shall, upon trial by any officer or officers of ex
   cise, denote any such spirits to be." The meditated inves
   tigation of this business, however, did not take place; and
   this clause was, after being once or twice continued in con
   templation of such a measure, at length made perpetual by
   41 Geo. III. c. xcvii. § 8.
      Now, if the instrument mentioned in the act had agreed
  with itself, it seems as if the proof as denoted by this hy
  drometer would have become the legal standard ; the sub
  sequent act being, of course, paramount to the antecedent
  one with respect to those points in which they might be
  found to clash with each other. Unfortunately, however,
  it had long been, in all respects, the worst instrument which
  had been in use in the spirit trade for these purposes, its
  indications differing every where with each other. Mr.
  Clarke's one to ten, for example, (by which is meant 10 per
  cent, over proof,) is only between 8 and 9 per cent, over his
  own proof, and some points actually disser in like manner
  to the enormous extent of 7 or 8 per cent, from the truth ;
  and, to complete the confusion, there were always two of
  those instruments made, one for import and the other for
  export spirit, each of which differed in every graduation
  from the other. How7 this came to be the case we are not
  sufficiently informed : we are told, however, by the pam
  phlet delivered with these instruments, that " the export
  hydrometer is used in trying British spirits in the different
  divisions of distillery, and by distillers in general. The
  import is used at the port of London and all the out-ports
  in trying imported foreign spirits, and by brandy merchants
  in general ; and is a small matter lighter than the export,
  and in favour of the importer.      This notice is thought ne
  cessary, as some gentlemen have tried instruments with one
                                                                 of

        tlie Strength and Values    of Spirituous Liquors.   SI 1
of  a different kind, not knowing there was any difference in
 Clarke's hydrometer ! ! ! "
    § 19. Vague and indefinite as the term proof 'has hitherto
been in England, it has always been still more so in Ire
land, where they have, for about forty years part, used au
hydrometer for the- purposes of the revenue which has no
correction whatever for temperature.            The Irish proof,
therefore, is altogether incapable of being defined with any
tolerable accuracy.     It appears, however, to be upon the
average somewhere about 9 per cent, over proof by our
standard, or to have a specific gravity of about 909 at 60°.
It was probably established at first of that strength, as being
the highest which a foreign spirituous liquor could possess,
without paying the augmentation duty on its subsequent
importation into this country.
    § 20. It appears, from what has been before said, that
the first step towards the permanent arrangement of this
important business must necessarily be to fix and ascertain
 the real strength of proof spirit by an act of parliament,
which shall define its specific gravity at a given temperature.
If  it were enacted, for example, " that every spirituous liquor
 whose specific gravity, when free from adulteration, should,
 at the temperature of 60° of Fahrenheit's thermometer, be
 to that of distilled water at the same temperature as 920 to
 1000 (or in any other ratio which might be thought pro
per), should be deemed and taken to be proof spirit ;
and that every spirituous liquor of different strength should
be estimated by the quantity of such proof spirit at the said
temperature of 60°, which, according to the tables contained
in the schedule to such act annexed, (annexing a set of
tables for that purpose, calculated from those of Mr. Gilpin,
 in the manner hereafter mentioned in § 32, &c.) would
 produce or be producible from every such other spirit by
 the addition of water to the stronger of the two till they
were reduced to the same degree of strength," all the pre
sent uncertainty respecting this matter would instantly
vanish. The hydrometer would still continue to be the
most convenient instrument; and its accuracy would be
 ensured by the facility with which its errors would be de
 tected, as any man who could use a pair of scales would
 then be able to examine the truth of its indications.

  XXXIV. Of          the Variations of the Temperature of the
       Summer aud Winter Seasons that take place in different
      Years.    By Richard Kirwan, Esq. LL.D. F.R.S.
      and P.R. I. A.*
   X o reason with precision on this subject, we must at first
  abstract from all sublunary physical causes, and indicate
  the temperature appropriated to different latitudes from mere
  astronomical considerations.
      Halley has ingeniously resolved this problem so far as
  the mere ratios of heat in the different seasons are con
  cerned. (Phil. Trans. Abr. ii. p. 165 j and Lambert in his
  Pyrometrie, § 596.
      Ilalley, calculating the ratios of heat communicated by
  the sun to the earth (which he considers merely as a pla
 net, abstracting from all distinction of land and water,) in
 the different seasons in the northern hemisphere, reduces
 these seasons to three, the equinoxes, the summer solstice,
 and the winter solstice ; and attending only to the sines of
 incidence of the sun's rays, and the duration of their action,
 he sets the heat communicated at* latitude 0, on the days
 of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, at 20,000 ; and on
 the tropical days in the same latitude at 18,341 : and then
adds the ratios which the heat in every 10th degree of north
 latitude bears to these at the same periods. Lambert adds
the ratios of lat. 49° and 66° 33', stating the equatorial
 heat on the cquinoxial day at 999.
     But to express these ratios in therntometrical measures
we must endeavour to find the greatest heat of the equi
noxial day, taking a mean of the heal of the morning at
two o'clock, and the evening under the equator, or very
near it ; and this I find to be 88° or 89° ot Fahr. (see Ulloa,
Mem. Philosoph. p. 61,) in the northern hemisphere, on
the 20th of March, on the ocean ; to which, indeed, we
must confine Gurselves in this inquiry, and particularly the
Atlantic, for no uniformity can be expected on land.
     It is uncertain what thermometer of Reaumur Ulloa
employed, whether the true or the false ; and hence I place
the heat at 88° of Fahr.
     This correspondence being found, the thermometrical
degrees corresponding with all the other ratios are easily
found by the rule of proportion, and the degrees thus found

 I call the mathematical temperature. But in most cases
 this temperature is far from agreeing with the temperature
really observed, and which I therefore call the real tempe
rature ; this I take at a mean, and not at its maximum,
which I could not always discover, and is more fugitive
and contingent.          These temperatures I exhibit in two sepa
rate tables, the first indicating those of the vernal equinox
and of the northern tropic or midsummer, and the second
those of the autumnal equinox and the southern tropic or
midwinter, over the Atlantic or standard ocean in our he
misphere.

    In tliis table   we sec, 1. That during the vernal equinox
the heat differs     but little from the mean heat really observed
in all latitudes,     and perhaps still less from the maximum of
real heat ; yet,     except in latitude 80°, it is always higher,
both from the         quantity of rays lost in passing through the
air, and from the quantity reflected by water and the fre
quent interposition of clouds, &c.
    2. We see that the astronomical heat constantly in
creases with the height of the latitudes, as the duration of
the solar rays more than compensates for their obliquity
when the sun is in the northern tropic ; but the real heat
decreases as the latitudes increase, because this theoretic
compensation does not take place from the interposition of
clouds and the access of cooler winds, and the increased re
flection from the surface of the water.

214            Of the Variations      of the  Temperature
    The different   temperatures of different summers are ulti
mately resolvable into the different direction of the winds
during those seasons and the different electrical states of the
atmosphere, the south or south-east producing not only
clouds which intercept the sun's rays, but also copious
rains or hail, which, descending from great heights and
occasioning a copious evaporation, cool the air to a great
degree.      The north and north-east, on the contrary, unless
immediately succeeding great rains (for then they increase
the evaporation), disperse the clouds, and, proceeding from
countries then somewhat heated, allow the sun's rays their
natural calefactive effect.         But why winds from opposite
points     should  prevail    in  different  years cannot be known
until the contemporaneous states of the atmosphere between
the northern tropic and the equator are known. It is pos-:
sible that frequent hurricanes and tornadoes, during which
a quantity of air may be destroyed and converted into wa
ter, may demand an annual supply from the north, and
thus occasion our north and east winds ; and the absence of
these phænomena may occasion an influx from the south,
if the north and east are summoned to a different quarter,
by similar causes.

    On this table we may remark, 1 . That though the ma
 thematical temperature of the autumnal equinox be exactly
 the sanw as that of the vernal, yet the real is much higher,
 as the northern hemisphere being cooled during the winter
 is slowly heated, and being heated duiing the summer is
slowly cooled.

temperature of       the autumnal equinox approaches       much
nearer to the astronomical than does that of the vernal,
until we arrive at latitude 70° and the higher latitudes.

to the astronomical is scarce ever felt at sea in winter : to
what can this be attributed but to the equatorial effluence ?
For other causes, viz. evaporation and the frequent inter
vention of clouds, or at least haze, intercept the sun's rays,
and consequently should cool the air even below the astro
nomical ratio which supposes the incidence of all the rays :
in latitudes above 20° the difference is enormous.
   4. At the distance of some hundred miles from the coasts
of the Atlantic, in latitudes above 40°, the cold is much
more moderate than the mathematical ratios indicate in
most years ; owing to the above-mentioned cause, and to
the reign of westerlv and southerly winds, which convey
their heat to a considerable distance before they are cooled.
   But in latitudes between 55° and 36° a degree of cold far
superior to the astronomical has often been observed, and
particularly of late, and in countries not very distant, or
even bordering on the Atlantic.         These extraordinary sea
sons may be attributed partly to the absence of the superior
effluence, or its refrigeration in communicating with air re
plete with vapours, and partly to the prevalence of east-
north-east winds which proceed from the interior and cold
est parts of our continent ; and hence the cold of the year
 1776, so well described by Van Swinden, seems rather to
have followed the order ot the longitudes than of the lati
tudes,     Wargentin, secretary to the Royal Academy of
Stockholm, informs him that the cold observed that winter
in Stockholm was not at all extraordinary, and expresses
his surprise that it should have been so rigorous in Ger
many, France, and England.          (Mem. Paris, 1770, p- '29.)
Nay,   it appears   that  the north-east  wind which raged so
furiously in Holland and at Montmorenci, latitude 49°, on
the 27th (see Van Swinden, p. 40), had not been at Peters-
burgh on the 18th, nor any day after; for a perfect calm
reigned on that day, and the high winds of the remainder
of the month were from the north-west. (Act. Petropol.
p. 382.)     It is therefore probable that this wind proceeded
obliquely from the eastern and southern parts of Russia,
and may have been derived from latitude 55° and longitude
40°, and originated on the Atlantic, latitude 40°; and hence
the utmost rigour of this cold was sooner perceived in the
SQU'h, of France, as Thoulouse, Marseilles, &c. than in the

more northern latitudes, as may be seen in Van Swinden's
general  table, for it reached these towns on the 18th or 19th
of January.     In the more northern latitudes it was felt only
on the 27th ; it is true its date at St. Jean de Luz, latitude
43°, is January 28th in the general table; but this is a mis
take, as may be seen p. 181, for January 19th is there said
to be the true date, and, p. 179, it is said that the 16th or
 19th of January are the days on which the greatest cold
was observed in all places south of the Garonne ; which
fully confirms my former statement, that the wjnd which
produced this cold originated in the south-west, and thence
was gradually propagated northwards and eastwards,           All
the minuter modifications of this cold, in places not very
distant from each other, may be ascribed either tp recent
falls of snow, the proximity to which must affect more or
less the thermometers, the greater or lesser abundance of
vapours in the atmosphere, and other circumstances too
tedious and minute for insertion in this general view.
    Snow falling from some height in the atmosphere is ge
nerally for some time surrounded with an atmosphere much
colder than the air some feet above    it,  as Mr. Wilson ob
served, though    it did not occur to him that the cold was
communicated to the air          bythe snow  ; for he thought       it
highly remarkable that     a  thermometer hung 24 feet above
the snow was four degrees less cold than one suspended
 SJ feet above it. (Phil. Trans. 1780, p. 462.) Yet Mr.
Boyle has long since noticed similar fact (Boyle Abridg.
                                 a                                  i.
 p. 629), as related to him    by some navigators; and Foster
expressly mentions, that being to the leeward of an icy
mountain, probably many feet distant, the thermometer
 sunk four degrees, and rose to its former height when he
 had passed that mountain (Observat.         p. 73)    but when
                                                         ;

             a
the surface of the earth    is  generally colder (when no great
 evaporation takes place) than that nearer to its surface.
Thus during the intense cold of January 776, there hav

 ing been no fall of snow since the 24th, Van Swinden found
 the degree of cold on the morning of the 27th to be 8° 25',
 while Camper, in the same street, whose thermometer was
 some feet nearer to the earth, found      only     5'. (See Van

XXXV.       Account and Description of a Stone which fell from
    the Clouds in the Commune of Sales, near Ville-Franche,
    in the Department of the Rhone.             From a Memoir of
    M. De Dree, read in the National Institute April 11,
     1803*.
 We       have more than once entertained our readers with
phænomena analogous to that which is to be the subject of
the present memoir; and since the attention of philoso
phers has been directed to these singular facts, one might
say that they have been more frequent.              We cannot, and
indeed ought not, to explain them until their existence has
been fully proved, and until all the circumstances by which
thev are characterized are well known.                  The account
which we are about to transcribe is extracted from a pretty
long memoir on these phænomena read some time ago
before the National Institute, by M.deDree, brother-in-
law of Doloinieu, a very enlightened amateur of mine
ralogy, and possessor of one of the richest collections of
this kind in France.       Among the facts which he collected,
the one about to be mentioned has a striking character of
authenticity;      and it acquires a particular degree of in
terest from a comparison which proved to us that we ob
served the same meteor, without doubting, any more
 than others who saw it either at Geneva or in the western
 part of Swisserland a3 far as Berne, that it was one of
 those stones the origin of which it is so difficult to deter
 mine.
     "  In the month of February 1802 I was at Lyons with
 Dr. Fetetin, president of the Medical Society of that city,
 member of several learned societies, and author of a work
 entitled Nouveau MScanisme de I'Electricite : we were con
 versing on scientific subjects, when he asked me whether I
 had heard any thing of a meteor which appeared at Lyons
 some years ago ; and on my answering in the negative, he
 relatea the fact, of which he was a witness, in nearly the
 following manner :
     " About four years ago (said he) during the evening twi
 light in the month of March, the weather being serene, and
 not at all cloudy, there passed over Lyons, nearly in a di
 rection from east to west, a luminous ball, which, as it at
 tracted attention by the strong light it emitted in its pas
 sage, was almost generally observed.             He added, that he
 learned a few days after that this luminous globe had been

                                                                     seen

 818             Account and Description        of a   Stone
   seen by some travellers on Mount-Cenis ; and he was in
   formed at the same time that it had fallen in the environs
  of Ville-Franche under the form of an incandescent stone*
  a small fragment of which was sent to him.
     "  He assured me also, that a comparison he then made
  of the periods at which die meteor had been observed on
  Mount-Cenis, at Lyons, and at Ville-Franche, positively
  announced that it was the same ball which had traversed
  that line and shown itself in these three points.
      " I expressed to Dr. Petetin a desire of seeing the frag
  ment of this stone which he had in his possession ; and
  the doctor, judging, no doubt, from the anxietv I showed
  to obtain information respecting this phænomenon, how
  much I was interested in       it, was so kind as to offer me this
  fragment in case he should find it.
      " was the more desirous, indeed, to see die specimen
        I
 of this mineral mass, as hadI            in my power to compare
                                           it
it   with analogous specimens, one of which fell near Wold
  Cottage, in Yorkshire, on the 13th of December 1795, and
 another near Benares, in Bengal, on the 19th of September
1   796, a  fragment which   I    brought with me few years ago
                                                        a
 from    London,     where
                         I    received     from count de Bournon,

 F.   R.S.,  a       celebrated mineralogist.
      " Some ver)r
               time after Dr. Petetin sent me the fragment in
 question, and   I    was much surprised to find that           had
                                                               it   a
 perfect   similarity  to specimens    of   those which   fell at  Be
 nares and at Wold Cottage        ;    similarity

 in regard to the genus of stones but to the mineralogical
 species which enter into their composition, and also in re
 gard to the effects resulting from their movement in the
 atmospheric fluid.
     " As the details which Dr. Petetin was so kind as to
 transmit to me along with this valuable present gave me
reason to hope that      I    should be able to discover the exact
spot    where   this globe  fell, and the circumstances attending
its fall,   1 made researches in the neighbourhood of Ville-
Franche, which were not fruitless; for by successively ac-,
quiring more satisfactory information           I was at length di
rected towards the commune of Sales, at about the distance
of league and
    a              a    half to the north-west of Ville-Franche,
in the department of the Rhone, where learned that most

of the inhabitants had been witnesses of, and much fright
ened by, the arrival of this luminous body, which had fallen
in vineyard within three hundred paces of the village, and
    a
near the house of vintager named Pierre Crepier.

relating all the circumstancees of it with simplicity, and free
from that air of the marvellous from which minds not dir
rected by a knowledge of the principles of philosophy can
scarcely be preserved.         I proceeded with them towards the
house of Crepier, and it was there on the spot where the
stone buried itself in the earth that I received every inform
ation respecting    it,  and even obtained the last specimen of
this stone which Crepier had remaining.
     "  The following are all the circumstances collected inI
regard to this singular phænomenon, omitting the useless
reasoning in regard to its authenticity
     "
                                              :
        On the 12th of March 1798, about six in the evening,
the weather being calm and serene,         a     luminous globe of an
extraordinary appearance attracted           towards   the east the eyes
of the inhabitants of the commune of Sales and of the neigh
bouring villages, as they were returning from their labour           ;
and its rapid approach and horrid humming noise, like that
produced     by    an irregular and hollow body traversing the
atmosphere       with  rapidity, threw all the inhabitants of that
commune into the greatest terror, especially when they saw
it  pass over their heads at    a     very little elevation- Accord
ing    to  their  report   this  ball  left behind     it  long train of
                                                            a
 light, and emitted, with an almost continual crackling noise,
 small blue sparks of sire similar to small stars.
    " Its fall was then observed      by    three workmen who were
not more than fifty paces from          itj       One of them, named
Montillard,   a    voung man who was nearest to             it,
                                                             was struck
 with terror, and dropped his coat and billet of wood which
                                              a
he was carrying, in order that he might escape as fast as he
could.      The other two, named Chardon and Lapous, were
 no less frightened, and fled to Sales, where general alarm
                                                        a
 prevailed. These three witnesses agree in stating that this
 body moved with astonishing rapidity, and that after its
 fall they still heard    a kind of hissing noise proceeding from
 the place where   it   buried itself.
    " In regard to Crepier, he was at home where he was so
                                                   ;
 much frightened with the hissing of the body in the air, and
 the noise of its fall, which took place within less than twenty
          of his habitation, that at first he shut himself up with
 Eaces
 is   family in the cellar, and then in his bed-chamber; where
 fear prevailing over curiosity, he spent the night without
 daring to go out to examine what had happened.
     " Next morning he was called out             by  Chardon and La
 pous,    who    had  carried   with   them    M.  Blondel, adjunct of
 the commune of Sales,          and several   other  persons, and they

220             Account and Description     of a   Stone
 all repaired together to.the place where the luminous body
 had been seen to bury itself.      There, at the bottom of a
hollow, eighteen inches in depth, that is to sav, of the
whole thickness of the vegetable earth, they found a large,
black, irregular, ovoid mass, according to their expression
like a calf's head.    It was entirely covered with a blackish
crust ; it was no longer warm, and had the smell of gun
powder.      They observed also that it was split in several
places, so that Chardon by thrusting his bill into one of
the fissures made it fall to pieces.      I was not able to learn
properly whether this fissure was lined by a crust similar to
that on the surface ; they only thought they remembered
that it was partly black.      This mass, having been trans
ported to Grepier's house, their first care was to examine
the nature of so unexpected an object, and what it con
tained.      The stone therefore was weighed, and imme
diately broken ; but finding only a stone, from avarice,
which did not fail to succeed their emotions of fear, they
proceeded to a sentiment of indifference for this mass, while
the phænoinenon was imputed to the most whimsical and
supernatural causes, according to the kind of impression
which had been communicated to the spectators.
    " The weight of this stone was about twenty pounds,
    " The noise of this event was soon spread ; and the com
missioner of the executive power to the administration of
Ville-Franche being informed of       it,  he sent to request the
stone, with information respecting its fall.         fragment of
                                                     A
it,  weighing   about   seven  pounds,   was  brought to him,         a
part  of which,   with   an account   of  the  phænoinenon, he
transmitted to one of the members of the conventional as
sembly.   I   do not know what attention was paid to           it,
                                                              and
what effect it  produced, at time when every mind was ab
                             a
sorbed in politics.
    "  M. Place,    amerchant of Ville-Franche, who was at
Sales at the same time   I   was there, assured me that he was
a witness, as well as many inhabitants of Ville-Franche, to
the passage of this luminous globe over the town          that he
                                                           ;
heard its humming noise      ;  that its elevation could not ex
ceed 500 toises     and that its direction was from east              by
south to west     by ;
                    north.
    " I  must add, that the simplicity of most of the reports
made to me, their perfect agreement in all the important
points, and the great number of persons who saw this phæ
noinenon, which took place at that time of day most                  fa
vourable for its being generally observed, leave no doubt
with me    in  regard to the veracity of the account which
                                                               I   have

         which sell from the Cloiuk near Fille-Franclic.                         291
I   have here given, and       of the certainty of         the fact in ques
tion.
    " Some time ago, when conversing on the subject of this
phenomenon with professor Pictet, he recollected that at the
same period he and a number of the inhabitants of Geneva
and the neighbouring towns, as far as Berne, had observed a
luminous body which suddenly appeared in the southern re
gions, proceeding rapidly from east to west. This phæno-
menon at that time was considered to be a meteor ; but he is
so fully persuaded that this body is the same which fell at
Sales, that he has given me permission to quote his testimony*.
    " To these circumstances I shall join a description of the
characters of this mineral substance, in regard to the point
of view in which they ought to be considered by a minera
logist ; and I shall give the result of the analysis of it made
by Vauquelin, member of the Institute.
    " Its colour in the inside is an ash-gray formed by a
 mixture of whitish parts interspersed with black metallic
 points.
    " Its texture is gravelly, and the substances, of which
 I am about to speak, are disseminated in                   it,
                                                    as octaedral

    " The following are the substances found disseminated
 throughout the mass of this stone. The first          malleable   is
 iron in grains which readily rust, and which vary in size
 from an almost imperceptible point to        line in diameter,
                                                       a
 and even to the weight of twenty-four grains.
    " These grains of iron are malleable, soluble, and sus
 ceptible of attraction      by
                           the magnet.    They, however, differ
 from forged iron in having      whiter aspect and less ducti

 found      analysis. Those placed in the centre of the mass
           by

         have   perfect recollection of the appearance of this meteor.        Its

only for  a few seconds, during which        it diffi'sed throughout the whole
town an alarming light, though      it  passed at the distance of more than
twenty leagues to the south.       Its direction, according to estimation, was
precisely towards the quaiter in which            fell.
                                                  it      My learned colleague,
professor Prevost, embraced this opportunity of presenting to the Physical
Society established at Geneva   a   very interesting memoir on the bolides or
fire-balls, in which he collected considerations respecting the supposed

  822            Account and Description    of a  Stone
     "  The   second   substance  is lamellated pyrites (sulphuret
  of iron) of a white colour inclining a little to that of nickel :
 it is sometimes dispersed throughout the mass in grains, and
  sometimes it lines the fissures interspersed in the stene.
 This pyrites   experiences only a very slight, partial, and tran
 sient effervescence in acids : it is not susceptible of attrac
 tion by the magnet ; by the blowpipe it readily gives a frit
interspersed with small globules like other pyrites. That
 in a thin stratum on the sides of the fissures has a gray and
 less brilliant colour.      It contains less sulphur, and ap
 proaches near to malleable iron in grains;
    " The third, which is very rare, is under the form of
 spherical or irregular globules of a dark gray colour, brittle,
 and having a smooth compact fracture.          It produces no ef
 fervescence in acids ; is not susceptible of attraction by the
 magnet ; is refractory to the blowpipe, and assumes in it
only a red and black tint.        When scratched with a graver
this substance assumes a metallic colour like trap.
    " Besides the gray globules I found also other globular
and irregular bodies of an olive-green ground inclining
sometimes to yellow, the fracture of which has a fat shining
aspect like the steatites of Briancon, and which are not very
hard. As several of these bodies lose their distinguishing
character, approaching more or less to the appearance of
paste; and besides, as they are in very small quantity, I did
not think it proper to include them among the number of
the contained substances.
    "  The surface of this stone is a vitrified black crust,
slightly puffed up, which strikes fire with steel ; of a quarter
of a line in thickness at most, and in the surface of which
are observed a few grains of iron and some gray globules,
which being more refractory than the rest of the paste have
resisted the effects of the heat.
    " It is to these grains and these globules, which in all
probability have been detached from the mass by the fusion
of the neighbouring parts or by the intensity of the heat,
that we ought to ascribe those blue sparks which escaped
from the mass during its course.
    " It is also to be remarked, that in a fragment of this
stone the vitrification has been effected in a part of an in
terior fissure lined with pyrites, with this difference, that
this vitrification is much more puffed up.
    " The interior of the stone even in the parts nearest to
the vitrified crust clots not seem to have undergone any
change by the action of the fire, only its granulated tissue has
that lax aspect observed in all stones which with this kind of
                                                        aggregation

           which sell from the Clouis,near    Ville-Franche.     223
   aggregation have undergone a certain degree of heat ; an
   aspect which may he better distinguished than described.
   In regard to the globular bodies, they cannot be the result
   of a kind of fusion, since they have none of the characters
   of glass ; and being the most refractory of all those sub
   stances of which the stone is composed, they could not pass
   to the state of vitrification near pyrites, which, though the
   least alterable substance, has nevertheless retained its lamel-
   lated texture.
      "  The paste or earthy part even in small fragments ex
   periences in nitric acid a partial solution without losing its
   cohesion, and being before susceptible of attraction by the
  magnet is not so afterwards ; which announces that the iron
  only has been attacked by the acid. It however still retains
  some metallic grains, which are pyrites. Treated by the
  blowpipe it gives black frit, assumes the metallic aspect,
  and continues to be attractable.
      "   I shall not give the specific gravity of this stone : as
  it is not homogeneous, and as its gravity depends on the
  greater or less quantity of metallic particles, and especially
  on the iron found in it, no positive character can be de
  duced from this property.
      "  To conclude : I can assert that the earthy part of the
 interior of this mass, as well as each of the contained sub
  stances, is in its original state, and that the only changes
 which the fire has effected are the relaxation in the tissue
  which I have already mentioned ; and perhaps the change
 of colour, in case it has a particular one. I have also reason
 to think that in certain respects, and particularly in regard
 to texture, it approaches       some kinds of pot-stone or sili
 ceous serpentine containing metals.
     "   I shall conclude this description bv transcribing the
 letter in which Vauquelin communicated to me the result
of the analysis he made of this stone : — ' The stone which
you gave me to analyse (says he) consists of

    " On pulverizing this stone there were detached globules
of iron, one of which weighed about 24 grains. Its colour
is whiter thao that of ordinary iron, and, though ductile, it
is harder than bar iron.       It contains sulphur and nickel.
Whence it appears that the sulphurated hydrogen gas and
nickel found in it arise from the iron it contains.

analysis arise from the oxygen absorbed by the iron.          It

tract from this account may be interesting to you who have
contributed to place this astonishing phænomenon beyond
a doubt, and perhaps to the Chief Consul, who amidst so
many labours still finds means to devote some moments to
the sciences.
   When set out from Paris on the 26th of June, did not
              I                                                        I
proceed directly to Laigle.  Had the explosion been as sud
den as was announced,       must have been heard at great
                                    it                                     a
distance.     was therefore agreeable to the rules of criti
                It
cism, first to collect scattered testimonies, and to suffer
myself to be gradually conducted by them to the place
where the meteor was said to have burst for in regard to      ;
all the circumstances of the explosion the accounts could
not but agree, in whatever part they might be collected.
    * In    the next Number        we shall   give an account of the stones which
fell  the neighbourhood
       in                      of Enshisheim       and of Agen, taken from the
tame source.
                                                                       I       went

                   in the Neighbourhood  of Laigle.          225
      I went first to Alencon, fifteen leagues west-south-west
 of Laigle,     and in going thither I learned that a globe of
  fire had been seen proceeding towards the north.      The ap
 pearance of this globe had been followed by a violent ex
 plosion.      This took place on the 26th of April 1 802, at
 one in the afternoon.       My the direction of this phænome-
 non, the day, and particularly the hour, I judged that this
 had been the commencement of the meteor of Laigle.
      At Alencon nothing had been heard — in consequence, no
 doubt, of the usual noise which prevails in a large town ;
 but if I received only vague reports, I acquired a very im
 portant certainty, by the mineralogical collections of the
 country, that nothing exists in the neighbourhood of Laigle
 which has any rescniblance to the meteoric stones.
      From Alencon I proceeded to Laigle, traversing the vil
 lages, conducted by the accounts given me by the inhabi
 tants. All of them had heard the meteor on the day and
 at the hour mentioned.         In this manner I reached Laigle,
and proceeded to the house of our colleague Le Blond ; and
 I was happy to find in him the intelligence of a philoso
 pher and the kindness of a friend.
     The meteor did not burst at Laigle, but at the distance of
 half a league from it. I saw the awful traces of this phæ-
nomcuon ; I traversed all the places where it had been
heard ; I collected and compared the accounts of the inha
bitants : at last I found some of the stones themselves on
the spot, and they exhibited to me physical characters which
admit no doubt of the reality of their fall.
      If we first consider the physical testimonies, no meteoric
stones had been found in the hands of the inhabitants be
fore the explosion of the 26th of April.       The mineralogical
collections, formed on the spot with the greatest care for
several years, contained nothing of the kind.
     The founderies, iron works, and mines, in the neigh
bourhood which I visited, exhibited nothing in their pro
ductions or in their scoriæ which had the least affinity to
these substances.       No traces of a volcano are found in the
country.
     All of a sudden, and only since the time of the meteor,
these stones have been found on the ground and in the
hands of the inhabitants, who are better acquainted with
them than any other person.
     These stones are found only in a certain extent, in ground
foreign to the substances they contain, and in places where,
on account of their size and their number, it is impossible
they could have escaped notice.
     Vol. XVI. No.      63.         P            -          The

  226            Account      of a Fire-Ball uhich fell
     The largest of these stones when broken still exhale a
  strong sulphureous odour from their interior parts.                That
 of their surface has vanished, and the smallest exhale no
 sensible odour, so that the odour of the former seems also
 from its nature likely to be dissipated in the course of time.
     These are so manv physical proofs which attest that the
 meteoric stones of the neighbourhood of Laigle are foreign
 to the places where thev have been found ; that they were
 conveyed thither exactly at the time of the explosion, and
 by a cause which has modified the principles they contain.
     If we now consult the moral testimonies, what do we
 find? Twenty hamlets, dispersed in an extent of more
 than two leagues square, almost all the inhabitants of which
 declare  themselves        to have      been eye-w itnesses  of the me
 teor, attest that a dreadful shower of stones was projected
 from it. Among the number there are men, women, and
children. The)- are simple and unlettered peasants, labourers
possessed of strong natural sense and reason ; respectable
ecclesiastics, and voung people who having been military
men are free from the illusions of fear.              All these persons,
of professions, manners, and opinions so different, who had
very little or no intercourse with each other, agree in attest
ing the same fact, which they had no interest to invent :
they all refer it to the same day, the same hour, and the
same moment, makine use of the same comparisons ; and
this fact, so strongly and so generally attested, is only a
consequence of the physical proofs previously collected ;
which is, that stones of a peculiar nature fell in that coun
try immediately after the explosion of April 26.
    Besides, traces which strongly attest the fall of these
masses, never mentioned without terror, are still shown.
The inhabitants say that they saw them descend along the
roofs of the houses like hail, break the branches of the
trees, and rebound after they fell on the pavement.                 They
say they saw the earth smoke around the largest of them,
and that they still burnt after they were in their hands.
These accounts are given and the traces shown only in a
certain extent. It is there only that meteoric stones are
found on the ground.                Not a fragment is found beyond
that district, and     there   is  not   a single person who pretend >
to have seen any       of  them     fall  beyond it.
    A third kind     of  proof    results   from certain physical pecu
liarities uniformly      related   by   the  inhabitants of the country,
who are too       little   enlightened      to have foreseen the conse
quences.     I' here allude to the successive changes observed
in the hardness of the stones and in the odour exhaled ;
                                                                 changes

                in the Neighbourhood  of Laigle.           227
changes   which, according to the report of eye-witnesses,
among whom we must reckon our colleague Le Blond, took
place in the interval of a few days after the explosion of the
meteor, and of which I myself observed very sensible traces
on breaking fragments of different dimensions ; and this
new comparison of testimonies and facts serves only to
show a new agreement between them.
    All the physical and moral proofs which it has been pos
sible to collect are therefore concentrated, and converge to
wards one point : and if we consider the manner" in which
I was led, by a comparison of the testimonies, to the place
of the explosion ; the number of particulars which I col
lected on the spot ; their coincidence with those which       I
brought from the distance of ten leagues ; the multitude of
the witnesses; their moral character; the resemblance of
their accounts, and perfect agreement from whatever part
obtained, without its being possible to discover a single ex
ception in that respect ; it may be concluded, without the
smallest doubt, that the fact to which these proofs refer
actually took place, and that stones really fell in the neigh
 bourhood of Laigle on the 26th of April 1 802.
    From the aggregate of the testimonies we have deduced
 the following description of the phænomenon :
    On Tuesday, April 26, 1802, about one in the afternoon,
 the weather being serene, there was observed from Caen,
 Pont-Audemer,      and the environs of Alencon, Falaise, and
 Verneuil, a fiery globe of a very brilliant splendour, which
 moved in the atmosphere with great rapidity.
    Some moments after there was heard at Laigle, and in
 the environs of that city to the extent of more than thirty
 leagues in every direction, a violent explosion, which lasted
 five or six minutes.
    At first there were three or four reports like those of a
 cannon, followed by a kind of discharge which resembled
 a firing of musketry; after which there was heard a dreadful
 rumbling like the beating of a drum. The air was calm
 and the sky serene, except a few clouds, such as are fre
 quently observed.
    This noise proceeded from a small cloud which had a
  rectangular form, the largest side being in a direction from
 east to west.    It appeared motionless all the time that the
 phænomenon lasted. But the vapour of which it was com
  posed was projected     momentarily from the different sides
  by the effect of the successive explosions.   This cloud was
  about half a league to the north-north-east of the town of
  Laigle : it was at a great elevation in the atmosphere, for
                               P2                           the

228                On different Steeps         for curing
the inhabitants of two hamlets a league distant from each
other saw it at the same time above their heads.         In the
whole canton over which this cloud hovered, a hissing noise
like that of a stone discharged from a sling was heard, and
a multitude of mineral masses exactly similar to those di
stinguished by the name of meteoric stones were seen to fall
at the same time.
    The district in which the stones fell forms an elliptical
extent of about two leagues and a half in length and nearly
one in brcldth, the greatest dimension being in a direction
from south-east to north-west, forming a declination of
about 22°. This direction which the meteor must have
followed is exactly that of the magnetic meridian ; which
is a remarkable result.
    The largest of these stones fell at the south-east extre
mity of the larsje axis of the ellipse ; the middle-sized ones
fell in the centre, and the smallest at the other extremity.
It thereby appears that the largest fell first, as might natu
rally be supposed.
    The largest of all those which fell weigh 17-J pounds.
The smallest I saw weigh about two gros, which is the
thousandth part of the former. The number that fell is
certainly above two or three thousand.
    In this account I have confined myself to a simple rela
tion of facts ; I have endeavoured to view them as any other
 person would have done, and I have employed every care
to present them with exactness.       I leave to the sagacity of
 philosophers  the numerous   consequences     that may be de
 duced from them ; and I shall consider myself happy if they
 find that I have succeeded in placing beyond a doubt the
 most astonishing phænomenon ever observed by man.

XXXVIII.         Nexv Method   of preparing corrosive Sullimate
     (hyperoxidated   Muriate  of Mercury) in the kumid Way.
     By   M.  L. Von   Schmidt     Phiseldeck*.
At    is well known how much apothecaries desirous of pre
paring their own medicines are indebted to Mr. Westrumb
for having furnished them with a method of preparing cor
 rosive sublimate without being exposed to the dangerous
 vapour it emits during the sublimation.               For some time
 past   I have  employed myself, merely        from   scientific   views,
 in preparing corrosive sublimate according to this method.
 But however much I may be sensible -of the advantages of
 this process, I cannot help regretting the loss sustained in
 the nitric and muriatic acids, which in general cost so
 much trouble and expense before they can be obtained pure.
 I reflected a long time on the means of avoiding this loss,
 and at length discovered a process much more œconomical
 than that of the chemist Hameln.              The question was, to
 dissolve the mercury in the cheapest concentrated acid (this
 acid, without doubt, was the. sulphuric acid), and to present
 to the oxide of mercury the muriatic acid without having
 separated it from its alkaline base.        I resolved then to pre
 pare a solution of mercury in sulphuric acid, and to decom
 pose the sulphate of mercury by muriate of soda.                  I then
 hoped that I could easily separate the two salts that were
 formed by crystallization, as the sulphate of soda for its
 solution took only eight parts of cold water, whereas corro
 sive sublimate takes 162; but I found that after the first

  crystallization the two salts mixed, and that no other means
  of separating them remained but by alcohol. I shall pass
 over in silence the operations, which were attended with
  more or less success in this point of view, and describe
  only the process which I definitively adopted.
      1 introduced into a tubulated retort       two ounces of mer
 cury    and   three  ounces   three  gros  of concentrated    sulphuric
 acid ; 1 then adapted to the retort a receiver, without luting
it,    and made    a  pretty strong fire. During the solution there
 was disengaged        a very considerable quantity of sulphureous
 gas.     When nothing remained in the retort but                a  white
 mass, added
      I              a solution of 5^ ounces of marine salt in six
 ounces of water, and exposed the mixture to strong ebulli
 tion for half an hour.         A complete solution took place.       I
 filtered the liquid while still in         state of ebullition, put
                                                 a                     it
 into a    retort, and distilled     to dryness.
                                      it            On the remaining
 mass I     poured 16 ounces of alcohol, and caused         it  to digest
 for some hours.         I then decanted the liquid from off the
 residuum, filtered         again warm, and put it once more into
                           it
 the retort after   I   had washed         it,
                                          taking care not to spread
any of    it    in the neck of the retort, and distilled      it  to dry
ness.  I      must here remark, that the distilled liquid, which
at first had the colour of Malaga wine, assumed, after the
solution was concentrated, the colour of water de Rabel               ;
and the saline mass, after the complete evaporation of the
alcohol, was exceedingly white. Lime water made no change
in the colour of this liquids
 I      poured over the mass in the retort           ounces of water
                                                     12               ;
I    boiled it    to solution, and, having filtered the liquor, ex
posed  it    to crystallize.    Very beautiful crystals in the form
of elongated prisms were deposited.                 then poured over
                                                     I
the residuum eight ounces of new spirit of wine, and again
obtained    a   considerable quantity of corrosive sublimate. The
distilled liquid," after being rectified on half an ounce of pot
ash, was perfectly pure.
     By employing this method, corrosive sublimate, in my
opinion, will cost one-half less than                by
                                                    Westrumb's pro
cess. Sulphuric acid costs only one-third of what the nitric
acid does   ;    and there      no comparison between the price
                                 is
of pure muriatic acid and that of marine salt.             I   therefore
flatter myself that this method will meet with            a  favourable
reception.

     XXXIX.                      Observations      on lite Plant called St. John's
                                      Wort.      By C. Baunach*.
    Ot. John's wort       is a very common plant, which grows
    in  great abundance in the fields, in the woods, and in uncul
    tivated places.   Botanists have described its distinguishing
    characters under the name of hypericum perfbratiim : it is
    employed in medicine as an excellent vulnerary and balsamic
    remedy ; but unfortunately its juice is of little utility, since
    it is unknown to the greater part of dyers, in whose art,
    however, it may be applied with success.       St. John's wort
    is a resinous plant, the flowers and summits of which, filled
    with seeds, contain a juice soluble in water, in alcohol, and
    vinegar : it diffuses throughout the first two liquids a red
    colour like that of blood, and in the latter a most splendid
    and beautiful crimson : when combined with acids or me
    tallic solutions it presents a beautiful yellow colour ; which
    proves that it contains two colouring matters, one more
    soluble than the other, that is the red.
         To dye cloth, wool, silk, and cotton, yellow, it is suffi
    cient to immerse them in water properly impregnated with
    the juice of this plant and a certain quantity of mordant.
    The salt best for being used as a mordant with this colour
    is sulphate of aluminc, combined with a proper proportion
    of potash (carbonate of potash), in which the stuffs are suf
    fered to remain some time ; for it is on the length of the
    time, the quantity of the mordant, and the heat employed,
    that the fixity of the colour, and the shades resulting from                                        it,

    in this operation becomes the true mordant, espec ially as
    the colouring principle resides in          matter almost purelya

     The plant in question contains a great deal of tannin.              A
solution of common glue in water, and several experiments
made in this respect, have proved it to me in a convincing
 manner.
     Having poured into the juice of St. John's wort a little
 solution of the sulphate of iron, there was formed a preci
 pitate of a blackish brown colour which had the property of
 absorbing oxygen, of becoming at length insoluble in water,
 and of assuming the characters of a concrete resin.
     St. John's wort contains no essential oil. Having sub
jected a certain quantity of this plant to distillation with
 water, the product of this liquid had a strong and agreeable
 odour, in which I could discover no trace of volatile oil.
     The juice of St. John's wort does not dissolve in fat nor
 in volatile oils, but it combines very well with resins. For
 this purpose, having the juice from the plant, it was poured
 into flat dishes to be desiccated.         This operation may be
 performed by placing the dishes in an oven some time after
 the bread has been taken out : it is then reduced to powder,
 in which state it may be united to turpentine. This solu
 tion is easily effected in a copper mortar which has been
 well heated.       The resin saturated in this manner may be
 mixed with fat and volatile oils.         If combined with olive
 oil it forms a medicine known in pharmacy under the name
 of oil of hypericum, which when prepared in this manner
 has decisive properties, and may be employed with success.
 When incorporated with linseed oil it produces a beautiful
 red varnish, which may be used with advantage for furni
 ture.
      It is certain that the juice of St. John's wort is a resino-
 extractive substance, in which the resin is considerably pre
 dominant.        The phænomena of its solution in water, al
 cohol, and resin, and in particular its inflammability, suf
  ficiently prove it. The last property is so great, that when
 exposed on a burning coal it burns like incense, and emits
 very little smoke.       It has the property of absorbing the ox
 ygen     of the  atmosphere;    it is no way altered in the airj its
 taste is somewhat bitter, and weakly astringent.

    dile of Saint Domingo had a great resemblance to that of
    the Nile, thought it a matter of importance to furnish na
    turalists with the means of confirming this circumstance :
   he therefore was desirous of making a sacrifice to us of two
   crocodiles which had been presented to him.                 The arrival
   of the younger, which was brought over alive, was an
   nounced at the time in the public journals ; but it died just
   when about to be landed at Havre.               The second reached us
   in Nivose : it was much larger ; it had been properly pre-
            at Saint Domingo, and served as an original for de
     feating the figure which accompanies this memoir. (See
   f)ared
   Plate V.)
        The fact mentioned by the officers attached to general
   Leclerc's staff, was not yet known : on the contrary, natu
   ralists were persuaded that America contained only one kind
   of crocodile *, the principal characters of which were an
   obtuse muzzle, a cavity in the upper jaw for receiving the
  fourth lower tooth, and the hind- feet half-webbed.                 They
  were therefore much surprised to see arrive from Saint Do
  mingo a crocodile similar to those of the old continent,
  having, like them, the muzzle oblong, an indentation in
  the side of the upper jaw to afford a passage to the fourth
  lower tooth, and the hind-feet entirely webbed. Our first
  suspicion on receiving this animal was, that the identity of
 species was proved, and that thus the real crocodile existed
 in the warm countries of both hemispheres.
       This, however, was a result so contrary to one of the
  finest laws established by Buffon, a law of the greatest im
 portance in zoology as well as in the history of the revolu
 tions of the globe, that I did not think proper to admit this
 iirst idea without a more accurate examination.
       This law, founded on an observation Buffon had made,
 that no species of the torrid zone had been primitively
placed in both continents, had either never been contra
dicted, or had been so only by objections the weak founda
tion of which had been soon discovered.
      I therefore compared the crocodile of Saint Domingo
with that which I had brought from Egypt, and it gave me
pleasure to find that there was a difference between these
animals sufficient to make them be considered as two di
stinct species ; for I do not think there is any reason for
observing, in opposition, that their differences ought to be
ascribed to age.          They are both nearly of the same size j

and  I was even enabled to confirm, that age in the crocodile
gives rise to other differences than those of which I am
about to speak.   I can mention, by way of proof, the two
individuals for which we are indebted to the enlightened
zeal   of general Leclerc : though different in age and size,
they still appeared to me to be perfectly similar.
    The crocodile of Saint Domingo resembles that of the Nile
in regard to all those characters which serve to distinguish
 the latter from the caiman :        it,

                                                         is
four to six. The body of the crocodile of Saint Domingo          is
also proportionably longer, and the tail consists of three
bands more, twenty in the one, and seventeen in the other.
The first two of the lower teeth are so long that they pierce
the upper jaw from one side to the other whereas they are
                                                ;
 smaller in that of the Nile, and form for themselves only
two small cavities in which they are received.       The fourth
 tooth of the lower jaw of the former can searcelv be distin
guished from the two neighbouring ones, while in the
other crocodile these fourth teeth are much larger. The
 plates which cover the back are much fewer in number,
and more unequally distributed in the crocodile of Saint
Domingo the ridges of each are only really prominent in
               ;
the exterior row, all those of the middle are almost entirely
effaced    on the other hand, in the crocodile of the Nile
           :
every plate and ridge has the same form, the same promi
 nency, and the same respective arrangement. In           aword,
all the scales, even those which cover the extremities, are
 perfectly square in the crocodile of Saint Domingo, and
 round or hexagonal in that of the Nile.
    All these differences appear to me to furnish so many
 inductions proper for making us believe that the crocodile
 of Saint Domingo forms species distinct from that of the
                                a
Nile. But         this fact cannot be established at present in
                   if
 an incontestable manner, there      at least no reason to con

                               Buffon as invalidated by. the dis
 covery at Saint Domingo of crocodile with elongated jaws.

  all          Operations. Bij C. Paysse, Professor of
        chemical
   Chemistry*.
At is generally admitted that the rapid progress which che
mistry has made during the last twenty years, is in part owing
to the different kinds of apparatus invented by the immortal
Lavoisier, and the precautions employed in the art of luting.
In this point of view lutings have been of essential service
to chemists, since bv facilitating the condensation of many
aeriform products they have afforded us the means of de
termining their nature, and appreciating their volume as
well as their gravity. This truth did not escape the sagacity
of the celebrated chemist Chaptal, who in his Elements of
Chemistry says :
                    " On the art of luting an apparatus pro
perly the whole success of an operation depends."
   Among the substances most used for this purpose, are
reckoned the fat luting paste of almonds or of linseed, the
oil of which is extracted, and mixed with strong glue, and
that of the white of eggs, and new cheese united to lime.
These different kinds of luting are attended with inconve.
niences which render them improper for being employed
under all circumstances.       Fat luting for example, composed
of dry clay and oil, combined with an oxide of lead, can
not be applied but on parts which receive a weak impression
from the heat ; for they liquefv at a low temperature, soon
run, and consequently become unfit for the proposed end :
that of linseed and almonds, mixed with glue or gelatine,
is often too porous, easy to be destroyed by acids, and                       by-
ammonia, when in            gaseous state
                            a                those prepared with
                                                     :
the white of eges, and cheese, mixed with lime, are only
attended with "the inconveniency of becoming too soon
solid, and immediately after mixture          so that;      exceed-,

   After making a great number of mixtures with different
substances, I thought it my duty to adopt the following,
which gave me a homogeneous compound, which drying as
slowly as could be desired, acquired very great hardness and
became very compacts so as to have as! the properties           I
wished for :
   Take the whites of eggs with their yolks, carbonate of
lime in powder, or lime strongly slaked in the air, equal in
weight to about one half that of the eggs ; and having put
the whole on a piece of linen, apply it in the usual manner.
   This luting, the composition of which is simple, pos
sesses when dry a certain degree of elasticity. I have formed
of it vessels impermeable to water, and susceptible of being
polished by the lathe. In a word, this mixture resembles
that substance called sea scum, of which tobacco pipes are
made.
XLII.    Account of the Travels ofM. A. de Humboldt in
    South America, extracted from some of his Letters *.
 lYl. Humboldt's brother, who is now at Rome, received
from him lately three letters: one dated Quito, June 3,
 1802; another, Cuenca, July 13, 1802; and the third, Lima,
the capital of Peru, November 25, 1802.         They announce
that M. Humboldt will soon return, and that he expected
to land in the month of August or September at Cadiz, or
Corunna ; but the last of his letters in particular is the most
interesting.    In the following extract from it care has been
taken to insert every thing worthy of attention in the other
two :
      MT DEAR BROTHER,                     Lima, Nov. 25, 1802.
   You must have learned by my preceding letters that I
had reached Cjuito, at which we arrived by traversing the
6now of Quiridian and Tolima ; for as the cordillera of the
Andes forms three separate branches, and as we were atSanta
Fe de Bogota, on that which is the most eastern, it was ne
cessary to cross the highest to approach the coasts of the
South Sea. Oxen are the only animals which can be employ
ed in this passage for transporting baggage.      Travellers in
general are carried by men called largeros. They have a
chair, in which the traveller is seated, tied to their back ;
they travel about four hours journey every day, and in five
 or six weeks earn only fourteen piastres.       We preferred

*38              Jecmnt of M. Humloldss Travels
travelling on foot ; and the weather beine exceedingly fine,
we spent only seventeen days in these solitudes, which ex
hibit no trace ot' their bavins ever been inhabited : we slept
in huts constructed of the leaves of die heliconia, which
travellers carry with them on purpose. On the western side
of the Andes there are marshes in which we sunk up to the
knees. The weather had changed, and during the last days
of our journey there fell such torrents of rain that our boots
rotted on our legs ; and we arrived at Carthago with our
legs naked and covered with bruises,' but enriched with a
beautiful collection of new plants, of which I have a great
number of drawings.
   From Carthago we went to Popavan by Buga, crossing
the beau ti fill yaflcy of the river Cauca, and having always
at our sides the mountain of Choca, and the platina mines
which it contains.
   During the month of November 1801 we remained at
Popayan, and went to visit the basaltic mountains of Ju-
lusuito; the mouths of the volcano of Purace, which with
a horrid noise throw out vapours of hydro-sulphurous water ;
and the porphvritic granites of Pische, which form columns
of from five to seven planes, similar to those which I re
member to have seen in the Fuganean mountains of Italy,
and which are described by Strange.
   The greatest difficulty still remained ; which was, to go
from Popayan to Quito. It was necessary to cross the
Paramos from Pasto, and even in the rainy season, which
had already commenced.         The name of Paramo is given in
the Andes       to every place at the height of 1700 or 2000
toises, where vegetation ceases, and where a cold which pe
netrates to the bones is experienced.       To avoid the heats
of the valley of Patia, where people in the course of one
night are seized with fevers which continue three or four
months, and which are known under the name of calattu-
ras de Patia (fevers of Patia), we passed the summit of
the cordillera by horrid precipices, in order to proceed from
Popayan to Almager, and thence to Pasto, situated at the
bottom of a terrible volcano.
   Nothing can be more frightful than the entrance and out
let of this valley, in which we spent the Christmas holidays,
and where the inhabitants received us with the utmost hos
pitality.   They were covered with thick forests, situated
among marshes where the mules sunk half up to the backs,
and w e passed ravines so deep and so narrow that we thought
we were entering the galleries of a mine.     The roads there
fore are paved with the bones of mules which have perished
                                                          here

                       in Smith America.                    939
here  of cold and fatigue. The whole province of Pasto,
comprehending the environs of Guachucal and Tuqueres,
is a cold plain, almost above that point at which vegetation
can take place, and surrounded by volcanoes and soufricres
which continually throw up clouds of smoke. The un
fortunate inhabitants of these deserts have no other food
but potatoes ; and when these fail, as they did last year, they
go into the mountains to cat the trunk of a small tree called
achupalla ( pourretia pitcarnia) . As this tree however is
the food also of the bears of the Andes, the latter often
dispute with them the only nourishment which these ele
vated regions afford.    To the north of the volcano of Pasto
I discovered in the small Indian village of Voisaco, at the
height of 1370 toises above the level of the sea, a red por
phyry with an argillaceous base inclosing vitreous feldspar1
and horn stone, which has all the properties of the serpen
tine of the Fichtel-Gebirge.     This porphyry has very evi
dent poles, and shows no attractive force. After having
been wet day and night for two months, and exposed to the
danger of drowning by a very sudden rise of the waters,
accompanied with earthquakes, we arrived on the 6th of
January 1 802 at Quito, where the marquis of Salvaalegre was
so kind as to prepare for us a house, which after so many
fatigues afforded us all the conveniences that we could have
wished for at Paris, or at London.
   Quito is a beautiful town, but the sky is dismal and cloudy.
The neighbouring mountains exhibit little verdure, and the
cold is very considerable. The great earthquake of Fe
bruary 4th 1797, which agitated the whole province, and de
stroyed in a moment from thity-five to forty thousand peo
ple, has also been fatal to the survivors. It has so changed
the temperature of the air, that the thermometer generally
stands at from 4° to 10° of Reaumur, and rarely ascends to
 16° or 17°; while Bouguer always observed it at 15° or 16*.
Since that catastrophe there have been continual earth
quakes : and what shocks ! It is probable that the whole
elevated part is only one volcano.       What are called the
mountains of Cotopaxi and Pinchincha are only small sum
mits, the craters of which form different apertures all ter
minating in the same hollow.     The earthquake of 1 797 un
fortunately proved this hypothesis, for the earth everywhere
opened and vomited up sulphur, water, &c.             Notwith
standing these horrors and dangers with which nature has
surrounded the inhabitants of Quito, they are cheerful, lively,
and agreeable.     Their town breathes nothing but pleasure ;
and no where does there appear so decided a taste for amuse
                                                        ment.

   240            Account   of M. Humboldt's Travels
  ments.     It is in this manner that man is accustomed to sleep
  soundly   On   the brink of a precipice.
     We resided nearly eight months in the province of Quito ;
 that is to say, from the beginning of January to the month
 of August, and employed that time in visiting the different
 volcanoes. We examined in succession the summits of Pin-
 chincha, Cotopaxi, Antisana, and Ilinica, spending from
 a fortnight to three weeks on each of them ; and always re
 turning in the intervals to Quito, which we left on the 9th
 of June 1802 to proceed to the environs of Chimboraco,
 which is situated in the southern part of the province.
     I twice ascended, viz. on the 26th and 28th of May 1502,
 to the edge of the crater of Pinchincha, a mountain which
 overlooks the town of Quito. Before, no person, as far as
 I  know, except Condamine, ever saw it ; and Condamine
himself arrived there onlv after five or six days of fruitless
researches,     and without instruments ; and* on account of
 the excessive cold, could remain 011 it only twelve or fifteen
minutes.       I succeeded in carrying thither my instruments;
 I made important measurements, and collected some of the
 air to analyse it. The first time I ascended I was accom
 panied only by an Indian. As La Condamine approached
 the crater at the lower part of its edge covered with snow,
 I made my first attempt by following his traces; but we
 were in danger of perishing.          The Indian fell into a fis
 sure up to the breast ; and we observed with horror that we
 had walked on a bridge of frozen snow, for at the distance
 of some paces from us there were holes through which dav-
 light appeared.       We then found ourselves on arches which
adhere to the very crater.        Alarmed, but not discouraged,
 I changed my project. From the circumference of the cra
ter there arise, projecting themselves as I may sav over the
abyss, three peaks or rocks not covered with snow ; because
the vapours exhaled from the mouth of the volcano conti
nually dissolve it.       I climbed up one of these rocks, and
found at its summit a stone, which being supported at one
end only, and hollow below, projected over the precipice
in the form of a balcony. Here I stationed myself to make
experiments.        But this stone was only about twelve feet in
length    and  six  in breadth, and was strongly agitated by fre
quent    shocks   of  an earthquake, of which I counted eighteen
in less than thirty minutes. That we might examine the
bottom of the crater better, we lay down on our bellies j
and I do not think that the imagination can conceive any
thing more gloomy and frightful than what we then saw.
The mouth of the volcano forms a circular hole of nearly a
                                                          league

                          in South America.                        £41
 league   in circumference, the edges of which, cut perpendi
 cularly, arc covered with snow at the top. The inside is very
 black, but the gulph is so immense, that the summits of
 several mountains placed there can be distinguished. These
 summits seemed to be 300 toiscs below us : you may judge
 then where their bases must be.           I have no doubt that the
 bottom of the crater is on a level with the town of Quito. La
 Condamine found this crater extinct, and even covered with
 snow ; but we had melancholy news to carry to the inha
 bitants of Quito, that the volcano in their neighbourhood was
 now burning. We were convinced of this beyond all doubt
 by the most evident signs. When we approached the mouth
 of it we were almost suffocated by sulphureous vapours.
 We even saw blue flames moving about here and there, and
 every two or three minutes we experienced strong shocks of
 an earthquake, with which the edges of the crater were agi
 tated, and of which nothing was perceived at the distance
nf 100 toises. 1 suppose that the great catastrophe of Fe
 bruary 7th 1797 kindled up the flames also of Finchincha.
After visiting this mountain alone I returned two days after,
accompanied bv my friend Bonpland, and Charles de Mon-
tufar the son of the marquis de Solvaalegre.             We were fur
nished with more instruments than the preceding time, and
measured the diameter of the crater and the height of the
mountain.       We found the former to be "Hi toises *, and
the latter 2177.       In the interval of two days which took
place between our excursions to Finchincha we had a very
violent earthquake at Quito. The Indians ascribed it to some
powder which I must have thrown into the volcano.
    During our journev to the volcano of Antisana, the wea
ther was so favourable that we ascended to the height of
 2773 toiscs.     The barometer fell in that elevated region to
 14 inches 7 lines ; and in consequenee           of the rarity of the
air the blood flowed from our lips, gums, and even eyes.
We experienced extreme weakness, and one of the persons
who accompanied us fainted. It was before thought im
possible to ascend higher than the summit called Curazon,
which is 2470 toiscs in height, and which La Condamine
reached.     On analysing the air brought from the highest
point to which we ascended, it gave 0*008 of carbonic acid
for 0-218 of oxygen gas.
    We paid a visit also to the volcano of Cotopaxi, but it was
impossible for us to reach the mouth of the crater. It is not
        '*
           The crater of Vesuvius is only 311 toises in diameter.

 true that this mountain has become lower since the earth
 quake of 1797.
     On the 9th of June 1 802 we left Quito to proceed to the
 southern part of the province, where we wished to examine
 and measure Chimboraco and Tunguragua ; and to take
 a plan of the whole country convulsed by the grand cata
 strophe of 1 797-    We succeeded in approaching to within
 about 250 toises of the summit of the immense colossus of
 Chimboraco.      A ridge of volcanic rocks, destitute of snow,
 facilitated our ascent.   We ascended to the height of 3031
 toises, and felt ourselves incommoded in the same manner
 as we had been on the summit of Antisana.         Two or three
 days even after our return to the plain we were still subject
 to an indisposition, which we could ascribe only to the effect
 of the air in these elevated regions, which by analysis gave
 us 20 hundreds of oxygen. The Indians by whom we were
 accompanied deserted us before we reached that height, say
 ing that we intended to kill them. Bonpland, Charles
 Montufar, and one of my domestics, who carried a part of
jny instruments, were the only persons who remained with
 me: nevertheless, we could have continued our journey to
 the top had we not been prevented by a fissure too deep to be
 crossed.    We therefore thought proper to descend. Being
 ill secured from the cold of these elevated regions, we suf
 fered very much ; and I in particular had the misfortune to
 lacerate my foot by a fall a few days before, which subjected
 me to great pain in a road where we every moment struck our
 toes against sharp stones, and were obliged to examine the
 ground at every step. La Condamine found the height of
 Chimboraco to be nearly 3217 tpises. Trigonometricalmea-
 surement, which I made at two different times, gave 3267
 tpises, and I have reason to place some confidence in my
  operations. All this enormous colossus, as well as all the
  high mountains of the Andes, consists not of granite, but of
  porphyry, from the base to the summit ; and the porphyry
  is 1900 toises in thickness. The short stay which we made
  at that enormous height was dismal and melancholy : we
  were enveloped by a thick fog, which only suffered us from
  time to time to have a glimpse of the horrid abysses by which
  we weie surrounded. No living creature, not even the con-
  dour, which on Antisana continually hovered over our
  heads, was to be seen. Small kinds of moss were the only
  organized beings which reminded us that we were still in the
  neighbourhood of the earlh.
     It is almost probable that Chimboraco, like Pinchincha
                                                             and

                         in South America.                     243
and Antisana, is of a volcanic nature. The ridge on which
we ascended consists of burnt and scorified rock, mixed with
pumice stone.       It resembles all the currents of lava in this
country ; and continues beyond that point where I was ob
liged to set bounds to my researches, towards the summit of
the mountain.       It is possible that this summit may be the
crater of an extinguished volcano ; and this is even probable.
The idea of this possibility, however, makes one shudder —
and with reason ; for, if the volcano should be rekindled,
this colossus would destroy the whole province.
   The mountain of Tunguragua sunk down at the period of
the earthquake of 1797.        Bouguer makes its height to be
2620 toises; I found it to be only 2531 : it has lost there
fore nearly 100 toises of its height. The inhabitants of the
neighbouring country assert that they have seen its summit
crumble down before their eyes.
   During our stay at Riobaniba, where we spent some weeks
with the brother of Charles Montufar, who is corregidor
there, we by chance made a very curious discovery. The
state of the province of Quito before the conquest of the
inca Tupayupagi * is absolutely unknown.          But the king of
the Indians, Leandro Zapla, who resides at Lican, and whose
mind is highly cultivated, has in his possession manuscripts
written by one of his ancestors in the sixteenth century,
which contain the history of that period. These manuscripts
are written in the language of Paraguay, which formerly was
the general language of Quito ; but in the course of time it
gave place to that of the Incas, or the Anichna, and is now
lost.   Fortunately, another of Zapla's ancestors amused
himself in translating these manuscripts into Spanish. We
made extracts from these valuable documents, and particu
larly in regard to the memorable period of the eruption of
the mountain called Nevado delAttas, which must have been
the highest in the universe, superior even to Chimboraco, and
which the Indians called Capa-Urcu, 'the chief of moun
tains.' Ouainia Abomatha, the last independent cochocando
 (king of the country), reigned at that time at Lican. The
priests informed him that this catastrophe was a sinister pre
sage of his destruction.
                              " The face of the universe," said
               "
they to him, is changing 5 other gods will expel ours. Let
 us not oppose what has been ordained by fate."            The Pe
ruvians indeed introduced into the country the worship of
 the sun.    The eruption of the mountain continued seven
 years, and Zapla's manuscript asserts that the shower of
ashes at Lican was so abundant that continual night pre-

                                  Q  2                       vailed

 £44            Account of  M. Humloldt's     Travels
vailed during that period. When the quantity of volcanic
 matters which are round in the plain of Tapia around the
 enormous mountain which then crumbled to pieces, is con
 sidered, and when we reflect that Cotopaxi has often in
 volved Quito in darkness for fifteen or eighteen hours, we
 may believe that the exaggeration of this account is not
 very great.     This manuscript, the traditions which I col
 lected at Parime, and the hieroglyphics I saw in the desert
 of Casiquiare, where at present no vestiges of mankind re
 main, added to the ideas offered by Clavigero respecting the
 emigration of the Mexicans towards the southern part of
 America, have given rise to some conjectures on the origin
 of these people, which I purpose to explain as soon as I can
  find leisure.
     I have applied also with great assiduity to the study of the
 American languages, and I have seen how much what La
  Condamine says of their poverty is false.        The Carib lan
 guage is rich, beautiful, energetic, and polished : it is in
  no want of expressions for abstract ideas.          It speaks of
  posterity, eternity, existence,  8cc. ; and  the numerical  signs
 are sufficient to express all the possible combinations of fi
  gures. I applied in particular to the Inca language : it is
  generally spoken in company ; and is so rich in delicate and
  varied phrases, that the young men, in order to sav soft
  things to the ladies, when they have exhausted all the re
  sources of the Castillan, begin to speak Inca.        These two
  languages, and others equally rich, are sufficient to prove
  that America formerly possessed a greater degree of culture
  than the Spaniards found there in 1492.          But I have col
  lected still further proofs, not only at Mexico and in Peru,
  but even at the court of the king of Bogota, a country the
  history of which is absolutely unknown inEurope, and whose
  mythology even and fabulous traditions are highlv inter
  esting. The priests were acquainted with the art of draw
  ing a meridian line, and observing the moment of the sol
  stice. They reduced the lunar year to a solar by interca
  lations ; and I have in my possession a heptagon stone,
  found near Santa Fe, whicli they employed lor calculating
   these intercalary days. But what is still more, even at Ere-
  vato, in the interior of l'arime, the savages believe that the
  moon is inhabited by men ; and know by tradition from
   their ancestors, that it derives its light from the sun.
      From Riobamba      I proceeded by the famous paramo of
   Assuay   towards  Cuenca,   after having visited the large sul
   phur  mines   of Tirrau.   It  was this mountain of sulphur
   which the negroes who revolted in 1797> after the earth-
. quake, attempted     to set on sire.     This no doubt was the
                                                               most

                         in South America.                     245
most desperate      project ever attempted, for they hoped by
 tlie^c means' to form a volcano which would swallow up the
whole province of Alaussy.        At the height of the paramo
of Assuay, an elevation of 2300 toises, are the magnificent
ruins of the Inca's highway. It conducted almost to Cuzco,
was entirely constructed of cut stone, and very straight, and
resembled the most beautiful of the Roman roads.            In the
same neighbourhood are found also the ruins of the palace
of the inca Tupayupangi, of which La Condamine gave a
description in the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin.
In the quarry which furnished the stones there are still seen
several half cut.    I do not know whether Condamine spoke
also of the so-called Inca's billiard-table.         The Indians
name this place in the Quichua language, Inca-chun-
gana, the Inca's game.        But I much doubt whether it was
ever destined for that purpose.        It is a seat cut out in the
rock, with ornaments in the arabese form, in which it is
believed that the ball ran.     There is nothing more elegant
in our gardens in the English style ; and every thing proves
the good taste of the inca, for the seat is so situated as to
command a delightful view.          In a wood not far from this
place    is found  a  round  spot   of yellow iron in freestone :
the Peruvians have ornamented it with figures, supposing
it to be the image of the sun. I made a drawing of ;t.
     We remained only ten davs at Cuenca, and proceeded
thence to Lima through the province of Jaen, where we
spent a month in the neighbourhood of the river of the
Amazons. We arrived at Lima on the 23d of October
 1602.
     In the month of December I purpose proceeding from
this place to Acapulco, and thence lo Mexico, that in the
month of May 1603 I may reach the Havanna, where. I
shall embark without delay for Spain.         I have snven up, as
you may see, the idea of returning by the Philippines.           I
should have crossed an immense tract of the ocean without
seeing any thing but Manilla and the Cape ; or, if I had
attempted to proceed to the East Indies, I should have
wanted ihe necessaries for that vovaa:e, and which it was
impossible for me to procure here.
     VVe have had fortv or fifty young crocodiles, on the re
spiration of which I have made verv curious experiments.
Other animals diminish the volume of the air in which they
live, but the crocodile increases it. A crocodile immersed
in 1000 parts of atmospheric air, which contain 274 of oxy
gen gas, 15 of carbonic acid gas, and 711 of azot, increases
this ma*s in one hour and forty-three minutes 124 parts ;

 Sir}          Account os      M. Humloldt's     Travels.
and   these   1 1 24 parts contain then, as        I  found bv exact
 analysis,  106'8    of  oxygen, 79     of carbonic  acid, and 936*2
 of azotic gas, mixed with other unknown gaseous sub
 stances.    The crocodile then in one hour and three quarters
 produces   64    parts of carbonic acid, and absorbs 167"2 of
 oxygen   ; but  as  46 parts are found in the 64 parts of carbonic
 acid, it appropriates       to itself only 121 parts of oxygen ;
which is very little, considering the colour of its blood. It
 produces 227 parts of azote, or other gaseous substances, on
which the acidifiable bases exercise no action.
    I made these experiments in the town of Munpox with
lime water and nitrous gas prepared with great care.             The
crocodile is so sensible to carbonic acid gas and to its own
exhalations, that it dies when put into air corrupted by -one
of its own species.         It however can live two or three hours
without breathing at all. 1 made these experiments on cro
codiles seven or eight inches in length : notwithstanding
this smallness of size, they are capable of cutting off a finger
with their teeth, and they have the courage to attack a dog.
These experiments are troublesome, and require great cir
cumspection.         We have made very minute descriptions of
the caiman or crocodile of South America ; but as the de
scriptions of that of Egvpt which I saw before my depar
ture from Europe were not equally circumstantial, I cannot
venture to determine whether they are of the same species.
The Institute of Egypt must undoubtedly have obtained de
tails which will remove all doubt in regard to this point.
This much however is certain, that there are three different
species of crocodile in the tropical regions of the new con
tinent, to which the inhabitants give the names of lava*
caiman, and crocodile.          No naturalist has yet sufficiently
distinguished      these  species.     These monsters, as at New
Barcelona, are sometimes of so peaceable a nature that peo
ple bathe before them; and sometimes, as at New Guiana,
they are so mischievous and ferocious, that during the time
we were there they devoured an Indian on the quay in the
middle of the street.          At Oratuen we saw an Indian girl,
eighteen years     of  age,   whom    a crocodile seized bv the arm.
She had the courage to put her other hand into her pocket
to pull out her knife, with which she gave the monster so
many wounds in the eyes that he let her go, but cut off the
arm near the shoulder. This girl's presence of mind was as
astonishing as the skill displayed by the Indians in speedily
curing so dangerous a wound : one might have said that the
arm was amputated and dressed at Pans.

at the   height of 1370 toises, an immense number of fossil
elephants' bones, both of the African species and of the
carnivorous kind discovered near the Ohio.                   We caused
several to be dug up, and have sent some specimens of them
to the National Institute.          I much doubt whether any of
these bones were ever before found at such a great height :
since that time I have received two from a place of the
Andes situated about two degrees of latitude from Quito and
Chili, so that I can prove the existence and destruction of
these gigantic elephants from the Ohio to the country of
the Patagonians.          I shall bring with me a fine collection of
these bones for M. Cuvier.             About fifteen years ago the
entire petrified skeleton of a crocodile was discovered in a
calcareous rock in the valley of the Magdalen : it was broken
through ignorance, and it was impossible for me to pro
cure the head, which existed not long ago.
 XLIII.    The    Art of moulding Carving in Wood. By Lenor-
    mand, Professor of Natural Philosophy in                 the Central
    School of the Department of Tarn *.
 Angenious or curious men are often thwarted in the exe
 cution of their .projects by the difficulty of finding in the
 places where they reside workmen capable of assisting them
 in  the articles for which they may have occasion.                Small
 towns in particular furnish only indifferent workmen; and
 besides, they do not contain artists of every kind.               Good
 carvers, for example, reside only in large towns ; and these
 even are not very common.               I had seen plasterers supply
 the want of good modellers by incrusting in their decora
 tions plaster moulded on excellent models. I therefore con
 ceived that it might be possible to mould carving in wood,
 to be afterwards applied to cabinet-makers' work. This idea
 I did not at first carry into execution ; but two or three years
 after, having occasion for some pieces of carving, I invented
 a new arts, as will be seen by what follows.                  Necessity
 rendered me industrious, and I at length accomplished my
 object.
     Wishing to obtain a case for a pendulum clock I had
 constructed, I drew a plan of it ; and presented it to an ex
 cellent cabinet-maker in the small town in which I resided.
    * "From Bibliothcque Pbyiico-Ecunomiqve,   June 1803.

He would     undertake only the plain work, and referred m«
for the execution of the carving to Toulouse or Bourdeaux.
 I was sensible how difficult it would he to get the carving
of the different pieces executed at a distance, and particu
larly within the required time ; and how expensive it would
be to transport such a case, which might also be damaged
by the way.      I told him that I would myself undertake the
carving of the laurel and oak foliage which I had placed in
the plan, provided he would undertake the remaining part.
Fearing, however, that my carving would not correspond to
his work, and might tend to degrade         it,  he was unwilling
to undertake any thing till    I   had  shown   him   a specimen ot-
my labour   —    aproposal  to  which  I  consented.
    I was well aware that very hard wood, such as box, might
be moulded       by putting   it under a  press in copper moulds,
after having subjected   it  to certain preparations  :  but for this
purpose very expensive      moulds,    an  excellent press, &c. are
                                                             I by
required,  which    occasions   considerable  expense, and       this
method bas-reliefs only can be executed.           But the art am
about to describe requires only cheap materials with very
little practice, and affords the means of making not only
figures in relief, but even the most difficult objects of sculp
ture.
    In the town where resided found one of those Italians
                        I          I
who employ themselves in moulding plaster figures.                  I
caused him to make such moulds as            1    had occasion for,
and which were copies from the best masters.          I   succeeded
perfectly   in moulding my garlands in walnut-tree wood             ;
and I   showed them to my cabinet-maker, who took me for
an able sculptor.      He constructed the case, applied to          it
the foliage had made, and neither he nor any person who
            1
saw     had the least suspicion of the method
       it                                         I  had employed.
All believed that the ornaments had proceeded from the
chisel of an able carver.        Since that time  I   have moulded
for my friends bas-reliefs, trophies, Sec. with wood of every
kind.   I  shall now describe my
                               Process.
I    made very clear glue with five parts of Flanders glue
and one part of fish glue or isinglass.    Idissolved these two
kinds of glue separately in       large quantity of water, and
                                   a
mixed them together after they had been strained through
a piece of fine linen to separate the filth and heterogeneous
parts which could not be dissolved.      The quantitv of water
cannot be fixed, because all kinds of glue are not homoge
neous, so that some require more and some less.             The
                                                             proper

                  Art os moulding Carving in Wood.                249
proper degree of liquidity may be known by suffering the
mixed glue to become perfectly cold : it must then form a
jelly, or rather a commencement of jelly. If it happens
 that it is still liquid when cold, a little of the water must be
 evaporated bv exposing the vessel in which it is contained to
 heat.       On the other hand, if it has too much consistence, a
 little warm water must be added.            In a word, the proper
 degree will be ascertained by     a few  trials.
      The glue thus prepared is to be heated till you can scarcely
 endure your singer in it : by this operation a little water is
 evaporated, and the glue acquires more consistence.           Then
 take fine raspings of wood or sawdust, sifted through a fine
 hair-sieve, and form it into a paste, which must be put into
 moulds of plaster or sulphur after they have been well rub
 bed over with linseed- or nut-oil, in the same manner as
 when plaster is to be moulded.           Care must be taken to
 press     the  paste in the mould  with  your   hand, in order that
 it may acquire all the forms of the mould : then cover it
 with an oiled board, and, placing over it a weight, suffer it
 in that manner to dry. The desiccation may De hastened
 and rendered more complete by a stove.               When the im-
               is dry remove the rough parts, and if any inequa-
    ities remain behind they must be smoothed ; after which
  Firession
  the impression may be affixed with glue to the article for
 which it is intended. Then cover it with a few strata of
  spirit of wine varnish, as is done in general in regard to
  carved work, or with wax in the encaustic manner.                  It
  requires much attention to discover that such ornaments
  are not carved in the usual manner.           Gilding may be ap
  plied to them with great facility. This operation is exceed
  ingly easy ; nothing is necessary but moulds ; and with a
  little art the ornaments may be infinitely varied.
       I tried also to mould figures, and completely succeeded.
  These, however, require more care.            I first make a paste,
  similar to the former, with very fine sawdust, and place a
  stratum, of about two lines in thickness, on every part of
  the mould ; after which it is left to dry almost entirely.        In
  the mean time I prepare a coarse paste with coarse sawdust
  which has not been made to pass through a fine but a coarse
  sieve, and instead of Flanders glue I employ common glue,
  which is less expensive, adding to it a sixth of fish glue.
   I first put together two parts of the mould, after introducing
  into the joints a slight stratum of the fine paste, which           I
  make ver)- clear ana apply with a small brush.             I fill up
  the vacuity between the two pieces with coarse paste.               I
   then apply the third piece as I did the second, and so on
                                                                 until

   250            Art os moulding Carving in Wood.
   until  the whole are adjusted, always filling up the vacuities
  with    coarse paste.   I suffer the whole to dry in the mould,
   and obtain a figure in relief of solid wood executed with all
  the delicacy of plaster figures. Care must be taken to re
  move with a sharp knife, or small file, the prominences
   formed by the joinings.      If the figure be not suffered to dry
  too much, these . prominences may be easily removed with
  the point of a sharp penknife.        It will be necessary to learn
  the art of determining the proper degree of desiccation ; for
  if the figure be taken from the mould before it is properly
  dried it will become warped, and if it be too dry it cannot
  be corrected but with a file, which is tedious and laborious,
  whereas if the proper moment be seized the paste may be
  cut like wax ; especially if the sawdust has been fine which
  is necessary for the exterior strata.        The figures may then
 be completely dried in a stove, by which means they will
 acquire a degree of desiccation and solidity hardly to be
 Conceived. Figures thus moulded may be bronzed or var
 nished : they will then be unalterable by the effects of mois
  ture or dryness.
      I have already said that Flanders and not common glue
 ought to be employed for the exterior strata, because this
 glue is almost colourless*; whereas the other, being dark-
 coloured, gives too obscure a tint even to walnut-tree wood.
 Being desirous to try whether my moulded figures would be
 unalterable by the effects of moisture or dryness, I made the
 following experiments      :
                            Experiment      I.
     I  exposed in a large bell-glass filled with atmospheric air
 two figures, one of which was varnished and the other not.
 I placed under the bell Saussure's hygrometer and a capsule
 filled with water, after having moistened the sides of the
bell. The air was soon saturated with water, and the hy
 grometer marked 100 degrees.             I observed no alteration
whatever in the varnished figure, and the other exhibited
no other sensible alteration than a commencement of solu
tion in the glue, so that on applying my finger to its sur
face it was found to be somewhat viscid ; in a word, the
figure was not in the least warped.
                           Experiment      II.
     I then introduced my two figures and the hygrometer
into another very dry bell, under which I had placed a cap-
    • When this cannot be had, a glue fit for the
                                                  purpose may be made
by boiling shreds of parchment in common water till dissolved. — Edit.
                                                                   sule

              Art of moulding Carving in        Wood.             Sol
sule filled with calcined potash.        The moisture of the air
by which the figures were surrounded was soon absorbed,
and the hygrometer indicated zero.           In order to ascertain
whether the whole moisture imbibed by the unvarnished
figure was entirely dissipated, I left every thing in statu quo
lor four hours, the hygrometer still indicating zero. I then
took out the two figures, neither of which had experienced
the least alteration.
                         Experiment     III.
   I  repeated the first experiment with a view to cause the
two figures to absorb as much moisture as possible ; and
when the hygrometer marked 100° I took them from the
bell, and suddenly introduced them into a stove the heat of
which was 30° of Reaumur.          The unvarnished one became
dry without cracking, and the other showed a little soften
ing in the varnish.      This effect I ascribed to the imperfect
desiccation before the experiment, for the softening was
more considerable than is generally the case when a var
nished body is exposed to heat.
   These experiments appeared to me sufficient to induce
me to conclude, that sculpture in moulded wood, according
to the process here described, is unalterable by moisture or
drought, for in our climates the thermometer never rises to
50°. Such sculptured figures have the solidity of wood,
and are even preferable to it ; for a slight blow given to
wood, if cut across the fibres, will detach some of the parts ;
whereas figures formed of artificial wood, if 1 may be al
lowed the expression, are homogeneous in all their parts,
and are not so easily broken.
   Besides the advantages which this invention on the first
view exhibits, it offers others which may be of great utility
to our arts and manufactures.
   1st, In the large manufactories of mirrors the ornaments
in general arc in a ver)' bad taste and miserably executed,
because the carvers arc very ill paid.         If this new method
be adopted, sculptors would pay      more   attention   to their first
work : they would     mould    their ornaments     in  plaster or in
sulphur, then take     a multitude   of  copies   with   the greatest
facility, and these   ornaments   would    add  to the  value  of our
furniture.
   2d, Inlayers would make much more elegant works by
employing pastes of different coloured woods, which might
be managed with greater ease than the thin pieces of co
loured boards which they employ. I am now engaged with
                                                                some

XLIV.    Evidence    of the precise   Date  of  the Cow-Pock  in
                            America.
                         To Mr.   Tilloch.
Jf inding    that the honour of the first instances of the vac
cine inoculation in America is not bestowed upon the gen
tleman to whom it is due, and that there have been even
some little contradiction and mistakes among the English
practitioners with regard to which of them first introduced
the new practice into that country by furnishing matter, I
trust the following statement of facts may establish the his
torical truth in question.
   In the winter of the year 1790. Dr. John Chichestcr, a
practitioner of the first distinction in Charleston, South
Carolina, and to whom I have been pupil, received vaccine
matter from his learned friend and former teacher Dr. Pear
son, accompanying the first publications written on the
cow-pock by Dr. Jenner and himself.             With this matter
several persons were inoculated, but the disease was pro
duced in one case only.        This was a mulatto boy named
Robert, about seven or eight years old, the property of
Thomas Tunno, esq. merchant. The small-pox matter was
subsequently inserted, in the most careful manner, without
effect.   It was some time after the occurrence of the above
case, before those which have been published as the first
instances in America really happened.
   It may be proper to notice that my late worthy master
Dr. Chichester was not supported by the approbation of his
brethren in his introduction of the vaccine inoculation in
America, notwithstanding the high authorities above men
tioned who first proposed it to the public.
                     I remain, sir, your humble servant,

   P. S. Since my arrival in London          I have seen doctor
Waterhouse's latest Treatise on the Variola Vaccina, 8vo.
 Cambridge 1802: hence I am enabled to fix the precise
date of hisjirst inoculation from his own words, viz.: — " I
 commenced the experiment July 8, 1800, on my own chil

tion." Page 5.
    The error concerning the inoculation of the cow-pock in
America would not have happened if Dr. Chichester's ac
count had not failed in getting to Europe ; nor would the
first introduction have been imputed to the Vaccine Insti
tution, as was supposed from a passage in Dr. Lettsom's
book on the cow-pock, viz. " The vaccine matter which
first succeeded with professor Waterhouse was transmitted
from England in a bottle with a glass stopper*." Page 24.

XLV.      Account      of  the  Life and Labours of        the late   Mr.
     Ramsden, in a Letter from Professor Piazzi, of Pa
     lermo, to M. DE LALANDEf.
  W hen       I had the pleasure of seeing you lately at London,
you    admired,      as I did, the genius and works of the cele
brated Ramsden, which has induced me to address to you
 such circumstances as I have been able to collect respecting
 the life and labours of this incomparable artist. No one has
 contributed more to the progress of astronomy than you have
 done by your zeal, and by your works on the principles and
 calculations of that science ; and Mr. Ramsden is certainly
 the first for inventing and constructing instruments : but as
 he is not so well known in France, perhaps, as he deserves
 to be, my letter may serve to give your countrymen a just
 idea of his merit.
     Jesse Ramsden was born at Halifax, in Yorkshire, on
 the 6th of October 1730.           At an early period he conceived
 a strong desire of devoting himself to literature, and espe
 cially to history and antiquities: the mathematics and che
 mistry engaged his attention also in their turn: but his
 father was anxious that he should pursue some occupation
 which might be useful to him ; and as he was a clothier,
 young Ramsden applied to the same employment till he had
    '"
       This mode of transmitting matter was peculiar for a time to the
 Vaccine  Institution,  now at No. 44, Broad-street, Golden-square.

  254             Account   of the   Life and Lalours
 attained to the age of twenty-one.            He then went to Lon
 don, to seek for some occupation more suited to his genius.
 Besides other things, he applied to engraving under Bur
 ton* : and a fortunate circumstance conducted him to that
 object for which nature seemed to have destined him, which
 was to be the reviver and father of the instrumental part of
 astronomy.       Mathematical instruments were often brought
 to him to be engraven : the more he examined them the
 more he was sensible of their defects, and a secret instinct
 made him desirous of constructing better ones.              He there
 fore resolved to make an attempt in this line : he soon ac
 quired the use of the file, and made himself acquainted
 with the method of turning brass, and even of grinding
 glasses.     In the year 1 763 he constructed instruments for
 Sisson, Dollond, Nairne, Adams, and other mathematical
 instrument makers. He then established a shop on his
 own account, in the Hay-market, about the year 1 768 j
 from which he removed to Piccadilly in 1 773. Having form
 ed a design of examining all the astronomical instruments,
 he resolved to correct those which being founded on good
 principles were defective only in the construction, and to
 set aside those which were wrong in both these respects.
    Hadley's sextant, which is so much employed in the
British navy, appeared to him one of the most useful, but
it was then very imperfect; the essential parts were not of
sufficient strength; the centre was subject to too much
friction ; and the index could be moved seyeral minutes
without any change being produced in the position of the
mirror; the divisions in general were very coarse; and Mr.
Ramsden found that the abbe de la Caille was right, when he
estimated at five minutes the error which might take place
in the observed distances of the moon and stars, and which
   •
      Mr.  Burton was a thermometer and barometer maker, and divider
of instruments.    Instruments at this period were divided by means of a
plate applied to them, and the divisions were in this manner marked off.
Mr. Burton was one of the best woikmen of his time, and worked for
Short. Bird, and other eminent artists. Mr. Ramsden bound himself ap
prentice to Mr. Burton for four years ; and after his time was expired
entered into partnership with Mr. Fairbone, who lived aftci wards in
New-street, Shoe-lane.     This partnership, however, did norlong con
tinue.   Mr. Ramsden opened a shop on his own account in the Strand,
and, having married miss Dollond, became possessed of a p;rt of Mr.
Dollond's patent for achromatic telescopes.   Mr. Ra nsden in the course
of a few years removed to the Hay-market, and then to Piccadilly, where
he died in the year iSoo.    Mr. Ramsden had seven children ; but none
of them are now alive, except one son, captain John Ramsden of the
East India company's service, and late commander of the Dorchester.—

             3                                                   might

                    of   the late Mr.  Ramsden.              255
might occasion in      the longitude an error of fifty nautical
leagues.   Mr. Ramsden       therefore changed the construction
in regard to the centre, and made these instruments so cor
rect as to give never more than half a minute of uncertainty.
At present he warrants sextants of fifteen inches radius
to within six seconds.        Since the time when he improved
these instruments he has constructed 983 ; and several of
them having been carried to India and America, the error
has been found to correspond with what he determined it to
be before their departure. He has since made sextants from
fifteen inches to an inch and a half radius, and in the latter
the minutes can be clearly distinguished ; but in general he
prefers those of ten inches, as being easier managed and
susceptible of the same exactness.
    The invention of a dividing machine having now become
 necessary, he employed himself in constructing one, which
 he did with the greatest success.       The dividing machines
 before  used  were  far  from   being exact.   Graham and Bird
employed beam compasses.             The latter kept his method
a secret till it was purchased from him by the board of lon
gitude, in order to be published. Mr. Ramsden had already
discovered a method of his own, which in exactness sur
 passed that of Bird.         For large works he still uses the
 beam compasses ; but as it is necessary in the greater num
ber of common instruments to save time, he has employed
 himself for ten years in improving his dividing machine, in
 which ease and expedition are united. You have seen that
admirable machine with which a sextant could be divided in
 the course of twenty minutes, and which is sufficient to give
 an idea of the inventive genius and superior talents of Mr.
 Ramsden. It was your friend Dr. Shepherd who made this
 excellent machine known to the board of longitude, who
 gave the inventor a premium of 6001. sterling, and caused
 an engraving to be made of it in 1777 •• but the edition was
 accidentally Durned, and you are right in wishing to cause it
 to be engraved at Paris. The machine is still in the hands
 of Mr. Ramsden, and he has undertaken to divide sextants
 for three shillings. The board of longitude has often given
greater premiums for objects of less utility ; but the greatest
 men do not always obtain the greatest rewards. Newton,
 indeed, got a place in the mint ; but he was not indebted
 for it to his merit alone.
    Mr. Ramsden has constructed an instrument also for di
 viding straight lines, a description of which has been printed j
 and I am sorry that you have no longer at Paris that invented
 by M. Megnie, in order that they might be compared.

  256            Account os the    Life and Labours
    While Mr. Ramsden was employed on his dividing ma
 chine, he improved at the same time other instruments.
 The theodolite before consisted merely of a telescope, turn
 ing on a circle divided at every three minutes, by means of
 a vernier ; but in the hands of Mr. Ramsden it has become
 a new and perfect instrument, which serves for measuring
 heights and distances as well as for taking angles.          I saw
 in his possession the largest and most wonderful of all theo
 dolites, employed by general Roy for measuring the triangles
 which at present join those of France, and by which there
 Cannot be an error of a second, though it is only eighteen
 inches radius.      It is furnished with two telescopes, which
 each turn on a horizontal axis, and by which the angles be
 tween objects more or less elevated are reduced to the ho
 rizon, and measured.        General Roy has lately measured the
 angle  between   the  pole star and the sides of his triangles, in
 order to have the convergency of the meridians such as it is
 in our oblate spheroid. These operations have already shown
 that the difference between the meridians of the observatories
 of Paris and Greenwich is y' 20".
    The barometer destined for measuring the heights of
 mountains has been much improved by Mr. Ramsden. His
 method of marking at the bottom the line of the level, and
 of looking at the top to the contact of the index with the
 summit of the mercury, renders it possible to distinguish
 the hundredth part of a line, and to measure heights within
 a foot.   He showed M. de Luc that it is the summit of the
 column, and not the part which touches the glass, that
 ought to be observed ; and he caused to be engraved a table,
 which accompanies his barometers, and which, without cal
 culation, gives the heights of places according to the height
 of the barometer, and even for different degrees of heat. He
 has simplified also, in the most ingenious manner, the ap
 paratus for carrying and supporting this portable barometer.
    Various other philosophical machines have been made by
Mr. Ramsden, and always with new improvements : such
as an electric machine ; a manometer for measuring the
density of the air ; an instrument for measuring inaccessible
distances, and which renders it unnecessary to measure a
base ; assaying balances which turn with a ten-thousandth
part of the weight; levels exceedingly sensible ; the optic
rectangle, prismatic eve-glasses where much fewer rays are
lost than by the reflection of an inclined mirror, when it is
necessary to look on one side ; the dynametcr, with which
he measures the magnifying power of a telescope, bv apply
ing before the eve-gsass a small scale divided into hundredths
                                                                 vi.

of a line  to measure the pencil or image of the object-glass.
This  was the original invention, but it was afterwards much
improved.
   The pyrometer, destined to measure the dilatation of bodies
by heat, afforded exercise also for the talents of Mr. Rams
den ; and with the happiest success, as may be seen in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1785.            Mr. Ramsden, on
examining the pyrometer then in use, had observed the ra
dical defect of that instrument, in which the bodies subjected
to experiment were not sufficiently separated. But with his
microscopic pyrometer he found means to compare the na
tural state of a body with the same body exposed to any de
gree of heat or of cold, and by a micrometer adapted to the
microscope he measured these variations with an exactness
before unknown, and which furnished the measurement of
a base with a precision ten times greater than in any of those
ever before measured.        On this occasion, as on all others,
Mr. Ramsden showed a natural sagacity in discovering the
essential faults of every instrument, and in inventing the
most simple and most exact methods of correcting them.
   Optics are no less indebted to him.         He found means to
correct the aberration of sphericity and refrangibility in com
pound eye-glasses applied to all astronomical instruments,
and in a new and perfect manner. Opticians had imagined
that this could be accomplished by making the image of the
object-glass fall between the two eye-glasses; which was
attended with this great inconvenience, that the eye-glass
could not be touched without deranging the line of collima-
tion, and the value of the parts of the micrometer. To re
medy this inconvenience Mr. Ramsden set out from a very
simple experiment, namely, that the edges of an image ob
served through a prism are less coloured according as the
image is nearer the prism ; and, in consequence of this truth,
he sought for the means of placing the two eye-glasses be
tween the image of the object-glass and the eye, without
foiling to correct the two aberrations, which he did by
changing the radii of the curves, and placing the glasses in a
manner altogether different from that commonly employed.
   He invented also a reflecting object-glass micrometer, a
description of which may be seen in the Transactions of the
Royal Society of London for 1779.             In his paper on this
subject   he points  out  the defects and  inconveniences  of that
ofBouguer,     first  invented  in  1748,   in which  the different
 positions of the eye, in regard to the pencil of light, cause
the two images to appear sometimes to touch each other,
sometimes to be separated, and sometimes alternately bv a

  S58            Account os the Life and Lalours
  sort of oscillation. He found also that the aberration of the
  rays, which renders the object badly defined, increased the
  inconvenience of that instrument.        He thought it would
  therefore be necessary to abandon the principle of refrac
  tion, and to substitute that of reflection. This instrument,
  as simple as ingenious, contains no more mirrors or glasses
  than what are necessarv for the telescope ; and the separa
  tion of the two images depends only on the inclination of
  the mirrors, and not on the focus.
      He however employed himself in improving the refract
  ing micrometer, and conceived the happy idea of placing
  this micrometer not towards the object-glass, but exactly in
  the conjugate focus of the first eve-glass. This micrometer
  is composed of two plano-convex lenses, which can be moved
  and form t\\ o images, as in the object-class micrometers, but
 with this difference, that the ravs before thevfall on theplano-
 convex lenses pass through a lens convex on both sides, at
 a certain distance towards the object-glass.     By these means
 the contrary refraction of the two plano-convex lenses, and
 the convex lens, corrects the error which takes place in
 object-glass micrometers, where the image depends only on
 the focus of the two plano-convex lenses. The image being
 already considerablv magnified before it falls on the refract
 ing micrometer, the imperfection of the glasses can occasion
 only an insensible error in the measurement of angles.         It
 is true, indeed, that by this position the field of the micro
 meter will be smaller than what it would be were the micro
meter near the object-glass.       Mr.Kamsden devised mean*
 also for making the imaees to be uniformly illuminated in
every part of the field. \Vith this micrometer the diameter
of the planets may be measured in every direction ; it may
be adapted to achromatic telescopes of even.- kind ; it may
be brought near to or removed from the object-glass at plea
sure, to render vision distinct; and it mav be taken from
the tube of the eye-glasses,        that the telescope may be
employed without a micrometer.             All these advantages
have given great reputation to Ramsden's micrometers,
and the astronomer who can obtain one of them is for
tunate.
     In consequence of these and other inventions Mr. Rams-
den was elected a fellow of the Roval Society in 1786.
    The objects hitherto mentioned, however, are not the
most important of the works of Mr. Ramsden. The equa
torial, the transit instrument, and quadrant, received in his
hands new improvements. The equatorial first constructed
by Sisson, and which was somewhat improved by Short, was
                                                            much

                       of the late Mr.   Ramsden.                 259
 much further improved by Ramsden.             He first suppressed
 the endless screw, which by pressing on the centre destroyed
 its precision. He placed the centre of gravity on the centre
 of the base, and caused all the movements to take place in
 every direction.      He pointed out the means of rectifying the
 instrument in all its parts ; and he applied to it a very inge
 nious small machine for measuring or correcting the effect
 of refraction. This invention is much anterior to that given
 by Mr. Dollond in the Philosophical Transactions.               Mr.
 Ramsden had a patent for this kind of equatorial. The ho
 nourable Stewart Mackenzie, brother of the earl of Bute,
 the friend and patron of Mr. Ramsden, wrote a description
 of this machine, which has been printed. But Mr. Ramsden
 does not always strictly adhere to the description : his in
 ventive genius rarely allows him to construct the same in
 strument many times in the same manner ; and it often
 happens that he breaks to pieces instruments which have
 cost a great deal of labour, if they are not as correct as he
 wishes.
    The largest equatorial instrument ever constructed is that
 destined for Sir George Shuckburgh, on which Mr. Rams
 den has been employed for nine vears. The circle of inclina
 tion is four feet in diameter, so that observations can be made
 nearly within a second.       The telescope is placed between six
 pillars,  which   form   the axis  of the machine ; and the whole
turns around two pivots resting on supporters of mason-
 work.
    The transit instrument is employed in all the large ob
servatories of Europe ; but Mr. Ramsden has added to it
several improvements.         He invented a method of illumina
ting the wires, by making the light pass along the axis of
the machine. The reflector is placed in the inside, and ob
liquely in the middle. He did not lessen the aperture of the
object-glass : and as the light passes through a coloured
prism, which may be moved at pleasure, the light may be
increased or diminished.        For adjusting this essential instru
ment, Mr. Ramsden invented a method which supersedes
the use of a spirit-of-wine level, on which he sets no
value, because it does not give that exactness which it is
always his aim to obtain.             He suspends a thread and*
plummet before the telescope placed vertically : this thread
passes over two points, which are marked on two pieces fixed
one above and the other below the telescope, and one of
which has a small motion.            The thread is absolutely de
tached    from  the  telescope  ; and  when it corresponds on the
same points in the two different situations of the telescope,
                                   R 2                           the

the observer    is certain that the axis is horizontal, as yon
have   remarked in vour Astronomy.          What is newer and
more ingenious in Mr. Ramsden's method                      is,
                                                   that the thread
and plummet sometimes          pass over the images only or' the
points which are formed in the focus ot         lens, because he

is sometimes obliged to remove the thread to         considerablea
distance from the instrument and from the points but the                   ;
exactness   is not lessened, and there     no parallax.
                                                   is
   Ramsden's meridian telescopes, such as those at Blen
heim, at Manhcim, at Dublin, and such as those made
for the observatories of Paris and Gotha, are also remarkable
for the excellence of the object-glasses. Mr. Usher, in                                a
letter from Dublin, says that he can see in the open dav
stars of the fourth magnitude, and those of the third verv
near their conjunction with the sun. These telescopes are
eight feet in length.        had the satisfaction to obtain one
                                1
of rive feet for my observatory of Palermo but          ; so good,    it  is

   The mural quadrant the most important of all the astro
                               is
nomical instruments, and Mr. Ramsden has distinguished
himself here also bv the exactness of his divisions          he                    :
places the thread and plummet behind the instrument, in
order that it may not be necessary to remove      when obser     it
vations are made near the zenith. His method of illuminat
ing the object-glass and at the same time the divisions, and
of suspending the telescope,      also new, and consequently
                                         is
more perfect.     In those of eight sect which he made for
the observatories of Padua and Vilna, and which Dr. Mas-
kelyne examined, the greatest error docs not exceed two
seconds and    ahalf. One for Milan     in  great state of for

and south in     minute.

noble instrument that Mr. Ramsden invented              method of     a
rectifying  the arc  of  go  dearrees,  respecting  which   an able
astronomer had started «ome difficulties Lut'with       ;      hori-           a

                           a                                kind of        a

  the difference arose from a mural quadrant of Bird, where
 the arc of godegrees contained several seconds too much, and
 which had not been verified by so exact a method as his.
     But the quadrant is not the instrument which Mr. Rams
 den values most. It is the whole circle; and he has proved
 that to attain to the utmost degree of precision qf which
 observation is susceptible, we must renounce the quadrant
 entirely.    His principal reasons are, 1st, The least variation
 in the centre isperceived by the two points diametrically op
 posite. 2d, As the circle is turned the plane is always ri
 gorously exact ; which cannot possibly be the case in the
 quadrant.     3d, Two measurements       can always be had of
 the same arc; which serves for verifying the accuracy of the
 observation. 4th, The first point of the division can be
 verified every day with the greatest case. 5th, The dilata
 tion of the metal is uniform, and can produce no error. 6th,
This instrument     is a meridian telescope as well as a mural.
 7th, It becomes a movcable azimuth circle by adding a
horizontal circle below the axis, and then gives the refrac
tions independently of the measure of time.          You there
fore approved the resolution I had formed of confining my
self to this instrument, and of not quitting London tils I
could carry with me a circle of five feet, which Mr. Rams
den was constructing for the observatory of Palermo : as
soon as mine is finished he promises to put in hand that
destined for Paris. He then hopes to finish that for Dublin,
which is twelve feet, and which you saw in an advanced
state; but a circle of 7 or 8 feet is sufficient to give preci
sion within half a second, as in the zenith sector, which is
employed for the most rigorous observations in regard to
the figure of the earth.
    You remarked with the greatest satisfaction the ingenious
manner in which the axis is supported, that it mav have no
friction on the pivots, and especially Mr. Ramsden's new
invention for rendering the axis perfectly horizontal, by
means of a thread and plummet, which is however with
out the machine ; and you had the pleasure of seeing that
inventive genius exercise his talents on this new problem,
and solve it in the completest manner. As his talents have
been exercised in a wide field, he has collected in his shops
workmen in all professions which relate to the construction
of mathematical and philosophical instruments, that he
might have every thing made under his own inspection.
Tlie same workman is always confined to the same branch,
and by these means acquires the utmost degree of correct
ness.     But notwithstanding this perfection, which ought ta

enable   Mr. Ramsden to make a fortune, he sells his instru
ments cheaper than any other artist in the same line at
London : the difference is sometimes a third. Though he
has nearly 60 workmen in his employment he is not able
lo execute all the orders which he has received from every
part of the world, and you yourself have experienced how
difficult it is to obtain instruments from him.
    No person can be more reasonable, more attentive to
business, or more indifferent for pleasure or for riches than
Mr. Ramsden : he is exceedingly frugal in his manner of
life ; and, unless provoked, no one can be more polite,
milder, or more complaisant.        I hope, sir, you will pub
lish with pleasure this tribute of my gratitude to a man of
uncommon talents, whom you esteem as much as I do,
and who, in his turn, has conceived for you a real attach
ment.
XLV I .    Some Details respecting the Voyage of the two French
     Corvettes, Le Geographe and Le Naturaliste, sent out under
    the Commandos Cap tainB au din for the Purpose of mak?
    ing Discoveries.
  X hese two corvettes sailed from the north-west port of
the Isle of France on the 25th of April 1801, and on the
 27th of May discovered the land of New Holland in lat.
 34° 36', long. Ill0 44' : the land they saw was that called
Leeuwin's Land, which forms the south-west extremity of
New Holland, and which the charts indicate as little known.
     Preparations were then made for exploring the country
 and the two corvettes were employed in this service from
 the 27th of May to the 14th of June. As these were the
 first geographical operations made on board these vessels,
 it appears that they are not very correct ; and captain Bau-
 din has sent home no account of them, nor any of the
 charts which he caused to be constructed.       He announces
 that on his return from Port Jackson he proposes to revist
 Leeuwin's Land, and to repeat the operations undertaken,
 in order to construct a chart of Bai du Geographe, which
 he found in that part.
     Among the charts brought home by the Naturaliste is
 one of the same coast of Leeuwin's Land, executed on board
 the Naturaliste by C. Faure : it contains an extent of coast
 from lat. 34° 23' to 32° 13', but coarsely delineated and
 without any details.
                                                           After

            for the Purpose  of making    Discoveries.      263
    After these operations the two corvettes were separated,
and did not again meet till they arrived at the Island of
Timor; but both of them sailed along the coast of the
Land of Endracht, which lies to the north of Leeuwin's
Land.
    Captain Baudin entered the Bay of Seals on the 27th of
 June,  and remained   there till the 13th of July.    HereBer-
nier, the astronomer, made some observations, which fix the
longitude of the northern point of Barren Island at 109°
 13' 46".    The course of the Geographe in this bav and on
 the coast to the north of it is traced out on a chart con
structed by C. Boulanger, one of the engineers belonging
 to the expedition.   This chart, however, is only a copy of
 a Dutch chart given to captain Baudin before his departure,
 and which C. Boulanger corrected by the results of astrono
 mical observations.
    Captain Baudin observes in his memoir, that his first
 operations in regard to this coast, and that of De Witt's
 and of Leeuwin's Land, were not satisfactory ; and he pur
 poses to repeat them on his return from Port Jackson. He-
 has therefore sent home none of the charts of the early part
 of his voyage along these coasts. Among the charts which
 the Naturaliste has brought home there is only one small
 chart of a part of the coast of New Holland, where the
 Geographe landed ; and which is supposed to be on the
 coast of De Witt's Land, or of the north-west.            This
 chart, constructed by Rousard, an officer of the marine en
gineers, is merely a sketch taken at sight, and may give
 some idea of the observations made on board the Geographe ;
 though, as captain Baudin announces, it contains only frag
 ments of the coasts. He says he transmitted to the minister
 of the marine, in a letter dated Timor, October 6, 1S01,
-some details respecting his navigation on the western coasts
 of New Holland from Leeuwin's Land, and that he then
 announced that they were by no means satisfactory.         He
 arrived at Timor, and entered Coupang Bay on the 22d of
 August 1801.
    The Naturaliste being separated from the Geographe on
 the coast of Leeuwin's Land proceeded to the Island of
 Kottenest, which had been agreed on as the first place of
 rendezvous in case of separation. The captain explored that
 island as well as another in the neighbourhood, and which
 is not marked in the charts : he called it Isle-aux-Ours. He
 examined at the same time Swan's River, on the coast of
 New Holland, opposite to the Isle of Rottenest : some boats
 were ordered to proceed up that river as far as they possibly
 could without danger; and a chart of it was constructed,
                              R 4                         which

264           Details respecting  Baudin's Voyage
which is inserted in the journal of C. Hamelin, the com
mander of the Naturaliste.
   The same corvette sailed along the western coast of New
 Holland from lat. 32° south, which is that of the Isle of
 Rottenest as far as the Bay of Seals, or of Dirk Hartoge ;
and a chart of that coast was constructed on five large sheets.
This chart, however, is merely a sketch made at sight, and
can serve only to give a general idea of the course. It con
tains none of those details exhibited in the Dutch chart of
the same coast.
   Trie Naturaliste having remained some time in the Bay
of Seals, waiting for the Geographe, took that opportunity
of exploring this bav, and the result is a chart verv different
from any before published.       It deserves consideration, and
may be useful to navigators who in future may touch at
this bay, in the different gulphs of which thev will find re
sources of which no idea was before entertained.
   From the Bay of Seals the Naturaliste steered a direct
course for the Island of Timor, without following the coast
of Endracht's Land or that of De Witt's, and arrived in
Coupang Bay on the 20th of September, having left the
Bay of Seals on the 3d. Captain Baudin has added to the
                                                                •
charts which he sent home, copies of some Dutch charts of
the islands of the Indian Archipelago,         which he made
during his stay at Timor.
   The two corvettes left Timor in company on the 13th of
November 1801, and proceeded to D'Entrecasteaux's chan
nel on the south-east coast of Van Diemen's Land, where
they arrived on the 13th of January 1802.        They explored
every part of that channel with the greatest care ; and cap
tain Baudin announces that they found nothing in it to be
 rectified. " It is hardly possible," says he, " to find any
work more correct, or better executed, than that of the geo
graphers who have made us acquainted with these places
for touching at ; and we shall be well satisfied if we hear
the navigators who succeed us give the same account of our
labours, in regard to the coasts which no one ever visited
before   us."
    Captain Baudin only observes that the land called Tas-
roan's Land, in the chart of D'Entrecasteaux's channel, is
not an island ; and that it is joined to Van Diemen's Land*
by an isthmus of about 80 or 100 paces in breadth. It is
to be observed that D'Entrecasteaux's boats did not proceed
so far in this channel as those of captain Baudin ; and the
observation he makes in regard to Tasman's Land is correct.
He observes also that the Bay of Frederick Hendrick is not
in the place where it is laid down in D'Entrecasteaux's chart,
                                                            and

           for the Purpose  of making Discoveries.         263
and he gives a long dissertation on this subject. D'Entre-
casteaux was not in that part, and the Bay of Frederick
Hendrick was given from old charts.
   After ascertaining the correctness of the chart of D'Entrc-
castcaux's channel, captain Baudin did not think it neces
sary to make a new one, as he had nothing to add to it. He
confined himself to the construction of one of Frederick
Hendiick's Bay, every part of which he explored.
   In the chart of Van Diemen's Land, constructed in ] 798
and 1 799 by captain Flinders, and which was engraved at
the depdt in order that captain Baudin might have a suffi
cient number of copies, the eastern coast of Van Diemen's
Land was traced out in a vague manner, as countries little
known are in general. Captain Baudin was therefore charged
to explore it in a complete and correct manner ; and This
operation he undertook on leaving the Bay of Frederick
Hendrick. Among the charts he has sent home there is
one of the Island Maria, the coast of which was explored
and correctly traced out ; another of the coast of Van Die-
men's Land between Maria and Schouten's Islands ; and a
third of Schouten's Islands and the adjacent coast.        It is
seen by the last-mentioned chart that there is only one
Schouten's Island, instead of the five laid down in captain
Flinders' chart. The rest form a long peninsula joined to
Van Diemen's Land by an isthmus.
   There is a chart also of the remainder of the eastern coast
of Van Diemen's Land, from Cape Pele in lat. 42° 8' to
Swan's Island in lat. 40° 42'. This chart is the result of
the course followed by C. Boulanger, who had been sent on
shore to explore the country, and who was not able to re
turn on board. Having waited some days for a boat to
come and fetch him, he resolved to proceed along the coast
which he supposed the corvettes would sail along ; and he
fortunately arrived at Swan's Island and Banks's Straits,
where he found an English ship, the captain of which pro
mised to carry him to Port Jackson ; but some days after
he fell in with the Naturaliste, which took him on board.
   The two corvettes had been separated some time, and
were endeavouring to fall in with each other. Both of them
proceeded to Van Diemen's Land, but without meeting.
They visited Dalrymple River, which is situated about the
middle of that coast, and another called North River; both
proceeded also to the coast of New Holland, which forms
the northern coast of Basse's Strait. The Naturaliste ex
plored the coast from Cape Wilson to Port Western.        That
port also was visited, and plaits were made of both. After
                                                            this

566           Details respecting Baudin's Voyage
this operation the Naturaliste made for Port Jackson, in
hopes of finding there the Geographe.
    Captain Baudin, after visiting different parts of Basse's
Straits in hope of meeting with the Naturaliste, determined
to explore the southern coast of New Holland, which was
entirely unknown.       He first proceeded to Cape Wilson,
from which he took his point of departure, and directed his
course west, following the coast to the distance of fifteen
degrees of longitude.     About the middle of his course he
fell in with captain Flinders, who had left England eight
months after him, and who was charged to make the same
researches as captain Baudin on all the coasts of New Hol
land.    He had cruised along the southern coast from Leeu-
win's Land to the point where he fell in with captain Baudin,
and two days before meeting him had discovered a large and
beautiful island, to which he gave the name of Kangaroo
Island.     This island is situated in lat. 35° 50' south, and
long. 135° 4', and appears to be about thirty leagues in ex
tent from east to west. Captain Flinders had passed through
the channel which separates it from the land, and had seen
none of the southern part.
    Captain Baudin, continuing his course, fell in with this
island, which he found such as it had been described by
 captain Flinders : like him he passed on the north side, and
did not see the southern part; but on the north side he
 found two gulphs which proceeded a great way inland, and
 which he entered, to explore the whole extent of them : he.
 however could see only one side, because the other was filled
with sand-banks and shoals, which did not permit the vessel
 to approach the land.
    When he came out of these gulphs he continued his
course towards the west as far as the Isles of St. Peter and
 St. Francis, which were nearly the term of the researches
 of D'Entrecasteaux on that coast ; he then proceeded to the
 south-east to reach Port Jackson, where he found the Na
 turaliste.
    This discovery of captain Baudin is highly important, as
 it completes the survey of the southern coast of New Hol
 land, which is entirely owing to France. As yet we catv
 form no opinion in regard to the degree of correctness with
 which it has been explored, because C. Baudin has sent
 home only a part of the chart which he constructed, and
 as the chart itself is only a sketch : he has added to it a
 chart which only indicates his course, with the soundings
 along that coast ; and he promises to send the other part of
 the coast by the first opportunity.
                                                       Captain

             for  the Purpose of making    Discoveries.       267
    Captain Baudin has joined to these charts twelve views
well executed, and by which he has endeavoured to give
an idea of the nature of the country.         They relate only to
Leeuwin's Land ; but he promises others of the same kind
in regard to every part of New Holland which he has vi
sited.
    On his departure from Port Jackson he purposed,
    1st, To explore King's Island lately discovered in Basse's
Straits, and situated to the north-west of Hunter's Isles.
    2d, The large island called Kangaroo Island, the southern
part of which is unknown.
    3d, The two large gulphs situated to the north of Kan
garoo Island,      and which  he can examine in every part by
means     of the Kasuarina, a small vessel which he procured
at Port   Jackson, and which draws little water.
    4th, The northern part of the Islands of St. Peter and
St. Francis,     and  where the discoveries   he has made   unite
with   those   of D'Entrecasteaux.
    5th, Leeuwin's Land, and that of Endracht,          which he
 has already seen, but not in a satisfactory manner.
    6th, De Witt's Land, where he knows he shall experience
great difficulties; but where he hopes to find also interesting
 objects.
    7th, In the last place, the Gulph of Carpentaria, which
 will be the boundary of his researches.
    The two vessels sailed from Port Jackson, Nov. 1 8, 1 802,
 twenty-five months after their departure from France, and
 on the 6th of December anchored in the Bay of Sea Ele-
          in the eastern part of King's Island in lat. 39° 5l',
 !)hants
  ong.   141°  34'.
    Two days after, captain Hamelin, having received his
 ultimate orders, separated from the Geographe and the
 Kasuarina in order to proceed to France.
    When on the point of sailing, an English galliot an
 chored near them. This vessel had been dispatched for the
 purpose of exploring Port Philips on the south-west coast
 of the Bay of Frederick Hendrick, in Van Diemen's Land,
 and the river in the north of the same land very near D'En-
 trccasteaux's channel; to construct charts of these places;
 and to wait at the Litter for the arrival of the Porpoise,
 which was to carry thither the troops necessary for form in**
 a settlement.      They learned also by this vessel, that the
 Lady Nelson brig, which sailed from Port Jackson along
 with the Investigator, had returned thither, having lost all
 her anchors, and been obliged to make one of wood. They
 had separated from captain Flinders en the 2d of October
                                                             1803

   also lost three anchors, and had several times struck ; as
   had been the case with the Lady Nelson, which by these
   means had broken her sliding keel.             Captain Flinders con
  tinued his voyage to the Gulph of Carpentaria.
  XLVII.      Observations   on the Chemical Nature'           of the Hu~
      mows of the Eye. By      Richard Chenevix, Esq. F.R.S.
      and M.R.I. J.1"
   J. he functions of the eye, so far as they are physical, have
  been found subject to the common laws of optics.                   It can
  not be expected that chemistry should clear up such obscure
  points of physiology as all the operations of vision appear
 to be ; but some acquaintance with the intimate nature of
  the substances which produce the effects cannot fail to be a
 useful appendage to a knowledge of the mechanical struc
 ture of the organ.
     The chemical history of the humours of the eye is not of
 much extent.       The aqueous humour had been examined by
 Bertrandi ; who said that its specific gravity was 975, and
 therefore less than that of distilled water.             Fourcroy, in his
 Systcme     des Connoissances     Chimiques,      tells  us that it has a
 saltish taste ; that it evaporates without leaving a residuum ;
 but that it contains some animal matter, with some alkaline
phosphate and muriate. These contradictions only prove
that we have no accurate knowledge upon the subject.
     The vitreous humour is not better known. Wintringhain
has given its specific gravity (taking water at 10000) as
equal to 10024 ; but I am not acquainted with any experi
ments to investigate its chemical nature.
     We are told by Chrouet, that the crystalline lens affords,
by destructive distillation, foetid oil, carbonate of ammonia,
and water, leaving some carbon in the retort. But destruc
tive distillation, although it has given us much knowledge
as to animal matter in general, is too vague a method for
investigating particular animal substances.
     I shall now proceed to mention the experiments I have
made upon all the humours.             I shall first relate those which
were made upon         the  eyes    of   sheep (they being the most
easily procured), and shall afterwards speak of those of the
human body, and other eyes.               I think it right to observe,
that all these eyes    were  as  fresh   as they could be obtained.

                             Aqueous Humour.
    The aqueous humour is a clear transparent liquid, of the
specific gravity of 10090*, at 60° of Fahrenheit.                   When
fresh) it nas very little smell or taste.
    It causes very little change in the vegetable re-active co
lours ; and this little would not, I believe, be produced im
mediately after death.           1 imagine it to be owing to a gene
ration or ammonia, some traces of which I discovered.
    When exposed to the air, at a moderate temperature, it
evaporates slowly, and becomes slightly putrid.
    When made to boil, a coagulum is formed, but so small
as hardly to be perceptible.            Evaporated to dryness a resi
duum remains, weighing not more than 8 per cent, of the
original liquor.
    Tannin causes a precipitate in the fresh aqueous humour
both before and after it has been boiled, and consequently
shows the presence of gelatine.
    Nitrate of silver causes a precipitate, which is muriate of
silver. No metallic salts, except those of silver, alter the
aqueous humour.
    From these and other experiments it appears that the
aqueous humour is composed of water, albumen, gelatine,
and a muriate, the basis of which I found to be soda.
    I have omitted speaking of the action of the acids, of the
alkalis, of alcohol, and of other re-agents, upon this hu
mour.       It is such as may be expected in a solution of al
bumen, of gelatine, and of muriate of soda.
                            Crystalline Humour.
    To follow the order of their situation, the next of the
 humours is the crystalline.
    This differs very materially from the others.
    Its specific gravity is 11000.
    When fresh, it is neither acid nor alkaline. It putrefies
 very rapidly.       It is nearly all soluble in cold water, but is
 partly coagulated by heat.            Tannin gives a very abundant
 precipitate ; but I could not perceive any traces of muriatic
 acid when I had obtained the crystalline quite free from the
 other humours.           It is composed, therefore, of a smaller
 proportion of water than the others, but of a much larger
 proportion of albumen and gelatine.
    * All  these specific gravities are mean proportionals of several expe
 riments.    The eyes of the same species ot animal do not differ much in
 the specific gravity of their humours.
                                                                 Vitreous

                             Vitreous Humour.
      I
      pressed the vitreous humour through a rag, in order to
 free it from its capsules ; and in that state, by all the experi
 ments I could make upon            it,
                                     could not perceive any dif

 ference between       and the aqueous humour, either in its

 other,)  or    its chemical
                   in         nature.
    M. Fourcroy mentions phosphate as contained
                                  a                    these         in

              ;     could not perceive any precipitation by

 muriate or nitrate of lime nor did the alkalis denote the
                                   ;
 presence of any earth, notwithstanding M. Fourcroy's as
 sertion of that fact.
                         HUMAN EYE.
 I    could not procure     sufficient quantity of these, fresh
                              a
enough to multiply my experiments upon them. However,
 by  the assistance of Mr. Carpue, surgeon to his majesty's
forces, fully convinced myself that the humours of the.hu-
          I
man eye, chemically considered, did not contain any thing
different from the respective humours of the eyes had exa        I
mined.     The aqueous and vitreous humours contained wa
ter, albumen, gelatine, and muriate of soda and the crys    ;
talline humour contained only water, albumen, and gela
tine. The specific gravity of the aqueous and vitreous hu
mours     found to be 10053, while that of the crystalline
          I
was 10790.
                             EYES OF OXEN.
 I     found the eyes of oxen to contain the same substances
as   the respective humours of other eyes. The specific gra
 vity of the aqueous and vitreous humours            10088, and
                                                            is
 that of the crystalline 10765.
    What      particularly worthy of notice
              is                                      is,
                                                 that the differ
 ence which appears to exist between the specific gravity of
 the aqueous or vitreous humour and that of the crystalline,
is  much greater in the human eye than in that of sheep, and
less in the eye of the ox.    Hence     would appear that the
                                           it
difference between the density of the aqueous and vitreous
humour and that of the crystalline,      in the inverse ratio of
                                            is
the diameter of the eye, taken from the cornea to the optic
nerve. Should further experiments show this to be           uni      a
versal law         in
                  nature,   will not be possible to deny that
                             it                                             it
is   in some degree designed for the purpose of promoting
distinct vision.
    In taking the specific gravity of the aqueous and vitre
ous humours, no particular precaution         necessary, except
                                                 is
that they ought to be as fresh as possible. But the crystal
                                      3                                   line

          Change observed in the Colour    of Prussian Blue.      271
   line humour is not of an uniform density throughout ; it
   is therefore essential that attention be given to preserve
  that humour entire for this operation;         I found the weight
   of a very fresh crystalline of an ox to be 30 grains ; and its
   specific gravity was, as I before stated, 10765. I then pared
   away all the external part, in every direction, till there re
  mained but 6 grains of the centre ; and the specific gravity
  of these 6 grains I found to be 1 1940. From this it would
  seem that the density increases gradually from the circum
  ference to the centre.
      It is not surprising that the crystalline humour should be
  subject to disorders, it being wholly composed of animal
  matter of the most perishable kind.          Fourcroy says that it
  is sometimes found osseous in advanced age.           Albumen is
  coagulated    by  many   methods  ; and,   if we  suppose that the
  same changes can take place in the living eye as in the dead
 animal matter of the chemists, it will be easy to account
 for the formation of the cataract ; a disorder which cannot
 be cured but by the removal of the opake lens.            If a suffi
 cient number of observations were made respecting the fre
 quency of the cataract in gouty habits, some important con
 clusions might be drawn as to the influence of phosphoric
 acid in causing the disorder, by the common effect of
 acids in coagulating albumen.
 XLVIII.       On a Change observed in the Colour of Prussian
      Blue   by coming in Contact with Iron.           By Thomas
      Gill,   Esq.
                          To  Mr. Tilloch.
        SIB,
 XJ.AVING frequently discoursed with you on the various
 colours producible from iron, I make no apology for trou
bling you with this letter. Happening this morning to be
grinding some Chinese blue colour with parchment, size,
and water, I noticed that a knife I employed in mixing it
became of a greenish tinge : upon this I resolved to prose
cute the experiment, when the following singular result was
obtained -.— After spreading a little of the colour upon the
blade of the knife with a camel's hair pencil, I diluted and
took off enough of the colour to form a tint upon paper,
and as soon as that was laid on proceeded to take off a se
cond, a third, &c. portion, without adding more colour to
the knife, until I had obtained thirty-six different tints, each
                                                            varying

872                 On the  Marine Spencer.
varying in colour from the original blue. The changes wert
to a greenish blue, a green, an olive green, a yellowish
green, a yellow, and so on to a buff colour, where I ceased
from further prosecuting the search.
    I then tried the same experiment with a cake of New
man's Prussian blue ; and, repeating the process quicker, I
obtained from the same original quantity of colour first laid
on the knife no less than eighty-six different tints, each va
rying in colour as in the former experiment.
    Indigo treated in a similar manner did not change its tint
in the feast degree under the process.
    This discovery may lead to very important consequence*
in the theory of colour-making; and it furnishes some cu
rious facts, namely, that the Chinese are acquainted with
the art of making a colour similar to the Prussian blue ; and
that indigo should be preferred to the Prussian blue when
we wish our colours to be durable, and not subject to change
on coming in contact with iron : it should also serve as a
caution never to employ the pallet knife or iron in any
form in treating Prussian blue.
    It would appear from the result of this experiment, either
that the Prussic acid, one of the constituent principles of
Prussian blue, is not saturated in that combination with
iron, but is still able to exercise an action on that metal
in its metallic state, or else that the acid itself becomes
decomposed, giving up its oxygen to the iron, and pro
ducing the ochrey tint which changes gradually the blue to
green.
    We are possessed of one tinge only of green colour pro
duced from iron, namely, Prussian green, with the process
for obtaining which I am unacquainted.
    Allow me before concluding to mention another fact
with which some of your readers may not be acquainted.
The superiority of the Chinese colours over those or Europe
is owing chiefly to their being ground much finer, and be
ing mixed with size instead of gum, which prevents their
having any gloss.
  XLIX.     On the Marine Spencer,     invented  hy  Knight
                         Spencbr, Esq.
An our last Number we gave a short description of this in
vention. To show its great utility, we need only to mention
 a few of the many possible cases in which it may be em
                                                        ployed

         Interesting Curiosities collected  ly Mr. Clarke.    273
          with advantage.     It may be proper to premise, that
 Eloyed
   eing made of an article at all times to be had in abundance,
 and of no present value whatever, and being very simple
in its construction, it may be made by old people in poor
 houses, by Greenwich pensioners, &c. who could not be
better employed, and therefore may be afforded at a price
within the reach of every foremast man.
    It would be a desirable appendage to the life-boat in cases
when the whole crew could not be taken in at once. Any
number of persons furnished with these might be floated
ashore attached to the boat with small cords.         In cases of
shipwreck where no life-boats are at hand, doubtless many
lives might be saved by the marine spencer ; and we may
presume that seamen will act with more effect in time of
danger when they know they have the certain means on
board of getting safe to shore when every exertion is found
in vain to save the vessel.
    In cases of persons falling overboard, any one not ac
quainted with swimming, if furnished with a marine spen
cer, might safely leap after them and keep them from sink
ing until a boat could be launched.
    In cases of fire at sea, or in harbours, the most beneficial
effects may be expected from its use; and had the Queen
Charlotte, which was burnt at sea, been furnishea with
only one hundred of the marine spencers, many hundreds
of lives might have been saved, as in moderate weather one
will keep three or four people from drowning.
    A corner in every seaman's locker in the royal navy could
not be better employed than in containing one of these ;
and if the men were occasionally exercised in the use of
them, so as to render them familiar, the most important
consequences might attend it.
    Most certainly the life-boat is the best means yet disco
vered of preserving lives in cases of shipwreck ; but as the
smaller description of merchant vessels could not afford the
expense of one, these marine spencers are certainly the next
best means of preserving the lives of the crews in such cases.

p. 42, has disappeared ; and that of Euclid, mentioned by
Dorvillc on Chariton, p. 49, 50, was supposed to have

copying     the  scholia  on   Plato,  has  thence discovered pas
sages   from   Greek   plays   and  from  poets that were lost, will,
it is hoped, allow the world to prosit              the fruits of his

   It   is the principal design of our periodical work to
give  some   account of the progress of science and philoso
phy;     and it will not appear to our readers unconnected
with this object if we take notice of a publication which is
the first on the subject, and the professed intention of which
is to enable men of superior attainments to reap the pro
duce of their talent*.    In the 21st of James the statute of
monopolies was passed, by which the exclusive privilege of
the sale of any important discovery for fourteen years was
assigned                                 To the comments on
                 to the ingenious inventor.

voted and full instructions are given to enable the candi

    " It will be seen in the catalogue, that a great variety of
 patents have been extended to objects connected with those
 branches of the trade and manufactures of this country
 which are of the first importance to commercial prosperity.
 No less than thirteen patents in a very short period have
 been assigned for improvements on the steam-engine, most
 of which would have been probably suppressed if the legal
 discussion on the patent of Messrs. Boulton and Watt, for
 an improvement on the same invention, had not completely
 decided the question on the competency and validity of pa
 tents for improvements, whenever those improvements can
 be deemed material and useful.

 how necessary it is that patentees should be informed of the
 rules laid down in the Law of Patents. It will be seen how
 great a portion of the grants appear by their titles to be ex
 tended not to any piece of mechanism, utensil,, or manufac
 ture, but to a process, method, or principle, for which no
 patent can be valid.    Itis,  however, some consolation to
 reflect, that what is  stated as such   often the application

           ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AT STOCKHOLM.
In   the sitting of the 13th of April M.Melanderhjclm read
an account of the expedition recommended by his Swedish
majesty in the beginning of the year 1801, for the purpose
of solving in a decisive manner the problem in regard to
the figure of the earth, which is of so much importance to
astronomy. The king for the accomplishment of this object
appropriated the sum of 5000 rix-dollars, and appointed two
members of the academy, Messrs. Ofverbom and Svanberg,
to perform the requisite operations. These gentlemen im
mediately proceeded to the neighbourhood of the polar circle
to prepare every thing necessary for the operations : such as
observatories for the two remotest stations ; signals on every
convenient point in the extent of twenty-two Swedish miles ;
and a series of triangles as convenient as the situation of the
country would admit. After making these preparations they
returned again to Stockholm to receive one of Borda's circles,
constructed at Paris by Lenoir under the inspection of De-
lambre, together with two metres, and a Peruvian toise of
iron which the French National Institute presented to the
Swedish Academy of Sciences. These articles, however, did
not arrive before the beginning of December at Stockholm,
where Messrs. OfVerbom and Svanberg made preparations for
their new journey.     But as the academy foresaw that two
persons    would  not be sufficient to superintend all the indi ¦
vidual parts and details of this operation, which required so
much accuracy, Dr. Holmquist of Upsal and Mr. Palander
of Abo were appointed to unite themselves to Messrs. Of
Verbom and Svanberg, and to assist them in their labour.
These gentlemen set out together in the beginning of the
year 1S02 ; and immediately on their arrival at Tornea pre
pared   the iron rods which were destined for measuring thp
base line, and made ready for the measurement. The place
on the river Tornea used as a base in 1736 was again made
choice of for the same purpose. Eight weeks were employed
in this operation, from the middle of February to the middle
of April. The centigrade thermometer often stood at 25,
26, and even 30° under the freezing point.         It was neces
sary to measure with the greatest accuracy all the angles
belonging to the series of triangles — a labour they were ob
liged to defer till summer, which in that climate is exceed-

ingly short. The number of these angles amounted to about
80; and it was requisite that the measurement of each
should be repeated at least thirty times, in order to render
as insignificant as possible the errors in the graduation, from
which no instrument is entirely free. This was not only
done, but many of the angles were measured sixty and even
eighty times ; and at the end of August the operations were
so far advanced,     that observations were made of the pole-
 star, by which the extent of the arc of the meridian mea
 sured could be determined. The last southern point was at
Malom, a small island in the archipelago of Tomea, where
 the gentlemen employed arrived in the beginning of Sep
 tember, and continued their observations on the latitude of
 this place till the end of October.      The observation of the
 zenith distance of the pole-star was repeated 400 times.
     In order to avoid, in determining the absolute latitude of
 the first and last stations, the uncertainty which might arise
 from the declination of the pole-star, its zenith distance at
 its inferior passage of the meridian was observed 86 times.
 When all these operations were performed, the expedition
 was considered to be at an end, and the observers returned
 home. Messrs. Ofvcrbom and Svanberg, in order to gratify
 the curiosity of astronomers, who are interested in the result
 of this new measurement, immediately on their return to
 Stockholm undertook a calculation ; according to which it
 appears, that in the latitude of 66° 20' 11<83" the length of
 a degree of the meridian is 57209 toises, or 1Q6 toises less
 than that given by the measurement of Maupertuis.            This
 without doubt will be an agreeable novelty to those who are
 acquainted with the importance of this question, and its
 relation to the grand phænomena of nature. If this result be
  compared with that of Bouguer's measurement at the equator,
  we obtain l -3 1 3th for the flattening of the earth at the pole ;
 and the northern degree of the meridian, which hitherto has
  been so different from all other results deduced from the pre
  cession of the equinoxes, experiments with the pendulum,
  calculations of the parallax compared with the ellipsoid form
  of Jupiter, no longer forms any exception, but coincides
  nearly with that which the greatest mathematicians of the
  last century were obliged to admit. Messrs. Ofverbom and
  Svanberg, however, do not consider the above result as ab
  solute and definitive, because improvements may still be
  made in their provisional calculation, which perhaps may
  amount to 20 toises ; and this is the more possible, as one
  second of variation will occasion a difference of 16 toises.

                    Garnerin's    33d Ascent.
Un     the 1st of July Garnerin, accompanied       Mrs. Garby
nerin, ascended in his balloon at Petersburgh in presence of
their imperial majesties,    great number of persons of
                              a                                         di
stinction, and an immense concourse of spectators.       This
ascent, being Garnerin's 33d, took place in the garden of
the first corps of cadets, where tent had been erected for
                                       a
their majesties, who repaired thither at six o'clock in the
evening.    After they had examined the balloon, Garnerin
presented lo the emperor small one filled with inflammable
                              a
air, which his majesty let off himself. Other balloons of
a similar kind were then presented to their majesties, and
to his royal highness the grand duke Constantine, who let
them off in like manner, in order to ascertain the direction
of the wind. The state of the atmosphere was exceedingly
favourable. At half after seven the aerial travellers entered
the car. The signal was given, and the balloon ascended                   in
a majestic manner.      At eight o'clock  began to descend,
                                               it
and the aeronauts reached the earth in safety on the little
Ochta at some distance from Petersburgh,
                   Mr.   Robertson's       Balloon.
   Mr. Robertson about the middle of July ascended                      ina
balloon at Hamburgh, accompanied by his friend M. Lhoest.
The following are the details published               by
                                                Mr. Robertson
himself
   " On the day on which determined to make my ascent,
        :
                              I
I resolved to rise to as great an elevation as my health and
strength would permit.      M. Lhoest, my friend and com
panion,   having   determined   to accompany me, we took,
besides provisions, as large      quantity of ballast as the car
                                  a
could conveniently contain. After hovering some time over
the city of Hamburgh, we resolved to ascend higher          and,    ;
having thrown out some ballast, we rose to such           heighta
that the elasticity of the air distended our balloon so much,
that we were obliged to open the valve and suffer        certaina

 quantity of gas to escape.      It issued from the balloon with
 a  loud noise.   The   tension  of the balloon being consider
 ably lessened,   we   threw   out  more ballast, and ascended
 till it was almost impossible for us to endure the great
 cold which we experienced. My teeth chattered ; my pulse
 beat with violence ; my veins swelled ; and the blood issued
 from my nose. The state of my friend was different : his
 head seemed to be swelled, and he could not keep his hat
 on.    We experienced also a great numbness, which in
 clined us to sleep. Not being able any longer to endure this
 state, we resolved to descend; which we did slowly, for half
 an hour, with our watches in our hands. About half after
 twelve we arrived over Badenburg near Winsen on the Luhe,
 where we purposed to get out ; but the inhabitants, taking
 us for spectres, fled with the utmost consternation, carrying
 with them their cattle, and sought shelter in their houses,
 the doors of which they shut.
     My friend having observed to me that this terror might
 be injurious to us, and induce these people to sire at us, we
threw out a part of our remaining ballast, and, having again
 ascended, continued our voyage till two in the afternoon.
 We at length descended near Wichtenbeck, on the road to
 Zell, where commissioners Weyhe and M. Raven were so
 kind as to give us every assistance in their power, and caused
 us to be conducted with our balloon to the first post, about
five leagues distant from the place of our descent. We arrived
at Wichtenbeck in perfect health, after having passed over
twenty-five French leagues in five hours;
     By some further particulars which Mr. Robertson has
since published at Hamburgh, it appears that he rose to the
 height of 2600 toiscs.
                            " When the balloon rose (says he)
the thermometer was at 28 inches. At 11 o'clock the ma
chine, which had not been entirely silled, became so dilated
that the inflammable air issued with noise from the lower
tube. As this aperture was not sufficient, I was obliged to
open the upper valve.      It remained open, nearly a quarter of
an hour, during which time the balloon ascended in a per
pendicular direction : at intervals we threw out some bal
last. The atmosphere below us was serene, but above us
it was somewhat cloudy. Though we approached the sun,
the heat decreased as we ascended, and we could look at
that luminary without being dazzled. When the barometer
was at 14 inches it appeared to become stationary.          The
thermometer was at 4* degrees below zero. The cold was
not excessive ; but the singing in my ears increased, and all
our faculties seemed to be palsied by a general indisposition.

Having taken     a little wine to recruit my strength,  I began
some experiments, but they were not satisfactory. I pro
posed to my companion to ascend higher : he consented,
though as much indisposed as myself.           We successively
threw out ballast. The mercury in the barometer fell to
 1 2*4 .inches.  At that height the cold out of the car was
insupportable, though the thermometer was only one degree
below the freezing point. We were obliged to respire faster,
and our pulse beat with extreme rapidity. We could scarcely
resist the strong inclination to sleep with which we were
seized. The blood rushed to our head, and M. Lhoest re
marked that it had entered my eyes. My head was so swelled
that I could not put on my hat. In this region, where the
balloon was invisible from the earth, Mr. Robertson made
 the following experiments :
    1st, Having let a drop of ether fall on apiece of glass,
it evaporated in four seconds.
    2d, He electrified by friction glass and sealing-wax. These
 substances gave no signs of electricity which could be com
municated to other bodies. The Voltaic pile, which when
 the balloon was set free from the earth acted with its full
force, gave only a tenth part of its electricity.
    3d, The dipping needle seemed to have lost its magnetic
virtue, and could not be brought to that direction which it
 had at the surface of the earth.
    4th, He struck with a hammer oxygenated muriate of
potash. /The explosion occasioned a sharp noise, which,
though not very strong, was insufferable to the ear.        It is
also to be observed, that though the aeronauts spoke very
loud they could with great difficulty hear each other.
    5th, At that height Mr. Robertson was not able to ex
tract any electricity from the atmospheric electrometer and
condenser.
    6th, In consequence of a suggestion from professor
Helmbstadt of Berlin, Mr. Robertson carried with him two
birds: the rarefaction of the air killed one of them; the
other was not able to fly, it lay extended on its back, but
fluttered with its wings.
    7th, Water began to boil by means of a moderate degree
of heat maintained with quicklime.
    8th, According to observations made, it appears that the
clouds never rise above 2000 toises, and it was only in
ascending and descending through clouds that Mr. Robert
son was able to obtain positive electricity.

                        NATURAL     HISTORY.
     Captain Baudin, commander of the ships sent on a voyage
 of discovery round     the world, by the French government,
 having   collected at New    Holland and the Moluccas a quan
 tity  of  productions    from   the three kingdoms of nature,
 sufficient to load one of the ships, dispatched them to France.
They arrived lately at Havre in the Naturaliste, commanded
 by captain Hamefin. One of the professors in the Museum
of Natural History' at Paris was commissioned to receive
them, and to take the speediest measures for conveying them
to the place of their destination.
    This collection consists of more than 140 boxes or half
barrels, containing minerals, vegetables, or animals.
    The minerals arc contained in 14 boxes.
    The vegetables, consisting of plants dried and prepared
for the herbal, occupy 12 : besides these there are 3 casks
filled with specimens of different kinds of wood ; 2 boxes
with seeds, and more than 60 half casks of living plants.
    The dead animals, or the remains of them, such as ma
drepores, shells, insects, preserved birds, and skins of qua
drupeds, fill 35 boxes.
    The living animals consist of 19 individuals, and are con
tained in 9 cages.
    All these articles, planks of wood proper for cabinet
makers, and some utensils of the Indians, were conveyed
from the Naturaliste into two small brigs of the state de
stined to carry them to Paris, and to land them at the gate
of the Museum of Natural History.
    This cargo is one of the most valuable of the kind ever
brought to Europe; but unfortunately the length of the
voyage, the want of means, and the multitude of rats with
which the vessel was infested, and ignorance in regard to
the manner of treating live beings, caused a great many of
them to perish on the passage from the South Sea to France.
Many of the animals died, and several of those alive arc
in a languishing condition.         A small number only arc in
good    health,  such as  the Indian hinds and the black swans,
male and female.       Fortunately they are the most valuable
of those embarked.
    In regard to the living vegetables, they have suffered still
more : of a hundred individuals sent from Port Jackson
only thirty give any signs of life, 12 or 15 vegetate feebly,
and only naif a dozen at most are in a good state.      Among
the latter there are several kinds of the flax of New Zea

      We are assured that captain Baudin will continue his re
  searches around New Holland ; that he is employed in col
  lecting geographical observations and natural productions ;
  and that he will return in the month of July next year with
  a more considerable cargo.        As the different parts of this
  new collection, during the voyage, will be under the care of
   those who collected them, it is probable they will arrive in
   a good state, and that they will enable naturalists to become
  better acquainted with the productions of this fifth part of
   the world.
                 RUSSIAN VOYAGE      OF DISCOVERY.
!
      The two   vessels destined for the new Russian voyage of
   discovery  are the Nadeschda (the Hope), commanded by
   captain-lieutenant Krusenstern, the chief of the expedition ;
   and the Newa commanded by captain-lieutenant Lisjansky.
   Both these gentlemen are naval officers of distinguished
   talents, and animated with the utmost zeal for promoting
   the objects of the undertaking.    Dr. Redowsky of Moscow
   has been appointed physician to the expedition, with a sa
   lary of 2000 roubles, and 800 roubles for his table.        As
   these vessels are destined also to carry an embassy to Japan,
  this opportunity will be embraced to send back to their
   native country some Japanese separated from it by an un
   fortunate accident. In the year 1793 the governor of the
   province of Sendey, in Japan, dispatched a transport laden
   with provisions for the maintenance of the troops in the
   capital. In consequence of tempestuous weather this vessel
   was driven from its course, and, after wandering about for
   four months, was at length wrecked on the island of Na-
   azky, which belongs to the Russian American company.
   The governor received the Japanese who escaped, and who
   amounted to sixteen persons, with great friendship, and
   sent them to Ochozk. They were conveyed thence to Irkuzk,
   where they arrived in the month of September 1794, and
   afterwards were removed to Petersburgh.        At present they
   amount to twelve, as four of them died and two remained

manship carried from England to Russia by a German
named Schuri, and sold to the empress Catharine II.- for
 15000 roubles.      It represents a peacock of the natural size,
which spreads out and folds together its magnificent feathers
in a manner which exactly imitates nature. It is accom
panied by a great number of birds and small animals, which
all move with the greatest ease, and emit the sounds pecu
liar to them. This Deautiful automaton was placed formerly
in the Tauride palace, and under Paul I. was removed to
the collection of rarities in the Hermitage.
                      VACCINE INSTITUTION.
The following new Edition of Directions for the Vaccine
      Inoculation has been lately issued ly this Institution :
    I. The limpid matter should be taken from a decidedly
characterized cow-pock, which is proceeding, apparently,
through its respective stages.       It is most efficacious in pro
ducing the vaccina from a pock before the eleventh or
twelfth day; and is most abundant, and is usually taken,
about the ninth day.          But it may be used at an earlier
period, even as early as the fifth day, if it can be collected.
However, matter from a pock later than the eleventh or
twelfth days is not more liable to produce inflamed arms
than that from younger pocks ; and if the cow-pock be ex
cited at all, it is as distinct as from any earlier matter. No
differences in the effects of the vaccine matter inoculated
appear to depend on the presence, extent, or absence of the
red areola.
    II. The matter is usually taken on glass, thread, or a
quill, on which it should be suffered to become dry with
out applying heat, and when so dried it is scarcely visible.
The air should     be excluded by keeping the matter between
two glass plates, or in a bottle silled with hydrogen gas.
    III. As dried matter fails much more frequently to ex
cite the vaccina than recent fluid matter, it will be advisa
ble, in order to insure the effect, or for obtaining a great
quantity of matter, that, instead of a single puncture or
scratch (which is sufficient and preferable with recent mat
ter), there be matter inserted in two punctured or scratched-
        in each arm. The dried matter at the time of inocu-
  ation should be softened by warm but not verv hot water.
{tarts
    IV. The inoculation must be performed in the same,
manner as for the small-pox.
    V. If the infectious matter produce the required effect in.
                                                              three,

                       Vaccine Institution.                  287
three, four, or five days, there will be seen a red spot
like a small gnat-bite ; in six or seven days, a small vesicle
will appear; in nine days, a circular vesicle (improperly
called a pustule) will be found as large as a pea, or from
about two-tenths to four-tenths of an inch in diameter,
usually surrounded by a red areola.         By the eleventh day
the vesicle begins to scab or grow dry, and turn black in
the middle, and the areola becomes more extensive. By
the fifteenth day, but often later, the pock becomes a mere
scab, circular, prominent, well defined, of a blackish or
mahogany colour, adhering firmly ; but the areola disap
pears.    Unless it be separated by violence the scab does not
fall off, in general, sooner than the twentieth day. It then
leaves a cicatrix permanent for life.
   VI. If the eruption or pimple excited by inoculation has
not the characters and does not pass through the stages in
the course above stated (V), although sometimes anoma
lous, this cow-pock may render the constitution unsus
ceptible of the small-pox, yet it cannot be depended upon.
In such cases, the inoculation should be re-instituted ; for,
if the vaccina cannot be again excited, the unsusceptibility
desired will have been produced : but if a further proof be
wanted, recourse must be had to inoculation with the va-
riolous matter.
   VII. In many cases, no constitutional affection or fever
can be perceived : when it occurs, it is almost always on
the ninth and tenth days ; but provided the pock exhibit the
distinctive characters of the cow- pock, even without areola,
with the usual course of its stages, the susceptibility of the
small-pox will be as effectually destroyed as if there had been
considerable febrile affection, and extensive areola.
   VIII. If erythema, like erysipelas, extend over the arm,
with swelling, pain, &c, it has always subsided in a few
days of itself, only avoiding irritating applications, or at
most on using sedatives.
   IX. Eruptions sometimes occur, but they require no par
ticular treatment.
   X. The small-pox may break out at any period within
twelve days of inoculation for the cow-pock.         If they ap
pear earlier than the sixth or seventh, the vaccina is cut off
in its progress ; if they appear later, the vaccina goes for
ward in its usual course.
   XI. The medical treatment which may be required from
unusual or supervening complaints, being analogous to that
in the small-pox, must be accordingly.

LIV.  On the Stones said to liave fallen at Ensisheim, in the
  Neighbourhood of Jigen, and at other Places. From the
  Memoir of M. De Dree *.
JDeing desirous    to collect a certain number of these extra
ordinary  facts, that I might compare them with each other,
I sought for and obtained some correct ideas respecting two
masses of this kind ; one of which fell near Ensisheim, and
the other in the environs of Agen.       These stones, indeed,
have been already mentioned ; Tmt as the latter was neither
analysed nor described mineralogically — as the circumstances
of the fall of the former are imperfectly known — and as, at
the period at which Mr. Barthold professor of the central
¦chool of the Upper Rhine described and analysed            he  it,
could not search for certain distinguishing characters of this
kind of stones, which were not then known — thought       I           it
might be of importance to give an account of them here, in
order to remove all uncertainty respecting the nature of these
bodies.

   The stone known under this, name, which fell at Ensi

took two fragments one of which he kept, and the other
                                  ;
he sent to duke Sigismund of Austria. The people talked

    The same year (1492), after the festival of St. Martin,
 a stone weighing 300 pounds and more, hard, and of diffe
 rent colours, fell in Alsace, with a great noise, from a bril
 liant and flaming cloud. The rest of the horizon exhibited no
 clouds. At the same moment, the heavens being still serene,
 a large red cross was observed around the moon.
    In a rescript of king Maximilian, dated Augsbourg,
Nov. 12, 1503, that sovereign mentions this stone, which
he says fell near him while at the head of his army ; and he
gives it as a presage of the victory which he had gained over
 the crown of France*.
    Brant also has made this stone the subject of some
 poems f.
    One of the fragments of this stone was suspended and pre
 served in the church of Ensisheim till a few years back, when
it was conveyed to the library of Colmar, and there depo
sited. It weighs about 150 pounds at least, notwithstanding
the specimens which have been detached from it ; and pro
fessor Butenschoen says that this stone is beyond all doubt
that spoken of in the before-mentioned chronicles.
    M. Felix Desportes, præfect of the department of the
Upper Rhine, having permitted several fragments to be de
tached from this mass, in order to be sent to me, I am in
debted to that zealous protector of the sciences, and to pro
fessor Butenschoen, for the advantage of being able to give
a comparative description of its characters, and for an ana

did not exhibit that continued black vitrified crust observed

I shall for the sake of brevity give only a comparative de
scription of them.
    In this stone, as well as in that of Sales, there are found
malleable iron, containing nickel disseminated throughout
it in grains ; ktmellated and whitish sulphuret of iron in
the form of lumps and grains; grav sulphuret of iron less*
sulphuratrd, in thin scaly strata, which line a multitude of
small fissures which traverse the stone in every direction :
but it is observed that the white pyrites in it form larger
luinp3, and that the gray pyrites is more abundant than in
that of Sales.
    Small amygdaloid globules might perhaps be seen in it j
but as they have a more metallic fracture than those of the
stone of Sales, as they are almost confounded in regard to
appearance with the mass, they do not deserve particular
attention.      Its interior colour is darker and bluer than that
of Sales, and its fracture i3 somewhat changeable in its co
lour, in consequence of the metallic splendour of small fis
sures, which eives it a different appearance by the magnify
ing glass; ana on the transverse branches of these fissures
it is observed, that this texture and the constituent element*
are the same in both, except in regard to the grain, which
is finer, and the tissue, which is more compact, than in that
of Ensisheim.
   On carefulVy examining the differences which I ob
served between this stone and that of Sales, and which distin
guish it also from the stones of Aeen and of Benares, and
from others of the same kind about to be mentioned, it
will be seen that they do not relate to the constituent ele
ments, but only to their proportions; it is therefore impos
sible not to discover that this mineral mass is of the <am«
nature as that of Sales and others of the like kind. This
is confirmed by the following note, communicated to me by
Vauquelin :
   " This stone has a perfect resemblance in the number,
nature, and quantity of its constituent principles, to all the
stones said to have fallen from the clouds which have hitherto
been subjected to chemical analysis.
   "  It is certainly composed of silex, magnesia, iron, nickel,
sulphur, aud a small quantity of lime.
    " I have ascertained, by particular trials, the presence of
sulphur and nickel in the grains of malleable iron, and in
the pyrites, but in different proportions.      This stone there
                                                             fore

               mid in the Neighbourhood       of Agen.          293
 fere resembles, in every point,      all those which have fallen
 from the atmosphere."
                         2.  Stones  of Agen.
    The  stones  known under the name of         the stones of Agen
have   been mentioned in the Bibliotheque Britannique *.
Their fall has been confirmed by numerous testimonies and
authentic documents, inserted by M. Bertholon in the Jour
nal des Sciences utiles f.
    According to the above accounts,       these stones fell on the
24th of July 1790, between nine and ten in the evening, in
the communes of Juliac, Creon, and others adjacent, between
Roquefort in the department of Landes, Mezin in the de
partment of Lot and Garonne, and Eause in the department
of Gerz, after the apparition of a large fire-ball which passed
through the air, accompanied with a loud report.
    They fell at different distances ; some gently, and others
with rapidity and a hissing noise.
    They buried themselves more or less in the earth : several
had fissures in them.
    Their weight in general was between a quarter of a pound
and two pounds : some of them, however, are said to have
weighed from twenty to twenty-five pounds ; and Mr. St.
Amand saw in the museum of Bourdeaux one of these frag
ments about fifteen inches in length, taken from a stone
which, as said in the accompanying note, crushed a cottage,
made a conical hole of about five feet in depth, and killed a
farmer and some cattle, at the time of the explosion of July
24, 1 790, near Roquefort in Landes.
   There is no stone in the place where they fell which has
any resemblance to them.
    Mr. Darcet was so kind as to transmit to me a fragment
of one of these stones, which fell near Barbotan, a place si
tuated within the boundaries above traced out. It was that
subjected to analysis by Vauquelin.
    This stone has so great a resemblance to that of Sales,
even in the most minute particulars, that the mineralogical
description would be the same, and therefore I refer to the
latter. It has the same vitrified crust ; the same substances
included, and nearly in the same proportions ; the same tex
ture, hardness, and aspect ; the same chemical characters.
    The analysis made of it by Vauquelin gave him the same
chemical substances as the other stones, and in proportions
nearly the same.

   All the masses of iron of unknown origin, such as those
found in Siberia, America, &c. contain nickel, and have be
sides characters analogous to those of the stones which have
fallen from the clouds. These circumstances induced Mr.
Howard and Count de Bournon to conclude that these sub
stances might have had the same origin. The following fact
tends to confirm this opinion.   Mr. Greville, who commu
nicated    to the Royal Society, extracted

in Persian by himself, and translated        colonel William   by
Kirkpatrick.

    In the sitting of the Institute on the Qth of May, C. Four-
croy read a letter addressed to C. Vauquelin from the town
of Aigle, in the department of Calvados (the ci-devant Nor
mandy), containing a circumstantial account of the recent
fall of a considerable number of stones.        The following de
tails are extracted from it :
    On April 26th, about one m the afternoon, the sky heing
almost serene, there was heard a rolling noise like that of
thunder.      It seemed to proceed from one cloud which was
on the horizon, and which the inhabitants beheld with unea
siness ; when, to their great surprise and terror, explosions
like the reports of a cannon, sometimes single and some
times double, were heard, with a violent hissing : phæno-
mena which struck a terror even into domestic animals, for
the cows bellowed, and the poultry fled to a place of shelter.
This noise was succeeded by the fall of a great number of
stones of different sizes, weighing ten, eleven, and even
 seventeen pounds.       The largest entered the earth to the
tlepth of a foot.      Several of them fell in the court-yard of
M. Bois-de-la-ville, and one of them very near him. Many
"curious persons collected some of them, and C. Fourcroy
 laid before the Institute one of these fragments, which, when
 compared with the fragment of a stone that fell near Ville-
 Franche, presented to the Institute in the same sitting by
 C. Pictet, had a great resemblance to it in every point : the
 same colour, the same texture, the same black crust ; in a
 word, the fragments could not he distinguished from each
 other but by the size.
     C. la Marck then reported that he had received from
 the department of Calvados several letters, making mention
 of a globe of fire which had been seen to pass, proceeding
 in a direction from west to east, with great velocity, on the
•same day and at the same hour at which the event alluded
to took place. It was added, that this meteor had been seen
at sea before it reached the continent.
     If any doubts remain to our readers on the certainty of
 the real fall of those foreign bodies of which we have fre
 quently given an account, we request them to peruse a work
 which has lately appeared under the title of Lithohgie Atmo-
 spherique.     M. Izarn, the author, who is professor of philo
 sophy, gives in this work a complete treatise on phænomena
 of this kind. It is divided into three sections. The first con
                                                               tains

                             which   fell   lately in France.                   S97
     tains a collection of the facts and opinions published in
     France since the year 1700 on thunder-stones, thunder, stones
    fallen from the heavens, &c. In the second is found a cri
     tical examination of the systems hitherto formed on this
     •ubject, both in regard to the reality of the fall of stones from
     the atmosphere, and on their origin and formation. It results
     from it that the phænomenon of the fall of solid bodies on
     the earth    is,according to ever) appearance, as old as the
     world;    and that the certainty of the fact         now so well
                                                                 is

      thing as certain. The third section contains an essay towards
    a   theory on the formation of stony and metallic bodies in the
      atmosphere. At the end, the author gives          sort of recapi
                                                                 a

LV.     Memoir on the Stones 7vhich have fallen from the
    Atmosphere, and particularly near LaigLe, in tlw Depart
    ment of I'Orne, on the 26th of April last.       Read by
    C. Fourcroy, in the public Sitting of the Class of the
    Mathematical and Philosophical Sciences of the Institute,
    June 19th, 1803.
JN ature     sometimes exhibits to us facts insulated, as we
may say,    and  so different from any thing with which we
are acquainted, that their existence is long problematical
even to men who are most accustomed to observe its won
derful works, and to calculate its powers.      It was in this
manner that naturalists and philosophers for a long time
classed among fables and popular errors the fall of solid and
stony bodies on our globe.
    Exact accounts, however, which have been multiplied for
six or eight years past ; the coincidence of meteoric circum
stances which in all these accounts accompany the princi
pal phænomenon ; the analogy of the form, structure, and
colour, observed in several of these stones, which have fallen
at different times and in different places very distant from
each other ; and the difficulty of referring these stones to
 any of the species with which we are acquainted, induced
Mr. Howard, an English chemist, to analyse these produc
 tions hitherto so little known.
     By chemical examination he not only found that they
 were all composed of the same principles, but that there
 was a striking difference between them and all the other
 mineral substances hitherto analysed. He found that they
 contained in general from a fourth to two-thirds of their
 weight of silex, a third of iron, a sixth or seventh of mag
 nesia, and some hundredth parts of sulphur and nickel.
 He found also that the general mass of these stones con
 tains inclosed in it globules of iron allayed with nickel and
 a little sulphur, and fragments of pyrites composed of sul
 phurated iron and nickel.
     C. Vauquelin obtained the same results from three of the
 same stones analysed by Mr. Howard, and from two others
 that fell in France, one at Barbotan in 1 789, and the other
 at Creon, in the parish of Juliac, on July 24, 1 790.
     The attention of philosophers was much excited by the
 novelty of these results, while the ability of the chemists
 who presented them commanded the utmost confidence.
.Hence, instead of rejecting the existence of the phænome
                                                          non,

 300     On Stones which have fallen from the Atmosphere,
 non, as had before been done, the greatest philosopher*
 were desirous that it should be carefully studied, fully con
 firmed, and accurately described. With this view C. Izarn
 composed his Litliologie Atmosphtrique, which was soon
 presented to the National Institute.       In this interesting
 work, the first ever written on the subject, are found a
 multitude of similar facts having all the characters of au
 thenticity ; and all the opinions hitherto expressed, both in
 regard to the existence and causes of the phænomenon, are
 clearly detailed and discussed.
    At the time when we were most occupied with this new
 problem of natural philosophy, and while, uncertain in re
 gard to its existence, we were discussing the authenticity of
 the accounts given of it by the antients and moderns, toe
 inhabitants of Laiglc and of a vast extent of surrounding
 district were witnesses of the phænomenon : it appeared
over their heads on the 26th of April, with circumstances
capable of striking with terror and astonishment.
                           Section I.
 Description and Analysis as tlie Stones which fell al Laigle,
   iu the Department of I'Orne, on the 26th of April 1803.
    From all the letters I received, and which I successively
 communicated to the Institute, of which I may mention as
the most authentic those of our fellow-member Leblond,
who has resided in Laigle for several years, it results,
    1st, That about one in the afternoon, on the 26th of
April, the air being rather cold than warm, and the sky with
out clouds, there was seen, at the distance of twelve or fif
teen leagues west-south-west from Laigle, a luminous globe
moving towards the north-west with great velocity.
    2d, That nearly at the same hour there was heard at
I^aiisle and in several of the surrounding villages a violent
explosion, succeeded by two others no less extraordinary,
which were followed by a rumbling noise, the more terrible
as no one knew to what it could be compared or ascribed,
and which continued about ten minutes.
    3d, That after this noise, by which the animals were as
much frightened as the inhabitants, there were seen to fall,
with a hissing noise, stones very much scattered, and of dif
ferent sizes, trom 2 or 3 gros to 1 7 pounds in weight ; that
these stones at first exhaled a strong smell of sulphur, which
was gradually dissipated ; that those who picked up some
                                                             of

   particularly near Laigte, in the Department   qfl'Orne.   301
of them at the time found them very warm ; and that to
judge by the number collected, and by the extent of the
 ground on which they were found, an astonishing quantity
 must have fallen.
     These stones in general are irregular, polygonal, often
 cuboid, sometimes sub-cuneiform, and exceedingly various
 in their diameters and weight ; they are all covered with
 a black gravelly crust consisting of a fused matter, and silled
 with small agglutinated grains of iron. The greater part of
 them are broken at the corners, either by their shock against
 each other, or by falling on hard bodies. The interior parts
 resemble those of all the stones analysed by Messrs. Howard
 and Vauquelin j they are gray, a little varied in their shades,
 granulated, and as it were scaly, split in many points, and
 filled with brilliant metallic points exactly of the same as
  pect as those of other stones of the like kind.
     In conjunction with C. Vauquelin I analysed them in
 the following manner, which has been already employed on
  similar occasions : The stone being reduced to fine powder,
  we poured over it muriatic acid somewhat weakened. A
  pretty strong effervescence was produced ; an odour of sul
  phurated hydrogen gas was disengaged, and the liquor as
  sumed a very evident green colour : the gas collected was
  not entirely sulphurated. Muriatic acid was twice in suc
  cession poured over it to deprive of its colour the insoluble
  part, which after being well washed was found to be pure
  silex, forming more than half of the whole weight of the
  stone.    The muriatic solution with excess of acid was
  treated with ammonia, which precipitated from it the ox
  idated iron, and retained the magnesia and the nickel. The
  iron was completely separated by boiling the liquor, and
  nearly 36 per cent, of that metal, weakly oxidated, was ob
  tained. The liquor, containing a triple muriate of ammo
  nia, nickel, and magnesia, was mixed with a solution of
  potash to precipitate the magnesia, which carried with it a
  small portion of nickel.    Nearly 9 per cent, of magnesian
  earth was obtained.     The water charged with sulphurated
  hydrogen was    afterwards  employed to separate the oxide of
  nickel, of which we found about 3 per cent.
      I shall omit saying any thing here of some difficulties
   which occurred in the details of this analysis : as I reserve
  these for a particular memoir, I shall content myself with
   announcing the result of the analysis.      It gave us as the
   constituent materials of the stone of Laigle the following
   proportions nearly  :
                                                            Silex

   The 5 per cent, of increase arose from the oxidation          of
the metals produced by the analysis.
                           Section II.
             Analysis of   the Stone   of Ensisheim.
     The stone which fell at Ensisheim about the end of the
1 5th  century has given rise to many accounts more or less
fabulous.     Almost all contemporary authors speak of it.
M. Butenschoen, professor of history in the central school
of Colmar, has communicated to me several interesting
extracts from them : but I shall give only the principal facts
of this interesting history.
   We read in a manuscript chronicle, written in German,
that between the hours of eleven and twelve in the fore
noon, on the 7th of November 1492, there was heard in
the environs of Ensisheim a terrible clap of thunder, and
that a child saw fall in a field sown with wheat an enor
mous stone, which entered the earth to the depth of about
three feet : it weighed at that time 260 pounds.        Maximi
lian, king of the Romans, after causing some, fragments to
be detached from    it,gave orders that  it should be suspended
in the parish church of Ensisheim.         Since the revolution
it has been transported to Colmar, and placed in the library         :
at present  it weighs only 171 pounds.
    M. Barthold, professor of chemistry in the central
school of the Upper Rhine, gave          in  the year   8an ana
lysis  of this stone.  Besides  silex, iron,  sulphur, and mag
 nesia, he announced 0*    1
                           7   of aluminc, ana considers       as
                                                                it
a  secondary argillo-ferruginous stone, arising from the de
 composition ot primitive rocks, and detached from        neigh
                                                            a
 bouring mountain.
    The method of analysis which the professor followed did
not allow him to distinguish very accurately the earths
 which enter into the composition of this production.         He
 admits also aluminc, which we did not find in any of our
                                                      experiments    ;

  particularly   near Laigle, in  tlie Department   ofl'Orne.   303
experiments ; while, on the other hand, he observed no
hickel j which, indeed, it was impossible to discover by the
means he employed.
    C. Felix Desportes, praefect of the Upper Rhine, always
disposed to favour researches useful to the sciences,          sent
me a fragment of the stone of Ensisheim weighing several
kilogrammes, which contained on one side a portion of the
black fused crust a little oxidated, and exhibited all the other
properties of the other stones which have fallen from the
atmosphere. There are found in it a kind of small veins of
gray brilliant sulphuret of iron and nickel.          We did not
meet with any very apparent globules of iron.
    A hundred parts of this stone, treated according to the
processes already described, gave
               Silex     -                -    56
               Oxidated iron       -      -   30.

    It  contains then the same principles as the stone of
Laigle, and differs from it only by a little less iron and
nickel, and by a little more magnesia and silex : but this
difference amounts only to a few hundredth parts.
    On comparing the analysis of these two stones with those
already made by Messrs. Howard and Vaucjuelin, it is im
possible not to observe a striking identity in their compo
sition.
                          Section      III.
   Conclusion and Reflections    on the   Origin of these Stones.
    Here then we have nine stones all well ascertained to
have    fallen from the atmosphere with noise, detonation,
luminous meteors; all gray, granulated, and metalliferous
in the interior parts j which give the same products by ana
lysis, containing no alumine, but a great deal of silex, a
little magnesia, and a singular combination of iron, nickel,
and sulphur: in a word, all perfectly similar to each other,
and all different from the other known minerals of the earth.
    It cannot therefore appear surprising that so striking a
physical and chemical analogy should induce a belief that
all these stones have the same origin, and that, as they form
an order of compounds different from any thing ever yet ob-
          9                                                  served

 304 On Stones which have fallen from the Atmosphere,     (fe.
 served among minerals, some philosophers should conclude
 that they do not belong to the fossils ot our globe. Several
 hypotheses have consequently, for some months past, been
 devised to explain the formation of these singular produc
 tions.
    It has long been asserted that they are nothing else but
 minerals elevated and projected from the earth by volcanoes.
 Other philosophers considered them as stones of our globe
 struck and fused on the outside by lightning on the spot
 where they were found ; and lately they have been consi
 dered as earthy and metallic substances raised into the air,
 which being there collected and agglutinated have formed
these masses, which immediately fell down by their own
 weight.
    The manifest contradictions exhibited by these opinions,
 either with the principal circumstances or the fact itself, of
 the fall of these stones, have given rise to one less impro
bable, though perhaps more extraordinary.         It is that of
 some geometricians, who consider them as volcanic produc
 tions projected from the moon beyond the sphere of its at
 traction, and to the confines of that of the earth.
    If this opinion, on the first view, seems to be contra
dicted by all the ideas hitherto entertained, it is at any rate
seen that it is much less susceptible of solid objections than
anv of the preceding hypotheses. The same may be said
of that of Chladni, who with some other philosophers con
siders all the masses which have fallen to the earth as solid
bodies detached from some other planet at the time of their
formation, and which move about in infinite space till they
meet with another, which becoming to them a new centre
of gravity attracts them to its surface.
    An analytical examination of all thexe hypotheses, and
the little agreement between them and the aggregate of the
circumstances which constantly accompany trie phxnome-
non of the fall of stones, and which are essential to them,
have induced the author of the Lifhologie At mosphtriqu*
to suppose that these stones are formed of the elements of
those earths and metals which they exhibit by analysis j
elements which he supposes to be in the gaseous state at a
great height in the atmosphere, and the combination of
which he ascribes to unknown circumstances that rarely
occur.    This opinion admits of several hypotheses, too far
distant from what is yet known not to present difficulties
which cannot be solved in the present state of our know*
ledge.
    To conclude  : In sunn situations one is obliged to choose
                                                        among

     On the Strengths and Values     of Spirituous Liquors. 305
 among ideas each as uncommon as the other ; but it is only
 by rejecting what is absurd and impossible that we can adopt

 LVI. Of     the general Relation between the Specific Gra
    vities and the Strengths and Values of Spirituous Liquors,
    and the Circumstances by which the former are influenced,

   Of   Over-Proofs  and Under-Proofs,       and the Modes   of
                       appreciating   them.
§   21.  A he first idea respecting the denomination of the
relative values of spirituous liquors appears to have been that
of Mr. Clarke, the inventor of the hydrometer now known
by«his name, which was founded on the supposed respec
tive proportions of water which would be requisite to reduce
an over-proof spirit to proof, or proof to an under-proof:
the quantity of water was, however, considered as invaria
ble, being always one gallon ; whilst that of the spirit was
regarded as variable, and as being so modified as to produce
the required ratio between the two. Thus, a liquor which
was so strong as to be supposed to require the addition of
half its measure of water to reduce it to proof was called
"   one to two over proof," indicating that one gallon of
water added to two of the spirit would make proof spirit of
it ; a spirit, with respect to which it was conceived that
one-third of its measure of water would render it of proof
strength, was called " one to three over proof," and so on.
With regard to such liquors as were below the proof strength,
an analogous mode of denomination was used.             Thus, a
liquor which was considered as being of equal strength with
a mixture of one gallon of water with three of proof spirit
was called " one to three," or more commonly " one in
four under proof." This latter denomination became at
length almost generally employed by those who used
Clarke's hydrometer ; so that " one to four" was regarded
as signifying that a liquor was 25 per cent, over proof; and
" one in four," that it was 25 per cent, under proof, with
out the use of these epithets themselves.
    § 22. It was impossible, however, not to feel the incon
venience of a system of denomination which was so com
plex and indefinite. Every scries by which successive quan
tities, qualities, or values of any description are defined,
    Vol. XVI. No. 64.             U                       ought

SOfi       Relation between tlie Specific Gravities and
ought necessarily to be as nearly equi-differcntial as is con*
sistent with the nature ot the thing.       This, however, is by
no means the case with that which is here employed. The
differences between the successive terms of the harmonic
series one-half, one-third, one-fourth, one-fifth, one-sixth,
 &c., arc one-sixth, one-twelfth, one-twentieth, one-thir
tieth, Sec; or such that they are constantly to each other
as the products of the terms between which they fall ; and
their inequality, therefore, becomes very soon exceedingly
great.
    It will perhaps, however, be more intelligible to some of
our readers, if we explain this matter in other words. The
first objection, then, which must naturally occur to every
one with regard to this method of denominating strengths,
is, that in one part of the series the difference between those
of two denominations immediately succeeding each other
is vastly too great, whilst at another part of it this differ
ence is as disproportionally minute. Let us suppose, for ex
ample, that spirit of any particular kind, of proof strength,
is worth 12s. per gallon. Then, what is meant by Clarke's
"   one to two," or that spirit of which 2 gallons would
make 3 of proof, would be worth 12 multiplied by 3 di
vided by 2, or 18s. per gallon; and what is meant by his
" one to three," or that of which 3 gallons would make
4 of proof, would be worth 12 multiplied by 4 divided
by 3, or 16s. per gallon only.      The difference between the
strengths    and  values of these  two   kinds of spirit is enor
mous when regarded in a commercial point of view ; and
yet we have no denomination according to his system (with
out using more complex ratios and higher terms) for any
intermediate strength. If we wished to express the strength
of a spirit of the same kind which was in this respect worth
 17 s. per gallon, we have no name for it.       Now let us look,
at two other terms of his scries, and sec what is the differ
ence in value between his " one to nine" and " one to ten."
The former of these is worth 12 multiplied by 10 divided
by 9, or 13s. 4d.; and the latter, 12 multiplied by 11 di
vided by 10, or somewhat less than 13s. 2{d.; so that
here the difference is but little more than 1 ^d. a gallon, in
stead of 2 s.; and the further we proceed according to this
system, the more the disproportion increases.         But this is
not all. There are many kinds of spirit which are above
his  " one to two," though we have not yet discovered any
which would require an equal measure of water to reduce it
to proof ; and there arc, on the other hand, faints and low
wines which are worth preserving, which are below his
                                                           " ona

        tlie   Strength and Values of Spirituous Liquors.       307
"   one in two          :"   and for all these we have no term what
ever.
   § 23. The next mode of denomination of which we shall
speak is that which is founded on the consideration of the
proportion of water which it would be necessary to add to
or subtract from a given quantity of any liquor, in order to
render it of proof strength, and which proportion is esti
mated in hundredth parts of the quantity of the liquor in
question.     Thus a liquor of which 100 gallons would re
quire the addition of 20 gallons of water to reduce it to
the proof strength was said to be 20 per cent, over proof;
and one of whieh 100 gallons would have required the sub
traction, if that were possible, of 20 gallons of water to ren
der it of proof strength (or, which is the same thing, of
which 100 gallons might be produced by making up 20 of
water to 100, by the addition of proof spirit), was said to
be 20 per cent, under proof.
    § 24. This latter method of denominating the strengths
of these liquors which obtained in consequence of the de
fects and inconveniences already stated in § 21 to have be
longed to that of Mr. Clarke, was, as well as that, founded
on the supposition that the quantity by measure of any com
pound of spirit and water would be equal to the sum of their
quantities before mixture, the principle of concentration
(§ 10) being, when it was first adopted, scarcely known.
    If, indeed, this supposition were true, either mode, of
denomination would, though with different degrees of con
venience, convey an idea of both the relative strengths and
values of the compounds.           This, however, being now
known to be by no means the case, as has been already
stated, it      perhaps, rather unfortunate that the system of
                  is,
denomination mentioned in the last section has now ac
quired such very general acceptation, that we may expect
                    a
that    itwill not be without some difficulty that die same
system, only so far changed as to render           consistent with
                                                     it
the present state of science and truly indicative of relative
 strengths and values, will be received and understood.
    §  25. If the gallon of proof spirit       to be our standard
                                                is
 of comparison, we should of course indicate its tempera
 ture, for quantities             by
                            measure are not the same at different
 degrees of heat          .  We have already supposed this to
                             (§   8)
be 60°       (§
             20)   but  the
                        :    gauging  or measuring and proving
 of spirituous liquors, both            by
                                   the revenue officers and deal
 ers, are performed at various temperatures         and the quan
                                                      ;
 tity of the spirit itself which its measure indicates therefore
 varies accordingly.     Now     this variation in bulk was equal
                                       if
                                       U2                         in

308          Relation between the Specific Gravities and
in spirituous compounds of       all strengths, a gallon of any
 such liquor would at any degree ol neat contain a certain
 proportion ot us bulk ot alcohol, and its per-centage would
 therefore not van,', whatever was its temperature, though a
 correction would he necessary with respect to the actual
 measure of each.      We have already said, however, that this
 is not the case (§ 9) ; aud it is also true, that not only the
 quantity of this variation is different in respect of their
 strengths, but the law of its progression varies still more.
 If the expansion ot mereurv be considered as uniform, as it
 appears to be very nearly between the freezing and boiling
 water points, the expansion of alcohol is progressively in
 creasing, but in a very small degree, between 30° and 80°
 of Fahrenheit's thermometer ; whereas water actually con
 tracts by elevation of its temperature      till it reaches 40°,
 after which it again begins to expand in a very increasing
                its expansion of bulk between 70° and 80°
 Erogression,
   eing  more than   5 times as great as that which takes place
 between 40° and 50°.       The expansion of mixtures of these
 two fluids will in both respects approach nearest to that of
the predominant ingredient ; but the exact quantity of                  it,
 or the law of its progression in any such compound, can
only be ascertained bv experiment.
    We must therefore apply such corrections in our process
as may give us the quantity of proof spirit          by
                                                     weight or,    ;
which amounts to the same thing, by measure when re
                                                          it by
duced to 60°, which       isequivalent to 100 parts       measure
of any spirit at any given temperature at which           may be
measured and proved.
     § 26. The ultimate conclusion from the premises laid
down in this chapter with respect to the mode of denomi
                                                                  is,
nating the strengths of spirits differing from proof          that
it  will be convenient that the scale should be graduated in
per cents indicating the relative values of each compound
with respect to the common standard of proof; or the
number of parts of proof spirit       by measure at 60°, which
would produce or be producible from 100 parts             by
                                                         measure
at any given temperature       of any given spirituous liquor.
Taking, therefore, the strength or value (for, cæleris pari-
lus, they are in the same ratio) of proof spirit as denoted
by   the number 100, some other number between unity and
170 will represent that of every other spirituous compound.
    If, for example, we mean to express     a    kind of spirit of
such     strength, that, on 100 parts of
         a                                 it   by measure at the
existing temperature being reduced to 60° of Fahrenheit's
thermometer, and then made up to 134 with water,                        it
                                                           should

 should become equal to proof, we should call it      134," or       "
" 34   per cent, over proof ;" adding the quantity of the con
centration, if we should wish to ascertain the necessary
quantity of water for this purpose, which would in this
case be about 2 parts more, or 36 parts in the whole.        If
we speuk of a spirit of which 100 parts would be producible
by the addition of water to 80 of proof spirit, we should
call it " 80," or " 20 per cent, under proof." It appears
to the authors that it would save unnecessary periphrasis,
and be mote convenient in several respects to u-c the former
of these modes of expressio i, and omit the terms over proof
and under proof altogether in the denomination of these
strengths.    If this svstem were adopted, the values of all
spirituous liquors, when equal in other respects, would be
in the direct ratio of their per-centages thus appreciated,
and the duties might be estimated accordingly.         If proof
paid 5s., 120, or 20 per cent, over proof, should pay 6s.;
and 80, or 20 per cent, under proof, only 4 s.: and, in
short, the relative values of proof spirit and of any given
compound, or of any two liquors of different strengths, or
the equivalent quantities of each, would in this case be to
be determined in a moment.
   We shall here, merely for the purpose of illustrating its
advantages, give rules for the solution of two or three ques
tions which occur hourly with respect to this subject, with
an example or two to each, founded on the supposition of
the establishment of that system of denomination which is
recommended in this section.

    § 27. It will, perhaps, be expected from the authors of
 this essay that they should here enter into a considerable
 detail respecting the various constructions and uses of those
instruments which they are known to have manufactured
so extensively for several years past for these purposes. This
it is by no means their intention to do in the present in
stance ; a few observations, however, on the subject in ge
neral may not be unimportant.
    It has been a very common error amongst the makers of
these instruments to conceive that their stem should be very
slender in proportion to their bulb ; a construction which
rendered a great number of weights necessary, and which
                                                              was

        llw Strengths and   Values       of Spirituous Liquors.             81   1
 was by no means conducive to their accuracy. The surface
 of aslender stem is proportionally greater when compared
 with its solid content than that of a small one : the capillary
 attraction,   therefore, and the weight of the liquor which
 adheres    to  it,both operate more powerfully •     we take     If
 any   of  those  instruments  whose stem      mere  wire, we
                                                    is

 shall find them, from these causes, so sluggish in their mo
 tion that they will generally stand at anv point of the stem
 at which they are placed, within        quarter of an inch of
                                           a                                 a
 certain part of      it,
                       whereas those with     thicker stem regain
                                                a
 the same point instantaneously.         The thicker the stem,
 therefore, the better, so as    itbe only within such limits as
 to render the difference in the points at which the instru
 ment will stand,       two liquors which differ in very minute
                       in                                a
 degree with respect to their specific gravities, sufficiently per
 ceptible.
     Let us calculate for   a   moment how many weiglits we
 must have to      spirit hydrometer. The stem may very con
                4 a
 veniently be      inches long, and in this length we could
easily graduate 40 or 50 divisions, so that          difference of
                                                         a
one-fourth of each shall be very visible. But we want to
express    adifference of nearly 200 in specific gravity (or from
 800 to 1000)     bythis instrument within about one-fourth of
an unit.     We shall therefore do        extremely well
                                           it                    the   by
virtual lengthening of the stem to four or five times its real
length     bymeans of three or four weiglits.             true, the
                                                         It      is
divisions, unless they be arbitrary ones with          scale of re
                                                             a
ference, are not equal;     if they be units of specific gravity,
they must he graduated from several harmonic scales             but    :
this will not affect the truth of our general deduction         and    ;
three or four weights, therefore, will be fully sufficient for
the nicest spirit hydrometer, whatever scale of graduation
we mav use on its stem.
    This kind of instrument would be far preferable, even                   if
superior accuracy were alone the object,          simplicity were
                                                    if
entirely out of the question, and 40 weights as easy and as
little liable to error in their application as      but when we
                                                    4:
reflect that simplicity and facility of use are, perhaps, even
of more consequence than accuracy in the result, the dif
ference    in the advantages of these modes of construction
becomes enormous.
  It   has been   a  favourite* opinion with some gentlemen,
that glass hydrometers would be preferable to metallic ones,
because they would not be liable to have their bulk altered
by   any contusion without being broken to pieces         whereas;

lacious indications of strength without its being perceived
by the owner of them. The fact                    is,
                                       however, that although,
for certain purposes, where metallic instruments cannot be
used on account of their being liable to corrosion (as in the
case of the mineral acids) we are obliged to employ glass,
yet they are     byno means capable of being rendered so ac
curate as those which are made of metal. The proportion
 of the bulb to the stem, and the consequent extent of the
 graduations, are, of course, within certain limits, matters
 of mere chance and they are, therefore, not the subject of
                  ;
 calculation.    Every such instrument can only be graduated
 by direct experiment and to those who would contend for
                               :
 the eligibility of such     method, where the other can be
                                   a
 used, we can only say, that they have not sufficiently con
 sidered the subject.   The metallic stems and bulbs, on the
 other hand, are          by
                       the tools employed for these purposes
 capable of being reduced so accurately to the required bulk,
 that the error in any point of the scale on this account will
 not amount to one-tenth of an unit in the specific gravity.
 Nor   is   true that
            it             easily possible for the effect of such
                           it   is
 an accident to pass unnoticed                  by
                                      any one who ought to be
 entrusted with the use of an instrument at all. The least
 want of proper convexity in the bulb strikes the eye in an
 instant, even before its effect would be such as to be per
 ceptible in the indication on the stem          and         were
                                                               ;    if   it
 not so, the simple operation of immerging the hydrometer,
loaded with its proper weight in distilled or rain water at
 60°, would at once detect such       circumstance, so that no
                                                 a
 probable inconvenience can ever result from such cause,            a

LVII.    On the Purification     Nickel, with some Remarks on
                                         of
     the Solutions     metallic Oxides in Ammonia, &c. By

Although        nickel has been discovered more than         cen         a
tury, yet its existence as     peculiar metal has not been so
                                        a
well established but that several chemists, even of late years,
have entertained considerable doubt on the subject.          This
has probably been occasioned

of   its magnetic property, it has been supposed impossible to
divest it of iron ; and until the method lately adopted by
R. Chenevix, esq. no certain means appear to have been known
for the separation of the arsenic.
     In order to purify this metal the following method may
be adopted, which includes that above alluded to for the se
paration of the arsenic. Let nickel be dissolved in dilute
nitric acid to complete saturation ; to the filtered solution
add nitrate of lead in sufficient quantity to precipitate the
 arsenic acid.    If more should be employed than is required,
 the    excess occasions no inconvenience.     Having separated
 the arseniate of lead by the filter, add a small quantity of
nitric acid to the solution, and immerse a bar of iron to
 precipitate the copper. This being done, there remain in
 solution the oxides of nickel, cobalt, iron, and lead, which
 may be precipitated by carbonate of potash. The precipitate,
 after sufficient washing, is to be put, while moist, into a so
 lution of ammonia, which, dissolving the oxides of nickel
 and cobalt, leaves those of iron and lead to be separated by
 filtration.
     All that is now necessary is to separate the oxides of co
 balt and nickel, in order to complete the purification of the
 latter : but before the experiments for this purpose are re
 lated, it may not be amiss to state the properties ot the ammo-
 niacal solutions of some of the metallic oxides, although the
 habitudes of all of them are not immediately connected with
 the present inquiry. These I prepared by precipitating the
 oxides from their solutions in acid, and putting them, while
 moist, into solution of ammonia.        Notwithstanding this is
 the most favourable state for the ammonia to act upon
 them, yet in every case, even after long digestion, the am
 monia is in excess, since a part of it may be evaporated with
  out causing any precipitation of the oxide. As these solu
  tions possess different properties when the ammonia is in
  excess and when it is not, in the following experiments I
  shall call the former solution, and the latter evaporated so
  lution.    The evaporation was continued until moist tur
  meric paper, when held over the solutions, suffered no
  change.
      Solution of oxide of silver in ammonia.     Colourless : is
  not decomposed by water. Evaporated solution — Speedily
  decomposed by water : the precipitate blueish white, be
  coming gradually brown by exposure to light.

                                                                It

  It  is not decomposed by water. — The evaporated solution is
  immediately decomposed by it.
      Solution of oxide of-cobalt in ammonia. — Colour deep red ;
 not decomposed by water. Nor is the evaporated solution
 decomposed by water, even when so diluted as to be nearly-
 colourless.
     Solution of oxide of nickel in ammonia. — Colour greenish,
 blue : slowly decomposed by water. Evaporated solution—
 Colour pure green : decomposed immediately by water.
     As silver and copper may be easily obtained from their
 solutions by well-known methods, the above-related expe
 riments are more particularly applicable for the separation
 of cobalt and nickel ; especially as the properties of their
 solutions differ very materially. But as the precipitation by
 water is often incomplete, and always inconvenient on ac
 count of the quantity necessarily employed, without ex
 amining the extent of its effects in the present instance, I
 tried other methods to effect the separation of these oxides,
 and, after some fruitless attempts, found potash answer this
 purpose extremely well. When a solution of it is added to
 the ammoniacal solutions of metallic oxides, the effects pro
 duced are as follow :
     Solution of oxide of silver in ammonia. — Slowly decom
 posed, requiring three or four days for its completion. The
 precipitate is blackish brown.      I have not examined whether
it is fulminating.      Evaporated solution — Immediately de
 composed : the precipitate is of a lighter brown than the
former.
     Solution of oxide of copper in ammonia. — Slowly decom
 posed, and in very small quantity.         Evaporated solution —
 Quickly decomposed.
     Solution of oxide of cobalt in ammonia. — Very slowly and
sparingly decomposed, even by large quantities of the solu
tion ot potash, and more slowly as the solution is more di
lute.     Evaporated solution, by the addition of potash, gra
dually changes from red to pink ; then becomes scarlet, at
length turns brown, and deposits brown oxide of cobalt. If
a quantity of solution of potash be added to a small quantity
of the evaporated solution, precipitation ensues in a few
hours ; but if a considerable quantity of water be added to
similar quantities of the evaporated solution, and of potash,
five or six days are required to complete the precipitation.
     Solution of oxide of nickel in ammonia. — Immediately de
composed, and the more readily as it is more diluted. Eva-*
porated solution — The same properties in a greater degree.

                 On the Purification  os Nickel.              315
    By comparing the above statements it appears proper, for
the separation or" the oxides in question, that the solution
containing them should have the ammonia in excess, and
be largely diluted before the addition of the potash.         The
excess of ammonia prevents, for a considerable length of
time, any precipitation of the oxide of cobalt, while it pro
duces no delay in the precipitation of the oxide of nickel.
Mere dilution precipitates a part of the oxide of nickel ; and
at the same time that it renders the remainder more easy of
precipitation, it prevents for several days any deposition of
the oxide of cobalt. The following experiment will show
that this method may be relied upon :
    To a measure of solution of oxide of nickel in ammonia
I added solution of potash as long as precipitation took
place. The precipitate was washed, dried, and weighed. As
it appeared probable that all the oxide of nickel might not
be precipitated, I heated the solution after filtration till the
ammonia had evaporated, but I did not obtain any further
quantity of oxide.
    To a similar measure of the same solution of oxide of
nickel I added a measure of solution of oxide of cobalt in
ammonia, and precipitated by potash. The precipitate ap
peared to be pure oxide of nickel ; and, after drying, its weight
 did not differ l-10th of a grain from that of tlie oxide of
 nickel obtained in the former experiment. This experiment
 was repeated with nearly similar results.
    Soda produces the same effects as potash, and appears
to act rather more readily ; but whether in smaller quantity
than the latter I have not tried.     Carbonate of potash pro
duces no effect.      The decomposition of the ammomacal
 solutions by potash appears to depend upon a combination
 of the two alkalies ; the compound possessing, as is usual
in chemical combinations, properties either partially or to
 tally differing from those of its constituents. That this pre
 cipitation does not depend upon dilution has, I think, been
 already shown ; and the following experiments more clearly
determine that it must be ascribed to some other cause :
    To one measure of solution of ammonia I added three mea
 sures of water.     Moist oxide of nickel put into this dilute
 solution quickly coloured it. After several days digestion
 the solution decomposed by potash furnished nearly four
 grains of oxide.
    One measure of solution of ammonia was mixed with
 three measures of dilute solution of potash. After as long di
 gestion with moist oxide of nickel as in the former case, the
                                                          solution

318                 On the Purification    os Nickel.
 solution had not acquired any colour ; and on evaporating
the ammonia no oxide of nickel was obtained.
    As far as I have examined, the solutions of oxides in car
bonate of ammonia possess the same properties as those in
ammonia ; for although carbonate of potash does not de
compose the latter, yet the former are decomposed by potash.
This is easily explained. Potash has a stronger affinity for
carbonic acid than ammonia has : when, therefore, a carbo
nated ammoniacal solution is decomposed by                it,part of the
                                                              a
potash    combines     with the  carbonic   acid   of the  carbonate   of
ammonia, and the remaining part decomposes what                      the by
action of the other has become ammoniacal solution.
    Considering that the supposition of combination of the
                                                a
two alkalies would be strengthened        if the experiments which
gave   rise  toit  could  be  reversed,   i.e.  if  itwere possible to
               with ammonia substances dissolved                  by
                                                                potash,

  dissolved in the latter silica, alumina, and several metallic
oxides. On adding ammonia to these solutions,                    at first
                                                                     I
thought I     had succeeded in obtaining precipitates but upon  ;
examining the ammonia employed,                I  found that       con it
tained small quantity of carbonic acid
       a                                        ;  and that when am
monia free from         was used, no precipitate was in any case
                        it
obtained. Although these experiments did not succeed in
supporting the above supposition, yet they are                no means
                                                                by
fatal to it.  It   is probable that potash has       a stronger affinity
for the substances which        it  dissolves than        has for am
                                                         it
monia  ;    and in this case, as no combination could be ef
fected, no precipitation would ensue.            In the first experi
ments potash and ammonia seem to possess                  stronger affi
                                                          a
nity for each other than ammonia has for the oxides soluble
in it.
   Judging    by  the effects produced     by  water and potash, the
affinity of ammonia for the metallic oxides appears to be as
follows :
                      Oxide of cobalt,
                      Oxide of copper,

the  above-described     process, and obtained       a  button of metal
which exhibited the followii       g  properties    :

                       to  Physical Inquiries.

     SIR,
  Jul few   years ago an eminent botanist, now abroad, being
  desirous of ascertaining the comparative elasticity of diffe
  rent woods, was wishing to have some machine made for
  that purpose ; but whether or not any such machine has
  been yet made I am not acquainted. At the same time the
  subject was mentioned the following contrivances occurred
  to my mind, which, if carried into execution, might in
  some measure answer the purpose ; and if you think them
 worth communicating to the public, I shall be glad to see
 them noticed in your magazine. They may serve for some
 of your readers as hints to improve on, and be the means of
 some much more accurate method of ascertaining the elas
 ticity of bodies being invented.
     First Contrivance. — A machine might be made which
 should have a flap on which balls of different sorts of wood,
 or other substances, might be placed, and suddenly let fall
 on a slab of ivory or marble : on this machine there should
 be an upright graduated post in order to see to what height
 each ball rebounded ; by which, in some instances, the com
 parative elasticity of the body subjected to trial might be
judged of.
     Observations. — This method, in order to be accurate,
 should be tried in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump ;
otherwise with light bodies, such as cork and elder-pith,
both very elastic, the experiment will not answer. The in
strument for performing the common guinea-and-feather
operation might, perhaps, be as good a contrivance as any :
a wire cage might be placed under the receiver in order to
          the glass.   Bodies of nearly the same gravity might
Erotect
   e tried in the air.    The standard ball might be ivory let
fall on ivory, or marble let fall on marble.
    Second Contrivance. — Thin slips of different sorts of
wood, See. might be bent half round a circular piece of
                                                          board.

  3 18    Two   Foetuses produced by the same         Parrots whick
  board, and suddenly let loose to fly back by their own force
  against a piece of wood hanging like a door on hinges *.
 The piece of wood should move on a graduated arch, in
  order to determine the degree of force with which the dif
  ferent slips fly back.
      Observations. — How far this contrivance will answer                I
 am not able to determine ; but it appears on consideration
 that some judgment may be formed of the elastic quality of
 bodies by this method, where the substance is capable of
 being cut into slips, which will bend easily and reeover their
 form again. Should either of these proposed schemes, or
 others more preferable, be adopted, it appears to me that
 the knowledge obtained by them might be of considerable
 use in various branches of art, as well as satisfactory to the
 inquiring naturalist.

L1X. Account of two          Fœtuses produced       ly  the same   Parrots
     which in the Year 1801 produced a young one at Rome.
     By C. L. Morozzo, Member of the Institute of Bologna,
     of the Italian Society of the Sciences, of the Academy of
     Stockholm, and of that of Padua f.
In     the letter which    I addressed to C. Lacepede in the year
 1801 on the birth        of  a parrot at Rome (see Philosophical
Magazine, No.          XLVII.),    I contracted an engagement with
the public,     as  I  promised to employ all my care on the eggs
which     these parrots might lay in the spring          of the next year
 (1802).     I shall  now  discharge    my  promise;      and though my
care was not crowned with success, I flatter myself that the
amateurs of natural history will find in it some interesting
details.
     I did every thing in my power to get again into my
hands these parrots, promising to the owner to take the
greatest care of them possible.             By these means I should
have been enabled to observe more exactly their habits ; but
J.   A. Passeri, the owner of them, who was governor .of
Orvieto, gave absolute orders that his son, in whose keep
ing they had been the preceding year, and at whose house
I had made all my observations, should send them to him.
    * Or  it may be made to strike the end of a rod or arrow in the manner
of the catapulta.   The distance to which the arrow is carried will deter
mine the elastic force. — Edit.

       in  the Year 1801 produced a young one  al Rome.   $1$
   These birds had already begun their amours. No rea
sons were able to persuade him to recall his orders. I was
therefore obliged to suffer them to depart : happily they
sustained no injury by the way.
    I therefore employed the only resource that remained ;
which was, to request him to take every possible care of
them ; to cause materials for building their nests to be
placed within their reach ; and to transmit to me a journal
of every thing that might take place. I even delivered to
him a small memorandum in regard to the observations
which I more particularly wished him to make.
    He informed me, that on the 21st of June the female
deposited her first egg ; that on the 25th she deposited an
other; and on the 29th a third. I flattered myself with
the happiest success 5 but though the female sat on them
continually, after the term of forty days, which we found
the preceding years to be the term of incubation, observing
that the first egg had been dragged out of the nest, and that
the other two had been bruised, we thought proper to exa
mine them ; and the following is a literal translation of the
proces-verbal, written in Italian, which was sent to me on
the occasion :
   "   We the undersigned, physician and surgeon of the
town of Orvieto, declare to whom it may concern, that we
saw in the house of J. A. Passeri, governor of the town,
two parrots of the kind called Amazons, viz. a male and
a female, and that on a requisition from the said governor
we paid several visits to these birds after the female seemed
 ready to lay.    We observed that the female on the 21st of
June 1802 deposited an egg in a nest which she had con
structed under a chest of drawers, and lined with linen rags
which had been placed within her reach.
    "  On the 25th of the same month she deposited a se
cond, and on the 29th a third.
    " We observed that the female sat on the eggs, and that
«he continued to do so with great assiduity, and that during
the whole time the male supplied her with food.
    " On the 18th of July we observed the first egg she had
laid to be without the nest : a small round hole, suspected
to have been made by the beak of the mother, was found
in one side of it. On this egg being opened, nothing was
found in it but a little coagulated matter in one corner, al
most black, and putrid, without any appearance of an em
bryo.
    " On the 22d of the same month we examined one of
          3                                                the

320      Two Fœtuses produced     ly Parrots    at Orvieto*
 the eggs which was in the nest, which was cracked, and
 depressed on one side, without any hole being observed as
 in the former. On the 24th it was remarked that the third
 egg had the same depression and fracture as the other.
    " The female, however, continued her incubation with
 great assiduity ; and on the 2d of August, finding that the
 eggs would not hatch, and that the foetus was dead, we de
 termined that day, in presence of the canon Felix Albarici,
 and M. Bernard Piermattei, merchant of that city, to break
 the eggs with great caution ; and when this was done we
 found the following results :
    " In one of the eggs we found the shell very hard, with
 an almost round depression in one of its sides : on the shell
being broken it was observed that the pellicle by which eggs
 in general are enveloped was dry, and adhered to the foetus.
This pellicle being gently removed, we found the foetus,
which was completely formed, and we distinguished in it
 a small parrot.    We observed that the head was placed be
 tween the thighs, with the beak large and long in the upper
 part, the tongue thick, the eyes shut, and covered by the
 eyelids. It had the two wings formed, as well as the thighs
 and legs, with claws on the toes, two of which were before
 and two behind.      On the upper part of the head, the back,
 and as far as the tail, it was covered with white down ; on
the breast and belly there was none ; on the middle of the
 belly was observed a carneous mass adhering to          it,
                                                           which
resembled the placenta.       We found also near the thorax     a
depression which corresponded to the contusion observed
in the shell, and which there     is  reason to suppose was the
cause of the death of the young.
    " In the shell of the other egg contusion was found
                                       a
as in the first :    the pellicle and foetus were completely
formed, though smaller than in the preceding, which gave
us reason to believe that this egg had been the last that was
laid.    In this foetus were observed on the right wing, and
near the thorax,    a  depression and contusion corresponding
to the fracture in the egg.
   « We remarked that the beak of the former was of an
ash colour, like that of the male, and that the beak of the
latter was blacker, like that of the female we therefore sup
                                            :
posed that the first was      male, and the second     female.
  "
                         a                           a
       These two fœtuses were put into     a  flask with spirit of
wine, closed and sealed in the presence of the above wit
nesses, to be kept as an authentic testimony of the prolific
powers of these two parrots which did not surprise us, as
                              ;
                                                               we

           New Spring of Petroleum        discovered in    Italy.    321
  we saw them produce young ones at Rome the preceding
  year, and as that produced in 1801 is lively, and now in
  the possession of the princess Venosa."
     The witnesses who attest the above are :
                    Dr. Louis Bernardi,
                    Joseph Taruchi, surgeon,
                    Felix Alberici, canon,
                    Bernard Piermattei.
     It is to be regretted that the hatching of these parrots has
 not been attended with the same success as it was last year.
     We here see that the climate of Orvieto, which is more
 temperate than that of Rome, was no obstacle to the copu
 lation or laying of these birds. What in all probability pre
 vented the female from hatching the eggs was, that the par
 rots were not in separate apartments as the preceding year,
 and that they were deranged by the too great number of
 people who approached them either through curiosity or by
 accident, since they were placed in a chamber which served
 as a kitchen.
     These birds are suspicious and timid, and it is probable
 that the female bruised the eggs in endeavouring to change
 their position with a view of placing them in more safety.
    But as these birds, according to my calculation, are in
 the vigour of youth, it is to be hoped they will produce young
hereafter; and that the owner, taught by the experience
of this year, will take the necessary precaution of placing
them in an apartment less exposed to noise and bustle,
where the solitude of the place may bring them nearer to
 the wild state, and suffer them to complete their incubation
as during the preceding year.

329        Neiv Spring    of Petroleum    discovered in   Italy.
Amiano,       a village in the state of Parma, near Josnovo and
Varese, on the confines of Liguria. Being vexed that the
government of the country did not take this object into
consideration, I have heard lately with satisfaction that the
government of Liguria has converted it to a useful purpose.
After being analysed- by an able chemist, it has been applied
with great advantage to the purpose of lighting the city of
 Genoa.
     It was C. Mojon, professor of chemistry in the university
 of Genoa, who made the most conclusive experiments on-
 this combustible substance.          He read a report on this sub
ject   before   the   National   Institute   of Liguria on the 4th of
July 1802; and it is an extract from this report, procured
 from the author himself, that I now have the honour of
 presenting to you.
     Professor Mojon, having been on the spot, was enabled
 to see that the richness of the spring of petroleum at Ami
 ano is so great, that, though people have continually drawn
from it since its discovery, it still keeps at the same level.
 He has found in it the following characters :
     This petroleum is exceedingly limpid, of a vinous yellow
 colour, or rather like that ot the topase of Saxony.                  Ils
 smell is strong, penetrating, and less empyreumatic than
 that of the common and brownish petroleum.                  Its specific
 gravity is to that of water as 83 to 100, and          to that  of olive-
 oil as 91 to 10O.
     If a few drops of it be poured on writing paper and ex
 posed to heat, it is entirely volatilised, and leaves no stain.
 Pf distilled in a glass retort, in a moderate heat, it passes en
 tirely into the receiver, and leaves no residuum.
     If it be mixed with concentrated sulphuric acid, it burns,
 becomes thick and dark -coloured.            It readily dissolves am
 ber, sulphur, and resins ; and when mixed with gum copal
 forms a varnish, which, when spread over a piece of board,
 and exposed for some clays to the sun, dries, and loses its
 odour. When poured on alcohol, it floats at the surface
 without dissolving, even when heated and strongly stirred.
 It floats also over fixed and volatile oils, with which it com
 bines by agitation.        Its combustibility is so great, that it
 inflames when brought near to a burning body : it seems
 even to attract the flame in consequence of its great volati
 lity.    Its own fiainc is white and lively, like that of oil of
 turpentine, but it emits much more smoke.
     Having thus determined the characters of petroleum, pro-.
 fessor Mojon, mindful of his commission, examined whe
 ther it might not be employed for lighting the city of Ge-
                                                                    uo*.

           New Spring   of Petroleum  discovered in  Italy.    325
 noa. He made experiments to ascertain the intensity and           ;
 degree ot the light which this liquid produces in comparison
 ot' olive oil ; and was able to make an exact calculation how
 tar it would be advantageous to employ it.
     He put an ounce ot' petroleum into a glass lamp ; added
 a flat wick of four lines in breadth, placing it in such a man
 ner that the bottom of the flame should be about an inch
 above the fluid. He then put an ounce of olive oil into an
 other lamp of the same kind, and kindled both lamps at the
same time.       They gave a flame equally strong, and a light
of the same intensity; but with this difference, that the
former alone produced a little smoke, and burnt an hour and
a half, while the lamp containing the olive oil burnt an
hour and thirty-five minutes. Both of them were then dry,
without leaving any residuum.
    In order to try whether the smoke might not be destroyed
or diminished, he burnt the petroleum in a lamp with a
current of air furnished with a glass cylinder.         He indeed
found that the liquid, while it burned completely with a white
aud very bright flame, emitted no longer any smoke or bad
smell. The combustion was so rapid that the flame was
agitated by it.     Having then introduced into the same lamp
a mixture of equal parts of petroleum and olive oil, he ob
tained a slower combustion, with a more tranquil and uni
form flame. He obtained the same result by the union of
these two substances in a reverberating lamp with a wick
of about an inch in breadth.
    From these experiments he concluded that this petroleum
might be advantageously employed for lighting the streets,
observing the following precautions :
    1st, That the flame should be about an inch above the
oil.
    2d, That the lamp should be covered and closed in such
a manner as to prevent the flame from being communicated
to the petroleum.
    3d, To use a flat wick, to prevent smoke and render the
combustion complete.
    It was in consequence of this report of professor Mojon
that the Ligurian government ordered, petroleum to be em
ployed for fighting the streets of Genoa.      It is used at pre
sent without any mixture : the reverberators are constructed
with the improvements above indicated; but 'care has been
taken to ado a kind of conical tube or chimney of tin plate,
to convey oft" the smoke which may be. disengaged.             By
these means the same quantity of light is obtained as with

LXI. Report on the Discovery of a Deposit of bituminous
  Wood.   Reud in the Ligurian Institute July 1802 by
  C. Mojon, public Professor of Chemistry * .
At the period when      nature opened in the state of Parma,
on the north side of the Appenints, an extraordinary spring
of petroleum ti it presented on the opposite side, in Ligu-
ria, at the distance of about fifteen leagues, a considerable
depot of bituminous wood.         The discovery of this fossil
is even a little more recent, and is equally interesting to the
naturalist and to the state.   For a knowledge of it we ara
indebted to the useful labours of professor Mojon, as will
be seen by the following extract from the report which he
made to the National Institute of Liguria :
   " Castel Nuovo is a country of Lunigiana on the confines
of the Italian republic. It is in the plain of that country,
half a league from the mouth of the Magra, that the mine
of the substance in question has been discovered. It is si
tuated in a soil formed of argillaceous and calcareous strata,
more or less thick, and inclined in different directions
throughout their whole extent. The nature of the fossil,
as well as the constitution of the soil, evidently shows that
these strata were formed only by great floods, which carried
with them and buried whole forests J. The extent of this
deposit, however, cannot be determined, because the pits
proposed to be sunk at different distances for that purpose
hive not yet been constructed. Hitherto one only has been
made, about 40 feet in depth, the bottom of which is inun
dated by a spring that issues from an excavation attempted
in a lateral direction ; and it is to be observed, that in this
pit no disengagement has been remarked of carbonic acid
 gas, nor of those gases generally developed from such ex
 cavations.

    <l
       This bituminous wood, which in some places appears
almost uncov wed, at the surface of the ground still retains
its primitive figure. In the course of the search which has
been made by digging, trunks of different thickness up to
two feet ciiaineter have been dug up ; and among these there
are some compressed, which exhibit in their transverse sec
tion an elliptical form.
    " The colour or this fossil is sometimes a perfect black,
sometimes a grayish black, and sometimes a wood brown.
The blackest is sometimes pretty shining, and has even tl.e
splendour of glass; the slavish black, and brown, are dull,
but shine very much on being polished.
    " Its texture is entirely that of wood, as. it has not been
altered by the bitumen with which it is impregnated ; so
that in some pieces the tree to which they belonged may
he determined : and in particular those which have the
transverse fracture conchoid and shining, and which are
perfectly black, exhibit all the characters of fir : others have
a texture similar to that of oak.
    " It is not so brittle as coal, and, when sawn in a direc
tion perpendicular to the axis of the trunks, exhibits a solid,
compact, and very smooth surface. The concentric strata
of the fibres of which the trunk is composed may be easily
separated by introducing the point of any instrument what
ever.
   "   It readily kindles, and without the aid of any other
combustible: it gives in burning a lively and brilliant flame.
The heat it produces is more intense and durable than that
of any other vegetable coal ; and, when once kindled, never
becomes extinct till entirely consumed, leaving very little
ashes.     The combustion may be interrupted and renewed
at pleasure.
    " Lighter   than coal, its specific gravity is to that of di
stilled water   as  1235 to 1000: the fragments which exhibit
the characters of oak are still lighter.
    "   Sulphuret of iron is sometimes found in this fossil
disseminated in lumps and small grains, which when long
exposed to the air are decomposed, and cause the fragments
to which they belong to fall in pieces.
   " It has besides the properties common to coal : but if
naturalists have long entertained doubts respecting the ori
gin of coals, in consequence of the variety of their texture,
the irregularity of their form, their fragility, their strata
analogous to those of schistous stones, &c, the fossil of
Castel Nuovo presents no difficulty to their researches. The

the bark of the different trunks; its knots ; fracture ; the
colour of some kinds ; the facility with which it inflames ;
the alkali contained in its ashes ; — all these characters, very
distinct, render it perfectly similar to charred wood.
    " It must also be added, that it possesses this singular pro
perty, that it is susceptible of being worked in the lath with
the greatest facility, and of acquiring a polish and splendour
which render it superior to ebonv.
    " In the last place, it is a conductor of the electric fluid,
and transmits it with facility."
    After this short account of the situation and nature of
this fossil, I shall describe some of the experiments which
the author made, in order to determine what advantages
may be derived from the employment of this substance.
    He burnt 12 pounds of this bituminous wood in a fur
nace, adapting to it a thermometer at the distance of eight
inches, the temperature at the time being 10 degrees of
Reaumur.       Sixteen minutes after, the whole wood was
completely kindled, and gave a clear brilliant flame, with,
less smoke than coal and a slight odour of bitumen, which
not being sulphureous did not incommode those persons
even who were nearest to it. The thermometer had risen to
42 degrees.     Twenty-four pounds of water, which were in
a copper vessel on the furnace, then began to boil. The
thermometer stood at the same degree for 12 minutes, and
the water continued to boil for 20.       When the ebullition
had ceased the thermometer fell to 26 degrees, and the
water was reduced to three pounds. The fossil was entirely
 consumed in the course of an. hour and a quarter, and left
 225 grains of yellowish impalpable ashes in the form of
 flakes.
    He then repeated the experiment under the same circum
 stances, and with oak charcoal. The latter kindled in twelve
 minutes, and in four more the 24 pounds of water contained
 in the copper boiler entered into ebullition.      The thermo
 meter rose to 38 degrees, at which it maintained itself for
  18 minutes, and when the ebullition ceased the thermome
ter fell to 25 degrees. Almost the whole of the water was
 evaporated, and the coal, being consumed in the course of
 an hour and a half, left onlv 154 grains of ashes.
    By this experiment, calculating the sum total of the heat
 respectively extricated during the combustion of the two
  substances, the author was able to remark, that the bitu
  minous wood produced 816 degrees of heat during an hour
 and a quarter; while oak charcoal, in an hour and a half,
 produced onlv ?£4>

           Memoir    on aeriform cutaneous Perspiration.          327
     He also tried whether this fossil could be used with ad
 vantage in forges for forging iron.            He kept at a red heat
 for some time the extremities of an iron rod, one in bitu*
ininous wood and the other in oak charcoal, employing
equal pans.       When the iron rod was taken out, he found
¦its extremities equally ductile,          malleable, and tenacious.
There is every reason to think that this new combustible
mav even be employed in the reduction of iron ore ; but this
the author has not been able to ascertain, for want of mate
rials.
    Professor Mojon terminates his report with the following
analysis :
    This fossil wood gives almost the same products as coals, if
we except the ashes, from which a little potash is extracted.
    By distillation he obtained phlegm, yellowish bituminous
oil, a quantity of carbonic acid gas, carbonated hydrogen gas,
and an empyreumatic oil thicker than the former.
    In alcohol a portion of this wood, at the end of some time,
gave a blackish resinous substance.
   By ebullition in distilled water it suffers to be precipitated
calcareous earth and argil.
    By pouring nitric acid over this fossil, it is decomposed,
disengaging nitrous gas.
    In the last place, the 225 grains of ashes, obtained by the
above combugtion of 12 pounds of this fossil, gave by lixivi-
ation and filtration 1 J grain of potash, oxide of iron, alu«
mine, lime, and magnesia.

X hysicians       at all times have endeavoured to ascertain the
influence which the air has on the human body ; but how
can we conceive that the antients, who were not acquainted
with the gravity of that fluid, should have been able to de
termine its action?         If we therefore except Hippocrates,
who formally asserts in his works that air is digested in the
Jungs as the aliments are in the stomach, his contemporaries
and successors have left us on this subject incoherent ideas,
often ridiculous, and always erroneous, the fruits of an ima
gination not guided by any certain experience.

    If I   intended to consider the influence of the air under
 every point of view, I should begin with respiration ; a func
 tion of so much importance, that without it life could not
 exist, while it alone can for some time maintain and pre
 serve it.
    But the modern chemists, after an exact analysis of atmo
 spheric air, have given a theory of respiration so ingenious,
 so complete, and so well founded on correct experiments,
 that all the attempts hitherto made to overturn it have only
 tended to establish it more and more.
    I could therefore only repeat here what has been said be
 fore me by Lavoisier, Seguin, Crawford, Fourcroy, Chap-
 tal, &c. ; and this matterhas been so well elucidated by the
 labours of these celebrated chemists, that it is in some mea
 sure exhausted ; and their theory in this respect has been so
 \vk! . ly diffused, that it is now adopted by all men of science.
 I shall therefore abstain from repeating what would be here
 tiresome and superfluous.
    But if what takes place in the lungs is exactly known,
 the same light has not yet been thrown on the functions of
 the skin. Independently of cutaneous perspiration, observed
 With so much care and correctness by Sanctorius and several
 others, does there escape through the skin one or more aeri
 form fluids ? and, in this case, of what nature are they ?
 Such are the two questions which I purpose to examine in
this memoir.
    The antients had no idea of this aeriform cutaneous per
spiration, and they make no mention of it in their works.
    Count de Milly first announced, in 1777? the discovery
of an clastic fluid * which escapes through the skin. He
 asserts that a person in a warm bath may collect half a pint
of it in the course of three hours; and it results from his
analysis, which indeed is very imperfect and incorrect, that
it is fixed air (carbonic acid gas).
    Dr. Ingenhousz announced some time after that an aeri
form fluid escapes through the skin ; but he believed it to be
phlogisticated air (azotic gas.)
    Dr. Priestley and M. Fontana repeated the experiments of
the two preceding philosophers, and observed no aeriform
emanation through the skin.
    M. Jurine, a surgeon at Geneva, being desirous to be
come a candidate for the prize proposed oy the Royal So
ciety of Medicine f, repeated the experiments of Milly and

Ingenhousz, both on himself and on several individuals of
different ages, employing different kinds of water, the tem
perature ot which he varied, and asserts that he never ob
served the least aeriform emanation.        Presuming that the
water, according to its gravity, might impede the escape of
the air, or that it might crisp the exhaling vessels of the
skin, he continued his researches, varying the processes
employed by Dr. Priestley and M. Fontana; and he thinks
he has proved by experiments, the inexactness of which
might be easily shown, that a small quantity of fixed air
(carbonic acid gas) is continually escaping through the skin.
   Fourcroy on this subject expresses himself as follows :
"  It is not true that elastic fluids, and particularly carbonic
acid gas, escape through the skin, as some of the moderns
have asserted *.
  Such, a few years           ago,     was the state       of the question
which forms the subject of this article. Incorrect experi
ments, the contradictory results of which were contested
either in the whole or in part, left philosophers in uncer
tainty, and seemed, to call for new researches, in order to
 fix the opinion of philosophers on this point.
    I often reflected on      it,
                             and had formed      design of em

being near one of my patients who was in the bath,         per             I
ceived that he was entirely covered with small bubbles of
air.    The hairs on his body were surrounded by bubbles
decreasing from the base to the summit, so that great                      a
number of them exhibited the appearance of pyramids more
or less elevated.     made all these bubbles disappear; but in
                      I
the course of half an hour they were succeeded         an equal    by
number.      In consequence of observing this phænomenon,
I  caused my patient to continue his bathing        and having ;
collected several bell-fulls of this gas,    examinedI    care          it
fully several times, and found that       was azotic gas, per
                                                it
fectly pure, without any mixture of carbonic acid.
 I    was then desirous to know whether this phænomenon
was general, or whether        depended on the pathological
                                  it
state of the subject.     made experiments on myself, and
                           I
on several other individuals, but never observed any thing

approbation of so celebrated a professor, I resolved to do so.
 It was not sufficient that I was certain of the exactness of
my experiments ; it was necessary also that I should con
vince philosophers of it.
      Having collected with great care, in the spring of the
year 9, a certain quantity of this gas, I filled with it a small
bell 10 lines in diameter and 8 inches in height.         A taper
was immediately extinguished in- it eleven times in succes
sion.
   .. It traversed  lime-water without rendering it turbid, and
without decreasing in volume.
      It experienced no change from ammoniacal gas.
      It produced no alteration in blue vegetable colours.
      Phosphorus which remained immersed in it for more than
a month had not decreased in volume.
      I thought these experiments more than sufficient to con
vince me that the subject in question was azotic gas.
      I again transmitted the result to C. Fourcroy in the month
of Fructidor, year 9 ; but it is probable that the hurry of bu
siness prevented him from returning me an answer.               •
      Having reflected   a good deal since that period on the im»
              of this discovery, I did not cease to attend to it ;
   ut my ideas are entirely changed in regard to the conse
Eortance
quences which may be deduced from it.
      In letters written to Fourcroy, and particularly in the
last, I considered my discovery as a particular fact depend
ing on a pathological state ; but at present I am obliged to
consider it as a general phænomenon belonging to the hu
man species.
      1st, Because it is probable that the gas which passed so
abundantly through the skin of count de Milly was azotic
gas.       One will easily be convinced of it by reading his me
moir with attention.
 -
      2dly, Dr. Ingenhousz, convinced from his own experi
ments that an aeriform fluid escapes through the skin, be
lieved that it was phlogisticated gas (azotic ga3) .
      3dly, The idea of Ingenhousz is confirmed by my experi
ments.
      4thly, I some time ago met with another individual who
perspires abundantly in the bath.         The bubbles with which

atmospheric air, the latter could not-be displaced by the azotic

to have been different with carbonic acid gas, ii any be con

experiments.
    Those which Jurine made, by placing his arm in a cover
of glass, are not more conclusive ; because, having been
made with a view to prove that carbonic acid gas escaped,
he did not employ the means proper for indicating the pre
sence and quantity of azotic gas, of which he did not su
spect the slightest disengagement.         But why has not this

remarked in all individuals placed under the same circum

ment of this memoir, according to M.Jurii«2, that the
water acting by its gravity on the exhaling vessels of the
skin, which in different individuals are endowed with a dif
ferent energy, opposes in the greater number the escape of

    I shall here terminate this memoir, to which I might have
given more extent had I been inclined to treat of all the ques

 the attention of philosophers to this subject, and being satis
 fied with having laid the first stone ot the edifice, I leave
 to abler architects the glory of finishing the building.
LXIII.       Extract from   the third Volume   of   the Analyses    of
                            M. Klaproth.
JL his celebrated chemist, so well known for the precision
of his analyses, and by the valuable discoveries with which
he has enriched the province   of chemistry, has published a
third volume of his Chemical Researches, dedicated to Vau-
quelin.   Among the number of ingenious analyses it con
tains, there are some particularly interesting to geologues :
such as those of cryolite, sonorous porphyry, and basaltes ;
in which we are suprised to see soda form, and even in con
siderable quantity, one of the constituent principles of rocks
and compact stones.    That of the ombre earth of Cyprus             is,
we may say, the first with which we are acquainted, and the
most correct. The rest, some extracts from which we shall
                                                                   here

                  Extract from the third Volume os
here    present, confirm or rectify those before made by the
most celebrated chemists.
                   Analysis of sonorous Porphyry.
   Sonorous porphyry unites in it all the mineralogical cha
racters of the other porphyries.                 Its substance, equally
hard, is composed        of   silex   and  alumine,       interspersed with
some    small   leaves  of  feld-spath,     and    small    grains, not very
numerous, of ampbibolite. But it differs from it by its foli-
aceous fracture.        Besides, when broken, it has a sound
almost metallic.       The name of sonorous porphyry appears,
then, to be perfectly suited to it.
   It is found in the mountains of Bohemia, in those of
Upper Lusatia, and in the country of Fulda. It never forms
these continued chains, but only insulated mountains, and
commonly situated in the neighbourhood of those of ba-
saltes.    It forms mountains of the hardest kind, and which
present the greatest resistance to degradation. It effloresces
only at the surface ; and the argillaceous crust which covers
it renders these stones very slippery, and of difficult ascent.
   The colour of the sonorous porphyry is gray, sometimes
inclining a little to green. It is always compact, rough, split
in its fracture. It breaks into thick leaves, very thin frag
ments of which have pellucid edges.                    Its substance, the
grain of which is fine,       is  very  hard   and  smooth.        When re
duced to powder it       is  of  a gray   colour.      Its   specific gravity
is 2-575.
   Sonorous porphvry reduced into small fragments, and
freed as much as possible from the leaves of feld-spar and
grains of amphibolite disseminated throughout its mass, lost
3 per cent, of its weight by calcination.               Its gray colour be
came lighter,      but it  experienced      no   other   alteration.
   When exposed        to  a  porcelain    furnace    it  fuses into a com
pact glass.

                  the Analyses  of M. Klaprotk.              333
   The naturalist will be able to appreciate the discovery of
soda as a constituent principle of rocks. It is seen that it is
no longer necessary to recur to the decomposition of fossile
or marine muriates of soda, to explain in all cases the forma
tion of free soda, or of the carbonate of soda.
    The sonorous porphyry subjected to this analysis was
taken from the mountain of Donnersberg,nearMilleschau,in
Bohemia. This majestic cone, of 2500 feet height above the
level of the sea, and from which is discovered, to the east, the
magnificent plain of Prague, crowned by the high mountains
of Bohemia and Silesia, and in the west the Fichtelberg,
which overlooks Franconia, is entirely composed of the same
rock of porphyry.       If it be now considered that soda con
stitutes almost the twelfth part of that enormous mass, it
will not appear exaggeration to advance, that the Donners-
berg alone could supply all Europe with it for several centu
ries, if the least expensive means of extracting it could be
discovered.
       Analysis of the prismatic Basaltes of Hasenlerg.
    Dr. Kennedy     has already published that he found soda in
 his analyses   of the lava of Etna, and in basaltes : Klaproth
has made a new analysis which confirms this discovery.
    Basaltes exposed to the heat of a porcelain furnace, in a
clay crucible, was converted into blackish brown glass, pel
lucid at the edges. In a crucible lined with charcoal, it was
 converted into a gray porous mass, abundantly interspersed
 with small grains of iron. The following is the result of his
 analysis :

 Kennedy, approaches near to the preceding.          The propor

    Dr. Kennedy makes no mention of magnesia, but he in
dicates muriatic     acid as one of the principles of basaltes.
M.    Klaproth    analysed it again, in order to try to discover
it.   He   decomposed basaltes by nitric acid, and poured into
the solution a solution of nitrate of silver. He observed a
slight cloud, and collected a deposit which weighed 3-10ths
of  a grain.     On this muriate of silver he found nitric acid,
which    reduced it to 1 -20th of a grain ; a quantity so small,
that it does not announce the hundredth part of a grain of
muriatic acid in the basaltes      of Hasenberg.
            Analysis of the Gold Ore of Transylvania.
    It was by    the analysis of these gold ores, so rich, that
M. Klaproth      discovered tellurium ; and as this new metal
constitutes the greater part of them, they have since been
called the auriferous ores of Tellurium. Under this name
M. Klaproth comprehends,

taken from Mariahilf, near Zalathna, in the mountains of

       An Account of some new Properties of Tellurium.
    Mercury seems only to be weakly attracted by this metal.
 One part of tellurium pulverised and heated in a small
 retort with six parts of mercury, seemed to be united into
an amalgam with a crystallized surface.             But M. Klaproth
found that the mercury had scarcely dissolved any of the
tellurium, and that the former had only covered the surface
of it under the form of small scales.
    The solution of tellurium in muriatic acid is clear. If
water be added to the saturated solution, it first produces a
 precipitate, which a greater quantity of water afterwards re-
dissolves. But if alcohol be poured in instead of water, and
if the precipitate be edulcorated with alcohol, scarcely any
tellurium will remain in the solution. Precipitates obtained
by alcohol or by water are not pure oxides of tellurium.
They always retain a little muriatic acid.
    Solutions of tellurium where the acid predominate* a
little, are neither rendered turbid nor produce any precipi
tate by those of prussiate of potash.         This is a remarkable
property   of  this    metal,  which   it however   participates with
gold, platina and antimony.           Tincture of gall-nuts poured
into a solution of it gives a flaky precipitate of an Isabella
colour.     Phosphorus immersed in a muriatic solution of
tellurium becomes covered in the course of time with me
tallic leaves.

    Besides the red ore of manganese found at Szekeremb,
 which     varies both in regard to its form and colour, and
 serves as matrix to the auriferous ores of tellurium worked
 there, there is one which exhibits the following characters :
     It has a mean colour between the brown and the black
 of iron (ethiops) . It is almost always compact, sometimes
veined with red ore of manganese, or it forms alternate strata
with that ore.
    It has a semi-metallic state.
    Its fracture is unequal, of a small grain, and foliated in
every direction.
    It splits into fragments irregularly angular, the edges of
which are not very obtuse.
    It is opake.
    When scratched the trace appears of the dark yellow co
lour of brass, inclining much to green, and almost entirely
dull.     It is of a mean hardness, and pretty smooth to the
touch.       Its specific gravity is 3*950. This ore contains
       Oxidulous manganese soluble in nitric acid           82

            New Analysis     of Cryolite ly M. Klaproth.
    Cryolite is one of the most interesting of the new disco
veries    in mineralogy.       It was found in Greenland, and a
small quantity of it was some time ago received at Copen
hagen.        Professor Abilgard, who was of great service to
the mineralogy of chemistry, undertook the analysis of it.
He found it to be composed of fluoric acid and alumine ; a
very unexpected combination,          no instance of which  had be
fore been found.
                  External Characters of Cryolite.
    External form as yet undetermined ; colour a bright
whitish gray ; fracture, when longitudinal, brilliant ; when
parallel to the axis, less brilliant. Both have a vitreous
splendour: its fractures are foliated, and intersect each other
at right angles; in the other directions they are unequal.
Cryolite breaks into cubic fragments : it is semi-trans-
            tender, and pretty soft to the touch ; exceedingly
farent,
  ragile ;   and, according to Andratla, of the mean specific
gravity of 2-9695, or according to Haiiy 2-949.

838           Extract from    the third Volume    of
   Exposed to the blow-pipe on coals, it first forms itself
into a white opake found ball; but it afterwards loses its fu
sibility, and resembles earth strongly calcined.     The name
of cryolite then is not suited to this fossil because it fuses
by the blow-pipe like glass, but perhaps because it has some
external resemblance to it. Klaproth repeated the analysis
of cryolite in the following manner, in order to determine
with the greater precision the proportions of the consti
tuent principles of this fossil : he heated to dryness in a
platina crucible 100 grains of cryolite in powder with 300
grains of sulphuric acid, to effect a complete separation of
the fluoric acid. The mixture at first boiled up with a
disengagement    of fluoric acid vapours. The residuum being
dissolved in water was precipitated bv evaporation under
the form of a soft saline matter, which was easily redis-
solved by the addition of a little water.
   2d. M. Klaproth precipitated from the solution, by means
of caustic ammonia, the alumine, which when washed and
dried weighed 46 grains, and only 24 when afterwards cal
cined. This earth, when dissolved by heat with diluted
sulphuric acid, was entirely precipitated by the addition of
potash in regular crystals of alum.
   M. Klaproth neutralised, by means of acetous acid, the
solution from which the alumine had been separated by
ammonia: he poured into it acetite of barytes; and the li
quor being filtered and evaporated, he brought the residuum
to a red heat in a platina crucible.       He then caused it to
redissolve, and freed it by the filter from a small quantity of
carbonaceous matter. By evaporation to dryness he ob
tained 02| grains of very dry carbonate of soda, which con
tained 36 grains of pure soda.      Saturated with acetous acid,
it wholly crystallized into acetite of soda.
   Deducting from the 100 grains subjected to analysis the
weight of the quantities of alumine and soda found in them,
we shall have that of the fluoric acid and of the water of
crystallization.
   Cryolite then is composed of alumine, soda, and fluoric
acid in the following proportions :
         Soda       -       -       -       -     - 36
       Alumine          -         -        -         -   24

        Analysis of   Umber   Earth   lij   M. Klaproth.
  The old mineralogists     gave the name     of umber   earth to   a
                                                               brown

                  the Analyses   of M. Klaproth.             339
brown earthy powder.        It is composed of a brown     carbo
naceous earth, which may easily be known, as it is entirely
 converted into ashes by exposure to fire.      On this account
 Cronstedt gave it the name of mumia vegetalis, and Walleriu9
calls it humus umbra. This substance has nothing in com
 mon with the real umber earth but the colour.
   On the other hand, umber earth is incombustible, and,
according to its constituent principles, ousrht to be classed
among the ores of iron.       It may be considered as a variety
of bog iron ore. The only analysis made of it before that
of Klaproth was by M. Santi, who analysed that of Castel
del Piaro.    The proportions he indicates are as follow:
               Oxide of iron       -      -   - 53
               Alumine         -        -     -24
               Silex     -       -       -    -   ly

                                                 100
   But   as M. Santi makes no mention of manganese, which
however is one of the essential principles of umber earth,
this omission must excite some doubts in regard to the cor
rectness of the proportions which he indicates. The umber
earth employed in the following analysis was procured
from the island of Cyprus : it resembles externally that
known in commerce under the name of fine Turkish umber,
and is equally good for painting ; it would therefore be su
perfluous to describe its exterior characters.
    1st. Kept at a red heat for half an hour in a crucible, it
lost 14 per cent, of its weight. But it experienced no other
alteration except that its colour had become a darker
brown.
   2d. Exposed to a more violent heat, it enters into fusion.
M. Klaproth put a fragment weighing 200 grains into a
charcoal crucible, which he placed in a porcelain furnace.
He took out the crucible quite safe, and containing a button
well fused under a thick vitreous scoria of a hyacinth co
lour, and covered with points at the exterior surface,     Thig
metallic button was a little tenacious in its fracture under
the hammer, and presented a granulated tissue like that of
steel.    It weighed 80 grains, and the vitreous scoria 47,
The Joss consequently amounted to 36J per cent.
   A hundred grains of umber earth well pulverized, mixed
with 200 grains of concentrated sulphuric acid evaporated
to dryness, were brought to a red heat in a crucible by
means of a very strong sire.         The red mass appeared of a
brick colour : it was porous, and easy to be pulverized.
                                Y   a                    When

340              Extract from       the third Volume    of
When     washed with        water and filtered, the liquor became
brown, and      contained     sulphate of magnesia.
   A hundred      grains   of  umber earth reduced to sine powder,
and digested       with   boiling muriatic acid, left a residuum
which weighed 9 grains. The solution when filtered was
                     1
condensed by evaporation, and mixed with a concentrated
solution of tartrite of potash; but the mixture remained
clear. M. Klaproth then endeavoured to obtain a precipi
tate by the solution of caustic soda, but did not succeed : he
even did not observe any cloud, and the saturated solution
assumed a reddish brown colour.               He poured into it mu
riatic  acid,  and   the   colour   of  the solution   was heightened :
he   then tried,   but  without     success,   to precipitate  it by am
monia; for the mixture reappeared with the brownish red
colour before indicated, and without any cloud.
    M. Klaproth's object was to separate the manganese
from the iron by means of these reagents ; but this trial
only confirmed a peculiar property of the tartareous acid,
which is, that by its presence it renders iron soluble in alka
line solutions.
    A hundred grains of pulverized umber earth were mixed
with a solution of 200 grains of caustic soda, then desic
cated to dryness, and exposed in a crucible to a moderate
fire for half an hour. The mass dissolved in the water gave
it a beautiful dark emerald green colour, which became of
an amethyst red by the addition of muriatic acid.                    This
 acid added to      saturation     dissolved    completely,   and  the li
quor had acquired        a  red  colour   inclining  to yellow.     There
were disengaged at the same time vapours of oxygenated
muriatic acid\         The solution, when evaporated almost to
 dryness,   assumed      at last the form of a jelly : diluted with
 new   water,   it left on   the filter silex, which when well dried
 weighed    13   grains.
    2d. M. Klaproth poured into the liquor a solution of
 caustic soda, which he added in excess, and the brown oxide
 of iron precipitated by it was washed. The remaining so
 lution was precipitated by sulphuric acid, and neutralized by
 carbonate of potash : alumine was deposited, which when
 dried weighed 5 grains.
    3d. The oxide of iron after being dried was black and
 brilliant, and resembled a piece of coal: it weighed 68 grains.
 Redissolved in muriatic acid added only to the point of sa
 turation, it was precipitated from it by the succinate of am
 monia.     The rest of the solution become colourless, mixed
 with the abundant water arising from the washing of the
 flaky deposit of iron, was again precipitated by that of
                                             3                     caustic

caustic soda, with which Klaproth boiled it. The blackish
brown flaky deposit, which was blacker after beinq; washed
and dried, weighed 20 grains : it was formed of oxide of
manganese. This quantity deducted from the 68 grains of
iron previously obtained, reduced the real proportion of the
oxide of iron to 48 grains.
    The proportions of the constituent principles of the um
ber earth of Cyprus then are :
               Oxide of iron          -       -         48

                    Analysis of Spar in Tablets.
    Spar in tablets * is generally found in a mixture of brown
crystallized granite and blue calcareous spar, of which it
forms the third substance.           It is of a milky white colour.
M. Karsten has described hexaedral crystals of , it. M.
Stutz calls it spar in tablets, because it exhibits in its frac
ture long leaves a little brilliant.         It is found, according to
M. Stutz,     at Dognaska in the canal of Temeswar, and ac
cording to M. Estner, at Oravuza.
                              ...

    Miemite takes its name from Miemo in Tuscany, where it
was found by Dr. Thompson in 1791, and made known by
him under the appellation of magnesian spar : it is of an                 ¦
asparagus green colour, crystallized in flattened triangular
 pyramids : it is of mean hardness and gravity, rough to the
touch, &c. A hundred parts of miemite contain

 that ospharmacolite and scorza sand, as well as that of miemite.

    The proportion of the principles       of miemite, which ap
 proaches   very  near to that of the magnesian        spar of the
 Tyrol, ought to make them be considered as two species
-of the same kind.
            Analysis  of prismatic Magnesian Spar.
    This spar, discovered at Gluuk Eronn, in the country of
 Gotha, in veins of cobalt, is very rare : its crystals are tetra-
 edral, almost rectangular, of an asparagus green colour,
 darker in several varieties than that of the chryso-beryl, and
 rarely so clear as that of the apatite of Cape Gates. They
 exhibit a vitreous splendour in their fracture; they break in
 irregular angular fragments ; they are very pellucid, and of
 a mean hardness ; they leave a snow-white trace ; their spe
 cific gravity is 2*885.
     Some crystals of magnesian spar, calcined in a platina
 crucible for half an hour, came from it entire ; but exceed
 ingly friable, and altogether opake. Zones of different co
 lours, the interior of which was Isabella yellow, Were ob
 served in them ; the second was reddish white, and the
 nucleus pink brown : they retained also some splendour,
 and had lost 45 per cent, of carbonic acid, though the whole
acid was not then entirely volatilized.        A hundred parts of
magnesian spar     contain

 a striking difference will be found in the proportion of
 the carbonic acid ; for that of the carbonic acid is at most
 73 parts in a hundred in the common carbonate, while it is
 nearly 103 in the natrum of Tripoli, which makes 30 more.
     It is this more complete saturation of soda by the car
 bonic acid which- gives to trona the property of not efflo
 rescing.      There are certainly some local circumstances
 which tend to favour it. But these must be determined by
 future naturalists who may visit the places where it is found.
     Common carbonate of soda is not at its maximum of sa
 turation ; consequently it is susceptible of combining with
 a larger quantity of carbonic acid.        This may be effected in
the same manner as the complete saturation of the carbo
nate of potash. That of artificial soda completely saturated
approaches, therefore, to trona, both externally in regard to
the foliated form of its crystals, and the property which it
 acquires at the same time of presenting greater resistance
to efflorescence.

been heretofore deemed a desirable object, and it is conse

to be noted in meteorological registers as they occur, a
practice which may be productive of considerable advan

save room and the labour of writing, and types may be

    In tracing the various appearances of clouds, we haver
only adverted to their connection with the different states
of the atmosphere (on which, indeed, their diversity          in   a
        measure depends), having purposely avoided mixing
  ifficult and doubtful explanation with simple descriptive

                             Of Evaporation.
  On   the         and universal origin of clouds there can
               remote
be but one opinion — that the water of which they consist
has been carried into the atmosphere           by
                                           evaporation.   It
                                                               is

346              On the Modifications           of Clouds, and
is on the nature of this process, the state in which the va
pour subsists tor a time, and the means by which the water
becomes again visible, that the greatest diversity of opinion
has prevailed.
     The chemical philosopher, seduced by analogy, and ac
  customed more to the action of liquids on solids, naturally
  regards evaporation as a solution of water in the atmosphere,
 and the appearance of cloud as the first indication of its pre
 cipitation ; which becoming afterwards (under favourable
 circumstances) more abundant, produces rain. The theory
 of Dr. Hutton goes a step further, assumes a certain rate
 of solution differing from that of the advance of tempera
 ture by which it is effected, and deduces a general explana
 tion of clouds and rain from the precipitation which, ac
 cording to his rule, should result from every mixture of
 different portions of saturated air. The fundamental prin
 ciple of this theory has been disproved in an essay hereto
 fore presented to the society*, and which was written under
 the opinion, at present generally adopted by chemists, that
 evaporation depends on a solvent power in the atmosphere,
 and follows the general rules of chemical solution.
    The author has since espoused a theory of evaporation
 which altogether excludes the above-mentioned opinion (and
 consequently Dr. Hutton's also), and considers himself in
 a considerable degree indebted to it for the origin of the
explanation he is about to offer. It will be proper, therefore,
 to state the fundamental propositions of this theory, with
such other parts as appear immediately necessary, referring
for mathematical demonstrations and detail of experiments
 to the work itself, which is entitled " Experimental Essays
on the Constitution of mixed Gases ; on the Force of Steam
or Vapour from Water and other Liquids in different Tem
peratures,   both in a Torricellian Vacuum and in Air; on
Evaporation ; and on the Expansion of Elastic Fluids by
Heat. By John Dal ton." —See Memoirs of the Literary and
Philosophical Society of Manchester, vol. v. part 2. — The
propositions are as follow :
  "    I. When two elastic fluids, denoted by A and B, are
mixed together, there is no mutual repulsion amongst their
particles ; that is,the particles of A do not repel those of B,
as they do one another.         Consequently, the pressure or
whole weight upon any one particle arises solely from
those of iis own kind.

                                                           is
distances above or below the several temperatures at which
they boil in the open air and that force

the force of aqueous vapour            of    2 1 2°  is  equal    to  30  inches   of
mercury; at 30° below,             or  182°,      it  is  of    half   that   force;
and at 40° above, or 232°, it is of double the force : so like
wise the vapour from sulphuric ether which boils at 102°,
then supporting 30 inches of mercury, at 30° below that
temperature it has half the force, and at 40° above                             douit,

                       :   so  in other    liquids.       Moreover,        the force
of aqueous vapour of 60°                nearly equal to half an inch of
                                           is

water of the same temperature, confined with perfectly dry
air, increases the elasticity to just the same amount.

directly   as  the     force of steam from such liquid at its tem

    " I  have frequently tried the evaporation at all the tem

tail of all the experiments, but shall give the results at some
remarkable points.       In all the high temperatures I used the

force of aqueous vapour at all the temperatures under 212°,
I was naturally led to examine whether the quantity of water
evaporated in       given time bore any proportion to the force
                          a
of vapour of the same temperature, and was agreeably sur

be verified by experiments in low temperatures regard must
be had to the force of vapour actually existing in the atmo
sphere at the time.       For instance, if water of 59° were the
subject, the force of vapour of that temperature is l-60th
of the force at 212°, and one might expect the quantity
of evaporation l-60th also; but if it should happen, as it
sometimes does in summer, that an aqueous atmosphere to
that amount does already exist, the evaporation, instead of
being l-60th of that from boiling water, would be nothing
at all.   On the other hand, if the aqueous atmosphere were
less than that, suppose one-half of                           \t\

 and made to be suspended from a balance.           When any ex
 periment, designed as a test of the theory, was made, a
 quantity of water was put into one of these (generally the
 six-inch one, which I preferred), the whole was weighed to
 a grain ; then it was placed in an open window or other
 exposed situation for 10 or 15 minutes, and again weighed
 to ascertain the loss by evaporation ; at the same time the
 temperature     of the water was observed, the force of the
 aqueous atmosphere       ascertained as above, and the strengh
 ot the current of air noticed.       From a great variety of ex
 periments made both in the winter and summer, and when
 the evaporating force was strong and weak,           I have found
 the results entirely conformable with the above theory. The
 same quantity is evaporated with the same evaporating force
 thus determined, whatever be the temperature of the air,
 as near as can be judged ; but with the same evaporating
 force, a strong wind will double the effect produced in a
 still atmosphere. Thus, if the aqueous atmosphere be cor
 respondent to 40° of temperature and the air be 60°, the
evaporation is the same as if the aqueous atmosphere were
at 60° of temperature       and the air 72°; and in a calm air
the evaporation from a vessel of six inches in diameter in
such circumstances would be about •£) of a grain per minute,

                    Of the Aqueous Atmosphere.
    Having quoted so much of this essay as may suffice to ex
hibit the principles on which we shall proceed, it may be
useful, before we do this, to recapitulate the following cir
cumstances respecting the atmosphere of aqueous gas, or
 (for brevity) the aqueous atmosphere.
     1st, It is supplied by the process of evaporation, which
bv this theory appears to be reduced to the immediate union
of water with caloric into a binary compound, aqueous gas.
    2dly, The supply of vapour (by which term, for the pur
poses of meteorology, we may denote aqueous gas), is re
gulated by the following circumstances:
                                                — 1 . Temperature
of the evaporating water, being greater as this is higher, and
vice versa.     2. Ouantity of surface exposed.    Since it is from
the surface only of the mass that the vapour in common
cases can escape, the supply is in direct proportion thereto.
3. Ouantity of vapour already subsisting in the atmosphere >
the evaporation being less (with equal temperature and sur
face) in proportion as this is greater,
                                            and vice versa.
                                                               3dly>

           their Production, Suspension,        and Destruction.         331
    3dly, The vapour thus thrown into the atmosphere is dif
fusible therein bv its own elasticity, which suffices for its
ascent to any height in a perfect calm. Yet, as in this case
the inertia of the particles of air considerably resists its dif
fusion, so in the opposite one of a brisk current, the vapour,
by the same rule, must in some measure be drawn along with
the mass into which it enters.
    4thly, The quantity of vapour which, under equal pres
sure, can subsist in a given mass of air, will be greater as
the common temperature is higher, and vice versa *.
    Aqueous vapour is the only gas contained in the atmo
sphere which is subject to very sensible variations in quan
tity.     These variations arise from its attraction for caloric
being     inferior  to th it of all the others.       Hence when a cold
body, such as the glass of wa't:r in the experiment above
quoted, is presented to the atmosphere, the other gases,
 composing the latter, will only be cooled by it (and that at
 all known temperatures) ; but the vapour, after being more
or less cooled, will begin to be decomposed, its caloric en
 tering' the body while the water is left on the surface.
    The formation of cloud is in all cases the remote conse
 quence of a decomposition thus effected, except that the ca
 loric escapes, not into a solid or liquid, but into the sur
 rounding gases.
                       Of the   Formation     of Deiv.
    Dew      is the immediate result      of this decomposition.         The
 particles of water constituting it are, singly, invisible, on ac
 count of their extreme minuteness.                The approach of dew
 is, nevertheless, discoverable by a dark hazy appearance,
 verging from purple to faint red, extending rrom the horizon
 to a small distance upwards, and most conspicuous over val
leys and large pieces of water.
    The theory of dew seems to be simply this : — During the
 heat of the day a great quantity of vapour is thrown into the
 atmosphere from the surface of the earth and waters. When
    *"The aqueous vapour atmosphere is variable in quantity according to
 temperature : in the ten rid zone its pressure on the surface of the earth is
equal to the force of -6, and from that to one inch of mercury.      In these
parts it rarely amounts to the pressure of -6, but I have frequently observed
it above half an inch in summer : in winter it is sometimes so low as to be of
no more force than -i of an inch of mercury, or even half a tenth, in this
latitude, and consequently much less where the cold is more severe.      This
 want of equilibrium in the aqueous vapour atmosphere is a principal cause
 of that constant inundation of it into thitempeiate and frigid zones, where
it becomes in part condensed in its progress by the cold, like the vapour
of distillation in the worm of a refrigeratory, and supplies the earth with
Tain and dew."      See the Essays ahpvc quoted.
                                                                          the

 352            On the Modifications       of Clouds, and
 the evening returns,      if the
                              vapour has not been carried off
 in part by currents, it will often happen  that more remains
diffused in the general atmosphere than the temperature of
the night will permit to subsist under the full pressure of
the aqueous atmosphere. A decomposition of the latter
then commences, and is continued until the general tempe
rature and aqueous pressure arrive at an equilibrium, or until
the returning sun puts an end to the process. The caloric of
the decomposed vapour goes to maintain the general tempe
rature ; while the water is separated in drops, which, minute
as they are, arrive successively at the earth in the space of
a few hours.    That the ordinary production of dew is bv a
real descent of water from the atmosphere, and not by de
composition of vapour on surfaces previously cooled (as in
the experiment already mentioned), any one may readily
be convinced by observing in what abundance it is collected
by substances which are wholly unfit to carry off the requisite
quantity of caloric for the latter effect.
                 Of the   Formation      of ike Stratus.
   The   case   which   has been     just stated, of the   decomposition
of vapour by the atmosphere in which it is already diffused,
goes but a little way in explanation of the production of a
cloud consisting of visible drops, and confined to a certain
space in the atmosphere : much less does it enable us to ac
count for the diversity of its situations and appearances.   In
attempting this we will begin with the stratus, as the most
simple in structure, and the next step, as it were, in the pro
gressof nuhificatian .
   When dew falls upon    a surface the temperature of which
is superior to that of the atmosphere, it is plain that it will
not continue there, but will be evaporated again : and a body
so circumstanced will continue to refund into the atmo
sphere the whole of the water thus gradually deposited on
                                                                      it,
so long as its substance can supply the requisite tempera
ture to the surface. Moreover, water either in mass, or
diffused among sand, clay, vegetable earth, &c. will con
tinue to be evaporated therefrom with      force proportioned
                                                a
to its temperature, so long as the latter continues above that
point which counterbalances the pressure of the aqueous at
mosphere.
  From    these causes     happens, that after the earth has
                           it

     This nocturnal evaporation    is usually most powerful in
the autumn,     about the time that the temperature of the
nights undergoes a considerable and sometimes pretty sudden
depression attended with a calm.
   In this state of things the vapour arising from the heated
earth is condensed in the act                           we may                (if
                                 of diffusing itself
be allowed the expression)     the cold particles of water thus

case    they alight on the herbage.
          if                           In this way an aggregate
of visible drops sooner or later formed and as from the

354             Of the    Modifications       of Clouds, and
 sition, extending through the portion thus thrown up, and,
 in short, a recommencement in the superior region, of the
 same process which in the vicinity of the earth furnished
the dew of the night.            In this case, however, the particles
 of water cannot arrive at the earth, as they are necessarily
 evaporated again in their descent.
     It appears that this second evaporation takes place pre
 cisely at that elevation where the temperature derived from
 the action of the sun's rays upon the earth, and decreasing
 upward, becomes just sufficient to counterbalance the pres
sure of the superior vapour.
     Here is formed a sort of boundary between the region of
 cloud and the region of permanent vapour, which for the
 present purpose, and until we are furnished with a nomen
 clature for the whole science of meteorology, may be deno
 minated the evaporating plane, or, more simply, the vapour
 plane *.
     Immediately above the vapour plane, then, the formation
 of the cumulus commences (as soon as a sufficient quantity
 of vapour has been thrown up) by the mixture of descend
 ing minute drops of water with vapour newly formed, and
just diffusing itself, as in the case of the stratus before de
 scribed.
    A continuance of this process might be expected to pro
 duce a uniform sheet of cloud, in short a stratus, only differ
 ing in situation from the true one. Instead of which we see
 the first-formed small masses become so many centres, to
 wards which all the water afterwards precipitated appears to
 be attracted from the space surrounding them j and this at
 traction becomes more powerful as the cloud increases in
 magnitude, insomuch that the small clouds previously
 formed disappear when a large one approaches them in its
increase, and seem to vanish instead ot joining it. This is
 probably owing to the small drops composing them having
 passed in a loose manner, and successively, into the large
 one, and consequently so as not to be traced in their pas
sage.
     Are  the distinct masses into which the drops form them
 selves, in this case, due to the attraction of aggregation alone,
 or is the operation of any other cause to be admitted ?
    A   rigid mathematician would perhaps answer the latter
 clause in the negative ; and with such a conclusion we
 should have great reason to remain satisfied, as cutting short

                                                                         much

 •much of the inquiry that is to follow, were it not that it
 leaves us quite in the dark, both as to the cause of the variety
 so readily observable in clouds, and their long suspension,
 not to insist on several facts contained in the former part of
 this paper, which would then remain unaccounted for.
    The operation of one simple principle would produce an
 effect at all times uniform, and varying only in degree. We
should then see no diversity in clouds but in their magni
tude, and the same attraction that could bring minute drops
of water together through a considerable space of atmo
 sphere in a few minutes, ought not to end there, but to effect
their perfect union into larger, and finally into rain.
    In admitting the constant operation of electricity, which is
 sometimes so manifestly accumulated in clouds, upon their
forms and arrangement, we shall not much overstep the limits
of experimental inquiry, since it has been ascertained by se
veral eminent philosophers, that " clouds, as well as rain,
snow, and hail, that fall from them, arc almost always elec
trified *."
    An insulated conductor formed of solid matter retains
the charge given to it so much the longer, as it is more
nearly spherical, and free from points and projecting parts.
The particles of water, when charged, appear to make an
effort to separate from each other, or, in other words, be
come mutually repulsive. Moreover, when a small con
ducting substance is brought within the reach of a large
one similarly electrified, the latter, instead of repelling, will
throw the small one into an opposite state, and then attract
it. From these and other well-known facts in electricity it
would not be difficult to demonstrate) that an assemblage of
particles of water floating in the atmosphere, and similarly
electrified, ought to arrange themselves in a spherical ag-^
gregate, into which all the surrounding particles of water
should be attracted (within a certain distance) at the same.
time that the drops composing such aggregate should be
absolutely prevented from uniting with each other during
the equilibrium of their electricity.
    To apply this reasoning to the formation of the cumulus,
we may, in the first place, admit that the commencement
of distinct aggregation, in the descending particles of water,
is due to their mutual attraction, by virtue of which small
bodies, floating in any medium, tend to coalesce.                   The
masses thus formed, however, often increase more rapidly
than could be expected from the effect of simple attraction

356             On the Modification os Clouds,        &c.
exercised at great distances ; and when the cloud has arrived
at a considerable size, its protuberances are seen to form, and
successively sink down into the mass, in a manner which
forces one to suppose a shower of invisible drops rushing
upon it from all parts.
   In unsettled weather the rapid formation of large cumuli
has been observed to clear the skv of a considerable hazy
whiteness, which on the other hand has been found to ensue
upon their dispersion*.
   On these considerations we are obliged to admit as a co
operating cause of the increase of this cloud, that sort of at
traction which large insulated conducting masses exercise,
when charged, on the smaller ones which lie within their
influence. Instead of a spherical aggregate, however, we have
onlv a sort of hemisphere, because that part of the cloud
which presents itself towards the earth can receive no ad
dition from beneath, there being no condensed water. On
the contrary, the mass must be continually suffering a di
minution there by the tendency of the cloud to subside, and
of the vapour plane to rise during the increase of the diur
nal temperature.         It is this evaporation that cuts off all the
cumuli visible at one time in the same plane, and it is rea
sonable to conclude that much of the vapour thus produced
is again condensed without quitting the cloud, as its course
would naturally be mostly upward.                Tims the drops of
which a cumulus consists mav become larger the longer it
is suspended, and the electricity stronger from the compa
rative diminution of surface.
   Such is probably the manner in which this curious struc
ture is raised, while the base is continually escaping from
beneath it.      That we may not however be accused oflmild-
ing   such   a castle   in the air bv attempting further conjec
ture, we may leave the present modification, after recapitu
lating some of its circumstances which appear to be ac
counted for.
   The cumulus appears only in the day time, because the
direct action of the sun's rays upon the earth can alone put
the atmosphere into that state of inequality of temperature
which has been described. It evaporates in the evening
   * That clouds    are not always evaporated when they disappear, but
sometimes dispersed so as to become invisible as distinct aggicgates, is
a fact prtety well ascertained by observations. This happens somctiir^s
by the approach of other clouds; at others, the evaporation of part of a
cumulus is followed by the dispersion of the remainder.    The criterion
used was the speedy production of transparency iu the one case, and of
hazy turbidness in the other.
                                                                   from

  from the cessation of this inequality, the superior atmo
  sphere having become wanner, the inferior colder : attend
  ed with a decrease of the superficial evaporation.          It be
  gins to form some hours after sun-rise, because the vapour
  requires that space of time to become elevated by the gra
  dual accession from below.           When a stratus covers the
  ground at sun-rise, however, we often see it collect into
  cumuli upon the evaporation of that part of it which is im
  mediately contiguous to the earth : and this effect ought to
  happen ; for the cloud is then insulated, the vapour plane is
  established, and every thing in the same state, except in
  point of elevation, as in the ordinary mode of production
  of the cumulus.
     Lastly, the cumulus, however dense it becomes, does not
  afford rain, because it consists of drops similarly electrified
  and repelling each other, and is moreover continually eva
  porating from the plane of its base. The change of form
  which comes on before it falls in rain, and which indicates
  a disturbance of its electrical state, will be noticed hereafter.

 LXV.      Account   of  a  Spaniard who can endure, without
     being   incommoded,    the greatest Degrees of Heat.        By
     J.  C. Delametherie*.
  A. native of Toledo, in Spain, about 23 years of age,
 who arrived lately at Paris, has made different experi
 ments to show that he is capable of enduring the greatest
 degrees of heat without being incommoded. We shall here
 give an extract of those made at the school of medicine be
 fore several of the professors, about three hundred of the
 pupils, and several other persons.
     Care was taken to examine him before, and it was found
 that his state exhibited nothing different from that of a man
 in good health. His pulse beat about 75 or 78 times a
 minute.
     Exp. I. A vessel containing oil heated to 85° of Reau-.
mur being prepared, he opened his hand and applied the
,palm of it several times to the oil ; he then washed his
hands and face in the oil, and applied the soles of his feet
to it. At the end of the experiment the heat of the oil waa
 still from 76 to 78 degrees.

and 2| inches in breadth was brought to a cherry red heat
at one of its extremities, and placed on bricks. The Spaniard
placed the sole of one of his feet on the red part : a portion
of the oil which still adhered to it immediately inflamed.
He applied the sole of the other foot in the like manner,
and this he repeated several times.
    Exp. III. The flat part of a large iron spatula 18 inches
in length was brought to a cherry red heat. The Spaniard
thrust out his tongue, applied it to the red p-rt of the spa
tula, and repeated the same thing several times. Three
glasses of pure water were then brought, into one of which
a few drops of sulphuric acid were put, and into another a
 pretty large quantity of marine salt : the third contained
 only water. The Spaniard was made to drink these three
 glassfulls, and was able to distinguish perfectly the savour
 of them.
    Exp. IV. He took a lighted candle, and drew the flame
 of it several times over the posterior part of his leg from the
 heel to the ham.     He was examined after these trials, and
 no part of his skin appeared to be in the least altered. The.
 sole of his foot seemed to be smokey — which ought to be
 ascribed to the carbon of the oil — but his pulse beat from 1 30
 to 140 times in a minute.      It appears that since that time
 he placed himself in an oven heated to 70 degrees, and re
 mained in it some minutes.
    Dr. Blagdcn, a fellow of the Roval Society of London,
 supported a still greater degree ot heat.         He heated an
 apartment till Fahrenheit's thermometer rose to 260 degrees,
 entered it with his clothes on, and remained in it 8 minutes.
 At last he was much oppressed. Several other persons en
 tered it also.   His pulse when he quitted the apartment
  beat 1 44 times in a minute.
     In another experiment he entered, undressed, into tht
  same apartment heated to 220 degrees of Fahrenheit, and
  remained in it 12 minutes without Deing incommoded.
     In a third experiment, the chamber being heated to 25Q
  degrees of Fahrenheit, he entered it along with several other
  persons, and remained in it several minutes without being
  incommoded.
     Some eggs and a beefsteak were placed in the same apart
  ment on a pewter dish ; in twenty minutes the eggs were
  entirely hard, and in forty-seven the beefsteak was, not only
  baked but almost dry.

  T*he   return of the Naturaliste to France, under the com
  mand of captain Hamelin, will enable you to judge how
 well our time has been employed in what relates to natural
 history.     I have entrusted him with the care of conveying
 to their destination all the articles we have hitherto collect
 ed, being persuaded that he will discharge this duty with
 that zeal and attention of which he has given me so many
 proofs.     I recommend him to you on that score.
     By my letter to the minister of the marine, containing
 several extracts of my Journal, you will see that for two
 years I have done every thing in my power to increase our
 collections of every kind.
    The premature death of C. Riedle and Maug6, whose
 memory I must ever respect, has reduced me to the neces
 sity of undertaking myself the departments of both these
 gentlemen, in which they acquitted themselves with a zeal
 I can never hope to equal.
    I shall not entertain you at present with an account of
all the events which have occurred since our departure ; I
shall only observe, that I never performed a voyage attended
with so many hardships. More than once has my health
suffered ; but if I shall be so fortunate as to terminate this
expedition agreeably to the intentions of government, and
the expectations of the French nation, I shall have little
left to wish for, and my difficulties will soon be forgotten.
1 have the greater      hopes of succeeding, as Lewin's Land,
with those of Concord and De Witt, Entrecasteaux's Chan
nel, the island of Maria and its environs, the eastern coast
of the large island of Diemen, Basse's and Banks's straits,
and the whole south-west coast of New Holland from Cape
Wilson to the islands of St. Peter and St. Francis, have
been explored in a manner sufficient to ensure the safety of
navigation.      Much, however, remains to be done for the
topography      of the country, which no doubt will be long
unknown, on account of the natural difficulties presented
by the extent of coast which we have explored.
    To supplv the place of Le Naturaliste I resolved to pur- '
chase a small vessel of thirty tons, which I have named the
{jisuarina, because the greater part of it is constructed of

wood distinguished by that appellation.          This small vessel
will in future accompany me, and will be of the greatest
utility. Had I been in possession of it sooner, some places
to which I could not penetrate would not have remained
unexplored ; as it draws little water, it can airy where ap
 proach the coast.
    Another consideration.no less important, which made me
 resolve to send home the Naturaliste was, the embarrass
 ment occasioned by transporting our collections, which the
 casualties of the sea and the length of the voyage might
 have rendered fruitless to government and to the sciences,
 had I subjected them to the new risks to which we are
 about to be exposed : as the number is very considerable,
 and as they are of some value, I am convinced that govern
 ment will approve of my conduct.
    Many of the great number of birds which I have sent
 to you, and which I received from the inhabitants of Port
 Jackson, are in a bad state: they will not give you a very
 high idea of their skill in the art of preparing them, but
 you will doubtless be indemnified for this loss by those
 which we prepared ourselves. The quadrupeds, insects, liv
 ing plants, hortus siccus, seeds, shells, madrepores, &c.
 are in the best state ; and I have no doubt that these article*
 will be delivered to you in the same condition by the care
 of captain Hamelin.
     If the live plants reach the place of their destination, you
 will have the most curious and the most beautiful produc
 tions of the country, and you will regret that you did not
 botanise on the soil which gave them birth.             The whole
 country,    at the  time  I am now writing,  is  covered   with the
 most beautiful flowers. For variety I know no place but
 the Cape of Good Hope which can be compared to it.
 Though the greater part of our live plants were collected
 between the 33d and 42d degree of south latitude, I think
it proper to observe, that I much fear whether they can be
 naturalised in France so speedily as you may wish.              The
 temperature     of Van  Diemen's  Land  is not  so   cold as the la
 titude where it i3 situated seems to indicate. That of New
 Holland is still less so. At the commencement of winter,
 when we were to the south of Van Diemen's Land, the ther
mometer was only once at five degrees.             At that time a ,
string south-west wind prevailed, accompanied with hail.
At Port Jackson, in the middle of winter, we had it dur
ing one night very near zero; in the day time it generally
kept at 6 or ^ degrees, and in the night between 4 and 5,
and it rarely fell to 3. It appears to me, therefore, that an

           now employed on a Voyage os Discovery.          361
•rangerie will suit them best during our winter in France,
which is much more severe, and cannot be compared with
that which we have experienced. Here the orange- and
lemon-trees stand in the open air. They have thriven ex
ceedingly well, and produce as fine fruit as in Portugal.
    The seeds which I send you were in part given to me by
the natives of the country ; others I collected myself in the
interior parts.    I have proceeded beyond the most distant
parts  known    to  the English ; but an almost impenetrable
chain of mountains of the first order, known under the
name of the Blue Mountains, the direction of which, in*
dining southward, seems to extend as far as Cape Wilson,
and which, towards the north, terminates at Port Stephens,
did not allow me to go further than 7 A or SO miles, reckon
ing from Port Jackson. If credit can be given to what is
stated by the natives and some English adventurers, a large
river of brackish water traverses these mountains, at the
extremity of which there is a settlement of white men.
 (This is the name given by the natives to the Europeans.)
 Since my return I have often conversed on this subject with
 governor King, whose conduct I cannot sufficiently praise ;
 but he declared to me that he placed no belief in these re
ports, which were invented by some deserters, who would
never have returned had they met with a settlement of Eu
ropeans beyond these mountains.
    On leaving Port Jackson, I intend to proceed through
Basse's Straits in order to explore an island of considerable
extent lately discovered bv some English fishermen, and
which has been called King's Island.     When I have termi
nated the geographical part of my labour, I shall proceed
to Kangaroo Island, on the south-west           coast of New-
Holland, the southern part of which neither I nor captain
Flinders was able to examine.         I shall then direct my
course to the islands of St. Peter and St. Francis, to exa
 mine them again, and to ascertain the direction of the con
 tinent in that part with which I am unacquainted.        Pro
 ceeding then from the point where general d'Entrecasteaux
 stopped, and which we have already seen, I shall proceed
 directly to Lewin's Land, to finish the survey of the large
 bay distinguished by the name of the Geographe.         As it
appeared to me of importance to determine the position of
Rosemary Isles discovered by Dampier, and which I have
already sought for in vain by the longitude and latitude as
signed to them in our charts, I shall make a new attempt
to discover them, that I may then proceed to De Witt's
Land, the chart of which is not sufficiently correct to en

 sure the safety of navigation. The reasons which prevented
 roe from undertaking this labour the first time I sailed along
 that coast, are known to you by the letter which I addressed
 to the minister of the marine a short time before        I left
Timor. The northern coast of New Holland and the Gulf
of Carpentaria will terminate our labours; but I am afraid
that so extensive an undertaking will require more time
than the provisions we have laid in here will admit.
    I have seen not without admiration the immense esta
blishments formed here by the English during the twelve
years they have been settled at Port Jackson.     Though they
began with great means, and expended a great deal of mo
ney, it is still difficult to conceive how they could so soon
attain to that state of opulence and splendour in which they
are at present.     Nature indeed has done every thing for
them in the beauty and safety of the port where their esta
blishment is situated ; but the quality of the surrounding
land obliged them to penetrate to the interior of the country,
till they found a soil proper for the different kinds of culti
vation, which produce an abundant supply for their subsist
ence, and for the consumption of the European vessels which
visit that coast for the whale fishery and for other purposes.
Besides brigs, sloops, and middle-sised vessels, built in the
new colony, and belonging to different individuals, we found
on our arrival in this port nine large vessels from England
and two Americans.      Some of them are to return by China;
the rest will be employed in fishing for spermaceti whales.
The advantage arising from this kind of speculation will add
 a considerable increase to the British shipping, if the fishery
 continues to be successful . It is carried on in general on
the coasts and in the environs of New Zealand.
    The present population of Port Jackson, and other places
occupied by the English, amounts to 6000 persons, employed
chiefly in agriculture. All the fruit-trees of Europe have be
come naturalized, but they have not all been attended with
equal success.    Among this number arc the apple-, cherry-,
and almond-tree.      All kinds of pulse, without exception,
thrive, are well tasted, and abundant in the proper season.
The vine, which during the first years afforded great hopes,
has degenerated so much that it is doubted whether it will
maintain itself. The cause of this unexpected degeneration
is not well known : it  is, however, ascribed to the scorching
drought of the north-east wind, the effeots of which are
pernicious.

have retired   to the interior part of the country  inpropor

highways,      but   never in considerable numbers. They have
lost very little of their primitive habits ; it is only remarked
that they have made more progress in the English language
than the English have done in theirs. They are of no use,
 and little to he feared. I am strongly inclined to believe that
 they are of a different origin from those of Van Diemen's
 Land.
     As the English government has omitted nothing that
 could tend to the prosperity of the establishment, it has not;
 suffered in its infancy.       A stock of cows, sheep, and goats,
 was     sent hither at its expense ; and these animals have mul
 tiplied so much, that at the enumeration made of them in
 the month of August last, there were reckoned to be 800
  bulls, 3600 cows, 6000 sheep, 1800 goats, and more than
  10,000 hogs. The horses brought from the Cape of Good
  Hope and Bengal are of all the quadrupeds those which have
  thriven the least, though the cause is still unknown.
      I shall not enlarge further on these details in this letter,
  because I have sent you a copy of that which I have ad

   LXVII.      Statement   of the  Improvement and Progress of the
       Breed   of Jine-woolled    Sheep in New South Irales ; pre
       sented by    Captain  M'Arthur        at the Right Honourable
        Lord Hobart's      Office, 26th  Jultj, 1803.
    JL he samples of wool brought from New South Wales
    having excited the particular attention of the merchants and
    principal English manufacturers, captain Mf Arthur consi
    ders it his duty respectfully to represent to his majesty's
    ministers, that he has found, from -an experience of many
    years, the climate of New South Wales is peculiarly adapted
    to the increase of fine-woolled sheep ; and that, from the
    unlimited extent of luxuriant pastures with which that
    country abounds, millions of those valuable animals may
    be raised in a few years, with but little other expense than
    the hire of a few shepherds.
                                                                   The,

    3C4       Improvement  and Progress qs the Breed os
       The specimens of- wool that captain M' Arthur has with
   him, have been inspected by the best judges of wool in this
   kingdom ; and they are of opinion that it possesses a soft
   ness superior to many of the wools of Spain, and that
   it certainly is equal in every valuable property to the very
   best that is to be obtained from thence.
      The sheep producing this sine wool are of the Spanish
  kind, sent originally from Holland to the Cape of Good
   Hope, and taken from thence to Port Jackson.
      Captain   M'Arthur, being persuaded that the propagation
  of   those   animals would be of the utmost consequence to
  this country, procured in 1797 three rams and live ewes ;
  and he has since had the satisfaction to sec them rapidly
  increase, their fleeces augment in weight, and the wool very
  visibly improve in quality.      When captain M'Arthur left
  Port Jackson in 1601, the heaviest fleece that had then been
  shorn weighed only three pounds and a half: but he has
  received reports of 1S02, from which he learns that the
  fleeces of his sheep were increased to five pounds each, and
  that the w ool is liner and softer than die wool of the pre
  ceding year. The fleece of one of the sheep originally im
  ported from the Cape of Good Hope has been valued here
  at four shillings and sixpence per pound, and a fleece of
  the same kind bred in New South Wales is estimated at
  six shillings per pound.
      Being once in possession of this valuable breed, and hav
 ing ascertained that they improved in that climate, he be
 came anxious to extend them as much as possible ; he
 therefore crossed all the mixed bred ewes, of which his
 flocks were composed, with Spanish rams.            The lambs
 produced from this cross were much improved ; but, when
 they were again crossed, the change far exceeded his most
 sanguine expectations.      In four crosses, he is of opinion,
 no distinction will be perceptible between the pure and
 the mixed breed.        As a proof of the extraordinary and
 rapid improvement of his flocks, captain M'Arthur has
 exhibited the fleece of a coarse-wool led ewe that has been
valued at ninepence a pound ; and the fleece of her Iamb,
begotten by a Spanish ram, which is allowed to be worth
three shillings a pound.
     Captain M'Arthur has now about sour thousand sheep,
amongst which there are no rams but of the Spanish breed.
He calculates that they will, with proper care, double them
selves every two years and a half; and that in twenty years,
they will be so increased as to produce as much sine wool
as is now Imported from Spain and other countries at an
                                                        annual

           Jine-woolled  Sheep in Netu South Wales.         365
annual expense of 1,800,000 1. sterling. To make the prin
ciple perfectly plain upon which captain M'Arthur founds
this expectation, he begs to state, that half his flock has
been raised from thirty ewes, purchased in 1793 out of a
chip from India, and from about eight or ten Spanish and
Irish sheep purchased since.       The other half of his flock
¦were   obtained in 1S01, by purchases from an officer who
had raised them in the same time, and from about the same
number of ewes that captain M'Arthur commenced with.
This statement proves that the sheep have hitherto multi
plied more rapidly than it is calculated they will do in fu
ture ; but this is attributed to the first ewes being of a more
prolific kind than the Spanish sheep are found to be ; for,
since captain M'Arthur has directed his attention to that
breed, he has observed the ewes do not so often produce
double lambs.
    As a further confirmation of the principle of increase that
captain M'Arthur has endeavoured to establish, and which
he is positive time will prove to be correct, he would refer
to the general returns transmitted from New South Wales.
In 1796 (since when not one hundred sheep have been im
ported) 1531 were returned as the public and private stock,
of the colony. In 1801, 6757 were returned ; and although
between those periods all the males have been killed as soon
as they became fit, yet there is a surplus over the calculation
of 633.
    Captain M'Arthur is so convinced of the practicability
of supplying this country with any quantity ot' fine wool it
may require, that he is earnestly solicitous to prosecute thi*,
as it appears to him an important object ; and on his return
to New South Wales to devote his whole attention to acce
lerate its complete attainment.      All the risk attendant on
the undertaking he will cheerfully bear : he will require no
pecuniary aid : and all the encouragement he humbly soli
 cits for is the protection of government, permission to
occupy a sufficient tract of unoccupied lands to feed his
flocks, and the indulgence of selecting from amongst the
convicts such men for shepherds as mav, from their previous
occupations, know something of the business.

      LXVIII.    Proceedings   of Learned and other Societies.
  SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDS OF THE SCIENCES AT WARSAW;
 An their public sitting of May 5, this Society    proposed    the
 following
                         Prize Questions:
     I. The formation of saltpetre was formerly much more"
 considerable than at present in several provinces of the ci-
 devant Poland ; so that it formed an important article of
 commerce. The Society, therefore, requires an answer to
 the following question : — 1st, Are there in these provinces
 any kinds of earth from which saltpetre can be obtained
 by lixiviation without any further preparation ; and where
 are these earths found ? 2d, The Society requires a che
 mical examination of the mould or upper strata of earth
 in those parts of the Ukraine and Podolia which formerly
 produced, or still produce, the greatest quantity of saltpetre,
 in regard to the formation of this salt at the place of ob
 servation.    3d, A comparison of the Polish saltpetre, as
 sold in commerce, in regard to purity, with that manufac
 tured in other countries, and particularly that of Bengal.
4th, An accurate description of the process by which salt
petre is obtained and refined in the different manufactories
of the Ukraine and Podolia. 5th, Whether the new che
mistry affords any means of improving these processes, so
that saltpetre may be obtained at a cheaper rate and in a
greater state of purity.    6th, A comparison of the expenses
of manufacturing saltpetre according to the new French,
the German, and the Polish method.           7th, A comparison
of the East India saltpetre with the saltpetre made in
the different manufactories of Europe, both before the
year 1 790 and at the present time.      8th, Plan for carrying
on trade with this production in the most advantageous
manner, so as to make it pay for the expenses of manufac
turing it.
    II. It is well known that a considerable and advantageous
trade was formerly carried on, and particularly at Venice,
with the Polish cochineal or czerwiec (coccus Polonicus
tinctorius).    The Society therefore requires, 1st, A com
plete natural history of czerwiec, with an account of the
difference between the real Polish cochineal and the false,
which is so often sold for the real czerwiec ; and how this
                                                      deception

                '
                  Aiade'my of Sciences at Berlin.           367
deception can be detected.      2d, What is the essential dif
ference between the American cochineal and the -Polish
czerwiec ? 3d, For what reasons has the American cochi
neal been preferred in modern times to the Polish ? and by
what means can czerwiec be again introduced into com-'
mercer       4th, Can barren sandy land, useful for no other
œconomical purpose, be employed in the regular cultivation
of czerwiec ? 5th, In what manner can czerwiec be raised
at the least expense, and in the greatest abundance ? 7th,
Whether czerwiec possesses any medicinal properties ?
     III. As the plague formerly occasioned great devastation
 in Poland, the Society requires, 1st, A complete history of
 the plague in Poland, from the most authentic sources. The
 author must examine, 2d, Whether this epidemia did not
 sometimes originate in Poland, or whether it was brought
 to these provinces from foreign countries ? 3d, In both
 these cases, what were the regular symptoms by which it
 was known ; and could the place where the disease chiefly
 originated be determined from these symptoms ? 4th, Whe
 ther the disease by passing from one province to another
 became more destructive ; or whether its malignant nature
 was thereby moderated ? 5th, What means of preventing
 the infection were employed at different periods in this
 country with success ; and what mode of curing the disease
 has been found most effectual ? fith, Whether the total ex
  tirpation of the plague be possible ; and in what manner
  this is to be accomplished ?
     The papers, written in the Polish, Latin, German, or
  French languages, must be transmitted, post paid, to the
  secretary ot the Society of the Friends of the Sciences, be
  fore the end of August 1804.
     The prize for the best essay on each of these subjects is
  a gold medal of the value of forty ducats.
     One of these prizes only is paid from the funds of the
  Society. The other two are proposed by two worthy mem
  bers, actuated by a laudable zeal for .diffusing useful know
  ledge.

       The Physical Class has proposed the following questions
   as the subject of prizes for the year 1 805 :
      I. Is Marion's law a general law for all elastic fluids, or
   only for atmospheric air?
      II. What is the nature of that disease called inflamma
   tion of the spleen, which prevails so much among cattle ?
   whence does it arise ? and what is the method of cure ?
      The prize for each of the above questions is fifty ducats.
      III. As the lungs consist of a cartilaginous air-pipe and
  cellular tissue, to which lymphatic vessels, bronchial arte
  ries, veins and nerves, proceed — and as the pulmonary ar
  tery and veins convey the whole mass of the blood through
 the lungs, answers to the following queries are required :—
  In what manner, and where, does the cartilaginous air-pipe
  terminate ? Does it proceed into the cellular tissue of the
 lungs, or has it determinate boundaries ? Does it remain
 cartilaginous in its minutest divisions, and, as such, does it
 terminate in the surrounding cellular tissue ? Do the bron
 chial vessels belong merely to this cartilaginous pipe, or
 to the cellular tissue and the lungs also ? — that is to say, Do
 the bronchial vessels convey nourishment to the air-pipe
 alone, or to the cellular tissue also ? Where does the pul
 monary artery of the lungs end ? Does it convey the blood
 by help of the cellular tissue merely- through the lungs, and
 transmit it immediately to the veins of the lungs, or does it
 expire a fluid into the cellular tissue of the lungs, which in
breathing flows out through the wind-pipe? — or, Does the
pulmonary artery separate a moisture from the exterior sur
face of the lungs ?      Where do the pulmonary veins arise ?
Do they arise alone from the arteries, or, as absorbing
vessels, do they take their origin in part also from the bron
chia, the cellular tissue of the lungs, and from the exterior
surface of the lungs ?        How do the nerves of the eight
pair    and the  intercostal nerves   terminate ? Do those of the
eight pair    terminate  alone   in  the  bronchia, or do they run
into the cellular tissue of the lungs ? Are the eight pair
connected with the branches which the intercostal nerve
sends out to the finest vessels in the lungs ?          The prize is
a golden medal of the value of 80 ducats, or 80 ducats in •
money.       The answers must be grounded on microscopical
observations.

Xrofessor Robertson             yesterday made his second ascent,
which, like the former, was exceedingly brilliant. At a
quarter past twelve he stepped into the car, with his friend
M. Lhoert, carrying with him barometers, thermometers,
a speaking trumpet, &c.           At 35 mintutes after twelve, the
balloon being at the height of 600 toises, M. Robertson
launched a parachute, which fell very slowly.             At three
quarters after twelve the balloon was at the height of about
1200 toises. During this ascent Mr. Robertson made several
new experiments, which had been suggested to him by some
of our philosophical men.
                                                            Aug. 13.
    Professor Robertson and his friend returned hither at four
in the afternoon. Their second aerial voyage has been as
successful as the first. As the wind carried ihem towards
the sea, and the sky was so obscured bv thick clouds that
they could not see to a great distance, they did not rise to
so great a height as the first time. The aeronauts descended
near the village of Rehout, in Holstein, having traversed
about eight miles in the course of an hour. Mr. Robertson,
during this voyage, made some new experiments, an account
of which he has promised to publish.
                                                            A"» 14.
    Ey observation* made during his last ascent, Mr. Robert
 son has found that barometric calculation docs not show
 with precision the real heights in the atmosphere.              He
 weighed different bodies by means of a spring balance, and
 found a great difference between their gravities in the ele
 vated regions of the atmosphere compared with those at the
 surface of the earth.      He ascertained that the magnetic vir
 tue decreases   as the   square of the distances.     He observed
 that sounds may be conveyed upwards to the height of 200
 toises, while downwards they can be conveyed only half
 that distance. The solar rays collected in the focus of a lens
 lose one-third of their intensity.        Mr. Robertson is prepar
 ing   to continue  his  tour  to  Petersbuigh.
                                                            A"g. 15.
     It was 42 minutes past twelve when Mr. Robertson de
 tached    his balloon from the earth when he made his last
  ascent.   The barometer being at 21 inches 12 lines, and the
                                                       thermometer

                           Aerostation.                       371
 thermometer at Ql degrees, he launched two parachutes of
 different sizes, and loaded with equal weights, in order to
 calculate the resistance of the air. The second, which was
 launched a hundred toises higher than the first, fell with
much greater velocity, but did not unfold itself till it had
passed over a double space.     At 51 minutes after twelve he-
passed between two large clouds, which seemed to open
to afford a passage to the Dalloon. The form of these masses
of vapour is oblong. They resemble rags suspended above
the earth. Their upper parts do not form in their ag
gregate a smooth surface, as appears to those who look at
them from the earth ; on the contrary, they resemble long
pyramids. This effect ought to be ascribed to caloric, which,
if we may use the expression, converts these masses into
Montgolfiers, the elevation of which is proportioned to the
density of the atmosphere. They appeared to Mr. Robert
son to plunge towards the earth, in consequence of an op
tic effect resulting from the apparent immobility of the bal
loon, which, however, was rising at the rate of 50 feet per
second. When the thermometer indicated one degree above
freezing, and the barometer stood at 15 inches, Mr. Robert
son set at liberty two pigeons, which descended with the ra
pidity of lightning, without moving their wings, and in a plane
slightly inclined. When the barometer stood at 14 inches
he let off a third pigeon, which, having fluttered about for
a moment with difficulty, perched on the net-work, and
would not quit it. Two butterflies let go at the same time
tried to use their wings, but in vain, as the air was too rare:
they never quitted the car, and fluttered, but in a very feeble
manner. Tinder exposed to a convex glass of six inches focus
did not catch fire till the end of some minutes. The rays
refracted by the prism no longer exhibited lively and distinct,
but weak and confused, colours.         Weights attached to a
spring   balance  had lost one half of their gravity. The mag
netic needle began again to put itself in motion. By means
of a very ingenious instrument invented byM.Hez, me
chanician, he inclosed four inches of the surrounding air
along with mercury, and marked exactly the point where
the air and the mercury were united. When he reached the
earth, he found that the latter filled the whole tube within
a tenth.     This important experiment seems to prove, that
in the upper regions there exists nothing but vapours, and
no atmospheric air. If this conjecture of Mr. Robertson
be verified, there will be no reason why people may not
ascend to a much greater height than that of 3670 toises, to
which we know some have ascended : but for this purpose
                                Aa2                    a balloon

i7t              Astronomy. — Dreadful Accident.
 a balloon    of 40 or 50 feet in diameter would be necessary ;
 otherwise the loss of gas experienced by the balloon might
 make it descend with a velocity which would endanger the
 lives of the aeronauts. Mr. Robertson experienced this dur
 ing his ascent before the last, when he was in danger of being
 killed.
                           ASTRONOMY.
     The  eclipse of the sun which took place on the morning
 of Aug.    17tb was observed at Paris, the weather being very
 fine, by all the astronomers, Delambre, Messier, Bouvard,
 Lalande nephew, Burckhardt, and myself.         I saw the com
 mencement at 5h 59m 18% at the college of France; and
 M. Messier observed the end at 7h 46m 8". In consequence
  of the rule I have formed to calculate such observations, the
  same day I found the conjunction at 6h 30m 24' true time,
  reduced to the meridian of the observatory. This will serve
  as a term of comparison for finding the longitude of all those
 countries where it may have been observed.       It was annular
  in Egypt.                                        Delalandk.
                       DREADFUL    ACCIDENT.
      On Thursday the 8th of September a steam engine em
  ployed to assist in clearing the works from water at the
  tide-mills now erecting in the marsh between Greenwich
  and Woolwich, was blown up by the force of the contained
  steam.    The explosion was as sudden and dreadful as that
  of a powder-mill, and was accompanied with a similar noise,
  which was heard at a great distance from the place. The
  engine was on Mr. Trevethick's plan, worked by the ex
  pansive force of steam only, without employing condensa
  tion as in the engines in common use.          it was literally
  blown to pieces ; and we are sorry to state, that by the ac
  cident three people were killed on the spot, and three others,
  all that were there at the time, so much hurt that two of
  them are not expected to recover.      It was a fortunate cir
  cumstance that the accident happened at a time when the
  other workmen were at dinner, or a much greater number
  might have lost their lives.
      Steam-engines on Mr. Trevethick's plan require a boiler
  of immense strength ; for they work with a power some
  times equal to 6o pounds on the square inch, while common
  engines, even Mr. Watts's, seldom work with more than
   5 pounds.    We are happy to state, however, that the present
   accident arose, not from the impossibility of making a boiler
   strong enough, but from a culpable mismanagement of a
                                                             boy

            Prevention   of Iron and Sieel from rusting.                        373
boy appointed to attend the engine. Impatient to finish his
work, he had put a piece of timber between the top of the
safety valve and a beam above             it,
                                     so that   could not rise to
                                                             it
allow steam to escape when produced in greater quantity than
required. He even went away to fish in the river. In the
mean time the engine was stopped                        by
                                             another workman,
who knew not what the boy had done, and in short time                 a
the mischief we have stated followed.         The boy had re
turned, and was in the very act of removing the piece of
wood he had so imprudently put over the valve when the ex
plosion took place.    He was the least hurt of all who were
near the spot.
   This accident ought to serve as warning to engineers to
                                                a
construct their safety valves     in
                                  such    manner that common
                                                    a
workmen cannot stop them at their pleasure which may be           ;
easily done.
   From tl»e way in which part of the boiler was bent, which
was constructed of cast iron nearly an inch in thickness,                         it
is thought the steam must have acquired an expansive force
equal to 500 pounds on the square inch before         gave way        it
— force much beyond any that can ever be required. But
1   a
though this shows that engines on Mr. Trevethick's plan
may, with proper precautions, be worked with as much safety
as those on the common principle,       such an accident as tha
one we have stated cannot fail to intimidate some people
from adopting them.         It  therefore with much pleasure
                                 is
we state that    boiler on
                 a            new construction, calculated to
                              a
bear    much higher degree of expansive force than can ever
        a
in any case be required, has been lately invented           verv           by
                                                                            a
able engineer, Mr. Wools. It consists of combination of       a
cylindrical tubes, which unite the double advantage of ex
posing much larger surface to the action of the fire than the
            a
common boiler, while they possess        much greater degree of
                                                a
strength. This invention appears to us so important, that
we shall take an early opportunity of laying      description of  a
it before the public.
     METHOD     OP PREVENTING      IRON AND STEEL                          FROM
                             RUSTING *.
   C. Conte has found out method of preventing the oxi
                                 a
dation of iron and steel, or, to >peak in language more ge
nerally understood, to prevent iron and steel from rusting.
This method consists in mixing with fat oil varnish half,                   a
at least, or rather tour-fifths, of well rectified spirit of tur-
                  * From   the Magasin Encyctyedique.

pentine. This varnish is applied slightly, and in an equal
manner, by means of a sponge ; after which the article is
suffered to dry in a place sheltered from dust. Articles var
nished in this manner, it is said, will retain their metallic
brilliancy, and never contract any spots of rust. This var
nish may be applied also to copper, of which it preserves the
polish, and brightens the colour. It may be employed in
particular, with advantage, for preserving from alteration
philosophical instruments, which, in the course of experi
ments, are brought into contact with water, and by those
means are liable to lose their splendour, and to become tar
nished.
                     A SHOWER OF MUD.
   The Journal de Physique for Germinal contains a letter
from De Fortis to the editor, in which he gives an account
of a shower of mud which fell in the evening of the 27th
of March near Udina. " The wind (says the author) had
blown with violence from the east for three davs.          The
extent of country which was abundantly besprinkled by this
strange rain was twelve miles in diameter from the borders
of the sea to the bottom of the Alps of Carnia. I do not
know whether the partisans of the opinion which makes
lava come to us from the moon, can derive any arguments
in their favour from the mud which has covered the plains
of Friouli; but, for my part, 1 first imagined that the wind,
being charged in Sicily or near Naples with clouds of vol
canic dust, had deposited them at the bottom of the Carnian
mountains, which prevented the clouds from going further.
But having then observed, through a very powerful mag
nifying glass, a specimen of the sediment in question which
 a friend sent me from Udina, I convinced myself that it
had not the least resemblance to that detritus which is raised
by volcanoes to the superior regions of the atmosphere.      It
 appears to me more natural to suppose that a storm, or per
 haps water-spouts at sea, having sucked up some of the
muddy water which the rivers by their inundation leave on
 the plains, raised them to the upper regions, where they
 were carried away by the winds.       It is in consequence of
 similar circumstances, very natural and common, that
 worms, tadpoles, and small fishes have often been seen to
 fall from the clouds with rain, without any person conceiv
 ing the idea of making them come from an aerial race or
 from another globe."
