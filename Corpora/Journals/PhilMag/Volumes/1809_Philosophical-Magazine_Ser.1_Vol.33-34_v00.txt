 I.  Result    of  some Experiments        on      the Distillation of va
    rious Vegetable and Animal Substances in the dry Way.
     By David Mushet, Esq.
 The      following    are some     of  the experiments        promised in
 my last communication          to the Philosophical       Magazine*.
                             Experiment         I.
     Raw Sugar. — 270 grains, being distilled till all volatile
 matter was separated, were found to have been reduced in
 weight to 38 grains, having lost 232 grains.
     100 parts therefore contained : Volatile matter              85'9
                                            Oxide of carbon       14*1
    The charcoal obtained in this experiment                was   light  and
 spongy,    and   possessed the most fascinating prismatic co
lours ; gold, purple, blues, and indigos. It occupied about
three times the bulk it possessed when raw.
                            Experiment        II.
    Loaf Sugar,      single refined, 264 grains. —This in           distilla-
  ion also swelled greatly in bulk, and discharged a pure
white flame edged with blue. The coal had in forming en
tered into complete fusion, and resembled the former pro
duct, though not possessed of the same brilliant shades.                   —

II.   Description         of a Portable Bridge, invented by Mr.
   James Elmes, Architect, of College-Hill, Queen-Street,
    Ckeapside, London*.
Bridges         upon this construction may be rendered either
permanent or otherwise.               The only difference will be, that
for the former the parts may be strongly bolted and fastened
together, instead of being joined by contrivances which ad
mit of the parts being separated, for the convenience of re
moval,     as  in   the drawing now sent.           (See Plate   I.)
   The component            parts shall be     first described, and after
wards the manner             of applying them.            A is a strong    iron
frame that forms the bottom.                   B   is a square frame of the
same metal, fastened            by hinges,      to the   ends of A, for the
purpose of falling           down flat upon the bottom for conve-
niency of packing, as shown by the figure C. A skirting of
iron plate marked D, is also strongly fixed to the bottom,
as in the elevation of the whole P, and in the figure B. Two
spring catches are attached to this skirting to keep the sides
steady when erected.            One of these, catches          E   on a larger
scale   is   shown       in the drawing.          The remaining       detached
parts are marked F and G. F is a               square iron link      separated
in the middle, and each part opening by a spring. G is a
kind of staple opening and closing by a double worm de
scribed    round its superficies working in an interior screw,
contained in a box, opening and closing very considerably
by a single revolution of the box round the screw, by the
means     of  a  small handspike        H.

                 Description     of a Portable Bridge.                11
    As many of     each   of  the above described    parts as are neces
sary, according to the width of the river or valley intended
to be passed, with a sufficient quantity of planking posts,
chains, &c, according to the existing circumstances of the
case, are the whole      of  its component parts.
    A bridge on this principle for a river, &c, of a consider
able width is very portable ; for several of the square frames
may be packed upon each other in carriages or waggons of
the dimensions of eight feet three inches long, three feet
four inches wide, and as many feet high as it may be wished
to pack a number of frames ; two of them rising one foot.
The links and staples can be packed in cases, each sort se
parate.
    The method      to be used    in passing   a river with this bridge
shall now be described.         (A valley is passed in the same man
ner   ; but there     being no water to pass, the bridge will be
easier supported      from    the under side.) First, two sufficient
holes are to be dug on one side the river, at the distance
apart of the width of the bridge, which in this plan is nine
feet, and the posts I, are first to be prepared with prongs,
Sec., as in the dotted       figure K : next the four smaller ones
L, properly secured and well rammed. Then taking any
one of the pieces C, fix it on the posts I and L as drawn,
and support it on two well driven piles, if the shore will
permit : and hooking on the next piece with one of the
links   F  through the eyes at the bottom of the piece, and one
of   the staples G, fixed into the holes of the upright piece or
parapet,    it will  there hang.      Several   more are to be hanged
on the same way, leaving             under them, where necessary,
barges or other craft, moored with supporters under them
pro tempore.        When completed         to the opposite shore,     the
 same process     of fixing the posts,     &c,   is to be repeated,  and
 when fastened to these posts, the under supports may be
 taken away, and the whole left suspending by itself. No
 thing now remains but for the superintendant of the work
 to screw the staples, by the handspike H, till the bridge
 rises by a small curvature by opening the interstices N at
 the top.     It is not required to rise more than a small degree
 above level, only     just enough     to stiffen the whole, and cause
                                                                        it

 it to lie like  a  stiff plank,    and   rather to occasion a thrust
 outwards      than otherwise,        which      when      the     weight   has
brought      down      may be again     raised    by the same operation.
 The planks are now         to be laid on to meet at the intervals as

 complete.       Q   is a perspective   view    of   three     joints looking

 III.  Analysis of some Iron Ores in Burgundy and Franclw-
    Comte ; to which is added an Examination of the Pig
    Jron, Bar Iron, and Sconce, produced from them.                          By
    M. Vausuelin *.
 In   the year   1 805,   M.   Vauquelin having visited various iron
works in Burgundy,           collected specimens of ores, pig iron,
bar iron,     scoriae,   and fluxes ; intending to subject them to
chemical analyses, to ascertain whether it might be possible
to learn, from a comparison of their composition, what
 takes place in the processes to which iron ores and cast iron
are subjected.      The following      are the principal results        of this
 able chemist's labours, and          the particulars      of some of the
 processes    he employed to obtain them.
         I.  Chemical Examination          of some Fluor Spars.
    The   spar used as a flux at the       mine of Drambon, in              the
department of Cote-d'Or, is yellowish white, and tolerably
hard.      It dissolves with effervescence in nitric acid, and
leaves a yellowish       residuum,     amounting to about a fifth of
its weight, which is composed chiefly of fine sand, with a
minute quantity of alumine and iron.                The solution, which
is colourless, gives with ammonia            a  light, flocculent, semi-
transparent, yellowish-white precipitate, in which was de
tected iron, a little alumine, and phosphate of lime.                         It
likewise exhibited some traces of silex.
    The spar of Pesme is compact, of a grayish white, and
dissolves in nitric acid, leaving a residuum of about a twen-

                                                                          tieth

                    Analysis of Iron Ores, &c.                     13
tieth of its weight.     A little iron, alumine, and phosphate
of lime, were found in the solution.
     From these two analyses it appears, that the fluors ana
lysed consist almost wholly of calcareous matter, but that
of Pesme is the most pure. They show at the same time,
that the stones examined contain        a small quantity of phos
phate     of lime, which certainly     does not amount      to a five-
hundredth part.
    II.  Analysis of the Scorice  of the Iron Works at Drambon.
     M.   Vauquelin began with these scoriae,       rather than with
 the ores and smeltings, because these        scoriae  include   more
 foreign matters in a smaller bulk.
     They   have a shining   blackish   colour,   nearly resembling
 some oxides      of manganese.     Their weight indicates that a
 considerable quantity of metallic matter is left in them.
 Some parts exhibit blebs of different sizes, others are com
 pact. Their fracture is crystallized, either needly or laminar.
      Five grammes (77 grains) of scoria;, fused twice in suc
  cession, with an equal weight of caustic potash, communi
  cated to the alkali a very deep green colour, when the mass
  had been washed with water. —This         green    colour is known
  to be an unequivocal proof      of the presence of manganese,
  and it is the    best method we can employ to discover the
  slightest trace of this metal in any substance.
      All the washings of the scoriae thus treated were put
  together, and boiled, to separate the manganese. In pro
  portion as this took place, the liquor losl its green colour,
  and the metal floated in it in the form of brown flocks,
  which, when collected, washed,          and   dried, weighed two
  decig. (three grains) amounting to four per cent. — The al
   kaline liquor, freed from the manganese and filtered, still
   retained an orange yellow colour, which led M. Vauquelin
   to suspect the presence of chrome.
      To verify this suspicion, it      was   necessary,   in order to
   facilitate the operations requisite for detecting the chrome,
   to separate the alumine and silex, that were in the alkaline
   lixivium : and to avoid the presence of muriatic acid, which
   would have thwarted the end he proposed,             M.  Vauquelin
                                                             employed

   14             ,     Analysis of Iron Ores, &c.
  employed very pure nitrate of ammonia, instead of the mu
  riate. Thus he obtained two percent. (0'3 grains) of a mix
  ture of silex and alumine.
      He next    saturated    the liquor with pure        nitric acid, added
  a little in excess,    and boiled it for a      quarter of an hour, in
  order to dissipate entirely the carbonic acid.
     To a portion of the liquor thus prepared he added                  a few
 drops of    the solution      of nitrate of mercury        at a minimum      :
 but instead of yielding a red colour, as is usual with chrome,
 they threw down a white precipitate, which at first he took
 for muriate of mercury,             but it afterwards appeared         to be
 phosphate of mercury. — Instructed by this trial, he added to
 the remainder of the liquor limewater, which, when the
 acid was saturated, produced a flocculent precipitate.                  This
 had a slight tint of yellow, which changed to a green on
 drying,    a circumstance that indicated             some    foreign matter
in   the phosphate      of lime.
    Anxious     to discover the cause        of this colour,     he made the
precipitate red-hot in         a silver crucible    ;  but the green tint,
instead     of disappearing,        became     more intense.        He then
fused a little with borax by the blowpipe,                and the fine eme
rald green colour       which    the   salt assumed, confirmed his first
suspicion of the existence of chrome in the scoriae from the
refining furnace.
    The remaining precipitate, being             treated    with nitric acid,
did not entirely dissolve ; a portion being left of a very deep
green colour, which was nothing but oxide of chrome mix
ed with a little silex, the particles          of which being brought
together and hardened           by the heat    had lost the capacity of
being soluble.
    The solution        was    colourless   ; and     oxalate   of ammonia
threw down from           it a granulous precipitate, which, when
washed     and     dried, weighed two decig. (three grains), and
was true oxalate of lime.
    The liquor from which           the oxalate    of lime     was thus pre
cipitated, being evaporated to dryness, and the residuum
calcined, yielded an acid, which had all the properties of
the phosphoric. .

                                                                           to

to precipitate the phosphoric acid,            being mixed with nitrate
of mercury recently prepared,              a brown     yellow precipitate
was formed, which assumed a green tinge by drying in the
air. This precipitate fused with borax gave it a very fine
green colour,        which proved it to      be a chromate    of mercury
 with excess of oxide.
      The presence both of chrome           and phosphoric acid in the
scoriae     from     the refining    furnace was thus demonstrated.
These matters,         as well  as those   that will be mentioned be
 low,     existed   in the pig   iron,   and previously    in the ore, for
 nothing      was added during the processes of working them,
 from which these could have been produced.
      After chrome, phosphoric acid, manganese, and a por
 tion of the silt-x and al umine, had been separated, M. Vau-
 quelin dissolved in muriatic acid the ferruginous part, which
 had then a yellowish red colour. He observed, that, though
  the alkali had taken from it a great deal of oxide of manga
  nese, a perceptible portion of oxygenized muriatic acid was
  produced, as the dissolution went on.
       A white powder remained at the bottom of the liquor,
  which, when washed and dried, weighed 88 cent. (13-6 gr.),
  or about     a fifth of the weight of the scoriae.            During the
  evaporation of the liquor, which was carried to dryness, a
   portion of the same substance was precipitated, which was
   freed by means of muriatic acid from a little iron that fell
   down with it. This contained some               traces  of chrome, for
   it communicated to borax a decidedly            green colour.     It  was
   silex.
       M.   Vauquelin precipitated the iron from its solution by
   ammonia, and added to the filtered solution oxalate of am
   monia,      which formed in it          a pretty    copious   precipitate
    of oxalate of lime.
       The iron, still moist and in an attenuated state, was treat
    ed with acetous acid, the mixture evaporated to dryness, and
    the residuum redissolved in water. In the clear and colour
    less liquor   was detected     by different means the presence of
    oxide    of   manganese      and of alumine, which had escaped
     the action   of  the alkali  in  the first operation, and   of a pretty
                                                                        large

  16                       Analysis of Iron Ores, &?c.
  large quantity of lime, which the volatile alkali had precipi
  tated with the help of the oxide of iron.
     From these experiments, and the results they furnished,
  it is evident, that                the   scoriae   of   the    refining         furnace, on
  which they were made, are formed of, 1st, a large quantity
  of iron oxided at a minimum ; 2d, oxide of manganese ;
  3d, phosphate of iron ; 4th, chrome, probably in the state
 of oxide; 5th, silex; 6th, alumine; 7th, lime,                              part    of which
 is perhaps combined with phosphoric acid.
    A doubt can hardly be entertained, that all these matters
 were contained, at least in part, in the pig iron that fur
 nished the scoriae         :   the charcoal might have imparted to them
 at most some lime,                  silex, and manganese               ; but the analysis
 of the ores, and of the pig iron itself, will soon                                  teach us
 what we ought to think on this point.
                    III.   Examination of the Bog Ores.
    The      ores   subjected to analysis by                    M. Vauquelin were,
 1st, those employed at the forge                        of Drambon.               These are
in spherical nodules of different sizes. Some irregular frag
ments of limestone are observed among them.      2d, those of
Chamfont and Grosbois. These much resemble the former.
Those of Grosbois               contain a pretty large quantity                     of lime
stone. 3d, that of Chatillon-sur-Seine. This is of an ochrey
yellow colour, in grains as small as millet-seed ; no lime
stone is seen among     but          it,
                               contains  pretty large quan
                                             it              a
tity of clay.
   M. Vauquelin gives at large his analysis of the ore of
Drambon, observing, that the other ores include the same
principles, though in different proportions    at the same time     ;
the quantities he has assigned    to its different component
parts he gives only             as    approximations.
    Ten grammes (154-5 grains) of                          the ore        of Drambon,
treated        caustic potash, assumed
            with                           very intense green   a
colour, that communicated itself to the water in which                                    it
was lixiviated. The ore, on being subjected to the same ope
ration   a   second        time, produced            a    similar       effect,     but less
striking.
                                                                                        The

     The liquors    were boiled,   and three decig. (4"6 grains) of
  manganese fell down, containing a little silex, and a minute
  portion of iron.
     The solution retained a slight yellow colour, as in that
  from the scoriae.     M. Vauquelin, supposing this colour to
 be produced by the same substance, saturated it with nitric
 acid. With this liquor he mixed a solution of nitrate of
 mercury made without heat; when it became colourless, and
 a white precipitate fell down, which did not give any tinge
 to glass of borax.
     As  the liquor contained an excess    of acid, it    was suspect
 ed, that,   if any chromate of mercury        had    been  formed, it
 was held in solution.      Accordingly few drops of a solu
                                           a
 tion of pure potash were added, and a brown red precipitate
 was obtained, which, being fused with borax, gave in a fine
 emerald green. This indicated, that it was chromate of mer
 cury, perhaps with a little phosphate of the same metal.
     The liquor being still acid, and retaining some mercury
 in   solution,    M.   Vauquelin imagined it still contained
 chrome.      He therefore added a few drops of nitrate of sil
 ver, in hopes of obtaining a crimson red precipitate; but
 what fell down was of an orange yellow, and did not give a
green colour to borax.        Ft was phosphate of silver.       Potash
 added to the remaining liquor produced a very bulky, floc-
culent, lemon-coloured precipitate. This acquired a green
 hue as it dried, and was chromate of mercury, containing
stiver, with    a small quantity of alumine and silex.
    The mercury was separated from the silver in a gentle
heat by mean* of muriatic acid, diluted with two parts of
water, that it might not dissolve the muriate of silver. At
once the precipitate became white, and the acid green. The
aolution being evaporated to dryness left a hlackish matter,
which    gave a very fine green colour to borax.
    Afterward, by employing sulphuric acid, and precipitating
by limewater,       M.   Vauquelin    obtained     I '5 per cent.    of
magnesia.       Though this     earth was    found in the pig iron
from each     of the five bog ores, he does not venture to assert
that it exists in all : but he observes, he has much more rea-

son to think that chrome and phosphoric acid arc constantly
found in it.
    Reflecting that oxide of manganese, chrome, and mag
nesia, which he had just obtained, were found likewise in
aerolites, or meteoric stones, he questioned whether it were
not possible for iron ores to have contributed in some way
or other to the formation of these stones. This idea led him
to examine, whether nickel likewise did not occur in bog
ores ; but his researches were fruitless.
    From what has been said it follows, that the bog ore*
 analysed   were composed of, 1st, iron; 2d, manganese; 3d,
 phosphoric acid ; 4th, chrome ; 5th, magnesia ; 6th, silex ;
 7th, alumine; and 8th, lime. The chrome, phosphoric acid,
 and rnagnesia    had not before been noticed in these ores.
 IV.   Examination     of tlie Iron that sublimes and  collects in
              the Chimneys    of the refming Furnace.
    This iron   is found  adhering to the sides of the chimneys
 of the refining furnace in the shape of stalactites, which are
 sometimes more than a foot long and three or four inches in
 diameter.     They are formed of agglutinated grains, red in
 their fracture, leaving great intervals between them, and
 having but a slight action on the magnet.
    We shall omit the particulars of M. Vauquelin's analysis,
 which he concludes with the following words :
    " In this sublimed iron, then, there are oxide of manga
 nese, silex, phosphoric acid, and above all a great deal of
 chrome.     These matters     therefore have  been volatilized by
 the caloric,    either by being dissolved in this fluid, or by
 yielding to the impulse of the current of air; but in either
 case they have issued from the pig iron during the process-
 of refining."
          V. Examination of the Pig Iron of Drambon.
     Having found oxide of manganese, chrome, phosphoric
  acid, and earths, in the scoriae of the refining furnace, it
  was natural for     M. Vauquclin to infer, that  he should find
  the same substances     in the pig iron ; since it is this that
                                                         furnishes

                     Analysis of Iron      Ores,    &fc.                   19
 furnishes these scoriae, at least for the most part, in the pro
  cess of refining. This fact was fully confirmed by analysis.
     He  proceeded thus. Ten grammes (154-5 grains) of gray
  pig  iron  of Drambon reduced to filings were dissolved in
 sulphuric acid diluted with six parts of water. The hydro
 gen gas evolved during the solution was collected.                  It had
 an extremely fetid smell, very much resembling that              of phos-
 phuretted hydrogen gas, though            it  had   a certain  pungency,
  which the phosphuretted hydrogeu has not. The nature of
 this gas will be noticed presently.
    The residuum      was   of a  very    deep black,     and diffused an
 extremely strong smell of phosphorus.                   It weighed 53
 cent. (8-2 grains), or a little more than a twentieth of the
 iron employed.        The upper part of the bottle in which the
 solution was made,        and the tube through which           the hydro
gen had passed, being so greasy that water would not ad
 here to them, M. Vauquelin suspected that oil had been
 formed ; a fact fist announced by          M.   Proust    a few years ago
 on a similar occasion, and which           M. Vauquelin       adds he had
 himself observed before that, when dissolving certain kinds
 of tin. — To know whether any of this oil remained in the
 residuum of the pig iron dissolved in the sulphuric acid, he
 boiled it with highly dephlegmated alcohol, and filtered the
 liquor hot.
    On   the addition    of water this alcohol became         milky   ; and
 being exposed to a gentle heat, drops of oil separated from
 it as the alcohol evaporated.        This oil was clear and trans
 parent   ; it had a  slight yedlow     tinge   ; its taste   was hot and
a little pungent.     It  appeared  10  be  of a middle kind between
the volatile and fat     oils.
    When     the oil it contained    was     separated    from the     resi
duum     of the pig iron, this residuum was deflagrated in a
silver crucible with a little very pure nitrate of potash, the
matter was washed          with distilled water, and a light yellow
liquor was obtained. This was mixed with a solution of the
nitrate of ammonia, to precipitate the silex and alumine
supposed     to be contained    in it ; and a small quantity of these
was separated.     Limewater added to the filtered liquor formed
                                    B   2                                 ip

in it   a  copious precipitate, which had all         the characters of
phosphate of lime.
    To ascertain whether chrome was contained in this liquor,
it was first boiled to volatilize the ammonia, and a few drops
of nitrate of mercury were added, which was precipitated of
a brown yellow,         owing to a little       lime remaining.    This
 precipitate, however, gave a green             colour to borax, which
proves that it contained chrome.
   The lixivium from the residuum of the solution calcined
with nitrate of potash then contained phosphoric acid,
chrome,       and silex mixed with a little aluinine.        There was
likewise in it a minute portion of manganese. —The resi
duum, when thus treated and lixiviated, was in the form of
a reddish      powder, which was dissolved for the greater part
by muriatic acid. There remained, however, a small quan
tity of grayish matter, w hich was silex mingled with chrome,
for it gave a very decided green colour to borax. — The mu
riatic solution contained         a large portion of iron. It assumed
the consistence       of  a jelly on evaporation, which proves that
it contained silex.         It is probable that a little chrome and
manganese        were also concealed in it.
    It appears then that this pig iron, besides carburet of
iron, contains phosphuret of iron, manganese, chrome, si
lex, and alumine. Next to the iron and carbon, it appeared
to  M. Vauquelin         that the phosphorus       was most  abundant.
It  is then in the residuums of the solutions of pig and bar
iron that we must henceforward look for phosphorus, rather
than in the solutions themselves,           as has hitherto been done.
Probably the neglecting to examine these residuums with
sufficient attention is the reason of our remaining so ignorant
of   the causes    of the bad quality     of iron.
   M.     Vauquelin admits that there is likewise a small quan
tity of phosphorus converted into acid, and dissolved in the
liquor, probably in the state of phosphate of iron, by means
of the sulphuric acid. It appears to him, that, when the
sulphuric acid is less diluted with water, a larger quantity of
phosphorus dissolves in the liquor.             To separate this phos
phate     of iron,  he  dilutes    the  solution   with seven or eight
                                                                  parts

parts    of water,     and mixes with it carbonate                         of potash, till
almost the whole of the acid is saturated.      white preci            A
pitate is formed, more or less copious according to the kind
of iron employed ; and at the expiration of a few days it
grows yellowish.   This precipitate, washed and dried, he
treafs with potash        in- a     silver crucible at a red heat               :   he then
lixiviates the matter with water, and, after having saturated
the liquor with nitric acid, and boiled it to expel the carbo
nic acid, he adds limewater, which commonly forms a white
flocculent precipitate, or semitransparent if phosphoric acid
be present.   He has likewise found a large quantity of
chrome in the precipitate produced bv carbonate of potash
in the solution of pig iron by sulphuric acid.   It follows
therefore, that chrome as well as phosphorus is oxygenized
and dissolved in sulphuric acid.
     The alkaline liquor should            be tested with nitrate                   of am-        •

ficient quantity should be added to precipitate these earths,
after which they must be separated     the filter     by

this precaution they would be precipitated       the lime, and        by
might   be mistaken  for phosphate  of lime.    M.   Vauquclin
has found verv evident traces             of this          salt   in   the pig iron      of
the works at Drambon,                though he employed sulphuric acid
diluted with six parts of water to dissolve    there was much it  ;
less, however, than remained      the residuum of the solution.

This    was    the only   kind of pig iron he examined, but he
conceives      it   probable that all the irons from bog ores con
tain the same foreign matters.
VI.     Examination       of   the   Bar Iron        of   Drambon and Pesmes.
  M. Vauquclin dissolved tive grammes (77-2 grains) of cold                                   •
short iron of Drambon in sulphuric acid diluted with five
parts    of   water.    The hydrogen           gas evolved            during the dis
solution      had exactly the same smell as that                   of the   gas from
the pig iron,   but not quite so powerful. — The residuum left
by   these five grammes was much less copious than that of
the pig iron, and appeared likewise not to be of so deep                                 a
klack.   While wet,     emittedit  very strong fetid smell,

22                    Analysis of Iron    Ores,     &c.
analogous       to that of hydrogen gas. It weighed 1 5 cent.
(2-3    grains),  amounting to three per cent. The solution of
the iron had the same smell, which was not dissipated but
by evaporation.
    A few particles of this residuum, thrown               on a burning
coal, emitted      a white vapour, with a smell resembling that
of  arsenic and phosphorus.          Heated red-hot in a silver cru
cible, it burned with flame,           and     left behind    a  yellowish
powder.        This  was mixed with a       little caustic potash, cal
cined,-    and lixiviated.     The liquor being filtered,         saturated
with nitric acid,      and subjected    for   a   few minutes      to heat,
limewater was added,          which   threw down       a  white flocculent
precipitate, consisting chiefly of phosphate of lime, but with
a minute portion       of sites, and perhaps of almnine.
    It  is certain from these experiments, which           M. Vauquelin
repeated several times, that the iron            of Dranibon, though it
is considered     as of pretty good quality, contains very per
ceptible traces of phosphorus. He likewise found some slight
traces of it in the solution by sulphuric acid.
    The iron of Pesmes afforded nearly the same results.
The residuum, however, was less by one half, amounting
only to ly per cent.; and it contained less phosphorus.
This iron is very tough, and is reckoned one of the best in
 Francbe-Comte.
                     VII. Of the     Hydrogen Gas.
    Various experiments, which M. Vauquelin made by the
 help of oxygenated muriatic acid on the hydrogen gas evolved
from the pig and bar iron, led him to conclude that phos
 phorus is the chief cause of its fetid smell.
                VIII.   Recapittilation and Inferences.
    From the experiments         1 have related,     says  M.   Vauquelin,
it follows    :
     1.   That  the five sorts  of bog ore I analysed are composed
 of   the   same principles,     which, beside iron, are silex, alu-
 mine, lime, oxide       of manganese, phosphoric acid, magne
 sia, and chromic       acid.
    2.    That  the five  sorts  of  ore  having been taken without
                                                                   selection

                           Analysis of Iron Ores, i$c.                      83
   selection from          places tolerably distant from       each other,   it
  is   probable    that all ores       of  the same kind contain the same
  substances.
     3. That these ores want only nickel, to contain the same
  substances     as the stones that have fallen from the atmo
  sphere.
     4. That part of these substances remains in the bar iron,
  and probably in larger quantity in pig iron, which may be
  the cause of its greater hardness and brittleness.
     5. That     the      greater    part of these substances is separated
  during the      refining       of  the pig iron, when this operation is
  well executed       ;   since they are found in the scoriae, and in
  the sublimed iron that adheres               to the insides of the chim
  neys   of the refining furnaces.
     6. That traces of them, however, are found in bar iron of
  good    quality   ;    and that     probably chrome, phosphorus, and
  manganese       are the        chief causes that render iron hot short
  or cold short.
      7.  That   the process        of refining merits    the greatest atten
  tion    from     iron-masters,          since it appears that     the  good
  quality of   iron depends on its           skilful execution.
     8. That the presence of phosphoiits and of chrome is to
  be sought for not in the solutions of pig and bar iron alone,
  but also in the residuunis            of their solutions.
     9. That by the union            of hydrogen and carbon during the
  dissolution of iron, and           particularly of gray cast iron, an oil
  is formed, which,            in conjunction with a small quantity of          .
  phosphorus,       communicates a fetid smell to the hydrogen
  gas that dissolves         them.
      10.  That it      is to these two substances        the hydrogen gas
. owes its properties of burning with               a bine flame, and being
  heavier than when pure.
      11. Lastly, That the oil and the phosphorus are separated
  from the hydrogen gas by oxygenized muriatic acid, which
  destroys them.                                    /

Rabies canina,            or, as  it is more commonly called, Hydro
phobia, the subject of the following dissertation, is a disease
as little understood, yet as serious in its consequences, and
dreadful in its effects, as any with which the human body
is affected.
     It may be defined a painful and difficult state of degluti
tion, attended with great anxiety and horror of countenance,
with occasional convulsive paroxysms ; and these the conse
quence of the bite of         a mad     animal.
                          History of the Disease.
    The symptoms take place at very irregular and uncertain
intervals of time after the bite, having been known to occur
as     early  as   the third     week, and       as  late as nine or twelve
 months; but for        the most       part   the   commencement      of the
 disease may be placed at four or six weeks from the time                  of
 the accident.        In most cases,       the first symptom is a painful
 and    uneasy    sensation     in the    part   where the bite was      in
 flicted ; but this is not to be considered as             a constant or in
 variable occurrence.
     Among       the earliest appearances       are to be ranked languor,
 depression of spirits, timidity, disturbed sleep, frightful
 dreams, sighing, and loss of appetite ; sometimes with
 nausea,      weight al the stomach, and rigor.
      In a short time the unhappy object becomes extremely
 sensible to all external impressions, the sense of touch, of
 hearing and seeing, being more or less affected in different
 cases.      Upon attempting to swallow the smallest quantity
 either of solids or fluids, but especially the latter, although
                                                                  frequently

frequently excited to it by thirst, the greatest agitation and
horror are produced, with an apparently strong convulsive
affection of the pharynx and oesophagus, difficulty of breath
ing, tremor, great anxiety and impatience, and remarkable
quickness of circulation.
  The patient is not so much agitated by the sight of solids
or fluids in the early state of the disease, as is commonly
imagined ; watery liquors being sometimes carried to the
mouth with fortitude and composure ; but, immediately on
touching the lips, are rejected with a violent and frightful
agitation, the mind being at that time more particularly
conscious of the inability of swallowing.
  Solids are, notwithstanding, in some cases, got down,
even in the advanced stage of the disease, but never without
pain and agitation, being thrust into the mouth in a pecu
liar hurried and greedy manner, and invariably exciting or in
creasing the convulsions, which constitute so formidable a
partof the disease.
  After these symptoms   have continued 12, 18, or 44 hours
(the progress being  somewhat   different in different cases),
the disorder puts on the most distressing and melancholy
appearance ; the convulsive attacks, which were before ex
cited chiefly by the attempt to                swallow,      now occur spon
taneously every        10   or    15 the whole body being so
                                       minutes,
violently agitated as to require several assistants to support
the patient.    The countenance is wild, the eyes red and
staring, and large drops of sweat pour from the head and face.
   In the intervals of these paroxysms, the miserable sufferer
becomes somewhat composed, complains of an uneasy sen
sation across the breast, and also                in   the throat, often ascrib
ing it to wind, and wondering                     that he is not able to dis
charge     it,
          so as to obtain relief.
  The secretion of               saliva   is   now     much increased,       but   of
such   athick viscid quality, that the patient    obliged to        is
exert considerable force to discharge  from his mouth. The

repeated,        joined to the peculiar anxious             state   of   the coun

disease,    that the most superficial observer, having seen one

case   of   it,   can scarcely afterwards be at                    a   loss to distinguish
another.          As    the disease         draws towards              a   conclusion,           the
intellectual faculties, which had before remained wonderfully
perfect, give way, the patient being affected with delirium
of   the fiercest and most unmanageable                            kind, especially du
ring the      paroxysms of convulsion,                        which        become so fre

supervene     ;    the countenance               is   somewhat livid and fright
fully distorted        ;    and in this state          a    general return         of convul
sion puts an end to one of the most melancholy and affect
ing scenes that the human mind can well form an idea of.
This   fatal termination                 happens  most commonly about the
end of the third day                     from the first attack, though has                  it
sometimes occurred as early as the second, and at other
times as late as the fourth day.
     No anatomical examination that                         has    hitherto been made
on this subject, seems to have thrown any light upon it.
Different parts of the fauces, pharynx, and oesophagus have
been frequently found slightly inflamed, probably owing to
the exertions to which these parts are subjected  the course                  in
of the disease. The lungs have also been generally found
distended with blood, and in some cases the vessels of the
brain likewise         ;    both of which             may be supposed                 to depend
on the      irregular action of           The only disease with
                                            the heart.
which this      likely to be confounded
                  is                        tetanus           is
                                                     the painful             ;
and difficult deglutition, with the convulsive paroxysms, being
common to both               ;    but the continued stiffness                of       the   jaws,
or the spasm                of    the   muscles        by    which      the jaws are kept
fixed, which           is   essential     to    tetanus, will          at once lead to            a
satisfactory distinction, independent of the circumstances of
infection, which we always annex to hydrophobia.
   With regard to the theory of this disease, there are several
Important questions which naturally present themselves for
consideration, each requiring  separate and perhaps exten
                                                  a
sive discussion, viz., To what   the origin of the infection
                                                      is
to be ascribed         ?         To what animals             is

frequent   ?   Is the infection confined to the saliva       ?    Is ab
sorption necessary to the production        of the disease  ?   At how
late a period is the destruction     of the part on which the bite
was inflicted, effectual   in preventing the disorder?          Are the
symptoms accompanied by a state of increased excitement,
or by debility ?
    The limits of this   paper will not permit me to enlarge on
these interesting topics    ; but we may shortly observe,           that,
whatever     may be the origin   of  the infection,   it does not ap
pear to be confined to any particular class       of animals, or     any
particular country or climate     ; that, with regard to absorption
as necessary to the production of the disease, it is difficult to
form a decided opinion ; for while on the one hand we have
the analogy of other poisons, as that of Lies venerea, in fa
vour of absorption, we must observe on the other, that this
disease   bears a great resemblance      to tetanus, where there is
not the mo3t distant suspicion of any thing absorbed to ac
count for the mischief; and further, that the lymphatic
glands in the course of absorption have never,              as far as 1
know, been found diseased.
    Could this point be settled, we should have less difficulty
in determining the next, namely, the period at which the de
struction of the part bitten would be effectual in preventing
the occurrence of the disease ; for, were it clearlv shown to be
 produced by absorption, we should be inclined to think that
 the operation would be successful any time before the com
 mencement of the pain in the part mentioned in the history.
    As to the question whether the hydrophobia be a disorder
accompanied by Increased excitement or debility, it is ne-
cessary to say, that, by increased excitement, I mean not
only a greater frequency of action in the heart and arteries,
but of strength likewise.       In  some cases    of this disease,    the
symptoms seem to have indicated such            a  condition   ; as, for
example, the rapid and apparently strong state of circula
 tion, and the fierce and unmanageable delirium.               Bleeding
has seemed to be strongly indicated from these circum
stances, and has accordingly had a full and fair trial ; but
the effects have by no means tended to confirm the idea on
which the practice was founded. The delirium and frequency

 48                               On Hydrophobia.
 of circulation            have rather,      on the contrary, been increased
by it.       It is not unlikely, when           we take a view of the action
of    the other poisons, that there may be a difference in differ
ent cases    thus, the small-pox is sometimes attended with
                ;
strong inflammatory symptoms ; at other times with great
debility ; and this difference not depending on any variety in
the poison itself, but on the state of the constitution and
other accidental circumstances.   I am not able to determine
how far the analogy will apply to hydrophobia., That it is
sometimes connected with debility cannot be doubted,
having occurred in delicate children, in whom the pulse has
been weak throughout                  the whole     of   the disease.     This   weak
ness, too, must necessarily be increased by the unhappy state
of deglutition, which precludes all nourishment by the mouth.
There are several other circumstances                        also, which        are fa
vourable to the idea of debility as connected with this com
plaint : thus, it is well known that some of the most violent
convulsive disorders are attended                     with      great debility,       and
the     only        method      of removing          them       effectually,     is    by
strengthening       constitution.
                          the      Again,           and very     a fierce
unmanageable state of delirium occurs in some cases of low
fever, where every other symptom points out weakness, and
the free use of wine at such times has produced the happiest
effects.       Although         then it is far from        my intention to pro
pose debility as explanatory             of the symptoms of hydrophobia,
yet    it   appears to be that        condition of the body which most
generally accompanies                 it,   and    which     should      not be lost
sight of in the treatment.
                                Method      of   Treatment.
 I     have no           hesitation   in
                          affirming, that there   no well-                is
marked case of this disorder in which    cure has been ob    a
tained after the symptoms have made their appearance;
and even       with regard to the prevention,                    that   there    is   no
method         of treatment (that of removing                   the part excepted)
which can           in   any degree be depended           on.
  The disorder has repeatedly occurred after the fullest trial
of theOrmskirk and other boasted specifics. And no favour
able    conclusion           can be drawn           from      those     instances      in
                                                                                 which

                          On Hydrophobia.                            If
which patients having taken such remedies have escaped.
First, because many bites are inflicted by animals which are
not diseased, but only supposed to be so. Secondly, If the
animal be decidedly mad, all of those on whom the bite is
inflicted are not the subjects of the disease, some of them
escaping independently of any medicine.
     After the symptoms ha"i made their             appearance,   there
are some      remedies   which appear to have had so full a trial,
that their exhibition should be totally laid aside in future.
Of these are the Ormskirk medicine, musk, mercurials,
bleeding,      warm bath, and opium        ; and   therefore, in con
ducting     the treatment     hereafter,   I would    propose   in the
 first place, that     we should seek for a specific among those
 articles of the materia medica which           are known     to exert
 strong effects upon the body.           Among the metallic prepa
 rations, I would more particularly recommend a triaPof those
 of lead, copper, zinc, and lastly of arsenic. Among the
 vegetables,     tobacco, cicuta, acoaite, henbane, &c. Several
 remedies    of this description   may be administered at the same
 time.
     But while     we are endeavouring in        this way to find out
 a   specific   for the   poison of hydrophobia,         I would not
 neglect other objects, which appear to be of consequence,
 and which do not interfere with it.              Thus, I should en
  deavour   to administer frequent clysters composed         of broth,
  milk,   and other nutritious    articles. Various -antispasmodics
  may be combined and employed in the same form, for it is
  in vain to expect that the patient can swallow so frequently
  as would be necessary to the fair trial of such remedies.
  Camphor, asafoetida, castor, aether, ice., may all be com
  bined in the form of clyster, and injected every second
  or third hour. When these different plans have been tried,
  if the disease should still baffle our endeavours, let us
  not continue tame witnesses of so melancholy a spectacle,
  but proceed to methods which no other situation could jus
  tify — I mean that of injecting into the blood vessels va
  rious active remedies, having previously tried upon animals
  (as some kind of guide) in what quantities they caa be re
                                                                 ceived

  ceived into circulation        without fatal effects.     If these   should
  be found unsuccessful,          to expose the      patient for a certain
  length of time to one or other of the inephitic gases.

                                                      Lynn, Dec. I7th,    1808.

                               To   Mr. Tillock.
 It    has heen     frequentlv observed,       that clocks with wooden
 pendulum        rods vary considerably in their rates        of going, at
 different seasons of the year ; but the cause of this irregula
 rity still remains in some obscurity, for want of a greater
 number of observations.
    Mr. Ludlam        says,
                              "  That such a pendulum rather lose*
 in cold and gains in warmer weather *." Mr. Wollaston had
 a clock with a pendulum rod of deal, and he says, " It ap
 pears   as   if  the clock gained in warm and lost in cooler
 weather    : but this is not clear. It began to gain before
 the weather grew warm.              Whether this be owing to damp,
or any    other   causes, longer experience and abler observers
may discoverf."
    My clock, of the rate of which the following table contain*
a short abstract        from 1798 to 1807, has a deal pendulum
rod,   a dead escapement,         and goes when winding up.              The
daily rate was ascertained           by a transit instrument which
stands in the same room with the clock, and the obseryations
were taken at all convenient          opportunities, as an exact rate
cannot be found from observations taken only once in a fort
night or three weeks.
    It appears from this table, that          pendulums with wooden
rods gain most in the driest, and lose            most in the dampest
weather.       I could never discover that heat or cold had any
effect upon my clock, further than that it went very regularly
during hard frosty weather, which I suppose was owing to
the moisture in the pendulum being frozen.                And it also ap
pears,   that moisture does not affect            the wood so much as

    VI. An      Account  of a Method of hastening the Maturation
       of Grapes.      By   John Williams, Esq., in a Letter to
       the Rt. Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. K.B. P.R.S.*
         SIB,
    It   is a fact well known      to gardeners, that vines,           when ex
   posed in this climate to the open air, although trained to
   walls with southern aspects, and having every advantage of
  judicious culture, yet in the ordinary course of our seasons
   ripen their fruit with difficulty.            This remark, however,
   though true      in general, admits of some exceptions ; for I
  have occasionally seen trees         of the common white muskadinet

  well,    and earlier by a fortnight or three weeks than                 others
  of   the same kinds, and apparently possessing similar advan
  tages    of soil and aspect.
      The vines that ripened       the fruit thus early, 1 have gene
 rally remarked, were          old trees having trunks eight or ten
 feet high,      before  their bearing branches commenced.                    It
 occurred to me, that this disposition             to  ripen early, might
 be occasioned by the dryness            and rigidity    of   the vessels     of
 the old trunk obstructing the circulation of that portion of
 the sap which is supposed to descend from the leaf.                       And
 to prove whether or not my conjectures were correct, I made
 incisions through the bark on the trunks of several vines
 growing in my garden, removing a circle of bark from each,
 and thus leaving the naked alburnum above an inch in
width completely exposed ; this was done in the months of
June     and   July.    The following autumn           the   fruit growing
on these trees came to great perfection, having ripened from
a fortnight to three weeks            earlier than usual : but in the
succeeding spring the vines did not shoot with their ac
customed vigour, and I found that I had                  injured     them by
exposing the alburnum unnecessarily.
     Last summer these experiments were repeated ; at the end
of July and beginning of August, I took annular excisions
ef bark from the trunks of several of my vines, and that the

the end of autumn, the removed circles were made rather
less than a quarterof an inch in width. Two vines of the
white Frontiniac, in similar states of growth, being trained
near to each other on a south wall,                  were       selected        for trial ;

by the beginning of September showed indications of ap
proaching ripeness, while the fruit of the unexperimented
tree continued green and small.                 In   the beginning              of   Octo
ber,     the   fruit on   the tree that had the bark removed                        from   it
was quite ripe, the other only just began to show     dispo                     a
sition to ripen, for the bunches were shortly afterwards de
stroyed  by the autumnal frosts.    In every case in which
circles of bark were removed,    invariably found that the

of   the sap,     the truth of which           these   experiments, in my
opinion,       tend strongly      to confirm.     I   therefore imagine by
cutting through the cortex and                 liber without wounding the
alburnum, that the descent of that portion of the sap which
has undergone preparation in the leaf   obstructed and con

not to let the removed circle of bark be too wide : from one
to two eighths of an inch will be a space of sufficient width ;
the exposed alburnum will then be covered again with new
bark before the following winter, so that there will be no
danger of injuring the future health of the tree.
     It  is not  of much consequence in what part of the tree
the incision is made, but in case the trunk is very large, I
should then recommend, that the circles be made in the
 Smaller branches.
     It  is to be observed    that all shoots which come out from
 the root of the vine, or from the front of the trunk situated
 betow the incision, must be removed as often as they appear,
 unless bearing wood is particularly wanted to fill up the
 lower part of the wall, in which case one or two shoot9 may
 be left.
      Vines growing in forcing       houses are equally improved    in
  point    of size  and flavour, as well as made to ripen earlier by
  taking away      circles of bark : the time for doing this, is when
  the fruit is set, and the berries are about the size of small
  shot.      The removed circles       may here be made wider than
  on vines growing in the open air, as the bark is sooner re
  newed in forcing houses, owing to the warmth and moisture
  in those places. Half an inch will not be too great a width
  to take off in       a circle from  a vigorous growing vine, but I
  do not recommend the operation to be performed at all in
   weak trees.
       I  think that this practice may be extended to other fruits,
   so as to hasten their maturity, especially Jigs, in which there
   is a most abundant flow of returning sap ; and it demon
   strates to us, why old trees are" more disposed to bear fruit
   than young ones. Miller informs us, that the vineyards in
   Italy are thought to improve every year by age, till they are
    50 years old.      It therefore appears to me, that nature, in
    the course    of time, produces effects similar to what I have
    above recommended to be done by art.            For, as trees be
    come old, the returning vessels do not convey the sap into
    the roots, with the same facility they did when young: thus,
    by occasionally removing circles of bark, we only anticipate
                                                                   the

the process of nature ; in both eases a stagnation of the true
sap is obtained in the fruiting branches, and the redundant
nutriment then passes into the fruit.
   I   have sometimes found that after the                 circle   of bark     has
been removed, a small portion of the inner bark has adhered
to the alburnum : it is of the utmost importance to remove
this, though         ever so small,        otherwise in a very short space
of time,       the communication           is again established with the
root, and little or no effect produced. Therefore in about
ten days after the first operation has been performed,   I
generally look at the part from whence the bark was re
moved, and separate any small portion, which may have
escaped the knife the first time.

VII.     On a new Method  of training Fruit Trees. By Thos.
               Andrew Knight, Esq., F.R.S., H&c*
From         the   of experiments I have made to ascertain
                   result
the influenceof gravitation on the descending sap of trees,
and the cause of the descent of the radicle, and ascerit of                              •
the expanding plumule of germinating setdsf, I have been
induced to believe             that none of the forms, in which fruit
trees are generally trained, are those best calculated to pro
mote an equal distribution of the circulating fluids ; by
which alone permanent health and vigour, and power to
afford a succession of abundant crops, can be given. I have
therefore been led to try a method of training which                          is,
                                                                                I
believe, different from any that has been practised  and as           ;
the success of this method has fully answered every expec
tation I   had formed,         I    have thought   a    concise account of      it
might not be unacceptable to the Horticultural Society.                        I
confine my account to the peach tree, though, with little               a
variation,      the method          of training   and    pruning,     that I   re-

commend, is applicable, even with superior advantages, to
the cherry, plum, and pear tree; and I must observe, that
when trees are by any means deprived of the motion, which
their branches naturally receive from winds, the forms in
which they are trained, operate more powerfully on their per
manent health and vigour, than is generally imagined.
    My    peach trees,   which were plants of one year old only,
were headed down, as usual, early in the spring, and two
shoots only were trained from each stem in opposite direc
tions, and in an elevation of about five degrees ; and when
the two shoots did not grow with equal luxuriance, I de
pressed     the strongest, or gave a greater elevation to the
weakest, by which means both were made to acquire and to
preserve an equal degree of vigour.          These shoots, receiving
the whole sap of the plants, grew with much luxuriance,
and    in  the course    of the summer each attained about the
length   of four  feet. Manv lateral shoots were of course emit-
ted   from the young luxuriant branches; but these were-
pinched off at the first or second leaf; and were in the suc
ceeding winter       wholly   destroyed    ; when the plants, after
being pruned, appeared         as  represented   in Plate II. Fig. 1.
This form, I shall here observe,          might with much advan
tage be given to trees whilst in the nursery ; and perhaps it
is the only form which can be given, without subsequent
injury   to the tree  : it is'also  a form that can be given, with
very little trouble or expense to the nurseryman.
   "In the succeeding season as many branches were suffered
 to spring from     each plant as could be trained conveniently,
without shading each other ; and by selecting the strongest
and earliest buds towards the points of the year old branches,
and the weakest and latest near their bases, I was enabled
to give to each annual shoot nearly an equal degree of vi
gour ; and the plants appeared in the autumn of the second
year nearly as represented in Fig. 2. The experienced gar
dener will here observe, that I exposed a greater surface of
leaf to the light, without placing any of the leaves so as to
shade others,    than can probably be done in any other mode
of training ; and in consequence of this arrangement, the
growth of the trees was so great, that at two years old some
                                                                   of

              On a new Method          of training Fruit   Trees.        87
  of   them    were    fifteen feet wide; and the young wood in
  every part acquired the most perfect maturity.               In the win
 ter, the shoots of the last season were alternately shortened,
 and left their whole length,           and they were    then prepared to
 afford a most abundant and regular blossom in the succeed
 ing spring.
     In the autumn of the third year the trees were nearly -as
represented in Fig. 3, the central part of each being formed
 of very fme bearing wood ; and the size and general health
 of   the trees     afford    evidence   of  a more regular distribution
 of   the   sap,   than    I have   witnessed in any other mode of
 training.
     In  the preceding method         of treating  peach trees very little
 use was made         of the knife during winter        ;  and  I  must re
 mark that       the necessity of winter pruning should generally
 be avoided       as much as possible ; for by laying in a much
 larger quantity of wood in the summer and autumn than can
 be wanted in the succeeding year, the gardener gains no
 other advantage than thai of having a " great choice of fine
bearing wood to fill his walls," and I do not see any ad
 vantage in his having much more than he wants ; on the                       ,
 contrary, the health of the tree always suffers by too much
 use of the knife through successive seasons.
    To    enter   into    the  detail of pruning, in the manner in
which I think it might be done with most advantage, would
of necessity      lead me much beyond the intended limits            of my
present communication ; but I shall take this opportunity of
offering a few observations on the proper treatment of luxu-                \i
riant shoots of the peach tree, the origin and office of which,
as well as the right mode of pruning them, are not at all
understood either by the writers on gardening of this coun
try, or the Continent.
    I have shown in the Philosophical Transactions of 1805,
that the alburnum or sap wood of oak trees loses a consi
derable part of its weight during the period in which iis
leaves are formed in the          spring; antl that any portion of the
alburnum affords less extractive matter after the leaves have
been formed than previously.               1 have  also shown that the
aqueous fluid which ascends in the spring in the birch and

iycamore becomes specifically heavier as it ascends towards
the buds ; which, I think, affords sufficient evidence that the
alburnum of trees becomes during winter a reservoir of the
sap or blood     of the tree, as the bulb of the hyacinth, tulip,
and the tuber     of the potatoe, certainly do of the sap or blood
of   those  plants. Now a wall-tree, from the advantageous
position of its leaves relative to the light, probably generates
much more sap, comparatively with the number of its buds,
than   a standard    tree of   the same size ; and when        it attempts
to employ     its  reserved     sap    in the spring,    the   gardener    is
compelled to destroy (and frequently does so too soon and
too abruptly) a very large portion of the small succulent
shoots emitted, and the aphis too often prevents the growth
of those which remain.             The sap in consequence stagnates,
and appears often to choke the passages through the small
branches ; which in consequence become incurably un
healthy, and stunted in their growth : and nature then finds
means of employing the accumulated sap, which, if retained,
would generate the morbid exudation, gum, in the produc
tion of luxuriant shoots. These shoots, our gardeners, from
Langley to Forsyth, have directed to be shortened in sum
mer, or cut out in the succeeding spring ; but I have found
great advantages in leaving them wholly unshortened ; when
they have uniformly produced the finest possible bearing
wood for the succeeding year ; and so far is this practice
from having a tendency to render naked the lower or in
ternal parts of the tree, whence those branches spring, that
the strongest shoots they afford invariably issue from the
buds near their bases.          I   have also  found   that   the   laterals
that spring from these luxuriant shoots, if stopped at the
first leaf, often afford very strong blossoms and fine fruit in
the succeeding season.              Whenever     therefore space can be
found to train in a luxuriant shoot,            I think it should rarely
or never be       either cut out, or shortened : it should, how
ever,   never   be trained perpendicularly,          where that can be
                                 *

      VIII.   Proposed Improvement            of  the Hygrometer.
                         By  J. Berzelius *.
Dalton's         admirable researches         have    at last decided the
dispute respecting the water of the atmosphere, which had
lasted for nearly a whole century.             The least absurd of the
 ideas advanced     on the subject was, that the water becam«
dissolved by the air, much in the manner as other solid bo
dies are dissolved by water, and that the aqueous meteor*
depended on alterations in the solvent capacity of the air,
whereby the water is sometimes precipitated, producing
clouds and rain, and at times dissolved, producing exhalations.
    But Dal ton   has proved,     that the water       of the atmosphere
is independent of the air ; and that if the earth were deprived
of the latter, it would nevertheless be surrounded by aqueous
vapour, the extent of which would depend upon the degree
pf  heat only ; its increase    in an increase     of temperature being
rather hindered than promoted by the air. The water con
tained in the air is in a gasiform state, mixed with the at
mospheric air, just as in this the oxygen is mixed with the
nitrogen, or as water is mixed with any other fluid.                    The
quantity of water-gas in the air (as we have said) is in pro
portion to the temperature ; and if the latter were immu
table, the former would also continue the same ; but per
petual changes of situations, circumstances, and tempera
ture, produce continual alterations in this gas of the air, and
from this alone are most of the aqueous meteors derived.
Dalton, by a series of experiments, has calculated the quan
tity of water capable of maintaining a gasiform state, cor
respondent with every degree of the thermometer ; and in a
separate   table   determined these quantities according to the
different columns of mercury they support.                  For instance,
at  —  15°f it is equivalent to a column of 0-064 inches, at
 — 5° to 0-120, at 0° to 0-183, at + 15° to 0-422, at + 50°
to 2-90, and at the boiling point to 25-0 inches, and this in
vacuo as well      as in the open     air.    But    it seldom      happens

that the air is charged with water to the maximum of its
temperature — a circumstance which renders the indications
of the hygrometer highly useful and necessary.    The hy
grometer should express— To what column of mercury the
water-gas of the air corresponds ? and at the same time de
termine the absolute quantity of the gas ; and, the tempe
rature of the air being knowrii — How much of this gas it
can take up beyond what it already holds, and how soon
the    exhalation thereof can take               place?    Our usual hygro
meters       of hair,   and   of whalebone,       are,    in this respect, very
imperfect       :   the results from them are not much to be relied
on, having always             a   relation to the temperature in which
the examination is made.
     Dalton     made use      of     a very   plain   instrument       for his hy-
grometrical essays        :       he filled a long cylindrical     glass vessel
with cold well water, and    when the dew appeared to coat
the outside, he decanted the water, and wiped the glass well
with linen, after which he returned the water, and this he
repeated until the glass             ceased to   appear moist upon the             in
troduction of the water              ; when he, by means          of    the   ther
mometer,        examined the temperature of the water so pour
ed in    :   he then found the degree of heat at which the air
might prove saturated      might so say) with the contained
                                    (if

lumn of mercury coincided therewith, he being already ac
quainted with the temperature of the air. This simple ap

I    altered Dalton'splan in the following manner                  :
  Let us suppose that the air which we are about to exa
mine     at 20°, and that
         is                     glass of ordinary spring water,
                                          a
generally at 7° when recently taken from the spring,         be               is
dewed  in  this air. The  difference  between the temperature of
the air and the water              is   then equal to 13°.      Should we take
                                                                          12 glass

          Proposed Improvement         of the Hygrometer.             4l
11 glass vessels,   in the first of which     we mix 12 parts    of this
spring water with one part of water which has acquired the
temperature of the air; in the second, 11 parts of the former
with two of the latter, and so in        a  decreasing ratio through
out, we then obtain fluids which differ from each other by
one degree of temperature. Of these we examine the first
which does not bedew, and its temperature then precisely
indicates the expansive capacity of the water-gas of the air.
Should the air happen to be too dry, so as not to yield a
deposition of water, then we might render it cooler by the
addition of sal ammoniac which dissolves          in it; and in winter
we can increase the cold by snow, with salt or sal ammoniac.
But even this method is slow and troublesome for hygro-
metrical investigations.        I therefore determined to precipi
tate the water from the air by the thermometer itself, as
follows :
    The bulb, defended by a case of oiled silk, being immersed
in the cold water, was taken up after having acquired the
 temperature of the water.        It then became covered with va
pour of water ;   I  observed   also  the degree of the thermometer
when the dew disappeared, and found the expansive capa
city of the water-gas, according to Dalton's tables, tolerably
near. But I also found that a very damp air at + 18° to
 +   20° produce.d    a somewhat        greater   result than what it
ought to be, because the thermometer, when much water
is deposited on its bulb, proceeds little beyond the true point
 before all is evaporated.      Besides, there is another circum
 stance which    renders    the use   of  the  ordinary thermometer
 less certain, that,   namely, a small portion of deposit is not
 accurately distinguished on the bulb.             I therefore caused a
 thermometer bulb of steel to be made, greatly oblongated,
 its outside   highly polished,       and    thereto   attached  a  steel
 tube an inch     long,   wherein     I  closely cemented a thermo
meter tube, and made thereof an actual thermometer. This
 instrument    completely answered my purpose.                When the
 bulb with its oil case was immersed in the cooling mixture,
 and taken up as the mercury fell an inch, or every other
inch according to circumstances, I at last arrived at a pe
 riod when the bulb became covered             with  a quickly-passing
                                                                    coat

 degree of expansive capacity of the water-gas of the air with
 the greatest precision possible.          This kind of hygrometer,
besides the nicety of its results, also has the advantage that
 an experiment may be made without loss of time and trouble,
 and does not tire the observator like the former methods.

            Some Precipitations      by the simple Prussiate.
This prussiate yields, with metallic solutions, results dif
ferent from those of the triple prussiate. Scheele had already
remarked some of them, and the following came under my
observation     :
    Silver. Triple prussiate s a white precipitate which soon
became blue, on account of the white prussiate                      of iron
which     is mixed   with that of silver.
    Silver.   Simple prussiate     :  a white    curd which does not
change.
    Gold. Triple prussiate : nothing.
    Gold. Simple : white precipitate, which becomes of                 a fine
yellow.
    If  we heat the mixture, this precipitate, when heated,
does not fulminate ; it is a true prussiate of gold.                 When
heated in a retort, it gives water, abundance of empyreu-
matic oil, carbonic acid gas, which burns with a blue flame,
and a residue of gold mixed with charcoal powder.                     Upon
looking over my notes I do not find ammonia mentioned,
perhaps from neglect.

that if this muriate was perfectly exempt from oxide at the
maximum, the precipitate would be white.        The solution
of this muriate is like that of iron ; it is difficult to keep it at
the zero of hypcr-oxidation,    on account of the air.
  The same muriate : simple prussiate : curdled precipitate,
perfectly white. Some drops of potass take the prussic acid
from        it,   and    restore         the      yellow colour to         it,   which   is   the

 the red oxide,    and seems to     take  a  surcharge   of it  : for it
 does   not any longer crystallize in prisms, but in small
groups of very fine needle-like crystals. Their solutions
 also require more concentration : new solutions do not re
store them to their first form.
    This salt heated in a retort is very easily decomposed, and
indeed totally, if we be not too hasty in heating, it.                 It
is sufficient to heat some grains of it in a tube three or four
lines in diameter closed at one end.          If, while it is   heated,
we present the open end to the flame, the prussic gas mixed
with gaseous oxide takes fire. Its flame is red and blue,
terminated by      a yellowish aureola. One hundred grains of
prismatic prussiate distilled yielded 72 grains of mercury,
and on another occasion 72f.
    The residue, being from eight to nine grains, was a mix
ture of charcoal and carbonate of potash. This is not sur
prising ; the alkali cannot decompose the prussiate of mer
cury : it certainly belongs to the Prussian blue, which was
that used in commerce.
    The products from this distillation        are ammonia and        oil
in abundance,      besides    a mixture   of carbonic acid     gas and
carbonic acid.
    There was apparently no prussiate with a base of oxide at
the minimum;       for the prussic acid, applied to mild mer
cury, and to the nitrate with a minimum base, eliminates a
portion of mercury, and gives prussiate with a base of red
oxide, the same as that obtained by treating this acid di
rectly with red oxide.
    The red oxide also decomposes        the simple prussiate.      Po
tass is also   separated    from it ; and as  it has no action upon
the prussiate    of mercury,    the latter crystallizes in the mass.
It   also completely     decomposes the triple prussiate, which
requires    long   ebullitions  :  in this case the black oxide,
the element of this salt, passes to the state of red oxide,
and is deposited in ochre.        A part of the mercury gives up
to it the oxygen which it requires for this : hence it hap
pens that we find it native with the ochre which is precipi
tated ; but without the hyper-oxidation         of the iron,    which,
as we    know, diminishes the affinities of this metal,        the ox
                                                                     ide

ide   of mercury would not               succeed perhaps          in decomposing
a combination so strong as that                of   the triple prussiate.
  Diluted          sulphuric     acid has no action upon the prussiate
of mercury         even   with   heat, and not the slightest smell of
prussic gas is perceived.
   Potass saturates the sulphuric acid                   as the   excipient   of the
prussiate, but precipitates nothing.
   Concentrated sulphuric acid destroys                       the     prussic acid,
gives sulphureous acid, and thereby puts an end to every
mean of comparison.
   The nitric acid is not more successful, even after ebul
lition.        We    perceive very early a little nitrous gas,             but it is
certainly the black oxide containing the prismatic prussiate
which occasions it : to conclude, the prussiate crystallizes
in the      mass    of the acid.         The alkalis      saturate this last, and
also precipitate nothing from it.
      It   does not elude the muriatic acid in the same way, how
ever.  There is a separation of prussic gas, a complete de
composition, and the prussiate is totally changed into corro
sive sublimate.  Alcohol also dissolves entirely the saline
residue  of this operation : finally, examined by the reagents,
we   find no longer any sublimate.       Alcohol, as we know
already, does not dissolve the prussiate of mercury.
   Potash dissolves in abundance the prussiate of mercury by
means of heat. This salt crystallizes in it upon cooling.
Alcohol separates it from  and we recoverit, entirely.              it
  The muriate of tin at the minimum, and hydro-sulphu
retted water instantly decompose this prussiate, and the
prussic acid becomes free.
      We
       have seen that the muriatic acid acted efficaciously
upon  this prussiate. From this    should seem that the sal

grain*.   I kept the alcohol in a bell glass over the bath of
mercury: the gas is dissolved rapidlv, but it would have
taken much more. The water of the intermediate receiver
was also surcharged with it : the smell was pungent and
suffocating, and its taste very strong of almond kernel. This
water did not disturb barytes. The gas always tends to se
parate from          it,     and continually            elevates           the    stopper       :   if   we

  Prussic alcohol is preserved extremely well                         :    we     might
    even conclude from     this, with    some foundation,                  that   if   al
    cohol is mors proper than water for its solution and preser
    vation, the prussic gas, considered besides in its qualities 6f
    being aromatic and inflammable, is perhaps more visibly
    allied to oily combustible products, and              of      a   complex na
    ture, than to saline substances.
       It results from these facts, in the first place, that there is
'
    only one prussiate of mercury, being that of which the base
    is at the maximum. Secondly, that all this exaltation of affi
    nities which the prussic acid borrows from the black oxide,
    when it is requisite to use potash, or the red oxide of iron,
    and upon    which Berthollet      has insisted       with         so    muchjus-

    oxides of gold, silver, copper, cobalt, nickel, uranium,
    mercury, &c. We see, in fact, that with regard to the lat
     ter, this acid, the affinities    of which         are so indolent,               and
                              of affinities, has however no oc
     so little deserve the title
     casion for black oxide, in order to furnish with mercury                               a
     saline combination,        very soluble, very crysfallizable,                     en
     dowed, in   word, with all the characters which distinguish
                 a
     the most perfect compounds.    Add to these mysterious cir
     cumstances, its preference to mercury over all the alkalis,
     and its not yielding its oxide cither to the nitric acid or to                              ,
     the sulphuric acid, which their power raises so much above
     it
      ;  and lastly, its only yielding to the muriatic acid, which
     we know to be in so many respects inferior to the sulphuric
'
     and   nitric acids.
         Lixivium    ofAnimal Charcoal.— 'Equal parts of charcoal
      of blood, and of carbonate of potash, made red-hot in                                 a
      covered crucible, have always furnished me with the richest
      lixivium.
        Thinking that the carbonic acid might be an obstacle to
      the saturation of the potash, added lime to the mixture,
                                        I
      but the lixivium was not improved   it.      by
       I    kept red-hot for half an hour,         a   mixture         of    144 grains
                                                                                            of

   of charcoal,    and the same quantity      of carbonate.      The lix
   ivium being finished,      the charcoal extracted     was only      104
   grains : 40 grains were destroyed.
      These 104 grains were again treated with 144         of carbonate:
   they were reduced to 62       ; loss 42.
      The lixivium of     these two experiments was saturated         with
   the solution   of the sulphate of iron      used in commerce     :  the
  blue of the first, after the colour was struck,         was double    in
  volume to that of the second.
      In order to ascertain the influence of temperature,         I  tried
  three mixtures of equal quantities.         The first was kept red-
  hot for half an hour, the second one hour, and the third an
  hour   and  a. quarter. The first lixivium gave very little blue ;
  the two last gave a great deal, and much about the same
  quantity.      These results prove either that the simple prus
 siate, being that which predominates in the lixiviums, is
 preserved in the midst of the carbonaceous alkaline mass, or
 that it is reproduced in proportion as it is destroyed.
     The charcoal of blood, pulverized, liquefies in the air             :
 when washed, it gives sea salt, and carbonate of soda hold
 ing a little prussic acid in solution.
     The charcoal of blood, when treated in this way           a second
 time, still yields blue, but in small quantity ; a third, less
 sensibly; a fourth, not at all.         This charcoal, when made
 red-hot, is incinerated with much facility without exhaling
the ammoniacal smell.           It appears, that in proportion as it
loses the azote,       it becomes    more combustible, and resem
bles more closely vegetable charcoals : the nitric acid, how
ever, does not inflame it.          The azote being susceptible of
forming    concrete    combinations     capable of resisting a high
temperature, what would be the influence              of animal char
coal in the formation of steel ?
    Equal   parts  of charcoal of blood, washed, and of pot
ash rendered      caustic by lime, yielded, by the distillation of
the simple prussiate of ammonia, plenty of gas, which had
the same smell with the prussic, and which burns red.
    Equal parts    of this same charcoal, and of oxide of manga
nese, yielded     carbonate   and prussiate of ammonia.
    The desire of forming ammonia to some profit, led me to
                                                                    the

the  following experiment         :    I  distilled the following mix
ture : charcoal of blood, six drachms; argil and sea salt,
each two drachms; but the produce in sal ammoniac was
much below my expectations.
   All  the vegetable     charcoals azotized are proper fur making
Prussian blue.       Thus    those of gluten, of chick peas, indigo,
and   of pit coal, have yielded dyeing lixiviums, sometimes
mixed with hydro-sulphuret : those of sugar-cane and of
milk do not give any indication of blue.
   Charcoal      of chesnuts and of brush-wood,                which   are
preferred   at the    founderies to any other kind, because they
have the advantage       of being extinguished the moment the
bellows cease, do not owe this to azote, for their lixiviums
do not contain any thing prussic in them.
   Cream     of   tartar   made     red-hot gives a lixivium, which
does not give the least blue          : nor did two parts of cream of
tartar and one     of sal ammoniac ; but one part of sal am
moniac with four of cream of tartar yield a lixivium which
contains simple prussiaie.           It gives blue with the green sul
phate   of  commerce.         Cream      of tartar and nitre of soda,
nothing.
   This result    proves clearly that it is by the azote alone that
animal are preferable to vegetable charcoals.              It also results
from this, that if we can at any time discover some azotized
combination,      more capable      of supporting    a strong heat than
the   ammoniacal       salts, we might         succeed in forming the
prussic   acid  in  a   manner perhaps less laborious than by the
animal charcoals.

     If we   saturate a portion           of lixivium with sulphate of iron,
and examine the blue          liquor formed by                 it,
                                                we discover phos
phate     of iron.      This phosphate induced Westrumb to think
that the prussic acid was phosphoric.
  Alcohol applied to concentrated lixiviums takes simple
prussiate from them   but    appears difficult to purify them
                               ;          it
by this means.   The triple prussiate remains     the lixivium           in                      s
with      the carbonate.
     Of   these two prussiates, one only can give Prussian blue
with solutionsiof    red oxide   namely, the triple prussiate, be
                                          ;
cause        it   provided with black oxiile.  The other cannot,
because   it is    has not the black oxide    but  does so, and
                                                           :           it
becomes triple prussiate, as soon as we mix the lixiviums
with the sulphate of iron of commerce: and consequently,                                       if
we use sulphate completely red, we shall have infinitely
less Prussian blue, because, the black oxide being wanting,                                    it
could not become triple prussiate and give blue with this
sulphate. Two experiments will render this apparent.
 I  divided   lixivium into two equal parts one part was
                   a                                                   ;
precipitated with  red sulphate, and the other with the green
sulphate of commerce. The excess of oxides being separated,
the blue     of    the second        was in proportion to that                    of   the   first
as   four to one.
     The first lixivium, when filtered, exhaled                    strong smell
                                                                            a
of almonds.            I    saturated     it   with potash, in order to fix once
more the free prussic acid                 :    when tried afterwards with red
sulphate,    did not give one atom of blue; but with the
                  it
green sulphate   gave abundance.
                        it        We may therefore con
clude that, without the aid of black oxide,    carbonaceous              a
lixivium would not give with solution of red oxide the whole
of the blue which    might.   From this would arise the loss
                              it
 that might be suffered              of    all the simple            prussiate     contained
 in   a   lixivium
                we only used
                       if    sulphate the oxide a                                      of which
 was completely red  and from this proceeded the
                               ;                                                        mistake
 into which       I    fell when    I     advised    it.   1   did not reflect that,            if
 the green sulphate has the inconvenience of giving pale prus -
 siate, the oxygen of the air soon remedies this defect    but                           ;
it    has the      essential       advantage        of furnishing            to    the simple
 prussiate the portion of black oxide which                                 it    requires in
                                                                                        order

order to convert it into a triple salt, and may afterwards
furnish blue with the red solutions. In this way practice had
preceded theory in accomplishing     an object ; but practice
also becomes in its turn a rational formula, from the moment
that    it      is   confirmed
                       by theory.    Two other experiments
strengthen this demonstration.
   The lixiviums are generally precipitated with a solution of
four parts of alum, and one of the sulphate of commerce.
  I    divided one of these solutions into two                                  parts    :    the one
was hyper-oxidated                by the     oxy-muriatic acid,                  and the other
not.        I   afterwards saturated              them       with         carbonaceous lixi
vium.           The common solution furnished                            blue in abundance,
but the hyper-oxidated                   precipitate, which
                                        gave a very              pale
was only a little blue mixed with a great deal of alumine.
This experiment does not differ essentially from the pre
ceding. It has only the advantage of showing that the alum
is but a passive ingredient                  in   the formation             of Prussian blue.
   It is not         the same therefore               with the        lixiviums of the ma
nufacturer,           with an alkali passed over Prussian blue:
                      as it is
the    latter will always give blue in abundance, because it
comes out            of   the operation tripled, but the lixiviums                             do not.
They could not give it but in proportion to the triple prus-
siate which they contain : it is in order to increase
                                                                                             it it,

raise their simple prussiate to the same degree, that    in                                           is
dispensable to use,  not        sulphate rigorously green, at

  These details also                   explain        to   us,     that    if    the lixiviums
contain     portion only of tripled prussiate,
                a                                  because                       it     is
charcoal of blood has not iron enough to furnish for rais
ing all the simple prussiate formed during calcination to
the triple degree,              or rather because           a     part    of   the latter again
becomes simple prussiate                    by   the loss        of   its oxide, as we have
seen   happen         to   it   when heated alone.                Of these two opinions,
however,        I     adhere      to    the last, because                I     have     remarked,
that   the charcoal              which      served         the    lixiviums           gives           ashes
which always contain much iron thus, in the calcination of

reason, that it is iron                     which          is wanting    in the prussiate :
and       even     if   we     reflect          on   it,   it
                                                           is     astonishing to see that
the triple prussiate, which certainly exists in the lixiviums,
could defend its oxide against the effects of the charcoal,
which tends to reduce     continually.   In short, all this part
                                        it
of      the subject     is    very obscure.                 We     do not know the period
at which the prussic acid         formed,       be destroyed in
                                                     is                 ifit
order to be reproduced, nor finally the degree of heat to be
applied to the boilers, in order to obtain the greatest possible
quantity of the one or the other of the prussiates which                                             it   is
the object of the manufacturer to obtain.
   The existence of the triple prussiate      clearly demon              is
strated in the          lixiviums,              by
                                       the following experiment                                  :
        Saturate   a   lixivium with  dilute  sulphuric acid carbonic                  :
acid      is   first set free, afterwards comes prussic acid from the
free prussiate          :    but   it   must be afterwards heated                      :    we then
obtain the triple prussiate, and the white prussiate of iron                                              is
set free. Besides this, the old concentrated lixiviums de
posit octahedral crystals of triple prussiate.
  The prussic lixivium has two distinct tastes                                     ;   the one            of
potash, and the other of kernels   and from this latter taste

 think also, that the calcination of the mixtures  the open                            in
 air ought not to contribute to the augmentation of the prus
 siates, and that   would perhaps be more advantageous, and
                             it
 less troublesome, to heat them in close crucibles placed                                            in   a
 reverberating furnace, since                         it    is   in other respects           certain

 this aperation.
        When     we have occasion to concentrate the                               lixiviums,             in
 order to diminish                their volume, or               in   order to preserve them,
 we should    begin before every thing, as observed     Cura-                               by
 deau,  in placing  the simple prussiate beyond   the reach of
 destruction    this may be at once effected
                   :                            pouring green                 by

 it  at all, because the potash which         predominates reduces it
 to oxide.      The latter is then deposited without passing to
 the state of prussiate.         To attain this, it must be accom
 panied by an acid, for the oxide in question (being only at
 the minimum)         has no effect upon the triple prussiate.      The
following experiment clearly demonstrates            the  advantages of
 this method      :
    I   divided a lixivium into       two equal parts : the one was
prepared     or   tripled by green sulphate, the other not.        I af
terwards distilled them : the former gave no suspicion of
the presence of ammonia, and the latter furnished it as
usual. It is indispensable, therefore, to prepare iixiviums be
fore concentrating them. Lastly, neither the red oxide, nor
its sulphate, as Scheele experienced, can be dissolved in the
simple prussiate, and give it the quality of triple prussiate :
this oxide, although fit to become the base of Prussian blue,
cannot decompose the triple prussiate           : it must necessarily
be used when dissolved in an acid.
                             Recapitulation.
    The prussic acid is composed of carbon, azote, and hy
drogen, in proportions with which we are not yet acquaint
ed.     Considering the great quantity of charcoal, however,
which it leaves after its destruction in several cases, we may
conjecture that it contains carbon in a greater proportion
than the two other substances.             No person     has  supposed
that oxygen entered into its composition ; and in truth the
well-known affinities of its three elements, added to the cir
cumstances attending its formation,            have   not as yet per
mitted us to hazard the opinion.
    The prussic acid, when by itself, has very few of               the
general qualities of the acids.           It has not a sour taste   : it
does not redden turnsole        : it is not so easily     dissolved in
water (the true solvent of the acids) as it is in alcohol : in
this last solvent it is decomposed even spontaneously, and
without the assistance of the external air. It forms with the
alkalis combinations        so imperfect,     that we find in them,
almost     in  a state  of perfect separation,    the specific proper
ties   of  the   component     parts, and    the carbonic acid, the

weakest     of all,    is sufficient to decompose them.        In  a word,
its combustibility, taste, aromatic smell, its being gene
rated in the midst of volatile oils, and its preservation in
alcohol, exhibit qualities which much more strongly re
semble     oily and inflammable productions             than saline sub
 stances.
     The prussic         acid,    notwithstanding      its trifling saline
energy,      has a powerful action on the major            oxide of mer
cury : it furnishes with this oxide a saline combination,
 so well characterized in its attributes, that we are compelled
to acknowledge that it acts in certain circumstances like the
most powerful acid. Nothing in fact is wanting to the prus
 siate of mercury, to entitle it to be ranked among the most
 perfect   of metallic      salts : it will perhaps astonish some che
 mists, to     see   that it refuses to^ic united to the minor oxide       :
 but by    a  concurrence of affinities, of which we have other
 examples, it raises it to the state of major oxide, by elimi
 nating a part of the metal, in order to form, with the other,
 prussiate of mercury.
     The prussic acid has no action upon the red oxide of iron ;
 but it attacks the black oxide, and produces white prussiate
 with it.      This prussiate, it is true, is not absolutely white,
 the difficulty         of preparing, with green sulphate, a pre
 cipitate at the zero of hyper-oxidation,              not permitting it :
  thus, it is always greenish ; but as, upon drying, it becomes
  perfect Prussian blue, we cannot doubt that the prussic acid,
  plus the base of the green sulphate, will give, all perturba
  tion being out of the question, a prussiate equally white
  with that which we obtain by more easy means.
      Prussian blue is not a simple combination, as has been
  thought.        The following observation will sufficiently prove
  this assertion :        We know, for instance, that the basis of
  this  blue   is  red   oxide  : but if this oxide be sufficient of itself
  for making Prussian blue, why should not the prussic acid
  and the red oxide furnish it ? Why should not the solutions
  of this oxide,      and the simple alkaline prussiates, give it also?
  There must necessarily be another element in Prussian blue:
   the following facts clearly demonstrate this :                 When we
  apply potash to Prussian             blue we obtain    a  yellow crystal-
                                                                     lizable

 Jizable salt, which has always         a  constant proportion    of black
 oxide.
     If we employ the yellow prussiate in reproducing Prussian
 blue, this oxide re-enters with the prussic acid into the new
 combination.       The "black oxide is therefore an element ne
 cessary to the formation both          of the crystallizable prussiate
 and   of the Prussian blue, and likewise of all             the  metallic
 prussiates prepared with the triple prussiate of potash.
    There are metals which are susceptible of forming simple
 and triple prussiates, such as copper, silver, manganese, cobalt,
 nickel,   uranium,    &c. There are some which give simple
 prussiate,   such  as  gold, mercury, &c. There are some also
 which give triple prussiate only, such as iron, &c. Lastly,
 some   of them   do not appear susceptible either         of  the one or
 the other.     But, with     the exception       of Prussian blue and
 prussiate  of mercury, all the rest are       little known, and merit
examination.       The black oxide united           to the prussic    acid
 may pass from the one combination to the other without
changing its state : the base of this combination may even
be raised from the minimum             to the maximum, without the
black oxide on that account taking any part in this change.
The combination of the acid with this oxide is maintained
by so powerful an affinity that the alkaline hydro-sulphurets
cannot separate them, or rather they cannot touch the oxide
in the triple prussiate of potash, or in Prussian blue.
    The prussic acid united to this portion of black oxide,
which enables it to form          triple, alkaline, or metallic prus
siates, is a peculiar combination, the existence of which is
not doubtful ; but with which we are not as yet acquainted,
except in these prussiates       alone.
    The triple   prussiate  of potash cannot undergo           a red heat
without    losing the black oxide, and consequently without
being reduced to the state of simple prussiate.
    The simple prussiate is also decomposed, but by a far
lower temperature : its acid is destroyed, and reduced to am
monia and carbonic acid        :   it is the destruction     of this   salt
by the heat     of ebullition,      which degrades the lixiviums for
preparing Prussian blue.                                  »,
    The simple    prussiate  assumes the character        of triple prus-

a sail  with    a base of black oxide, and acquires, besides the
advantage      of  crystallizing, that of being no longer decom
posable by the heat of ebullition.
    This prussiate, which was the test liquor so long wanted
 by chemists, does not give             Prussian blue with solutions of
 ted oxide   ;  but it gives them       if they contain black oxide, be
 cause its acid     is attached    immediately to that portion of the
 same oxide,      which ought to serve as an intermedium be
 tween it and the red oxide.
    The triple      prussiate   of iron, or Prussian blue, strongly
 heated,   is reduced     to  ammonia, to the two gases of carbonic
 acid and gaseous oxide, to iron             (ferarerc)    and to charcoal.
    The prussiate of mercury gives the same products by its
 decomposition, besides a certain portion of oil.
    The charrv lixiviums contain hut I i i tie triple prussiate,
 and a great deal of simple prussiate. They must not be con
 centrated     without having in ihe first place strengthened the
 constitution of the simple prussiate by an addition of black
 oxide, or of green sulphate.
     In order to obtain from these lixiviums the whole of the
 Prussian blue which they are susceptible of giving,                   it is in
 dispensably requisite to use a sulphate, a portion of which at
 least is green : without this precaution, the simple prussiate
 contained in them could not furnish blue with a sulphate,
  the base  of which      was completely red.
     To conclude, if this memoir               be compared with that of
 Scheele, it will      be  found that all the facts above stated were
  perfectly well known to him : but they appeared to me to
  require some further elucidation ; and with this view I lay
  my present memoir before the public.
  X.   Observations     of  a Comet,       made    with a View to investi

28th of September ; and the first time I had an opportunity
of examining it was the 4th of October, when its brightness
to the naked eye gave me great hopes to find it                       of   a   different
construction from many I have seen before, in which no
solid body could be discovered with any of my telescopes.
   In the following observations, my attention has been di
rected to such phaenomena                   only,    as   were
                                                            likely to give us
some information                  relating to   the physical condition of the
comet:     it will therefore not be expected that I should give
an    account of its motion, which I was well assured would
be most accurately ascertained                      at the Royal Observatorv at
Greenwich.                                                                            (
   The different parts of a comet have been generally ex
pressed by terms that may be liable to misapprehension,
such     as the     head, the tail, the coma, and the nucleus
                                                        ; for
in reading what some authors say of the head, when they
speak of the size of the comet, it is evident that they take
it for what is often called the nucleus.                      The truth     thatis,
inferior      telescopes,          which     cannot       show the real nucleus,

late to the above-mentioned particulars, namely, the nucleus,
the head,          the coma,         and the tail, without regarding the or
der     of   .the time when they           were made.     The date of each
observation,  however, will be added, that any person who
may  hereafter be in possession of more accurate elements of
the comet's orbit, than those which    have at present, may

 cleus, the disk of which is plainly to be seen.
      Oct. 6.        I examined              the disk      of       the comet with a proper
set of diaphragms, such as described in a former paper*,
in order to see whether any part of it were spurious; but
when the exterior light was excluded, so far from appearing
larger, as would have been the case with a spurious disk,
it appeared rather diminished for want of light; nor was
its diameter lessened when                        I   used        only the outside rays of
the mirror.              The visible disk of                    the comet therefore is a
real one.

powers, but found that its light was not sufficiently intense
to bear very high ones.  As far as 200 and 300, my 10-feet
reflector acted very well, but with 400 and 500 there was
nothing gained, because the exertion of a power depending
on the quantity of light was obstructed f, which I found
was here       of    greater consequence than the increase                              of mag

might be more precisely remembered in the evening, when
                                                                                                     '
I intended to compare the appearance of the nucleus with
them.
   On examining the comet,     found the diameter of its nu

which, being -0466 of an inch, subtended an angle of "-97                                   3
at the distance            of   the telescope          in   the day time.
    Comparing the nucleus also with the impressions which
the view of the second and third had left    my memory,                       in
and   of which         the real diameters                  were -0325 and -0290             of an
inch,      and magnitudes at the station                       of the mirror           2"-77 and
2"*47,   I      found,      that the comet was almost                            as large as the
second, and           alittle larger than the third.

reviewed my globules, T judged its diameter to be not only
less than my second globule, but also less than the third :
that   is,   less than 2"-47.
     Oct. 6.       The 20-feet reflector, notwithstanding its great
light,   does      not show the nucleus of the comet larger than
the ten- feet,         with an equal magnifier, makes it.
     Oct. 28.       My     large ten-feet telescope, with the mirror              of
24    inches in diameter, does not increase the sizt of the nu
cleus.
     Oct. 6.       fully aware of the objections that may be
                   Being
made against the  method of comparing the magnitude of
the nucleus of the comet with objects that cannot be seen
logether,  had recourse to the satellites of Jupiter for

decisive result, and with my seven-feet telescope, power 202,
I viewed the disk of the third satellite and of the nucleus of
the comet alternately. They were both already too low to be
seen very distinctly         ;    the diameter          of the nucleus however
appeared to be less than twice that                     of the satellite.
     Oct.    18.    With    the ten-feet reflector, and the power 221,
a   similar estimation was made                 ;    but the light    of   the moon
would not permit    fair comparison.

cate polish of my former one having suffered     little from           a
being exposed to damp air in nocturnal observations. This
new one being uncommonly distinct, and the air also re
markably clear,     turned the telescope from the comet to
                        I
Jupiter's third satellite, and saw its diameter verv distinctly
larger than the nucleus of the comet.      turned the telescope
                                                         I
again to the comet,             and as soon as        I   saw    it distinctly round
and well defined,         I     was    assured that        its    diameter was less
than that of the satellite.
     6h. 20'.      I   repeated       these alternate observations, and          al
ways found the same result. The night        beautifully clear,  is
and the moon  has not yet risen to interfere with the lightof
the comet.
     Nov.    20.    With    a   seven-feet reflector, and power only 75,

     When                   with an inferior telescope, or
                    the comet is viewed
if the magnifying power, with a pretty good one, is either
much too low, or much too high, the very bright rays im
mediately contiguous to the nucleus will seem to belong to
it,and form what may be called the head.
     Oct.       19.      T   examined the head of the comet with an indif
ferent telescope,                 in the manner           I    have described, and found
it apparently of the size of the planet Jupiter, when                                               it   is
viewed with the same telescope and magnifying power.
      With      a     good telescope,               I   saw   in   the centre         of   the head      a
very small well-defined round point.
   Nov. 20. The head of the comet                                  is   now less brilliant than

          Of the    Density         of the     Coma and    Tail of the Comet.
      Many authors             have said, that the        tails of comets are of      so
 rare a texture, as not to affect the light of the smallest stars
 that are seen through them. Unwilling to take any thing
 upon trust, that may be brought to the test of observation,
  Itook notice of many small stars, that were occasionally
 covered by the coma and the tail, and the result is as follows.
      Oct. 26. 6h. 15'. Large 10-feet reflector, 24 inches aper
 ture.     A small star within the coma is equally faint with
 two other stars that are on the north-following side of the
 comet, but without the coma.
      7h. 3(/. The coma being partly removed from the star,
  it is now brighter than it was before.
     Oct. 31. 6h. 5'. 10-feet reflector. A star in the tail of the
' comet, which we will call a, is much less
                                                 bright than two
 others,        b and     c, without the tail.
    Two other stars, d and e, towards the south of and c,                   I
 are in the following skirts of the tail, and are extremely
 faint.
      7h.   20\ The            star e is now considerably bright,               the tail

too low to estimate          the brightness     of stars properly.

without       the   tail, but near enough to be seen in the field of
view with a.          The     path   of  the head   of  the comet   leads to
 wards a, and       a more intense brightness will come upon it.

 the head     of  the comet,      and is no longer visible,     except     now
 and     then very faintly, by occasional imperfect glimpses;
 but the star b retains its former light.

      Dec. 6. The head of the comet, viewed with a mirror of
  24 inches diameter,          resembles now one of those nebule,
  which in my catalogues would have been described,                   "  a verv
  large,    brilliant,   round     nebula,    suddenly    much    brighter in
  the    middle."
      Dec. 16.      7-feet reflector. The night being fine, and the
  moon not risen, the comet resembles " a very bright, large,
  irregular, round nebula, very gradually much brighter in
   the middle,      with   a  faint nebulosity on the south-preceding
   side."

                                    " Very bright, very large, very gra
   dually much brighter in the middle."
       If I had not known this to be a comet, I should have ad
   ded to my description          of it as a  nebula, that the centre of it
   might consist of very small stars ; hut this being impossible,
    I directed my ten-feet telescope with a high power to the
    comet, in order to ascertain the cause           of this  appearance ;     in
    consequence of which I perceived several small stars shining
    through the nebulosity of the coma.

  preceding side; I take it to be the vanishing remains of the
  comet's tail.
     Feb. 19. Considerably bright; about ^th of the field =
  3' 26'' " in diameter, gradually brighter in the middle."
 The faint nebulosity in the place where the tail used to be,
 still projects     a  little further from      the  centre  than in other
  directions.
     Feb.  21 . Less bright than on the 19th ; nearly of the same
 size  :  gradually brighter in the middle.             The nebulosity still
 a little projecting on the side where the tail used to be.
                 Result       of the foregoing   Observations.
     From the observations which are now before us, we may
 draw some inferences, which will be of considerable im
 portance with regard to the information they give us, not
only of the size of the comet, but also of the nature of its
 illumination.
     A visible, round,           and well defined   disk, shining in every
part   of it with     equal brightness,       elucidates two material cir
cumstances       ;   for since the nucleus of this comet, like the
body of     a planet, appeared in the shape of a disk, which was
experimentally found to be a real one, we have good reason
to believe that it consists of some condensed or solid body,
the magnitude          of which may        be ascertained   by calculation.
For instance, we have seen, that its apparent diameter, the
 19th of October, 6h. 20', was not quite so large as that of
the third satellite of Jupiter.               In order therefore to have
some     idea  of    the    real  magnitude of our comet, we may ad
mit that its diameter at the time of observation was about
 1", which certainly cannot be far from truth. The diameter
of the third satellite of Jupiter, however, is known to have
a permanent disk,             such  as  may at any convenient time be
measured      with all the accuracy that can be used ; and when
the result    of   such a measure         has given us the diameter of
this satellite! it may by calculation be brought to the di
stance from the Earth at which, in my observation, it was
compared with the diameter of the comet, and thus more
                                                                 accuracy,

 accuracy,   if it should be required, may be obtained. The
following   result of my calculation, however, appears to me
quite sufficient for the purpose of general information. From
the perihelion distance 0 '647491, and the rest                          of the given
elements          of     the comet,         we find,      that its distance from the
ascending node on its orbit at the time of observation was
73° 45' 44" ; and having also the Earth's distance bom the
same node, and    the inclination of the comet's orbit, we
compute by these data the angle at the sun. Then by cal
culating in the next place the radius vector of the comet,
and having likewise the distance of the Earth from the sun,
we find by computation,                      that the distance        of   the comet from
the    Earth      at the time         of observation         was   1 "169192,     the mean
distanceof the Earth being 1. Now since the disk of the
comet was observed to subtend an angle of 1", which brought
to the mean distance of the Earth gives i' "169, and since
we also know that the Earth's diameter, which, according
to Mr. Dalby, is 7913*2 miles*, subtends at the same di
stance an angle oPl7"*2, we deduce from these principles the
real diameter of the comet, which is 538 miles.
      Having       thus investigated the magnitude                    of our comet,    we
may in the next place also apply calculation to its illumina
tion. The observations relating to the light of the comet
were made from the 4th of October to the 19th.          In all
which time the comet uniformly preserved the appearance of
a planetary disk fully enlightened by the sun : it was every
where equally bright, round, and well defined on its borders.
Now      as that part            of   the    disk which was then visible to us
could not possibly have a full illumination from the sun, I
have calculated the phases of the comet for the 4th and for
the 19th      ;   the result of which              is,   that on the 4th the illumi
nation      was 119° 45' 9", as represented                        in Plate     II.
                                                                                  fig. 4,
and that on the 19th                  it   had gradually increased           to 124° 22'

this been the case, the deficiency, I think, would have been
perceived, notwithstanding     the smallness of the object.
Those who are acquainted with my experiments on small
silver globules* will easily admit, that the same telescope
which could show the spherical form of balls, that subtend
ed only a few tenths of a second in diameter, would surely
not havf          represented    a cometary disk as circular, if it had
been as deficient as          are the figures which give the calculated
appearances.
     If these      remarks are well founded,            we are authorised to
conclude,          that the body     of the comet on its        surface is self-
luminous,          from whatever cause this quality may be derived.
The vivacity of          the light of the comet also had a much
greater resemblance           to the radiance       of the stars,    than to the
mild reflection of          the sun's beams from the moon,               which is
an additional support           of our former inference.
   The changes in the brightness of the small stars, when
they are successively immerged in the tail or coma of the
comet, or cleared from them, prove evidently, that they are
sufficiently dense to obstruct the free passage of star-light.
Indeed      if   the     tail or coma were composed            of particles that
reflect the light of the sun, to make them visible we ought
rather to expect that the number of solid reflecting parti
cles, required for this purpose, would entirelv prevent our
seeing any stars through them. But the brightness of the
head, coma, and tail alone, will sufficiently account for the
observed changes, if we admit that they shine not by reflec
tion, but by their own radiance; for a faint object projected
on a bright ground, or seen through     will certainly appear
                                                      it,
somewhat fainter, although its rays should meet with no ob
struction in coming to the eye. Now,                    as   in this case we are
sure   of    the    bright interposition of the parts of the comet,
but have no knowledge           of floating particles, we ought cer
tainly not to ascribe an effect to   hypothetical cause, when
                                                a
the existence of  one, quite sufficient to explain the phaeno-
mena,       is   evident.

of   the comet cannot be accounted                                  for from     reflection,    we
may draw the same conclusion,    with respect to the bright
ness of the head, coma, and tail, from the following consi
deration.   The observation of the 2d of February mentions,
that not only the head and coma were still very bright, but
that also the faint remains of the tail were still visible ; but
the distance of the comet from the Earth, at the time of
observation,        nearly 240 millions of miles*, which
                      was
proves, I think, that no light reflected from floating parti
cles could possibly have reached the eye, without supposing
the number, extent, and density                               of    these particles far greater
than what can be admitted.
     Mylast observation of the comet, on the 2 1st of February,
gives additional support to what has been said; for at the
time of this observation the comet was almost 2' 9 times
the mean distance               of   the sun from the Earth                    f.     It   was also
nearly 2-7 from the sun |. What chance then could rays
going to the comet from the sun, at such a distance, have
to be seen after reflection,                      by an eye placed                  at more than
275 millions of miles § from the comet?    And yet the in
stant the comet made its appearance    in the telescope, it
struck the eye as a very conspicuous object.
   The immense tails also of some comets that have been
observed,        and even that          of   the present one, the tail               of which,
on the 18th of October,                    was expanded                 over a   space of more
than nine millions                of miles             ||,   may be accounted for more
satisfactorily,   admitting them to consist of radiant mat
                       by
ter, such as, for instance, the aurora borealis, than when
we unnecessarily ascribe their light to reflection of the sun's     a
illumination thrown upon vapours supposed to arise from
the body of the comet.

XI.    On Commerce.         Being  a second      Communication    from
    Mr. Graham,         in Answer to our Correspondent       Lapis.
                             To Mr. Tilloch.
      SIR,
In    my last letter  I  endeavoured     to prove, and illustrate from
a variety   of articles,   that no country could produce all that
was necessary      for the comfort,      health, protection, and se
curity of   its inhabitants.     I likewise showed, by a reference
to very barren and uncomfortable situations, that the inha
bitants of such districts, so far from deserting those coun
 tries, were rather more attached          to the soil than the people
 of much    more favoured climates.           Without further recapi
 tulation,   I will pass on to another observation of your cor
 respondent Mr. Lapis. I will not call it an objection, be
 cause he does not give his opinion as positive; but he is
 apt to   think, from     the different languages spoken by the
 different nations of the world,       as  well  as  from the natural
 barriers of kingdoms, such as large rivers, long ridges of
 almost impassable mountains, and the still more extended
 ocean, which rolls its mighty waves between different coun
 tries, that the Author of the universe never intended tliat
 social intercourse between nations which I seemed to argue,
 but rather that they should be completely independent of
 each other.      I am much pleased with this observation, not
  so much on account        of giving   me an    opportunity of com
 municating my ideas on the subject, but as I consider it a
                                                                 matter

                               On Commerce.                             69
matter of great importance, as well as useful and curious
disquisition.       I hope some of your readers, who hare more
time and far superior abilities-, will favour us with a more
full illustration    of the subject.
    1n order to prevent        my being misunderstood, it may be
here necessary to observe that, in all I have written, 1 wish
to keep in view this idea or leading principle, (viz.) That
the Supreme Creator           of this world     is the universal parent
of all its inhabitants       ; that   they  are all alike his children ;
and that all his laws have in themselves a natural tendency to
promote the happiness          of  his creatures.    At   the same time
it is necessary     to observe     that the benevolent   Author of our
existence was fully aware of all the weaknesses as well as
imperfections of his creatures, and that it was impossible
for the whole inhabitants of this earth to be under one go
vernment     :   he has   therefore divided or separated different
countries     and kingdoms by such barriers as I have already
mentioned      :  yet, notwithstanding these gnat impediments,
and what would appear almost insurmountable difficulties,
we find that the ambition of man is not fully restrained ; for
some nations are constantly endeavouring to make inroads
on their neighbours : now, if this is the case under the pre
sent   formation      of this world, surely it would          have   been
much more so        if nature    had not fixed those strong bounda
ries.    While on the one hand I admit this argument in its
fullest latitude, on the other i can never enough admire the
kind benevolence of our Creator, in giving such diversity in
the productions       of  the   earth to different countries,    as to be
a very   strong incitement for friendly and social intercourse :
even the principle of curiosity, which has so powerful an
effect on the human mind, is a great inducement to visit
distant countries ; but this can never be done with either
pleasure or satisfaction,        unless   such  nations or f«:ople have
a  friendly communication             with each other.      T must like
wise observe how easily            a  social intercourse is maintained
with all    the    different parts of the earth when there is no
hostile intention          With what ease and facility can a few
merchant-vessels carry the various productions of this coun
try   to  another, and        bring    in exchange many articles of
                                       E3                          which

70                            On Commerce.
which we are in want         ? But how many difficulties attend the
fitting  out of an armed           fleet ! This requires all the united
strength and energies of the nation.               Thus, while the Su
preme Being       has  laid  strong     restraints  on all the more dan
gerous passions of men, he at the same time has placed
very powerful incitements in the human mind for sociability,
and from the diversified productions of the earth has made
it their  interest   to have a friendly intercourse with         one an
other, to behave         and   act   as  subjects of one supreme go
vernor, and    as  the children of one kind and benevolent parent.
Were I     to call in the aid     of the inspired writers, they would
appear in full force        in  favour   of my argument ; but I only
beg leave to recommend a serious perusal of the principles
of Christianity     to many who assume -that name, while their
whole- conduct         is  diametrically      opposite to its precepts,
 otherwise we should never have heartl of that impious and
unchristian maxim, Natural Enemies : from the general idea
of   the Devil  such a supposition would be natural, but to im
pute such to our merciful Creator is surely horrid impiety.
    1 hope it will not for a moment be supposed               that I here
 make any allusion to Mr. Lapis, —No, not in the least; but
 that there are such as I describe is but too evident. As                 I
 would not willingly overlook any argument or objection
 brought     forward by     Mr. Lapis, I will       beg leave to observe,
 that I fully agree with him in the manner in              which   he has
 stated the first beginning or principles          of commerce,     as be
 longing to one nation or individual country : but he could
 not perceive that the same was rendered necessary between
 different kingdoms. Now I think I have shown in a variety
 of instances, that there is a greater necessity for an inter
 change with different countries than with the distinct parts
 of the same nation ; and that, in the present system of the
 universe, every law or institution contrary to this order of
 nature may justly be said to counteract the benevolent dis
 pensations of the Creator.            The more I consider this sub
ject, the more I am convinced that it is a law or principle
 which runs through every department of society, from a
 single individual to that of nations. I am rather surprised
 that  Mr. Lapis should mention             (as part  of his objection   to
                                                                       my

 my statement) that that man who could excel in the manu
 facture of any article in his own country, had more merit
 than he who imported it from another : — most certainly he
 has ; and whoever will turn to my first Essay will find, that
to promote this          spirit amongst the inhabitants I state to be
one   of the principle objects         of a wise and patriotic politician
 or statesman.         I think I    have already proved       to a demon
 stration, that there is no country which can produce all that
may be said to be of use, comfort, &c, &c, to the inhabi
tants, — I mean as far as the productions of the soil are con
cerned.       I likewise contend          that   no exertions, either by
individuals      or     united     bodies,   can   bring the making or
manufacture       of every article to the same degree of perfection
to which it is sometimes brought in another country ; at least
such a phaenomenon has not yet appeared in the world, and,
for the happiness of the human race, I believe it never will.
Nations, like individuals, if they possessed within them
 selves  every requisite which they found necessary                or useful,
would be too much              puffed up with vain-glory, pride, and
presumption       ;  would      consider themselves as the only fa
vourites of Heaven, and look down with contempt on all their
fellow-mortals         as   beings of      an   inferior  order,    and   not
alike the children        of   the  same kir.d and benevolent parent.
Nations,      as well    as  individuals,    with all their wants, weak
nesses,    and imperfections,         are but too apt     to fall   into this
dangerous error : — How much more would it be so if every
country did, or even could, by its exertions supply all its
wants! Would not such be apt to forget the Creator, and to
exclaim,     " My     own right hand has gotten me the victory?"
I  am well aware that several foreign articles may justly be
termed    luxuries,      and that a very improper use is often made
of  them   ;   but  if  some people     will injure their health or hurt
their constitution,         by excess in that which ought only to be
used as a medicine,           or for the comfort      and  support of old
age,   the blame in all those         cases lies with     man, who only
abuses the bounties          of his benevolent Creator.        I  well know
that rice is more congenial to the support of the inhabitants
of those countries where it is the natural produce, than it
would be ts an Englishman               who has been        accustomed to

bread made from          flour*.    But,   even  in our    years   of   greatest
plenty, is not rice a very useful article ? From the gene
ral reasonableness of the price, even the lower orders of the
people find it pleasant, wholesome, and to them a luxuri
ous treat     :   only a few years         have   passed     away     since all
classes   of     people    were   happy to find in it        a substitute for
bread.      I   am apt     to think    that  the  Supreme Governor of
the world saw that it was necessary so to constitute the order
of nature, that years of scarcity might sometimes occur, to
teach ungrateful men the value              of his blessings,       as   well as
to show them the           necessity    of  a friendly     intercourse with
other countries : and I am persuaded that, if that social inter
course for which I contend were more generally adopted,
even famine would be divested of half its horrors.
     I have  already said, that      I  would neither recommend wine
nor foreign brandy, as a common beverage to an English
labourer, in preference to good malt liquor; but however
preferable this may be while youthful vigour blooms in the
countenance, and manly strength braces every nerve : when
old age weakens the limbs, bows down the body, and dries
up every source of pleasure, Who will deny that a change is
often useful, and that even a little wine as well                      as  some
other foreign cordial will make glad the heart of man, and
occasionally help to cheer the languor of declining years? If
this be a true state of the matter, (and I think it will readily
be admitted by every person              who has made observations on
these things,)       was I not justified in saying, and now re
peating,      that  it is a cruel policy to deprive the great bulk of
the people of any article which may be of such eminent use,
and more particularly when nature requires it most ? I my
self have known           several  instances where the' physician or
apothecary have recommended wine: the attending relatives
of the patient answered (while the sympathetic tear started
from their eyes)         "  O sir,  we have no money,          it is too dear,
   * It would be superfluous to enter into the disquisition whether the natural
produce of every country being more proper for the inhabitants than any
foreign substitute, did not proceed more from long habit than from any po
sitive law or order of nature : for it is a well known fact, that the stomach

we cannot afford           it." But of this I forbear.      I will only  beg
leave to mention one or two more articles, to show the great
difficulty,      if not   utter impossibility,     of  the people, even   in
the same country,            making some things equal in quality or
perfection at a very small distance from each other. London
porter is one article : — there is scarcely a town or village of
any note in the kingdom, where the making of porter, in
imitation of the London, has not been tried. Brewers and
malt-makers have been brought from the metropolis'at a
very great expense, no money has been spared, every ef
fort which         human       ingenuity   could    contrive has been ex
erted, — but       all in vain ; the difference even to a superficial
observer      is very evident.
    I   will only mention           one more  : — the  making  of Cheshire
and      Glocester      cheese,     seemingly    a  very  simple and well
known operation ; yet I have never seen what could be call
ed a tolerable imitation, and have known great exertions
made by some wealthy farmers, both from a principle of
emolument and curiosity ; but I have never known one who
succeeded       in any tolerable degree*.
     I  must now beg your indulgence while I offer a few re
marks on the bad policy of high duties.                    Whether I con
sider the present system as it affects the revenue, the morals,
or the health of the             people, it has the most dangerous ten
dency : it teems with evils of the greatest magnitude.                       I
will not here recapitulate the arguments I used in my first
Essay, but will add some others.
    To    remove      as  far  as  possible every alluring incitement to
transgress the laws of the country, to place at a distance
every temptation which might be supposed too strong for
the general virtue of the people, has always been the care
and study        of  every wise legislator,      much more than to make
 severe     laws or to inflict cruel punishments.               1 am fully
persuaded        that   there   is  no  person who has studied human
   *   I hope this will not be understood as meaning to damp ardour, or di
 spirit the exertions of those who wish to persevere in improvements : I only
mention the difficulty, without meaning to set bounds to human ingenuity or
 persevering exertions.
                                                                    nature,

nature, whether by reading or from his own observations in
the world, but will admit the wisdom and utility of this
maxim.
    I cannot here omit mentioning the great penetration and
humanity of our ancestors in framing many of our laws.
    The   law is   positive, " Thou shah not steal ;" but very
great difference is made between the crime of breaking locks
and bars to commit theft, and when cash or other valuables
are placed in very open exposed        situations  ;   and for this very
plain and humane reason, — the temptation is supposed               to be
much more strong in the one case than the other.                   Com
pare this with our present system of excise laws, which are
of a modern      date :  in these no allowance       is  made    for the
weakness of human nature placed under the strongest temp
tations, sometimes of poverty ; at other times the loss of
business, by being undersold by some neighbour who is
less scrupulous as to illicit connexions : — even that invaluable
privilege, trial by jury, is denied to the great bulk of the
people connected with the excise.             I have often contem
plated with      astonishment,    that the greatest      crimes which
 can disgrace    human creatures      are suffered    to be tried    by a
jurv   the nearest to the place where the crime is connected ;
but   this  is denied to every offender against the excise laws,
 unless he is able, and will submit to the enormous expense,
of having the cause tried in the Court of Exchequer at Lon
 don.    I could here adduce a great variety of arguments in
support of this proposition.        I wish to prove, as well as re
late, some circumstances, the unavoidable consequence of
the present system, which would astonish some, and excite
 feelings of pity in the breast of the most obdurate ; — but            I
 forbear this.
    Lest, however, some may think that I plead too much
for the weakness of humanity, I will only beg leave to men
tion two cases, which, I think, are in point.               If the good
 and pious    Agur   so earnestly  prayed against poverty,        lest he
 should put forth his hands to steal,       How      necessary   then to
 place, as far as possible, temptation from those whose minds
 are often litlls fortified either by piety or morality ! If he
                                                                     who

who well knew the heart            of man    closed this petition,   (" Lead
us not into temptation")         with   those which we are commanded
 to offer up to our Creator, need          I  use any further arguments      ?
 I  must not, however, omit mentioning a well-known fact,
 which     I am afraid is too little attended to by those who fix
such enormous duties to certain articles*, viz. There is not
 one amongst         a thousand who considers what is called illicit
 trade any breach either of religion or morality : if they pay
 the value of the article to those who sell, they think they
 have fulfilled every moral obligation.              I will now mention a
 few particulars to show how the health of the people is in
jured by the present system of high duties. I agree with
 Mr. Lapis,        (and  I believe it is generally admitted,) that malt
 liquor is the most wholesome and best beverage for the great
 bulk of the people : But, since the present enormous imposts,
 where can it be obtained genuine ? Far be it from me to im
 peach every brewer          of illicit practices ; but the public have
 had sufficient evidence, that, in different instances, various
 ingredients, and some of a very pernicious nature, besides
malt and hops have been made use of. But, supposing no such
practices to have been proved, is it not a well known fact, that
 not only in breweries, but likewise in distilleries, all the arts
 of chemistry, and the skill of the most eminent in the pro
 fession, are called into action ? To produce the colour most
 likely to please the eye, to obtain the flavour in most gene
 ral approbation, to cause the liquor to sparkle in the glass,
 raise a fine head or adhere to the sidts of the pot, are, with
 many other objects, constantly exercising the mind of the
 operator ; and to obtain such on the easiest terms, or at the
 least expense, his constant aim and study.                It is really asto
 nishing how         easily some of these objects can be produced by
 artificial means, which ought only to be the effect of the
 genuine materials from which the liquor is made.                      To ob
 tain any foreign liquor          in  a true    genuine  state   is  likewise
 very difficult       and uncertain ; for       in this the temptation is

 equally strong. Even allowing that the first importer has
strength of mind sufficient against all the allurements of gain,
 the article goes through so many hands before it reaches
 general consumption,           that all the well known practices of
mixing, (particularly when the flavour is strong,) reducing,
 and again bringing to full proof, are too often carried to a
 great extent.
    Even wine is well known to be often so much adulterated,
 that it is a  mixture of no person can tell what. When we
 consider that this is often used as a medicine, how danger

    Need I recall the attention of your readers to the various
means used to adulterate tea before the reduction of the duty ?
Now it    is nearly back to its former high price, the very same
consequences will naturally follow *, as soon as any of the
countries on the continent shall be in a situation to get tea
from China so as it may be smuggled into this country. What
with smuggling from abroad, adulteration at home, the high
price lessening the consumption, the diminution of the re
venue must follow. I should now point out some of the bad
effects which high duties have on the morals of the people 5
but the evils are so numerous, and the consequences so fa
tal to the peace of society as well as individuals, that the
subject would require a separate Essay, and I have already
intruded too much on your indulgence. Wishing every suc

XII.      Memoir upon the Vineyards and Wines of Champagne
     in France : Written in answer to certain Queries circulated
     by   M. Chaptal. By M. Germon, of Epernay*.
                                 PRELIMINARIES        f.
The         ancient province of Champagne, now divided into
two departments under the names of La Marne and La Haute-
Marne,         has been       long celebrated as the vineyard of France.
      There are two kinds of wines which distinguish this di
strict.
      White wines         :  called Riviere de Marne wines.
      Red wines        : called Monlagne de Rlieims wines.
      The white wines are produced from vineyards situated in
 the     valleys      and     upon the sides of the hills in Epemay,
 Dizy, Avenay,              Ciamant, Lemesnil, Monthelon, Chouilly,
 Moussy, &c. : but in consequence of one of these varieties
 of nature, for which we cannot always account, the estate
 of Cumieres, in the midst of so many vineyards celebrated
 for white wines, and under the same exposure, produces red
.wines only, and of a quality far superior to the above wines.
       Among all the vineyards on the river Marne, the can
 tons of Hautyillers,              Mareuil, Cumieres,        and Epernay,       are
  the     most advantageously situated : they extend along the
  river Marne, with this distinction, that the quality of the
  wine falls off in proportion as the vineyard is distant from
  the river : for this reason Hautyillers and Ay have always
  enjoyed a preference overEpcrn3y and Pierry ; and the latter
  over Cramant, Lemesnil, &c, and these last over Mon
  thelon,       Moussy, &c.
        South exposures produce upon the banks of the Marne ex
  cellent white wines, but their declivities and posterior parts,
  which are called the mountains of Rheims, although situated

       t The numerous       facts contained in this Memoir render it truly valuable:
   although the author expresses himself in the language of a good practical
   cultivator, he does not always display the accuracy of a modern chemist.

   ;ect ; and it forms the materials of tfi. Chaptal's projected work upon " L-A1
   de ftire  It liin."      Note of the French Editor.
                                                                                  in

  in  general towards the north, and almost always to the east,
  also give red wines   of a  good quality, and   of a fine  taste and
  aromatic flavour.
     The   slope which overhangs Rheims       is divided    according
  to the quality of its wines ; hence we have wines of the
  mountain, of the lower mountain, and of the estate St.
 Thierry.
     The mountain comprehends Verzy, St. Basle, Verznay,
 Mailly, Taissy, Ludes, Chigny, Rilly, and Villers- Allerand ;
 and among these vineyards, the most esteemed are Verzy,
 Verznay, and Mailly.        The rest, although very good, are of
 a different quality.
     The vineyard of Bouzy, which terminates the chain or
 the horizon between south and east, and which, therefore,
 belongs to the two divisions, ought not to be omitted.              It
 produces excellent, fine, and delicate red wines, which,
 from its exposure, participate in the good qualities of Verz
 nay and the good red wines of La Marne.
     The lower mountain        comprehends a great quantity of
vineyard countries;      among which we may distinguish Cha-
 mery, Ecueil, and Ville Demange : this last place in parti
cular, when the season is good, yields wine which will keep
for ten or twelve years.
    The lower mountain        extends  to  the   banks of the river
Aisne. As the wines it       produces are  of  a middling     quality,
it scarcely requires to be particularized.
    The district of Saint Thierry has taken its name, with re
spect    to  its wines and vineyards, from a large extent of
grounds containing large vineyards, such as Saint Thierry,
Trigny, Chenay, Villefranqueux, Douillon, Hermonville,
and produce very agreeable red wines of a pale colour, very
much in request by the dealers.
    But the wine properly called Clos Saint Thierry, and
coming from the archbishopric of Rheims, is the only wine
which unites the rich colour and flavour of Burgundy to the
sparkling lightness of Champagne. Clos Saint Thierry holds
the same rank among Champagne wines, that Clos-vougeot
does among those      of Burgundy.
    In  the  enumeration of the vineyards of the mountain,

    some readers may perhaps                        expect to find          Sillery mentioned,
    once so remarkable for red and white wines                                        :    the truth        is,
    that Sillery wine in great measure composed of the wines
                                  is    a
    produced in the territories of Verznay, Mailly, and Saint
    Basle, once made,                  by   a   particular process,              by       the marechale
    d'Eslrees, and for this reason long known         the name of                    by
    Vins de la Marechale. At the revolution this estate was di
    vided, and sold to different rich proprietors of Rheims     the                                    :
    senator of Valencia, however, the heir to    great part of this         a
    Vineyard, neglects no means                       of restoring Sillery                 to its former
    reputation.
     Series      of questions put                M. Chaptal, with their answers.
                                                by
    I.    Which       is    tlie most       advantageous Exposure for the Vine?
      The most             advantageous              exposure          for the vine            is,   without
    contradiction,           the south and the east                   ;   but   it   has been ascer
    tained that certain advantages of soil and the nature of the
,   plant must also concur    otherwise various districts, such as
                                            :
    Damery, Vanteuil, Reuil, &c, with the same exposure and
    climate, and also watered                        by    the   Marne, would enjoy                        the
    same celebrity as Cumieres,                           Hautyillers,          and       Ay.        It must
    be confessed that the former districts produce inferior kinds
    of wine     ;      remains to be decided whether we ought to
                      but    it
    ascribe this difference to the culture, the plants, or the soil.
    II.    Are       the high Exposures,                  the middle Elevations,                      or the
                    lower Grounds,              best adapted          for Vineyards?
          Of all situations,           the middle grounds are most esteemed                                  :
    the heat being more concentrated in .them, they are exempt
    from the variations of the atmosphere which prevail on
    eminences, and from the humidity and exhalations which
    issue from the lower          regions: the elaboration of the sap or
    juice      is   therefore more complete    the middle grounds.

the channels of vegetation, when mists, humidity, or dew,

IV.    Describe the Nature                of   the Ground or          Soil which pro
                              duces the best           Wine.
  Next       to exposure, the nature    of the soil and of the ground
influences         the    qualityof the wine. It must be admitted,
however, that            grounds with a northern exposure produce
wines of a generous and spirituous description ; while an
other exposure, perhaps to the south, yields a poor and com
mon sort of wine. It is therefore to the salts and the juices
of the earth, combined with the influence of the atmosphere,
that we  must ascribe the goodness and qualities of soils
adapted for vineyards.
  The most proper soil for vines is a sandy granitic earth,
neither compact, nor too thick, nor clayey : frequently in
the best exposures, we meet with stony soils, which give
very strong wines; but warm and dry seasons are requisite in
these cases,                 maturity : beneath these stony
                     and a necessary
soils, there are clayey and unctuous parts, and "plenty of
springs, which conduce to the elaboration of the juice.
  In       general       throughout        Champagne             the soils proper for
vines rest upon banks                  of chalk. The vine, indeed,           comes up
slowly in this kind           of soil, but when it               has fairly taken root
it grows      to perfection        :    the heat      of   the    atmosphere is tem
pered and modified by the coolness                         of
                                                         the     the chalky beds,
moisture of which is constantly sucked up by the vegetative
channels of the vine-plant.

                         V. How         is the   Vine planted ?
  In November or December, when                            the season admits      of   it,
the vine     is
           planted            by
                         making an oblong hole or furrow,
one foot and    half in depth,
                     a                           by
                                 two or three feet in length                           :
the plant   introduced into
              is               and covered with earth, slop
                                           it
ing   it   in such    a   way as to uncover only two or three inches

                         of Champagne in France.                        Si
 of the extremity of the plant, to which a horizontal and
 erect position is also given.          Each hole of this kind is one
 foot and a half from the one adjoining, and on the same
 line in vineyards where the soil is rich ; two feet being al
lowed in light soils. An interval of three feet is left between
the rows       of the plants,    'and care is taken when a new row is
begun     :  the plants must not be placed perpendicularly,           and
 directly above each other.
     VI. What        is the Way in which the Shoots are made ?
    The plants      are inserted    into turfs, or in longuetles. The.
longuette is a mere            naked twig, which had been left the
year preceding,         and which is now       carefully raised and de
 tached, leaving the young roots behind k.
    The turf plant, or marcotte, consists in digging up a turf
 in the marshes, and introducing into it in spring, by means
of a hole made in the middle of the turf, the longuette or
 slip intended to be planted : this shoot with its earthy ap
 pendage is then fixed in the ground, sloping it as usual :
the root is formed in the course of the year, and with a
pruning-knife         the longuette is cut close to the       top of the
shoot, and they are then removed by men, or on the backs
of animals, in order to be afterwards planted : this last way
is the most expensive, but it is the surest, and advances
the vine very fast in respect to vegetation.
    One hundred of longuettes or bare slips cost four or five
livres, and turf plants cost from 12 to 14 livres.
    But   as two longuettes are requisite for each           hole-or fur
row, when they plant in this way there is a trifling              saving,
although the other method is far preferable.
                    VII.    Is Grafting    advantageous   ?
    Grafting      is not in general use, except in the vines be
longing       to the vine-dresser3 themselves,         and in the large
plant   :   these vines     when grafted     become yellow,     and  lan
guish.       The graft remains for       some years exposed to the air,
humidity, and to bad management of the labourer, and in
ihort to all the intemperance of the climate.

        VIII.     How long does a good Vine Plant last ?
   A  good   vine     plant lasts 50 or 60 .years, and frequently
longer, according to the care which has been taken of it.
   A  vine plant is deteriorated generally by the bad manage
ment of the vine-dressers with respect to the shoots or slips:
if they are not sunk deep enough in the ground, the vine
plant becomes overwhelmed with roots, which at last form
a solid cake, and absorb all the juices from the ground : the
vine being thus incapable          of shooting, the evil ought     to be
instantly remedied.
IX.  What Kind of Grapes            are best adapted for   White Wine?
   Black and white grapes           are planted indiscriminately  in the
same vineyard       :   and this is perhaps     wrong ; for the term   of
maturity is not the same with both kinds of grape. The
reason assigned for this practice is, that wine made from
black grapes alone would be too vinous, and would become
muddy [sujet d tachtr) in hot seasons ; while wine made
from white grapes would be too soft : the latter kind of
grapes    would      be too     soft,   as containing     more mucilage
 {muquenx)    .
X. Is   the Black Grape preferuble            to the While ?— State  the
                         Cause   of this Superiority.
   There is not much variety in the grapes             of Champagne.
   The black       are generally      preferred to the white grapes for
several   reasons     :    In  the first place, the black grapes resist
much better        the rains and frost        so common about vintage
time.     Secondly, because          there is more vinosity and fine
ness in the black grape, and it gives more of what is called
body to the wine : the white on the contrary is too muci
laginous,    renders      the   wine soft, and exposes it to become
yellow, or      to thicken.
   There    are whole         cantons,    however,    such  as Chouilly,
Cramaut,      Avise, Bisseuil,        &c., where     there are but very
few black grapes, and yet their wine is in high estimation.
XI.   Which of the Exposures is most subject to the Hoar
                            frosts of Spring ?
   The effects of frost are only to be feared at sunrise : the
                                                                 eastern

                      of Champagne in France.                           83
 eastern exposures are consequently         most apt       to suffer, al
 though it   has   been   ascertained that vine plants freeze          in
 every exposure.
    Thus, all  the preservative   methods hitherto indicated, such
as fumigations,     or poles armed with long branches of foliage
capable   of being    agitated by the air, are mere reveries of the
imagination : they have been employed indeed in small en
closures; but they never preserved a single cluster of grapes,
and are incapable of being applied to a large vineyard.
        XII.   At what Period is     the   Vine   to be pruned   ?
    About the     end  of February or beginning of March,             the
most essential     operation must be performed, namely, that
of cutting the plant.       When it is very strong, two branches
or stumps only are left.
         XIII.   How many Eyes         are left  in  the  Plant ?
    Three eyes upon each branch           : when the vine is weak,
one branch only is cut off.
XIV. At     what Height    from   the Ground is the      Plant pruned ?
    When the plant     is young and the rind is not marked with
old prunings, the plant is cut at the height of three or four
inches : the vine-dressers cut higher, because they frequently
cultivate three branches, and leave four eyes.
       XV.   To what Height is the Vine allowed to rise ?
    Not  higher than a foot and a half, — to avoid dilating the
sap too much.
XVI. At     what Season     does  the first Operation in the       Vine
                           yards commence ?
    After having pruned the vine, the first occupation is that
of hoeing: this operation consists in digging up the earth
around the plants, so     as to uncover their roots for a moment,
and detach    the earth from     them which        may have become
clotted ; the hoe being always       inserted   into the earth about
a foot from the plant.
  . At the end of March, or beginning of April, when the
thaws have softened the ground, the hoeing commences.

XVII.    What     is the Period        of Planting    by Slips or Cuttings  P
    This kind of planting           is performed at the time when the
vine is planted.
XVIII.     In what Manner          is this   Kind of Planting managed?
    In pruning, the           vine-dresser reserves, in the barest and
most sterile places,          certain slips, upon which he leaves only
two or three stalks,          according to the strength of the slip :
the hole or furrow            being made, the slip is gently inclined,
by disengaging the roots, and by means of a pair of tongs
the stalks are held while placing in the furrow, at from four
to six inches distance from each other : the slip being thus
fixed at the depth of a foot or thereabout, a hand-baskelfull
of manure      is thrown at the root          of  the slip ; the hole is then
filled up with natural earth in a loose manner, in order to ad
mit of the two or three stalks sending out their shoots with
out being bruised.
 XIX.     How many Operations are there to                  he performed   be
            tween the Pruning and the Vintage                Season ?
    The primings being over, as the same vines are not pruned
 every year, and even in those which have been pruned the
 earth has not been thoroughly               stirred, the vines are trimmed
 at the beginning        of May      :  this trimming is called lalourage
 au bourgeon,       and is followed by the tyeing up of the vine
 plants.
 XX.     Which      is Ike most favourable Moment            for Tyciiig  and
                               Paring the Vine?
     While the vine is in flower, it must not be touched : it
 must be pared when the flower has nearly passed away, and
  at the height indicated in Art. 'XV.: it must afterwards
  be tied in    such     a   way as to envelop the slip, without in
 juring the circulation of the air or the growth of the suckers.              \
     Finally ; about the middle of August, in order to clear
  away the grass from the roots              of the plant, and to raise up
  the grapes    which       may have fallen to the ground, a third and
  last trimming takes place.
     The following         is the routina practised       in the vineyards of
  Champagne       :
                                                                      1. They

XXI. How is it ascertained that the Grape is sufficiently ripe,
       in order to commence the Labours of the Vintage ?
    At  the end   of September, or      later if   the season has been
backward, — before proceeding        to the labours     of the vintage,
in order     to obtain the fruit     at ihe most complete state       of
ripeness,

   The skin or pellicle of the grape tender, and not brittle
when chewed ;
    When     a seed can be easily   detached     from the juice of the
grape   : which should in its turn present a vinous and trans
parent appearance, without having any green in it ;
   Wherf the grape stones are brown, dry, and not glutinous.

XXTI. What Precautions           are  necessary     for managing    the
          Grapes   so as not to injure the W kite Wines ?
   Many precautions, even of detail, are necessary in making
white wine.
   These consist in carefully picking the ripest and soundest
grapes from all withered or bruised grapes ; they are then
put into panniers, and covered with cloths to prevent the
effects of the sun's rays, and to avoid fermentation.
   The panniers thus covered, being put upon the backs of
horses, are conveyed to the press ; into which they are not
emptied, however, until after sun-set. From twenty to forty
panniers full are put under the press at a time : the contents
of two panniers produce half a piece of wine : forty pan
niers yield nine or ten pieces of white wine, and each piece
contains two hundred bottles.

"   T
    1   thank            you for your early insertion of my former com
munication,              as by that means I was favoured by Mr. Davy's
observations on it in his lecture yesterday.
    "It seems that I misunderstood him : it is fit therefore
that I should state that T did so. He did not assert (in reference
to the experiment of the decomposition- of the sulphate of
potash) that the sulphuric acid and the potash repelled each
other in consequence of being in opposite states of electri
city, but in consequence of being brought into the same state.
    "   I             him to say that the decomposition
            had understood
took place in consequence of the natural electricities of the
sulphuric acid and the potash being reversed by means of
the Galvanic apparatus; and I was less disposed to suspect
that I was wrong, from observing the following passage                                      ir;

   ferred,   upon this neutral salt being placed in the Galvanic

   other of them, is brought into an electrical stare opposite to
   its natural one; consequently, into the same state as the body
  with which it was united:            hence   a repulsion ensues, and the
   compound body is decomposed.                 This  is  Mr. Davy's expla

  proposed explanation may be considered (which is not in th$
  least affected by my having misunderstood Mr. Davy's ex

 to be, that we must suppose that                 in the first instance one
 only of the parts         of   the compound       body is affected by the
 battery, and has its natural state of electricity reversed ; and
 that, ultimately, both are affected ; for, the experiment being
 completed, the acid is found to be positive, and the potash
 negative.
      " Is there,    however, any repulsion in the case? Should we
 not rather consider it          as a case of chemical decomposition,
 in which the attraction between the two constituents of the
 salt is overcome by more powerful affinities               ?

         SIR,
Y~our correspondent 'Auditor,' notwithstanding his                       pene
tration,     has,    I think,      misunderstood Professor Davy's rea
soning     on   electrochemical       attraction.     His remarks on the
inconsistency of the theory and its explanation, such as he
conceived them to be,               must naturally occur jto every consi
derate     reader.
      But if my memory          does not deceive me,      Mr. Davy     stated  :
*f   An acid     that is artificially   rendered    positive will not com-

bine with an alkali that is naturally positive, and vice versa.*'
Hence it is evident that, if the electrical state of either the
acid or alkali     in the neutral salt is changed, they can no
longer    remain   in  union, as they instantly exert towards each
other a repulsive power proportionable to the inverse energy
of their natural electrical affinity.        This principle of de
composition, which Mr. Davy merely mentioned in the lec
ture referred to by Auditor, was fully explained and illus
trated in a subsequent one.
    He showed, by refined applications of his principles, that
in the decomposition of a neutral salt in solution the order
of the arrangement varies.         When copper wires, which rea
 dily combine with oxygen, and are easily soluble in an acid,
 are used to transmit the electricity, the positive wire attracts
 the oxygen and acid, and repels the hydrogen and alkali.
But when platina wires        are employed, which have but a very
 slight affinity for oxygen and acid, the phoenomenon is very
 different.    Oxygen and acid, as before, are attracted by the
positive pole; but as they are incapable of uniting with the
platina,    they instantly receive by contact its electric state,
 and exercise    a repulsive power towards it : the same effect
 takes place with the hydrogen and alkali at the negative pole.
    If we follow this course of reasoning, it is evident that the
 gaseous     oxygen and hydrogen must diffuse themselves in
 thcaliiiosphere as they are liberated from their combina
tions, and the acid and potash must find their states of rest
 at a little distance from the positive and negative poles.

 January        12.—The conclusion        of Mr. Davy's Bakerian
 Lecture was read.        In this part of his communication Mr.
 Davy    gave an account      of the decomposition of the fluoric
 acid ; detailed some      curious experiments upon the muriatic
                                                             acid ;

                            Royal  Society.                      89
acid  ; and   entered   into  various new views connected with
chemical theory.
    Potassium burns,     as  Mr. Davy discovered, in fluoric acid
gas, and separates its basis, which combines with the potash
formed, or with the potassium, if this last be in excess; and
this compound of the fluoric basis, and the alkali or alka
line basis, produces fluate of potash by combustion,          or by
the action of water.
   Common muriatic acid gas, Mr. Davy has discovered, con
tains at least a third of its weight of water. Mr. D. has not
been able to procure it free from water in an uncombined
state ; but he has obtained combinations of muriatic acid
with phosphorous acid, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, and
with phosphorus, free from moisture; and these compounds,
even when fluid,      though constituted by matter supposed to
be intensely acid,     do not act on litmus paper nor dissolve
alkalis,   and are non-conductors      of electricity ;  but a very
small quantity of water develops their energies, renders them
conductors, and makes them capable of violently acting
upon litmus and alkaline bodies.            With these compounds
•of muriatic acid, potassium detonates violently even at com
mon temperatures.       The energy of the explosion has hitherto
prevented     Mr. Davy from examining the results; but he
thinks it probable that the muriatic acid may undergo change
or decomposition in the experiment.
    In the course of his general inquiries Mr. Davy examined
an experiment, (lately published in Mr. Nicholson's Journal)
on the production of ammonia, from a pyrophorus moist
ened with water, by Professor Woodhouse; and states that
he has found his results accurate; but that the formation of
the volatile alkali depends upon nitrogen absorbed from the
atmosphere by the charcoal employed.
    Mr. Davy, by exposing the pyrophorus whilst cooling
to hydrogen gas, found that no ammonia could then be pro
duced by the affusion of water.
    Mr. Davy, from experiments made upon a large scale,
 confirms his former analysis of potash,     as consisting of about
 14 of oxygen to 86 of metal.
    He   defends  the theory of Lavoisier against the opinions of
                                                               some

    Jan. 19 and 26. — A. Marsden, esq., Vice-president, in
 the chair. Part of a long paper, illustrated with several draw
 ings by Mr. Troughton, mathematical instrument maker,
 was read, describing his instruments and methods of gra
 duating quadrants, sections of circles, and other instruments
 for mathematical and philosophical experiments. Mr.Trough-
 ton's theoretical method consists in making out a table of
 errors, by which    means he corrects    the dots  made on the
 graduated circle,   previous to the application   of his instru
 ment for dividing it into 190 degrees.      Of this instrument,
 invented by his brother, and improved by himself, no cor
 rect idea can be given without the drawings, which unfold
 the whole secret  of  the author's superior mode    of manufac
 turing mathematical instruments.

    At the meeting of this Society on the 14th of January,
 Dr. Thomas Thomson read an interesting description and
 analysis of a particular variety of copper-glance from North
 America.
    At the same meeting Dr. John Barclay communicated
tome highly curious observations which he had made on the
caudal vertebrae of the Great Sea Snake, (formerly men
tioned) which exhibit in their structure some beautiful pro
visions of Nature, not hitherto observed in the vertebrae of
any other animal.
    And Mr. Patrick Neill read      an ample and interesting ac
count of this new animal,     collected from different sources,
especially letters of undoubted authority, which he had re
ceived from the Orkneys.       He stated, however, that owing
to the tempestuous season, the head, fin, sternum, and
dorsal vertebrae, promised some weeks ago to the University
Museum of Edinburgh,         had   not yet arrived  ; but that he
had received a note from Gilbert Meason, esq., (the gen
tleman on whose estate in Stronsa the sea snake was cast,)
intimating that they might     be expected    by the earliest ar
rivals from Orkney. In the     mean time, he submitted to the

proposed for this new genus was Halsydrus, (from d}.; the

to be the Soe-Ormen           described above half a century ago, by
Pontoppidan,          in his Natural History of Norway, it w as sug
gested that its specific name should be                  H.   Pontuppidani.

,                                 EARTHCIUAKE.
The    following account of a shock of an earthquake felt at
Dunning, in Perthshire, on the 1 8th of January, about two
o'clock A M. is given by Mr. Peter Martin, surgeon, iu
punning. — He was coming home at the time on horseback,
when his attention was suddenly attracted by a seemingly
subterraneous noise, and his horse immediately stopping, he
perceived the sound to proceed from the north-west.   After
continuing the space of half a minute, it became louder and
Jouder,          and apparently nearer, when,            all on a sudden, the
earth gave a perpendicular heave, and with a tremulous wav
ing motion seemed to roll or move in a south-east direction.
The noise was greater during the shock than before     and                   it,
for some seconds  after   was so loud,
                                  it   that made   the cir        it
cumjacent mountains reecho with the sound    after which,          ;
    in   the course   of about half    a    minute,   gradually died away.
                                                        it
    At this time      the atmosphere         was calm, dense, and cloudy,
    and for some hours before and after there was not the least
    motion in the air. Fahrenheit's thermometer, whenexamined
    (about half an hour after the shock), indicated temperature        a
    of           below the fieezing poiut of water.

    Natural History. —At            day- break on the 3d of January
 1809, an enormous fish was descried at half cable's length
 from Penryn quay, steering towards the town, and three boats,
 under the direction of captain Dunn, were manned to attack
 him  :  the first he enclosed, as it were    in  a  pond, formed by
 a circular curve from head to tail, without doing any            injury.
A   man then courageously cut a hole in the dorsal fin, through
which he rove a hooked rope. Upon feeling this, the fish
attempted to put to ssa, but being diverted by some hard
blows on his snoul,        he sheered towards the Falmouth          road.
A   three-inch rope doubled was then parbuckled round him,
which    he instantaneously snapped. A hawser from the quay
was next applied to him ; when, after dragging a sloop's
anchor, tearing up a moorstone post on the quay, and stav
ing a boat, he was brought into shoal water, and, it being
ebb tide, subdued. He was afterwards towed round by three
boats, and with the tackle       of a sand-barge     and the exertions
of 20 men     and   three horses, he was drawn upon the slip           of
colonel Heame's quay, where he remained a few davs for the
amusement of the curious.           He measures 31 feet long, 19
feet round,     9| feet high,   T\  feet mouth.      It proved   to be a
male    of  the  Squalus genus, being       the  Squalus maximus,
the Basking Shark, or Sun-fish of Pennant.               It abounds in
the Irish Channel and on the west coast of Scotland. It is
generally seen in pairs. Accordingly the mate of this animal
was observed in St. Keverne Bay, next day, by the Wal-
singham packet.                         -
   Mr. Taylor the Platonist announces, that he has made
some very important discoveries in that branch of the mathe
matics relating to infinitesimals and infinite series.               One
of  these discoveries consists      in   the ability   of ascertaining
the last term of     a  great  variety of infinite series, whether
such series     are composed     of whole numbers or fractions.
Mr. Taylor further announces,           as  the result   of  these dis
coveries, that he is able to demonstrate, that all the leading
propositions in Dr. Wallis's Arithmetic of Infinites are false ;
and that the doctrine      of Fluxions is founded on false princi
ples, and,    as  well  as the  Arithmetic of Infinites, is a most
remarkable instance of the possibility of deducing true con

in the Menioires de l'Institut, vol. vi., and                      M. Daubisson
in the Journal des Mines, February 1807,                           have        recently
brought to perfection, the method                of measuring altitudes by
means of the barometers.          Their memoirs
                                           are highly deserv
ing of being     translated             it is at least certain,
                                into English        :
however, that it would be agreeable to the geologists of this
country, and to those of foreign nations who make use of
instruments graduated in the English way, if the second of
the two methods       of   M.   Ramond was reduced into the mea
surements of this country. This second method has the ad
vantages over the first of being the most expeditious, and at
the same time almost imperceptibly exact.      I have under
taken this task, and shall       be   happy to      see    it inserted         in your
Journal, if you find it worthy of publication.
   The principal part of this work consisted in the reduction
of the table of M. Ramond ; the object of which         to have       is,
a view in calculation, to the gravity at di-fTerent parallels of
latitude at which we take observations. His second method
abridges   considerably his first; and, in my opinion, all an
tecedent   methods where exactitude was the object in view.
I subjoin this table calculated upon the co-efficient 10057 -5
fathoms, which corresponds to 18393 metres, being that of
M.   Ramond.
    You will   perceive    that the result        of    the calculation,             ac
cording to my reduction, gives             the    altitudes in fathoms                in
place of giving them in feet as        in   England. In this trifling
change,    Ifind two advantages        :    In the first place renders    it
the calculation   alittle shorter;       and secondly,         it   presents the
altitudes in numbers more easily fixed in the imagination
than more complicated numbers. In short, we cannot form

a very distinct idea of the height of a mountain, when we
state it as 19000 feet, whereas three miles and some fathoms
will impress the real height much more strongly on the mind.
  The examples subjoined show the method; and I presume
will require no further illustration to those who are ac
quainted with logarithms.     I shall only observe, that in re
ducing the metre to fathoms, I have made use of the report
which  I found in the Memoirs of the Royal Institution,
vol.      i.,
       namely, l^so-SZl English inches and with respect to    :
the thermometer,   have made use of the well known re

scale comprehended between the freezing and                           boiling points   :
thus in calculation              the degrees of Fahrenheit should be               di
minished            32°    for the degrees above the freezing point, and
on the contrary with respect to the degrees                           below melting
ice, they must be retrenched from 32°.

         Note — In the first        of the following examples have ap    I
plied to the least height               of the barometer, the difference of
 the thermometers                 which   are attached       to them, because      the
thermometer was lower than in the other.

     tlw Structure      of   Rocks,      on   the Surface of the basaltic
     Country in the Counties of Derry and Antrim. Addressed
     to Humphry Davy, Esq,, Sec, if. S.                        By William
     Richardsos,         D.D. *
       SIR,
A REauEST you will               be so good as to lay before the Royal
Society the        following observations on            the Natural  History
of that part of Antrim, (contiguous                  to the   Giant's Cause
way,)      which you and        I  examined so carefully together. I
know not       any country that deserves so well to have its facts
faithfully recorded ; from the important conclusions to which
they lead.
     The basaltic area (taken in its whole extent) comprehends
the greater part of Antrim, and the east side of Derry to a
considerable depth.
     Tn a geological point of view, nature             f  has been very kind
to this district, for not content with assembling together in
a small space so many of her curious productions, and ar
ranging them with more regularity and steadiness than in
any other country described, she has condescended occa
sionally to withdraw the veil, and lay herself open to view,
often exhibiting a spectacle equally gratifying to the admirer
of magnificence,          and     to   the   curious naturalist,    who can
here, by simple inspection,                trace the arrangements which
are to be discovered elsewhere, only by penetrating beneath
the surface of the earth.
     As soon     as we     enter    the   basaltic area, we begin to per
ceive traces of these arrangements ; as we advance further
north, they increase; and in the tract neir the shore, and
especially at the island of Batldin, which seems to have
come fresher from the hand                of nature    than the rest  of our
area,     the stratification      of  the whole is perfectly visible,    and
    * From                  Transactions for 180S.
            Philosophical
    f By the word nature, which frequently occurs in the course of this Me
 moir, I always mean, according to Ray's definition, the wisdom of God in
 the creation of the world.
                                                                          the

                    On   the basaltic Surface,   &ic.               103
the nature of the several strata laid open to us at their abrupt
and precipitous terminations.
   To   the     southward    we   perceive  the  distinctive   features
abate,   and     wear away ; the basaltic stratification indeed re
mains, but is no longer displayed to us in the same manner;
the neat, prismatic,          internal construction of the strata,
which occurs so frequently on, and near, the coast, is scarcely
to be met with at a distance from it ; a rude columnar ap
pearance     is all we find, and that but rarely.
   It  is at the     periphery of our area, and especially at its
northern side, that every thing is displayed to the greatest
advantage ; here we have perpendicular facades often con
tinuous     for miles, and      every  separate  stratum completely
open to examination.
   Of these facades, four are more distinguished by their
grandeur and beauty than the rest, Magilligan Rock, Cave
Hill,   Bengore, and Fairlwad.
   The two former are at the extreme points of the north
west diagonal of our area, and nearly forty miles asunder               ;
they are at the summits of mountains, and accessible by
land.
   The precipitous faces of Fairlwad and Bengore, to which
I had the pleasure of attending you, and which are visible
only from the sea, are the most beautiful, and the most
curious ; for the strata, which at Magilligan and Cave Hill,
are all nearly similar, at F'airhead and Bengore are much di
versified. Of Fairhead I have already published an account
in Nicholson's Journal for December, 1801, and I now
propose to execute an intention which I have had for some
years of giving a minute account of Bengore.
   I am aware that it will be extremely difficult to convey a
clear and adequate idea of an assemblage of 16 strata, (for
such is the number of which our promontory is composed,)
appearing and disappearing at various altitudes, yet retaining
each its own proper place, and forming together a most
beautiful and regular whole, though never considered as such
before.
   But   as   I have  the aid   of  very correct views    of the most
important parts       of  the   facade, to the accuracy and fidelity
                                      G4                              of

104             On the basaltic Surface     of the      Counties
of which I                obtained your testimony — I shall
                have already
venture to proceed, for I am anxious to bring into notice the
most complete exposure of the internal structure of a district,
that I have seen or read of ; as there is little likelihood that
any other  person will enjoy the opportunities which I have
had for so many years, of exploring this interesting part of
our coast, through        a   turbulent sea, and rapid tides.
       Description    of ike Promontory          of'   Ben gore, and its
                               Stratification.
   This promontory commences              at the termination        of Bush-
foot Strand,   where the coast, the general               direction of which
for several  miles had been due east and west, turns to the
north-east, and, after being cut into several semi -circular bays,
deflects to the S.S.E. and near the old castle of Dunseverick,
resumes     its former rectilineal and nearly eastern direction.
   The promontory occupies the interval between Dunseve
rick, and the Black Rock, at the end of Bushfool Strand,
about four English miles; the facades commence at Black
Bock, and increase in height until we reach Pleskin, where
the perpendicular part at the summit       70 feet, and the
                                                        is   1
precipitous part from the bottom of the pillars to the sea 200.
As we proceed on from Pleskin to Dunseverick, the height
gradually abates, and    finally reduced to about 100 feet.
                              is
   In this whole space, wherever the precipice accurately          is
perpendicular, the several strata arc easily distinguished from
each other, but where the slightest obliquity prevails,   grassy        a
covering    formed that effectually conceals all beneath
             is                                                                  it
                                                                                  ;
hence the face of the precipice seems much diversified the                  ;
columnar strata in some places only exhibiting detached
groups of pillars, while in others they form extensive colon
nades.
 I    shall now state the appearances as we approach, and
coast the promontory from the westward, noticing       this                 in
first view of the precipice, every thing that may be consi
dered as general, and reserving            (as   I     did with you)       for my
return     in   the   contrary direction,    a    detailed       account    of the
strata taken separately.
      The first circumstance,      that occurs to the attentive ob
                                                                            server

                            of Derry and Antrim.                                         105
Server on his approach,                is,
                              that although both the promon
tory itself, and the strata composing                      it,
                                           ascend to the north
ward, yet    it  not in the same angle, the strata being more
                  is
inclined to the horizon than the line tracing the surface of
the promontory,   fact which
                        a     shall account for afterwards.
                                             I
   From the Black Rock to the Giant's Causeway (about a
mile) the materials, and their arrangement, are similar to
those of the coast to the westward, viz. strata of table basalt,
generally separated           by
                        thinner strata of   reddish substance.   a
  At the Giant's Causeway new arrangement commences,
                                             a
one of the little systems have mentioned
                                   I       other memoirs,             in
by the aggregate of which our coast  formed nature having
                                                      is               ;
changed her materials, or their disposition, or both, every
two or three miles.    To the system of strata comprehended
between the Giant's Causeway and Dunseverick       now limit                I
myself, as all the strata composing                   it
                                       emerge between these
two points.
  As we proceed along the coast from the Giant's Cause
way eastward, we perceive the whole mass of strata ascend
gradually,       culminate at the northern point                       of       the promon.
tory,   and then descend               more rapidly,
                                       as the land falls away
to                 until having traced them across the face
     the south-east,
of the precipice we see them immerge separately at and be
yond Porlmoon Whyn Dykes.
     The   western     side   of   the promontory                is   cut down perpen
dicularly,       by
               eleven Whyn Dykes; the intervals
                                                    between
them are unequal, but they all reach from the top of the
precipice to the water, out of .which some of them again
emerge in considerable fragments    they are all constructed
                                                  ;
of horizontal prisms, which are strongly contrasted with the
vertical pillars of the strata through which they pass.
   One of the dykes at Port Cooan, on Bengore, half mile                             a
from the Giant's Causeway,    very beautiful is
                                             an insulated                  :
rock about 160 feet high, and 20                      in
                                    diameter, stands per
pendicular in the middle of  small bay; the main body of
                                             a
the rock    is   similar to the contiguous                  consolidated            masses   ;
but on the east side      singular whyn dyke
                                   a
                                                 joined to                 is             it,
composed (as they often are) of several walls agglutinated
together, with wall-like fragments of other parts of the dyke
                                                                                   emerging

106            On the basaltic Surface          of   the Counties
emerging at their base ; the solid mass of dyke is seen cutting
down the precipice to the southward at, 150 yards distance.
                     Depression         of the Strata.
  Soon after we have passed the last of our whyn dykes at
Tort Spagna, (a name derived from a vessel belonging to the
Spanish armada having been driven ashore in that creek,)
we discover a new and curious circumstance, viz. that the
western half of the promontory has sunk or subsided be
tween thirty and forty lee;, without the slightest concussion
or derangement of the parallelism of the strata.
  Two other depressions appear as we proceed                        onwards,
one at Porlmoon, and the other at the angle where the pro
montory begins to project from the rectilineal coast ; these
however are far less considerable in thickness than the pre
ceding, neither of them exceeding five feet.
  Such depressions occur at the collieries near Ballycastle,
and generally on one side of a whyn dyke. We have also at
Seaport, two miles west from the Giant's Causeway, a dyke
oblique and undulating, with a depression of the strata of
about four feet on one side ; but on Bengore promontory
our dykes are unaccompanied by depressions of the strata, and
where we have depressions we do not find a trace of a dyke.
  The portions of this extensive facade, which I                    have se
lected for explanatory views, are Port moon, in or near which
most of the strata emerge, and Pleskin, where the strata
culminate : each of these views, too, exhibits one of our de
pressions ; but in that of Pleskin the first apparent de
pression is purely an optical effect arising from the position
of my friend major O'Neal, of the 56th, who took his view
from the water.
Enumeration      of the   sixteen   Strata that compose the Promon
  tory    Bengore,
         of'              taken   in their regular Order, and count"
  ing from above.
  The country immediately              to the southward      of Bengore   is
like the promontory itself,        mass, accumulated to
                                    a   stratified
the summits of Craig Park and Croaghmore, the first five
hundred and the second seven hundred feet high but with         ;
                                                                       these

                              vf Deny        and Antrim.                                   107
these strata      I    have   nothing       to do,        limiting myself             to those
alone   of which         the promontory              is    formed, and             which are
exhibited in its facades.
  The uppermost of these commences near half a mile to the
eastward of the angle, where the coast deflecting from its
due east and west course, turns to the north-west,                                    and be
gins to form the promontory.
   So far the course of this stratum is to appearance perfectly
horizontal ; for the strata all ascending to the north, the in
tersection      of their planes with              the plane           of     the     sea must
run east and west, that               is,   in the present             case     it   coincides
-with the direction           of   the coast.
     But when the         coast changes its direction,                     this coincidence
ceases,    and the        facade      (that     is   the vertical           section of the
coast) losing its east and west course, its strata must appear
to ascend towards the point      turns to   therefore the strata
                                             it                 ;
at Pdrtmoon,   and along the north-east side of the promon
tory,  should ascend  obliquely along the facades, as they ac
tually do.
                     First Stratum, (m).
     The stratum   commence with forms the whole facade,

which     it   lines   as far as     Portmoon, on the south side                     of which
it   loses some        of its thickness,          then suddenly disappears                 and
vanishes from that facade,              receding westward                    in    the form   of
9.   stony ridge, and         is   seen no more.
                               Second Stratum,              (k)   .
  The stratum upon which the preceding rests,   red as                                is
brick, and about nine feet thick appears in spots and ;    it
patches    just    above high water mark,                   so long as the             incutn-*
bent stratum continues horizontal,                          but when that rises ob
liquely,       the second          ascends      with      it;   it now completely

   108          On the basaltic Surface      of llie Counties
  to the    summit, vanishes with it (at x in the view of Port-
  moon), and is seen no more.
     These ochrcous matters, so common in all basaltic coun
  tries, according to Mr. F. St. Fond's opinion, were once
  pure basalt, but have undergone some chemical process of
  nature we are unacquainted with, by which their colour has
  been changed.
                             Third Stratum,     (i).
     The next stratum is the last of those composing the pro
  montory which appears beyond it ; for so long as the first
  and second continue their horizontal course towards Bengore,
  this third accompanies them, showing its upper surface be
  tween high and low water-mark ; but when it ascends along
  with the others across          the  facades it displays its whole
  thickness,    above fifty feet.
     This stratum      is  of that variety of  J»asalt, I have on diffe
  rent occasions distinguished by the name irregular prismatic ;
  it resembles    the columnar basalt in grain, but differs from
  it totally in principle of internal construction, for its prisms
  are small, not articulated, and indifferent as to the position
  of their axes, which is perpetually changing.
     The irregular prismatic basalt accompanies the columnar
  in most countries, as at Povt du Baitme, at Trezzaf at Bol-
  scna in the Sound of Mull, and at Staff'a. In Antrim, it is
  very common ; and here is a striking resemblance between
  the rock crowning the celebrated columns at Staffa, and a
  stratum covering a very neat colonnade at Craigahullur, near
  Port rush.
     This stratum        (as is well   exhibited in the view   of Port-
  moon) is scolloped off irregularly from the point where it be
  comes superficial (.r), until it completely disappears at (z);
  a thin stripe    of its lower edge alone is ever resumed      again.
i                           Fourth Stratum, (h).
     The next    three strata    will require only very short descrip
  tions  ;  the fourth is about seven      feet thick, entirely colum
   nar, the pillars small, but not neat : they appear very white
  from   a thick covering of Byssus saxat'ilis, which shows a
  great predilection for this stratum.
                                                                  Fifth

                          Fifth Stratum,       (g).
    This stratum is ochreous,       and more      of  a slate colour than
any   of   the other red strata ; as    it  is friable,   it soon acquires
a grassy coat, through which          it is only in spots that it shows
its proper colour ; it is about eight feet thick.
                          Sixth Stratum^       {f).
    This stratum       is .composed of rude massive pillars so
coarsely    formed,     that on the least abatement of perpendicu
larity the columnar form can scarcely be traced. This stra
tum is about ten feet thick, it forms the vertex               of  the beau
tiful  conical    island Beanyn      Daana, and         is marked in the
views    (/).
    These last strata, though they have nothing very remark
 able in themselves, nor contribute much to the beauty of
 the facade ; yet they exhibit one of the most important facts
 I am acquainted with in natural history, and which, when
 attentively considered, throws much light on the nature of
 the operations performed upon our globe since its consolida
 tion, and leads us irresistibly to conclusions extraordinary
 and unexpected.
     The fourth,     fifth,  and sixth strata reach         the   top   of the
 precipice, and vanish together at the waterfall in the north
 west corner of Portmoon.           When they come to the surface,
 they turn inland to the westward in long stony ridges ; these
 obstruct the course of the waters in their descent along the
 inclined plane, formed by the surface of the promontory,
 and throw them over the precipice, in a cascade highly beau
 tiful after rain.
     On the   facades to the north-west not a trace of them ap
 pears,   these  being entirely formed by the lower strata, which
 I  have not yet noticed ; but at the distance of a mile, at the
 great depression (already mentioned),             the fourth,      fifth, and
  sixth strata,   with   a narrow stripe     of the third, suddenly ap
  pear, in their regular posts,      their    proper order, and with all
  the characteristic marks peculiar to each separate stratum.
     In the interval between the depression at Pleskin, and th«
   Giants Causeway (about         a mile),     these   three    strata    often
                                                                         appear

110            On the basaltic Surface              of the Counties
appear in      a desultory way on the               summit of the precipice,
wherever it is of sufficient height to receive them, always
preserving their usual thickness, their characters, and their
order ; so that          a   person master of the order          I   am detailing,
as he approaches a rising point  of the precipice, can tell its
strata, and their order, before he is near enough to distin
guish them.
                               Seventh    Stratum,      (d).
   The rude and massive pillars of the sixth stratum pass into
the neater, and much longer columns of the seventh, without
interrupting the solidity or continuity of the material ; exact
ly   as a          hand appears to separate into fingers. The
            down-held
thickness of this stratum, that is the length of the pillars of
which it is formed, is fifty- four feet ; it is marked (d) in the
two views, and in its passage across the face of the precipice,
displays more beautiful colonnades than any of the others.
     This   seventh      stratum emerges from the beach immediately
behind the south-east point          of Portmoon, and where it first
shows itself in that bay, has its lower edge raised only a few
feet above the water ; it forms the upper frustum of the
larger of the two conical islands, ascends obliquely along
the face of Portmoon,   and continues to rise until it com
poses the upper range  in the beautiful facade, properly called
Bengore Head. This is probably the most magnificent of all,
its convexity towards the sea producing a fine effect.     The
lower edge of this stratum, that     the line forming the base
                                                  is-
of   its pillars,    has here, as at Pleskin,            attained     the height   of
three hundred feet above the water.
     The    seventh          stratum,    like those above      it,   also suffers an
interruption   for after having exhibited itself to such great
                ;
advantage      at Bengore,the extreme northern point of the
promontory lowers, and this stratum disappears for about
one-third of    milea   as the promontory rises,
                               ;                      resumed        it   is
again in great beauty at Pleskin, and    interrupted no more
                                                        is                         ;

                     Eighth Stratum, (c).
   The next stratum is of the same variety of basalt with the
third, that is, irregular prismatic ; it is fifty-four feet thick,
and in the views distinguished by the letter (c) : where it
emerges at the south-east corner of Portmoon, it is quite ac
cessible by land, and affords the best opportunity I know for
examining this species of basalt, as it is there very neat.
   There is little more of this stratum seen in the facade of
Portmoon for want of perpendicularity, but it forms the
lower frustum  of the great conical island Beanyti Daana,
and the whole of the smaller, except the base ; it is well dis
played over the remainder of the precipice, it forms the in
termediatestratum between the magnificent colonnades at
both Bengore and Pleskin, and finally is lost just over the
Giant's Causeway. Large globular fragments have fallen
from        it,   and are scattered       about the causeway.
                                  Ninth Stratum, (b). „
     This stratum           is   forty-four feet thick, that being the exact
length of the neat pillars composing        at its emersion it;                       it
forms the bases of the two conical islands in Portmoon, and
isno more seen in that bay, but immediately to the north
ward   begins to show itself in colonnades and groups, some
          it
of them resembling castles and towers.
     It   ascends along the precipice                obliquely,   like those above
 it,   forms          the   lower range        at Bengore and       Pleskin, from
 which         dips to the westward regularly, composes the
               last    it
 group at Port Naffer; called the Organs, seen from the
 causeway, and finally at its immcsion, or intersection with
 the plane of the sea,      forms the beautiful assemblage of
                                     it
 neat pillars, so long distinguished                  by   the name   of the Giant's
 Causeway.
       At   these       two intersections,          each   of them     accessible      by
 land and   water, the prisms exactly resemble each other in
        size,  and ueatness  the interval between them  full

  112         On the basaltic Surface     of the    Counties
     We  see now what     a diminutive portion       of our  vast basal
 tic mass has, until lately, monopolized the attention of the
  curious ; and even after it was discovered that we had many
 other, and much finer collections of pillars on the same pro
 montory, it never occurred to those who were preparing to
 give accounts of them to the public, to examine whether
 these were mere desultory groups, or detached parts of a
 grand and regular whole, which a more comprehensive view
 of the subject would soon have laid open to them.
                       Tenth Stratum,       (a).
    The stratum upon which        the pillars of   the preceding rest,
is ochreous, red    as minium,     and about twenty feet thick ;       it
 is scarcely seen at Portmoon, a patch alone of its surface
being distinguishable under water at low tide ; but imme
 diately to the northward it shows itself, and from its bright
 colour, makes a conspicuous figure across the face of the
 precipice in a course of more than a mile and half; its last
appearance    to the westward is at Rovinvalley,           the opposite
point of the bay from the Giant's Causeway, from which
we have a good view of it. The final dip and immersion of
this tenth stratum,    as   well as its emersion, are lost for want
of perpendicularity.
    The six remaining    strata are all similar in material, but
differing much    from  each    other in thickness ; they are all of
that description called tabular basalt, sometimes showing a
faint disposition to assume a columnar form at their edges,
and always separated from each other by ochreous layers.
    These six strata are not so perfectly distinct as those above
them, for sometimes we think we can count seven, and
again not more than five ; nor does each of these preserve
the same thickness through their whole extent, for they are
deeper towards the northern point, where they culminate,
forming by themselves a perpendicular facade near two hun
dred feet high,     but they grow thinner        as  they recede from
this centre.
    The jets of black rock in the view of Portmoon, are the
emersions of these strata ; their last appearance on the west
Bide is at Rovinvalley, where they strongly display the incli
                                                                 nation

nation      of their strata, (the   same with all the rest) to those
approaching from the westward; their final immersion is
1ost for want of perpendicularity.
    I shall now proceed to select from the great mass of facts
that are exhibited on the face        of Bengme promontory, and
occur in the contiguous basaltic country, such as seem ap
plicable to geological questions, and likely to throw light
on such subjects.
              Facts applicable to geological Questions.
    1.   Every stratum preserves accurately, or very nearly, the
same thickness through its whole extent, with very few ex
ceptions.
    2.  The upper     and lower   surface   of  each stratum preserve
an exact parallelism, so long as they are covered by another
stratum ; but when any stratum becomes the superficial one,
its upper surface is scolloped, or sipped away irregularly,
while    the   plane forming its base continues steady       and rec
tilineal   ; but the parallelism of its planes is resumed      as soon
as another stratum is placed over it.
    3.   The superficial lines bounding the summit of our fa
cades, and our surface itself, are unconnected with, and
unaffected by, the arrangement of the strata below them.
    4. Nature,      in the formation      of her arrangements,     has
never acted upon an extensive scale in our basaltic area, (at
least on its northern side, where our continuous precipices
enable us to determine the point with precision,)         but changes
her materials, or her arrangement, or both, every two or
three miles, and often at much smaller intervals.
    5. Wherever       there is a change   of material,   as from one
stratum to another in       a vertical line  ; or where the change is
in  a  horizontal direction by the introduction of a new sy
stem   ;  or where    a  whyn dyke cuts through an accumulation
of strata; in all these cases the change is always per saltum
and never per gradus, the lines of demarcation always di
stinct, and      well defined   ; yet  the   different materials pass
into each other without interrupting the solidity and con
tinuity of the whole mass.
    6. The facades on our coast are formed as it were by ver-
Vol. 33. No.       130. Feb. 1809.                  H             tical

114                On the basaltic Surface              of the   Counties
tical planes, cutting down, occasionally, the accumulations
of our strata ; the upper part of these facades is generally
perpendicular, the lower steep and precipitous.
     7.   The      bases   of our precipices commonly                       extend    a   con
siderable way into the sea ; between the water and the foot
of the precipice, (and especially near the latter,) there is fre
quently exhibited the wildest and most irregular scene of
confusion, by careless observers supposed to be formed by
the ruins of the precipice above, which have fallen down :
such, no doubt,             was     Mr. Whitehurst's                idea,    when he de
scribes one         of these   scenes as        "   an awful wreck           of   the terra
queous globe."
  But a more attentive observer                          will soon discover that
these capricious irregularities,                whether in the form of rude
cones, as at Beanyn Daana,                      and the west side             of Pleskin ;
or towers,         as at the dyke        of Port        Cooan and Castro         Levit, at
the foot       of Magilligan facade,                even spires and obelisks,               as
to the westward            of Kenbuan,          andat the Bull of Rathlin ;
yet all       of   these once formed          part of the original mass of
coast, stratified like            it,   and their strata still correspond in
material and inclination                 with    those in the contiguous pre
cipice.
   8. These vertical sections or abruptions of our strata are
by  no means confined to the steeps that line our coast   the                         ;
remaining boundary of our basaltic area has several of them
equally grand; and similar abruptions, or sections, (though
not so deep,) are scattered over great part of our area, and
                                                    a
especially on the ridges of our hills and mountains which are
cut down in many places like      stair,   the sudden abrup
                                                a              by
tion      of the basaltic stratum.
     9. Wherever           the strata are thus suddenly cut off, whether
it  be  mass of accumulated strata as
          a                                 the facades on our in
coast, or solitary strata in the interior the materials on one
                                                           ;
side of the abruption are completely carried away, without
a  fragment being left behind, while on its other side the un
touched stratum remains entire and undisturbed.
 I  shall not proceed to apply these facts to support,                                or in
validate, any of the numerous theories                              which have given

know)     have bome some part ;         I shall look to nature alone,
without much reference to opinions, and shall endeavour to
trace, by the marks she has left behind her, some of the
grand operations she once executed              on the surface of our     i
globe.
   Varro divided the time elapsed since the beginning of the
world, into three portions, which he distinguished by the
names, prolepticum, fabulosum, and historicum.
   The first comprehended          the period    of absolute darkness   j
in  the second some faint lights were          thrown upon the his
tory of its events, by fable and tradition ; in the third, the
historian had the common aids from which history is usually
compiled.
   The natural history of the world seems to admit of a cor
responding division.        In the first I include the formation of
our strata, their induration,          their derangement from the
horizontal position in which           they seem originally to have
been placed, and the operation           of cutting them down by       so
many whyn dykes.
   In the second division,        corresponding to Varro's       fabuh-
sum,    I  comprehend       the   operations performed upon our
globe, posterior     to its final  consolidation, and antecedent to
all history or tradition ; operations therefore that can be
established    by   the   visible effects alone which        still exist,
written in strong characters.
   The third division contains         the period since we acquired
some knowledge of natural history, became acquainted with
causes and effects, and able to trace the connection between
them.
   With    the operations performed         in the first division (cor
responding with Varro's prolepticum) modern theorists as
sume that they are well acquainted, able to account for every
appearance,     and to detail the whole process of original for
mation.      I however shall decline noticing these early pro
cesses of nature, and limit myself to the second division of
natural history, hoping from the prominent features of my
country that remain still undefaced, and from its curious
facts, to trace    and    demonstrate the great       effects that have
been produced upon our surface ; and though               I do not pre-
                                  H  2                             sume

 116            Some Experiments       on the    Distillation
 sume to advance further,         I  perhaps     may assist     in clearing
 the way     for future naturalists, and, by establishing effects,
 encourage them to proceed to causes, and help them to dis
 cover the powers and agents by which                these    grand opera
 tions have been executed.

Bitter Almonds,         HO gra\m. — In distillation they discharged
a great quantity     of smoky flame. The almonds               were   found
without adhesion to each other, and contained upon their
surface a great variety of prismatic colours.                The coal was
found to weigh 32 grains : 208 grains having been lost by
the distillation.

    Black Pepper, not ground, 240 grains. — In distilling, a
considerable portion of flame was disengaged. The coal ob
tained was partially prismatic.            Every spherule of pepper
preserved     its original form.      A few masses slightly adhered
together without any appearance or reality of welding.
Weight of the coal 53 grains. Loss by distillation 187 grs.

    While Pepper, 240 grains. — This substance              flamed a good
deal   in distilling, of   a pure white colour,           edged with pale
                                                                       blue.

  corn entire, and partially connected in groups, which, how
  ever,   separated  upon being exposed to air.                Weight 50
  grains;   having lost by distillation 190 grains.

                        Experiment         XXVI.
    Fine Black Tea,    240  grains — The result of this distillation
 was a slightly prismatic coal,        to   appearance     very   little al
 tered   in shape,   bulk, or colour.           It weighed      74    grains.
 Loss in distillation   166 grains.

                       Experiment         XXVII.
    Gunpowder Tea, 120 grains. — This substance afforded a
 small portion of flame during the operation of distilling.
 The result was a firm compact coal, thoroughly welded to
 gether by means    of  a silvery-gray      species  of coal, perhaps of
 resinous extraction.     The whole surface of the mass, which
 resembled in shape the interior           of  the  retort, was covered
with    fine  prismatic shades.         The grains of tea had not,
 though welded, lost any part of their shape.              The coal thus
obtained weighed 39 grains.            Loss by distillation 81 grains.
            Component parts    :    Volatile matter         67 -5
                                    Oxide of carbon         32*5

                       Experiment        XXVIII.
   Coffee Beans, 240 grains.
                               —The distillation       of this substance
disengaged a considerable portion of flame.             The beans were
found in the state of a beautiful prismatic           coal   of the most
lively and elegant shades.         The whole were destitute of ad
hesion, and seemed to possess nothing of the welding pro-
                                     H   3                          ,  perty.

                          Experiment    XXIX.
   Dutch    Cheese, 276 grains. — After a distillation,      which was
 attended    with the discharge of        a watery-coloured      smoky
flame, a rough sooty coal was found, without any symptoms
of welding. It was salt to the taste, and in distilling emit
 ted strong fumes of muriatic acid gas.             The poal weighed
 48 grains,    222 having been lost by distillation.
           Compontnt      parts : Volatile matter       82*22

                          Experiment     XXX.
^   Scotch Cheese    (Dunlop), 300 grains. — This cheese flamed
violently during the distillation.        The colour of the flame
approached near to that of thick oil, and deposited a con
siderable portion of soot. The resulting coal was much
shrivelled, possessed nothing of the welding property, and
weighed 25 grains, having lost by distillation 275 grains.
The colour of this      coal was grayish black,      and saltish to the
taste.    It  was not,   however, nearly so pungent as that ob
tained from the Dutch cheese in the former experiment.

                          Experiment    XXXI.
    Cheshire Cheese, 300 grains.— The discharge of flame in
 the distillation of this cheese was still more violent than in
the two former.        The coal   was   reduced   to a mere skeleton.
The colour brownish black, with           a small perception of salt.
 It weighed     15 grains.    Loss 285 grains.

     It would    appear   by the Experiments from Exper. XIII.
  inclusive, with the exception of the gunpowder tea, that the
 coals obtained from these various substances do not con
 tain the welding or caking principle ; and so far they re
 semble the residual coals, or oxides obtained from the di
 stillation of all the woods.
     The following experiments           are selected  from   a variety
 made with animal substances.
                         Experiment       XXXII.
    Beef, entirely freed from fat, 1121 grains. — This in distil
lation gave out a light blue penetrating smoke, which to
 wards the middle of the operation became particularly of
fensive.       Towards the close a blue lambent flame appeared,
which continued to twitter for some time ; after this, all of
 fensive smell ceased,      and a skeleton coal of a pure black
colour     was   obtained perfectly insipid, which weighed 34
grains ; 1087 grains having been lost by distillation.

                       Experiment       XXXTII.
    Fat, cut from   the same beef, 425 grains. —This was slowly
distilled,    and with a moderate        heat, so as to restrain the
flame.     After ignition   there was found in the bottom         of  the
retort a long flake    of carbonaceous matter that weighed         three
grains.     Loss by distillation 422 grains.

   Mutton,      cut   from the thick part of            a hind-quarter and
carefully freed from fat, 775 grains. — This substance exhaled
the same disagreeable odour as the beef, but was succeeded
by   a flame   that burnt longer and with more violence.                  The
coal obtained was light and honeycombed, of a dark gray
colour, and weighed 23 grains.                   Lost by distillation 752

   AToad, weighing       554 grains.  — This    was introduced into a
retort, and distilled with nearly the same attendant circum
stances as in the experiments immediately before.                At the
commencement        of  the   operation a violent hissing was per
ceptible, accompanied        with  slight explosions.      The result
wasj the skeleton nearly in the position in which it was ori
ginally placed.     The  flesh and skin had disappeared,       and left
a very    perfect coal adhering to the bones, all       of which were
converted into a beautiful white         colour. —  The carbonaceous
matter weighed 24 grains ; the bones, some of which soon
fell into powder, / grains: — total 31 grains.             Loss in the
distillation 523 grains.

    It is rendered    highly probable from these experiments,
that every   animal    substance contains a portion of oxide of
carbon ; and many of those that exhibit but a small residuum
in the state of coal, part with a considerable quantity in
the state of gas and flame, dissolved in hydrogen, but
which is lost from a recoinpounding affinity not being pre
sent at the    period of disengagement.             From this circum
stance most probably may          arise,   in  part, a well established
fact, that the same quantity of any of the substances before
operated upon,       will communicate       a greater share   of carbo
naceous matter when in a raw state,                than the same sub
                                                                  stance

   stance carefully converted into charcoal,           and afterwards ap
   plied to the same purpose. The substances being so varied
   and numerous that contain the oxide of carbon, it could not
   possibly follow that the extent of their carbonaceous effects
  would be in the proportion of their masses under similar
  circumstances, nor that the charcoal or oxide that each of
  them afforded by distillation would bear the same relation
  to each other in point        of purity,      even where the -acknow
  ledged   quantity of alloy in        the   state  of earths, salts, &c,
  were the same.       We therefore find, that even in the state of
  the raw substance equal weights or quantities of matter,
  calculating always upon the residuum alloys of different
  substances, produce results materially different, which can
  only be attributable to the different existing state of the
  oxide, or to the decomposition of the hydro-carbonate which
  most of them contain.        The   difference    of the results becomes
  much greater when the oxide of carbon is used in the state
  of charcoal or coke, and the variety of the results here also
  obtained, where no hydro-carbonate comes into action, can
  only be placed to the state of oxidation of the carbon.

  periments, what I have just stated.

  Having       lately fixed on the discussion of the nature of in
  flammation, for the subject of an academical exercise,                   I
  found it necessary to examine attentively the mechanical
  principles of the circulation of the blood, and to investigate
  minutely and comprehensively the motion of fluids in pipes,
  as affected   by friction, the resistance        occasioned by flexure,

  contained in an elastic tube, the magnitude of a pulsation
  in different parts of a conical vessel, and the effect of a con
  traction advancing progressively through the length of a
  given canal.        The physiological application of the results of
  these inquiries I shall have the honour of laying before the
  Royal Society at a future time ; but 1 have thought it ad
  visable to communicate, in a separate paper, such conclu
  sions, ,as may be interesting to some persons, who do not
  concern themselves          with disquisitions of a physiological na
  ture  ;  and  I  imagine it may be as agreeable to the Society
  that they should be submitted at present           to their considera
  tion,   as  that    they should be withheld until the time ap
  pointed for the delivery of the Croonian Lecture.
      It has been observed by the late Professor Robison, that
 the comparison         of   the Chevalier Dubuat's    calculations with
 his experiments is in all respects extremely satisfactory; that
 it exhibits a beautiful specimen of the means of expressing
 the general result of an extensive series of observations in an
 analytical formula, and that it does honour to the penetra
 tion, skill, and address of Mr. Dubuat, and of Mr. de St.
 Honore, who assisted him in the construction of his ex
 pressions.       I  am by no means disposed        to dissent from this
 encomium;          and   I   agree with Professor Robison,     and with
 all other late authors on hydraulics,           in applauding the un
 usually accurate coincidence between these theorems and the
 experiments from which they were deduced. But I have
 already taken the liberty         of remarking,   in my lecture on the
 history of hydraulics, that the form of these expressions is
 by no means so convenient for practice as it might have
 been rendered; and they are also liable to still greater ob
jections in particular cases, since, when the pipe is either
 extremely narrow, or extremely long, they become com
 pletely erroneous         :  for notwithstanding    Mr. Dubuat    seems
 to be    of opinion,      that a canal  may have a finite   inclination,
 and     yet  the    water contained in it may remain perfectly at
 rest, and that no force can be sufficient to make water flow
 in any finite quantity through a tube less than one twenty-
fifth of an inch in diameter ; it can scarcely require an ar
gument to show, that he is mistaken in both these respects.
                                                                       It

It  was therefore     necessary for my purpose       to substitute,     for
the formulae       of Mr. Dubuat, others of        a   totally  different
nature;    and    I could follow    Dubuat     in nothing      but in his
general    mode of considering a part of the pressure, or of the
height of a given reservoir, as employed in overcoming the
friction of the pipe through which the water flows out of it ;
a principle,       which, if not of his original invention, was
certainly     first reduced    by  him into     a practical form.       By
comparing the experiments,           which    he has    collected, with
some of Gerstner's,        and some    of my own, I     have ultimately
discovered      a formula,   which    appears   to agree fully as well
as  Dubuat's with the experiments from which his rules were
deduced, which accords better with Gerstner's experiments,
which extends to all the extreme cases with equal accuracy,
which seems to represent more simply the actual operation
of the forces concerned, and which is direct in its applica
tion to practice, without the necessity of any successive ap
 proximations.
    I began by examining the velocities of the water discharged
 through pipes of a given diameter with different degrees of
 pressure ; and I found, that the friction could not be repre
sented by any single power        of   the velocity,    although it fre
quently approached to the proportion of                  that power of
which the exponent is 1-8 ; but that it appeared to consist
 of two parts, the one varying simply as the velocity, the
 other  as  its square. The proportion of these parts to each
other must however be considered as different in pipes of
 different diameters, the first part being less perceptible in
very large pipes, or in rivers, but becoming greater than the
 second in very minute tubes; while the second also becomes
 greater   for each given portion of the internal surface of the
 pipe, as the diameter is diminished.
    If we express, in the first place, all the measures in
French inches, calling the height employed in overcoming
 the friction    f, the velocity in a second v, jhe diameter        of  the
 pipe d, and its length I, we may          makey=              -f 2  c.v ;
                                                        a^v*
 for it is obvious,     that the   friction  must be directly as the
 length of the pipe ; and since the pressure            is  proportional
                                                                          to

     friction to its circumference or diameter, the relative

     It  appears from this comparison,                      that in the forty experi
ments extracted          from the collection,                 which served as a basis
for Dubuat's calculations, the mean error of his formula is
•jii- of the whole velocity,             and that of mine                      only ; but if
we omit the four experiments, in which the superficial ve
locity only of a river was observed, and in which 1 have
calculated the mean velocity by Dubuat's rules, the mean
error of the remaining 36 is                            according to my mode of
calculation, and -pi- according to Mr. Dubuat's ; so that, on
the whole, the accuracy of the two formula; may be con
sidered as precisely equal with respect to these experiments.

                                                                                            the

the mean error of.his formula is about            -^V,     an(^  that  of mine
        In  fifteen  of Gerstner's experiments, the mean error
of Dubuat's rule       is one third, that of mine one fourth; and
in the three experiments which I made with very fine tubes,
the error of my own rules is one fifteenth of the whole,
while in such cases Dubuat's formulae completely fail.                          I
have determined the mean error by adding together the lo
garithmic ratios of all the results, and dividing the sum by
the number of experiments. It would be useless to seek for
a much greater degree of accuracy, unless it were probable,
that the errors of the experiments themselves were less than
those of the calculations; but if a sufficient number o*f ex
tremely accurate and frequently repeated experiments could
be obtained, it would be very possible to adapt my formula
still more correctly to their results.
    In order    to facilitate the computation,        I  have made a table
of   the coefficients a and c for the different values                of d, all
the measures being still expressed in French inches.

determined, became too great when d was about 20, and too
small in some other cases.  Coulomb's experiments on the

with this table,                as any         constant number could be expected
to do.         I   have however reason to                think, from some experi

                                               to    me by
that the value of a, for pipes about half an inch in diameter,
is somewhat too small ; my mode of calculation, as well as
Dubuat's, giving too great a velocity in such cases.
    If any         person should                    be desirous             of making          use   of Du

II. Of the Resistance occasioned                                by   Flexure in Pipes or Rivers.
     Mr. Dubuat            has made some experiments on the effect                                                         of
the flexure       of   a   pipe       in retarding                   the      motion of the water
flowing through it; but           not appear to be
                                               they do any                                                 by
means sufficient to authorise the conclusions which be has
drawn from them.                      He directs                the       squares of           of the     sines
the angles       of    flexure to be                  collected into one sum, which,
being multiplied           certain constant coefficient, and
                                 by   a                                                                                    by

cidence with some experiments merely accidental, since the
results afforded by it must vary according to the method of
stating the problem, which is entirely arbitrary.               Thus it
depended only on Mr. Dubuat to consider a pipe bent to an
angle of 1443 as consisting of a single flexure, as composed
of two flexures of 72° each, or of a much greater number
of smaller   flexures ; although the       result of the experiment
would only agree with the arbitrary division into two parts,
which he has adopted.           This difficulty is attached to every
mode of computing the effect either from the squares of the
sines or from      the sines     themselves   ; and   the only way    of
avoiding it is to attend merely to the angle of flexure as ex
pressed in degrees.       It is natural to suppose, that the effect
of the curvature must increase, as the curvature itself in
creases,   and   that the retardation must be inversely propor
tional to the radius of curvature, or very nearly so ; and
this supposition is sufficiently confirmed by the experiments
which    Mr. Dubuat has employed in support of a theory so
different.    It might be expected, that an equal curvature
would create a greater resistance in a larger pipe than in a
smaller, since the inequality in the motions of the different
parts of the fluid is greater ; but this circumstance does not
seem to have influenced the results         of  the experiments made
with   pipes   of   an inch    and   of two inches diameter      : there
must also be some deviation from the general law in cases of
very small pipes having a great curvature, but this deviation
cannot be determined without further experiments.                Of the
25 which Dubuat has made, he has rejected ten as irregular,
because they do not agree with his theory : indeed four of
them, which were made with a much shorter pipe than the
rest, differ so manifestly from them, that they cannot be
reconciled: but five others agree sufficiently, as well as all
the rest, with the theory which I have here proposed, sup
posing the resistance      to be as the angular flexure, and to in
crease besides almost in the same proportion            as the radius of
curvature diminishes, but more nearly as that power of the
radius of which the index is            Thus if p be the number of
degrees suhtended      at the centre   of flexure, and q the radius
of curvature of      the  axis  of  the pipe   in French inches, we

XXI.     Analysis of       the Schist that accompanies        the   Menilite
           near Paris.       By Professor Lampadius*.
The       schist that     accompanies the menilite near Paris was
formerly confounded with poller schiefer, or polishing slate :
but Werner has given it the name of klebschiefer, or adhe
sive slate, on account of its property of adhering strongly to
the tongue. After his return from France he gave me some
of it for the purpose of chemical analysis.
    Werner gives the following as its external characters : It
adheres     strongly     to  the   tongue — colour, pale yellowish
gray—without lustre — fracture slaty in even laminae — opake--
takes a slight degree       of  lustre   by scratching   — is    very tender
— separates into       leaves    spontaneously,     which is one of its
principal characters      — specific gravity under 0'2.
    It  serves   as a   gangue to the menilite,          with which it is
found in the hill of Menil-Montant                near Paris. — The fol
lowing    are the results     of my chemical experiments           on it.
    a. Roasted for two hours in           a powerful wind furnace, it
lost 30 per cent. of its weight.              Its colour became a deep
brown.       It exhibited no signs of fusion, either in a clay
crucible, or in a crucible lined with charcoal : yet it had
become harder and less friable.           That which     had been roast
ed in the clay crucible        was    rendered   very attractable      by the
magnet.
    b. Exposed to the blowpipe on .charcoal             and with oxygen
gas, it melted in     a  few seconds into an opake glassy bead,            of
a blackish brown colour.
    c. Exposed to the flame of the blowpipe simply, it was
not possible to melt it : but with borax a small portion was
dissolved, and coloured of a blackish brown.
    These preliminary trials, and its effervescence with mu
 riatic acid, led me to suspect that it contained carbonic
 acid and iron.
    d.  A  thousand parts of the mineral distilled in a retort
 yielded '270 of carbonic acid.
     e. Another thousand parts dissolved in ten times their
 weight of muriatic acid lost 270 parts.

      It  contains therefore     27 per cent.     of carbonic acid.
     The     analysis   was conducted in the       following manner      :
      1.  One part      of  the mineral     in fine powder was put into
 four parts       of concentrated sulphuric acid, in which it dis
 solved with         evident effervescence      ;  and   the  solution     was
 evaporated        to dryness.
     2.   The residuum        was diffused    in water, and     a gelatinous
 matter separated,         which was still a little yellowish.          This
 was silex.
     3. The liquor was filtered.
     4. The gelatinous residuum was washed with boiling water,
 till no further trace of sulphuric acid was discoverable.
     5. This water and the filtered liquor were evaporated                 to
 gether, till there remained but ten drachms.
     6. Some sulphate of lime separated, which was decom
posed by an alkaline carbonate; and after it had been heated
and roasted o-OS         of pure lime    were obtained.
     7.   The liquor     separated from the sulphate         of lime being
concentrated          by heat,   yielded crystals     of  sulphate of iron
and      of  sulphate   of magnesia.
     8.   T  put the whole, without separating          the crystals, into a
platina crucible, and exposed             the    saline mass    to a strong
heat for two hours.
     9.   After cooling, the       mass   had an ochrey colour,        and a
bitter      taste.    On it I    affused    boiling water, filtered       and
washed the residuum.
     10.    The oxide of iron remained on the filter. After hav
ing been dried and roasted it weighed 0-OQ.
     11. I added to the liquor carbonate of ammonia, when a
white earth was precipitated, which, dried and roasted, ap
peared to be magnesia, and weighed 0.28.
     12.    The yellowish gelatinous residuum (No. 4) was di
gested in muriatic acid, till its colour became entirely white.
     13. Being filtered and washed, the liquor was of the co
lour of pale white wine. Being precipitated with ammonia,
I obtained some more oxide of iron, which, washed and
roasted,       weighed 0-03.
     14.    Having     redissolved   this oxide of iron, and         that   of
No,      10, there yet remained       0-008 of silex.

    The most remarkable circumstance is, that this mineral
contains no alumine, and includes a large quantity of iron.
The outward appearance of the mass would lead us to sus
pect the former substance, and its light colour by no means
indicates so large a quantity of the second. Probably the
carbonic acid combining with the oxide of iron conceals its
presence.

 XXII.     Comparative Analysis of some Varieties             of Steatite,
                  or  Talc.   By  M. Vauquelin *.
 The     smoothness and unctuosity       of   the stones      called stea
 tites  has  been commonly      ascribed   to the presence       of mag-
                   * From Anualcs de Chimie, tome x'ii.

nesia, this earth having been found in all of them that have
been analysed ; and in consequence all stories possessing
these external characters have been classed together.  But
the pierre de lard, or speckstein, which in some respect
may be considered as the prototype of the species, having
been analysed by Klaproth, and no magnesia     found in                                    it,
has changed the opinions of mineralogists on this subject,
and             led them to wish             that some     of   these substances      should
be analysed              anew.
        To    this uncertainty, M. Haiiy gave me three va
                 remove
rieties          of talc,
               that   might make   I  comparative analysis of
                                                           a
them. — The first of these     termed    Hauy's Mineralogy
                                                     is          in

the mass, very smooth to the touch, and divides into ex
ceedingly thin flexible laminae of     silvery white. — The     a
second   called in the same work talc glaphique, because
                  is
   employed in sculpture but commonly pierre de lard.                                      It it

at the same time scaly. — Of   this species M. Haiiy sent me
two specimens one of         yellowish white, from

      One hundred parts of this stone, calcined in

                            a             light rosy tint, was  a
deprived of its flexibility, and lost six parts of its weight.
Its laminae being thus rendered very fragile,      could easily               I
reduce           it    to powder.
      The hundred parts thus calcined
        2.                              heated with twice           I
their weight of caustic potash. The mixture did not melt                                    ;
but its tumefaction                      indicated, that        a   combination between
the substances had taken place.
   3. The mixture diluted with                 afterwards dis

a   jelly.

    4. The residuum, being lixiviated with distilled water,
 left a white powder, which, when calcined in a red heat,
 weighed 62 parts.            It  was pure silex.
     5.   Ammonia, mixed with            the   liquor separated from the
 silex, formed in it         a  yellow precipitate of little bulk,- from
 which P5 of alumine were separated by means of caustic
 potash. The remainder was oxide of iron, weighing 3 parts
 and    a  half.
    6. Having precipitated the iron and alumine by means of
 ammonia,        I put into the liquor a solution of carbonate of
 soda, and set it to boil.           As soon as the mixture began to
 grow hot, it grew turbid and deposited a large quantity of a
 white powder, which, when washed and calcined, weighed
 27 parts.       This substance was magnesia, for with sulphuric
 acid it formed       a salt   that had all the characteristics of com*
 mon sulphate of magnesia.

    From     the smallness       of  the quantity   of  the   iron   and alu
mine,      I  think    these     substances   may be presumed          not to
be essential      to the formation      of  the stone ; so that perfectly
pure laminar talc may be deemed               a  compound of silex and
magnesia.
               Analysis of       compact rose-coloured     Talc.
   In    the   analysis   of this variety      I pursued    the same     pro
cesses as    in that of    the preceding;      I therefore    need not enter
into the particulars. The following are its results               :

     Analysis of the yellowish compact Talc (Speckstein).
    1. A hundred parts of this stone strongly calcined lost
i parts.
    2. Heated afterwards with twice its weight of potash in a
silver crucible   no fusion took place, but the matter was
greatly increased in bulk, and had become homogeneous.
    3. This was diffused in water, and dissolved in muriatic
acid. The solution, being evaporated,          became gelatinous
towards the end of the operation.
    4. The matter being dried and washed, a white powder
remained, which, after calcination, weighed 56 parts.
    5. The silex having been separated by lixiviation, the
liquor   was mixed with     a small quantity of muriatic acid,
and ammonia was        afterward poured in, which formed in it
a copious white flocculent precipitate.
    6. The liquor being filtered, the precipitate was washed
and dried.     This was alumine, and weighed 30 parts. The
alumine dissolved entirely in sulphuric acid, and its solu
tion, saturated with the requisite quantity of potash, af
forded very pure alum : but the mother water, evaporated
afresh, yielded b\ parts of sulphate of lime crystallized in
needles.     Thus with the assistance of the alumine the am
monia precipitated the lime from its solution in muriatic acid.
    7. The liquor from which the alumine had been sepa
 rated gave no precipitate with carbonate of soda, even assisted
 by long boiling. The speckstein therefore contains no mag
 nesia, like the two preceding varieties. — But in recapitulat
 ing the products of this analysis we find only 93 parts;

     A loss so considerable,    which   is  not common    in such
 analyses   carefully  executed,   led   me  to suspect  that the
  compact talc contained      some   other principle,   which   the

processes     employed did not enable me to discover. In con-
sequence      I treated a hundred parts, reduced to fine powder,
with concentrated sulphuric acid.
    1.  After boiling for two hours         I  dried the mixture,      lixi
viated the residuum           with  distilled    water, and boiled the
lixivium.       At   the   expiration of    a   few days I obtained 36
parts   of alum crystallized in       cubes : and by a second evapo
ration   I   procured    from  the  mother     water 1 5 parts more of
the same salt mixed with a few needly crystals of sulphate
of lime.
   2.  The   stone appearing to me to be but imperfectly decom
posed,     I  powdered it afresh, and treated it as before. On
adding the acid employed in this operation to the mother
water of the preceding, I obtained 15 parts more of alum,
making in all 60 parts. Then, as I employed for this ope
ration very pure sulphuric acid, and added no potash to the
solution, it is evident that the stone contained a certain
portion of this alkali, and that this substance was the occa-               ,
sion of the loss I had in the first analysis.               Sixty parts of
alum, however, do not require seven of potash, the quantity
of   loss , but as      the  stone   is very    siliceous, it is probable
that the whole of the potash was not extracted by the sul
phuric acid, though I boiled the stone twice in it.
    The speckstein therefore is composed              of

    In his analysis of speckstein, M. Klaproth found no
potash : but the quantity of water, which, according to him,
amounts to 10 per cent., and the loss of 2j, which he ex
perienced, will just balance the deficiency 1 found.                  It is
probable that M. Klaproth estimated                the water by compu
tation, and not by direct experiment;               for, to whatever heat
I  exposed the stone, it never lost more than 5 per cent.
                                                                     FrotM

   From this analysis it follows, that of the three varieties
of  talc here mentioned, two only must continue to be so
called ; namely, the laminar tals, and the compact rose-co
loured talc.      The third, the speckstein, should        be removed
to the genus     of alkaliniferous stones.
   It   deserves   particular     remark,  that  those   two varieties,
which most      resemble    each    other, and   which    have  always
been classed together, should now be separated by analysis :
which shows,       that minerals should never be classed accord
ing to their external appearance, since the most striking
analogies in this respect are the most deceitful. In fact, the
speckstein and compact rose-coloured talc have the same
softness, the same fineness         of particles, the same fracture,
 nearly the same specific gravity; and certainly, if there were
any room to suppose that one of the three substances
 ought to be separated from the talc species, we should be
 more inclined to suppose it the laminar, than either of the
 others.
    Note.     I analysed at    the same time that      species  of talc
 known by the name of crate de Briangon, or French chalk,
 and I found it to contain the ame principles, and nearly in
 the same proportions, as the laminar talc, and. the compact
 rose-coloured talc. These proportions were,

      culated by M.    Chaptal.       By M. Germon, of Epernay.
             .             [Continued  from p. 85.]
  XXIII.       What   is the Method      of operating in      the Press,   in
                      order to make    White Wine?
  The       press being previously well washed and cleaned, and
  the screw inspected and greased, the fruit is pressed by
  three successive      and rapid turns of the screw in certain
  districts,    and by two only in others, according to the expe
  rience of the proprietor, the strength of his machinery, and
  the expertness     of his workmen,       or the nature of his grapes.
  The whole of this operation should be finished in less than
  an hour by good workmen. Before applying the press, three
  or four layers of billets or pieces of wood are thrown upon
  the grapes, placed in such a wa>' as t0 make the pressure ge
  neral. After allowing thejuice to flow for about five minutes,
  the press is slackened, in order to stir up the remaining
  mass, and clear away any obstructions, and the operation is
  repeated.
      The wine flows through        a hole into a small tub, called a
  carbou,     placed under the press.
      When the      three  pressures    have    been    effected,  the wine
v produced from thejuice is called vin d' elite, or choice wine.
  It is called in the language of the workmen vin de cuevee, or
  wine of the tub     ;  but of this expression      I highly disapprove,
   as  it gives an idea to strangers that the white wine          of Cham
   pagne is allowed to ferment (cuver) in tubs.
      This vin d' elite is carried from the carbou into a tub ad
  joining, in which it is allowed to deposit its lees and all other
   heterogeneous      matters  during the night        :  this tub is called
   the cuve de depot.
      After this v in d 'elite is extracted,     there still remains some
  juice in the husks of the grapes :              a new turn therefore is
   given to the screw of the press, and          the wine issues through
   a hole placed a little lower in       the   press   into another tub      :
                                                                         thw

           On the Vineyards and Wines           of Champagne.           143
this juice is called the first cut (premiere laille), and fre
quently enters into the composition of the vin d' elite. If
the wine is not already too vinous, the juice from this last
pressure is allowed to flow for about an hour, according to
the season or other circumstances.
     Another    pressure    is still giverf at a subsequent    period, and
the wine is called deuxieme           laille, or vin de lisanne, so much
called for at certain seasons.
    <U+2713>A third pressure      is sometimes given at another interval,
 and the wine is muddy, hard, and vinous.
     Lastly, a poorer kind of wine, called vin de rebec1iage, is
 produced by repeatedly             pressing the husks until they are
 perfectly dry      : these    operations are also called drying the
 husks.
      The vin d' elite, after having been allowed to remain all
 night in the tub, where it deposits its sediment, &c, is put-
 into new or well rinsed puncheons, and the juice from the
  subsequent pressures is successively treated in the same
  way.
 XXIV.        What     Use    is made      of the Wines last drawn off,
      which are generally very spirituous ; but which,             being co
      loured, cannot be mixed with the first Juices ?
       As it  has been experienced        that the Champagne wines of
  the    last  pressures,    notwithstanding their vinosity, are too
  weak, and would occasion too much waste of time and ex
  pense to distil them into brandy, it is found more advan
  tageous to sell them in the vineyards of inferior quality, in
   order to improve the poorer kinds of wine : they are some
   times sold also to inn-keepers, after a sufficient quantity
  has been retained       for the use of the domestics of the pro
   prietor.
       In  some places, however,          these wines are    distilled ;  but
   it  requires  from five to eight pieces        of  them   to make one
   piece   of brandy.
        [Articles 24,   25,    20,   27, and 28, regard the making          of
   red wine, and will be treated of under a separate head.]
                                                              XXIX. How

                          XXIX.         Hoiv     is Red   Wine made?
      The       for making red wine are managed with the
               grapes
 same precautions as those for white wine.
    The only difference consists in loosely depositing the
 grapes for making red wine in vessels for the purpose : these
vessels are covered, and their contents are allowed to remain
until     the first fermentation has begun in the colouring pelli
cle   of the fruit.
     This must, in                of fermentation, is deposited under
                                 a state
the press :          the same turns of the screw are given as to the
white grapes.
XXX. How                 are the     White Wines           managed            until   they are
                                       Jit for   drinking ?
   The white wine, when left in the state described at the
end of No. XXII., enters into fermentation, at first ra
pidly, and afterwards in a milder manner : when it has
gone through all these degrees of fermentation it becomes
clear; and when the weather is dry with a clear frost it is
racked off, being previously fined with a proper quantity of
isinglass.           With
                        pound    one               of Marseilles             isinglass forty
pieces of wine are fined.
XXXI.           What        is    the Process      of clarifying White Wines ;
                         and at what Age are they bottled ?
     The isinglass                           in order to divide
                            is prepared by breaking                  it,
it into small pieces        then diluted
                                 :   it    some wine drawn
                                          is                    in
from the puncheon.       When both are well mixed up to
gether,       introduced
               it   is    into the bung-hole of the cask, its
contents being briskly agitated with    staff or other instru

                            is              undergoes another    it
slight fermentation, until the coldness of the weather finally
settles it.
     One month or six weeks afterwards                         it   is     again racked      off;
and   a   slight proportion of isinglass                  is   added,        to bring   it   to   a
state     of   perfect limpidity.
                    XXX IL At             what Period      is   it   bottled?
     In   the month         of March           these wines are generally bottled.
                                                                            XXXIII.       How

   XXXIII.      Hoio is the Operation   of Bottling performed?
   The wine is drawn off into bottles well chosen, well rinsed,
 and of an approved manufacture : they arc corked with the
very best kind of corks : pieces of thread or iron wire are used
for fixing down the corks firmly ; the bottles are then put
into the cellar, and piled up on their sides.
   The elaboration of the juice not being completed when
the wine is    bottled,   a slight fermentation takes place in the
bottles.     About the middle of.August in the same year this
fermentation begins, and frequently there is a loss by the
end of September of five or ten per cent. from the bottles
breaking. This loss sometimes goes on increasing until next
year, according as the wines are more or less juicy or vinous.
   XXXIV.       Is it necessary to cover the Coi-ks with Wax ?
   It is not necessary      to  wax the corks when      the wine is
bottled  : this expense would be thrown away ; since about
 15 or 18 months after being bottled, when the wine has ex
hausted all its fermenting principles, and is to be sold and
sent off,  it must    be again disturbed, in order to undergo
the operations     pointed out in No. 38. This moving of the
wine consists of making a slight deposit disappear, which,
notwithstanding the first clarification, is indispensable in
the different operations necessary : Secondly, such bottles
must be filled up as have leaked or lost by filtration through
the corks, and the broken bottles are also to be removed.
XXXV. What           are the Faults to which White Wines are
               subject, either in Casks or Boltles?
   The faults to which white wines are most liable are mud-
diness (lagraisse), acidity, and sometimes also yellowness
of colour. White wine very rarely becomes muddy when
in the casks ; but this happens sometimes with bottled wines.
   The wine is said to     be greasy (gras)  when it is milky and
whitish, and when it       does not sparkle and   present   bubbles
on its surface when hastily poured out.
   When it is ascertained that this accident has happened,
care must be taken not to disturb' the wine, and the disease

generally cures itself by the next or following spring. The
whitish sediment turns brown, and deposits or attaches itself
to the bottle;            and the wine becomes once more diaphanous

      XXXVI.              What         are the Means used to remedy                            this ?
   When           the     season        has        beenrainy, the vintage wet, and
the juice is too waterv,                       this disease is very frequent; and
besides,          if    the white        is in more                abundance than                 the   red
fruit,      the        yellow disease is mixed with what is called the
greasy,       and in this case it is no longer fit for sale : it has a
disagreeable            taste,    and         is    of      the colour      of cider : nothing
can be done with                   it,    unless         it   is       mixed with common or
inferior red wines.
   Greasy wines must be cured                                by   time alone; and tbey very
rarely continue more than year                     a           in   this state.
     All    the        preservatives           recommended in books upon this
subject are             of no     avail   :     when employed, they are found to
injure the quality               of     the wine            instead        of improving it.
     Note. Acidity being more peculiar to red wines^                                               it   will
be treated  of under that head.
XXXVII.                 How      does   it    happen that               Half      of    the Bottles are
                        broken during the first                    Six Months            ?
     The breaking of                    the        bottles        is   owing         to several causes
more or less direct and more or less well ascertained.-
   It    depends          in the first place                  upon the choice and quality
of      wine; the time at which
      the                             put into bottles;   the it   is
quality of the glass  the nature of the cellar; the tempera
                                   ;
ture of the weather, and even on the way in which the bot
tles are packed.  We cannot therefore assign the exact cause
of this accident, so much connected with the phaenomena of
nature:  in general, however, when proprietor has ho more              a
 than twenty bottles broken                            in
                              one hundred he does not com
 plain.
 XXXVIII.                 When           White Wines                       deposit      a    Sediment     in
      Bottles,          what am          the Methods                   of   extracting         this Sedi-
      ment before sending     off         tliem               to their Place            of  Destination?
      The sediment in white wines, .when they                                           are not    spoiled
 in other respects,               is    made to disappear                    in   the   following       wav   :
                                                                                                          If

    If the wme is not muddy the operation         ii very simple :
it consists   in emptying the bottle with care, keeping it in the
precise direction in which it lay : the workman with a small
hook removes the iron wire which fixes the cork ; he then
uncorks the bottle, and presents in a perpendicular direction
another bottle to it quite empty and well rinsed, and pours
out all the wine, leaving the sediment, which, if the bottle
has not been shaken,      will remain at the bottom.
   Some persons      make use of a syphon, when the wine          is
not thick, in order to avoid all shaking.
   When the wine is thick the operation is more tedious and
more delicate : wooden planks aie made use of, in which
holes are made at proper distances, in order to receive         the
bottles  :  these planks being arranged, adjoining to the      col
lection of bottles, an intelligent and experienced work
man carefully takes a bottle from the heap, keeping it in
the same position in which it lay : he then gives it a slight
shake, and by a regular and long continued movement he
brings into the side of the bottle the sediment which is de
tached, and, without scattering it through the liquor, makes
it slowly descend to the neck : he then places his bottle
upon the plank which lies ready to his hand, inclining it in a
sloping direction : he afterwards does the same by a second,
a third bottle, &c, which he places in the same sloping
direction.
    four-and-twenty hours afterwards       the workman     returns
to the plank where he has deposited his bottles ; he once
more gives them a slight shake, and slopes them a little
more, in order to bring the sediment nearer to the cork : if
the sediment has then completely fallen down, and the wine
is limpid, the workman holds the bottle perpendicularly ele
vated, and does the same with all the rest of the bottles
placed upon the planks : he returns with his hook, uncorks
the bottles, and with a dexterous motion of the wrist turns
them upside down : the fixed air escapes and pushes out the
sediment, which      falls into  a receiver:  the workman     then
dexterously replaces the bottle upon its end, after allowing
nothing to escape, except what is necessary to render it lim-

  The wines of Champagne, after being put into circulation,
and having travelled  about, preserve their good qualities for
ten years   :but when they are kept in cellars, and particu
larly in those  of Champagne, which are superior from the
nature of the soil (being dug out of beds of chalk), they will
keep for twenty and thirty years.

to establish an equal current of air, the cellars should be dug
very deep: they, however, would be so expensive that few
proprietors could be prevailed on to adopt such      regulation.          a

ctllent plan, and where no expense has been spared.
 I   have never tried the temperature of the air of the cellars,
andI   cannot give any results upon this head.

    be more    pliant,    dat able,     and longer impervious to Water t
    than in the usual Mode.              By Mr. William Anderson,
    of His Majesty's Dock-Yard, Portsmouth*.
1 beg     leave to lay before the Society             of Arts, &c.,      the fol
lowing improvements and observations, which I hope will
be of service to the public.
    Having never heard or read of any method being disco
vered to prevent       paint when laid on canvass from hardening
to such      a  degree as to crack and eventually to break the
canvass, and render it unserviceable in a short time; and
having been an eye-witness for many years of much canvass
perishing for want of such discovery, in the immense quan
tities painted for covering seamen's hammocks, and for other
uses on board his majesty's ships ; I long hail it under con
sideration to find out such                an ingredient as, when mixed
-with paint, would preserve the canvass and pamt laid thereon
from the damages above mentioned : and after experiments
for   a considerable time, T have discovered                  such an article,
and made trial       of it with     effect above three years.
    The   canvass    I  have painted has been submitted to the in
spection of the Navy Board, who arc so perfectly satisfied
with my new method, that general directions are now given
to paint all canvass in his majesty's dock-yards in this man
ner; which, in addition to the advantages I have before men
tioned, actually saves an expense of o/ie guinea in every
hundred square yards of canvass so painted, as I have fully
Stated to them. The ingredient I use is not only serviceable
for ships'    canvass,    but also for canvass designed for paintings,
for floor-cloths, and for painted coverings within and with
out doors.       I have no doubt of it being applied to many
other purposes 1 am yet unacquainted with ; as, from actual
trials of near four years, I can vouch for its being a prcser-

vative to red, yellow, and black paints, when ground in oil
and put in casks. When the paints were examined at the
expiration of such time, they discovered no improper hard
ness; but when laid on the work with a brush, they dried
in    a   remarkable manner, without the addition of any of the
usual drying articles.    I still preserve some of these paints
for future trials, and I believe this plan of preserving co
lours will be of essential use to colourmen, and other per
sons who purchase colours for exportation.     The ingredient
I use is perfectly simple, being a solution of  yellow soap ;
and the composition for painting is made in the following
manner         :
      To one pound of             soap   I    add six pints     of water in     a vessel
over the fire         ;   in a few minutes after the boiling              of the water
the soap will dissolve              ;    whilst hot it is to be mixed with oil
paint, prepared as hereafter directed, and is then fit for im
mediate use.   The above quantity of soap solution will be
sufficient to mix with     one hundred weight of paint.     The
 first coat to be laid upon the canvass is to be entirely of this
 composition, without first wetting the canvass in the usual
 way.          A    very small proportion           of   it,   or none,   is   necessary
 in   the second coat         ;    and the third coat should be           of oil paint
 alone.
    The method heretofore practised in his majesty's dock
 yards for painting canvass, was as follows  The canvass           :
 was first wet with water, then primed with Spanish brown                              ;
a     second coat given            it    of   a   chocolate colour,       made     from
 Spanish brown and black paint     and, lastly, finished with
                                                    ;
 black.  This mode     destructive, and more expensive than
                                  is
 mine in the proportion before mentioned.     In my method,
 to ninety-six pounds of English ochre ground in boiled oil,
I  add sixteen pounds of black paint, being one-sixth  pro                       in
 portion of the ochre this, when mixed, forms an indif
                                   ;
 ferent black.            The solution,           made   of   one pound   of   soap and
 six pints of water,               is    to    be added to this paint,
                                                     and well
 united therewith   and without the canvass being previously
                            ;
 wet, this composition     to be laid upon the canvass as stiff
                                        is
 as can conveniently be done with the brush, and this first
 coat will form  tolerably smooth surface.
                          a                The second coat
                                                                                       is

Portsea, Oct. 31, 1806.                          at Portsmouth.
        SIR,
     Agreeably      to the request in your letter,      I have enclosed
 certificates relative to mv new method of painting canvass;
 and I take the liberty of informing you of a method of ob
 taining from painted canvass, unserviceable, the whole of
 the colour laid thereon, and to do it at a very small expense.
 This I discovered since I last wrote to you, and I believe it
 will  be  of considerable advantage to government, who, for
 want of such a thought, have buried and burnt immense
 quantities of ships'        hammock    cloths,   when found unser
 viceable, to prevent        embezzlement     from taking place.        I
 suggested    the idea    to  N. Diddems,     esq., builder of Ports
 mouth yard, who communicated it to the honourable George
 Grey, commissioner.           I obtained leave to make an experi
 ment, which I repeated thrice, and found that from one
 ton of painted canvass, unserviceable, I obtained, upon art
 average, four hundred weight of dry cplour, in value to
 government nine pounds six shillings ; the expense of the
 process not exceeding six shillings.
     This I effected by calcination, raking aside the ashes and
 sprinkling them with water, to prevent loss of paint through
  excess of heat.      Bypassing the calcined matter through a
  fine sieve, it is perfectly prepared for grinding; it grinds
  well, possesses a good body for covering with, and dries
  well with a good gloss. Its increase of bulk, in comparison
  with common colour of equal weight, gives it the advantage
  of covering more Work. The colours yielded by the calci
  nation of different coloured canvass areas follow: viz. Can
  vass which has been painted with black paint only, produces
  a  black colour.      Canvass finished black, but which has had
  a previous red or yellqw        ground,    will produce   a dark  cho

   Portsea, March 25, 1807.
 To C.    Taylor, M.D.          Sec,
     Certificates,    dated   March,   1607," were   received   from the
 following persons, viz.
    A. Stow, lieutenant and commander of the jrun-brig;
 Steady, stating, that in the preceding month of October he
 had received on board his ship a set of hammock cloths,
 painted after the method invented by Mr. William Ander
 son, which had been constantly in use since the time above
 mentioned,      and appeared fully to answer the end proposed,
 of rendering     the canvass soft and pliable, of preventing its
 cracking,    or   the paint peeling off, and which in the old
method had been a subject of much complaint.
    John Pridy,        lieutenant and commander of the Gladiator,
and formerly        commander       of  the  Dapper, on which latter
ship a set of hammock cloths, painted after Mr. Anderson's
method, appeared fully to answer the end proposed.
    P. F.   Wyatt,        oil- and colour-man,   Portsea, stating that
he had seen canvass painted after           Mr. Anderson's new me
thod, which,        after a trial of sixteen months, remained        per
fectly soft and pliable, the paint by no means cracking or
peeling off, and that the gloss was retained, though it had
been exposed to all weathers.            He fiyther added, that he
had seen the paint prepared by him from old painted canvass
found unserviceable, and had worked and painted there
with   ; that   it was, in his judgment, very good, and would
answer either on canyass, wood, or iron.
   Ns. Diddems,            master shipwright,      Portsmouth dock*
yard, stating,      that   Mr.  Anderson    had  proposed     to him to
obtain, by calcination, from old unserviceable painted can
vass, the paint which had been laid thereon ; that such ex
periment was made, and four hundred weight of dry ser
viceable    paint prepared from one ton of such canvass ; thaj

he had       seen it when ground in oil and laid on work,            when
it appeared to possess all the properties of good paint, and

         SIR,
    Inanswer to your letter of the 25th of April, in which
you informed me that the committee were desirous that I
should furnish them with a sample of canvass painted in the
old method, and another on my improved plan, I trust that
I  shall be able fully to comply with their request. In the
first place, I have sent a small sample of the residuum of
the burnt canvass, fit for grinding in oil for paint, also a
piece of canvass painted therewith, markedNo. 1; another
piece painted after the old method, marked No. 2; another
piece painted according to my process, marked No. 3 ; and,
lastly, a piece finished entirely with a new composition,
marked No. 4; each sample having received three coats of
paint.  Upon examining No. 2, you will find it becoming
from time to time more stubborn, in consequence of the paint
hardening       ;   and when a small ridge is formed in   it,   by   press

I      for the last three years, saved the labour of three
     have,
men out of four in grinding colours with the common mills
employed for that purpose. One mill has ever been con
sidered sufficient for a man to turn, whereas one man can
now, with          perfect      ease, turn four             mills; this is effected by
placing two mills on each                     side     of   the winch, so close as
only to leave room for the                    fly
                               wheel to play between them.
The spindles of each on either side are locked together                             by
                                                                                     a
small iron collar, with pin passing through it. The distance

length of the arm              is    one foot six inches from the spindles to
the bar across which the man clasps in order to turn.
   Fly wheels at the extremity are impediments. Necessity
was truly the mother of invention to me in this case, as                            I
had great demand     for paint, and   was not allowed men

 XXV.       Experiments on various Earths,          undertaken   with  the
      View of ascertaining whether they            are metallic Oxides.
     By David Mushet, Esq.
 The late interesting       experiments of Mr. Davy in metallizing
 soda and potash, have brought lo my recollection a train of
  experiments in which I was engaged eight years ago, with
  a  view to metallize some of the earths. Though considerably
  disappointed in my first attempts,- vet I have repeatedly re
  turned to the charge with increased hopes,            but without ob
  taining any thing like a perfect result.
      In giving    to the public a detail     of my experiments, it       is
  impossible that I should mean to bring them forward with
  any view to a comparison with the perfectly original and
  satisfactory results of Mr. Davy.           Our modes of operating
  were so totally different, that similar results could not be
  expected.       Should, however, any beneficial or useful pur
  pose arise from the knowledge           of the new metals ; then, so
  far  as a  simple mode of operation goes, my reasonings and
  practice may be of service to others who may engage in si
  similar undertaking.
                                                                       My

  iS8               Experiments on various Earths.
    My first experiments        were made      with pure earths, clay,'
silex, lime, barytes, and           strontian, considering them as
metallic oxides, whose oxygen might be carried off by pre
senting them with carbon at a high temperature, and secured
from the access of air.          This reasoning I carried into        prac
tice by cementation for hours, and sometimes for three or
four davs. Various earths were exposed imbedded in finely-
pounded charcoal.           These were afterwards freed from the
carbonaceous matter, and exposed to fusion in high heats
in a wind furnace. Clay and silex I found infusible under
the highest heat that could be urged,               l$arytes, lime, and
strontian,    were fused with various proportions             of charcoaf,
but no result occurred from which             any conclusion could be
drawn favourable to the idea of either a part, or the whole,
of   the  oxygen having been removed from the respective
earths, nor was it found that any loss of weight took place,
 (as is the case with iron ores,) which would not have oc
curred by simply         exposing these       substances     to  the  same
temperature.        The   glasses resulting from the different fu
sions were various in colour, whitish, opaque, brownish,
and black.       The only circumstance which indicated change
was in the     barytes, the different fusions of which always
gave a thin pellicle on the surface that never was resolved to
glass, but was always strongly alkaline. This, at the time,
I could not account for, nor till Mr. Davy's discoveries were
announced.        The probability      then appeared,     that this was a
portion of     the barytium,      which,    during the operation,      had
been metallized, but, in cooling, had again attracted              oxygen
from the atmospheric air, and had passed               into the state of
an alkaline earth.
    After many experiments,          I  at that time abandoned          the
pursuit,    and arranged      those specimens      of  glass    which   ap
peared most fit for        future examination,       should the subject
present   itself  under   any   new   shape.   Some    years afterwards,
having occasion otherwise to examine the boxes in which
these specimens were kept, I was much surprised to find,
that many     of   the   glasses   bad become converted into a fine
powder.      I  was    induced, from      a similar circumstance hav
ing taken place with        a glass  of  manganese,     to infer, that in
                                                                        tht

                    Experiments on various       Earth.              i5<$
the original       experiment a de-oxidation had taken place,
and that      by the reassumption of oxygen the present effect
had been produced.
     I then thought of pursuing some mode of operation which
would enable me to detect what proportions of oxygen were
united to the various earths.              This I thought of accom
plishing by a set of comparative experiments in the fusing
 of pure malleable iron with the different earths. Iron being
 a highly oxidable metal, the quantities             disappearing would
 indicate the comparative quantities of oxygen in each of the
 earths. This was with a view to form the most ample data
 for subsequent experiments, and to compare the alkalis
 with      alkaline    earths.       These   experiments embraced         a
 number of substances,            as  will be brought    forward in the
 detail.
      I. — 200  grains of calcareous earth (very pure Paris white),
  deprived of its carbonic acid, were mixed with 50 grains of
  iron filings : these were mixed together and exposed to a
  high degree of heat ; a perfect fusion of the eanh had taken
  place, which was now converted into a black glass of a deep
 jetty lustre. Two small but finely polished spherules of
  metal were obtained weighing 12 grains — loss by oxidation
   38 grains, or 76 per cent.            It may be proper to state here,
   that 50 grains of malleable iron filings, the same used in
   this and the following experiments, were fused per se in ten
   minutes, and the button formed in consequence weighed
   47  2 grains —loss only     7}  percent.  — oxidation in consequence
   of  the calcareous    earth nearly 70 per cent. more.
       II. — 100   grains of pure barytes and 50 grains of filings of
   malleable     iron   were fused together.          A black brownish
   opaque glass was obtained, and beneath a smooth-skinned
   metallic    spherule was found weighing 9' grains — loss 40\
    grains — equal to 8f per cent. From the portion of the earth
   to the iron in this experiment being double, in place of
    quadruple, as in the last experiment, it was inferred that 100
    grains of calcareous      earth would oxidate      19 grains of iron,
    whereas    100 grains      of  barytes   in this experiment oxidated
    4 1{  grains.
                                                                III.— 100

  I fid             Experiments on various Earths.
      III. — 100   grains of carbonate of barytes in a similar ex
 periment     oxidated    only 4 It grains of iron *.
      IV. — 100 grains of carbonate of strontian deprived of its
 carbonic acid oxidated 21 \ grains of iron.
      V. — 100 grains of potash oxidated 28 grains of iron.
      VI. — 100 grains of salt of lartar oxidated 22i grains of
 iron.
     VII. — 100    grains of calcined borax oxidated          3}  grains  of
 iron.
     VIII. — 100 grains of window         glass, composed of two parts
 of soda    and two    of Lynn-sand, oxidated 4{ grains.
     IX. — 100 grains of bottle glass oxidated 3 grains of iron.
     X. — l00grains of roasted ironstone, containing iron 48•5 ;
 oxygen 15'5; earths 36' = 100, oxidated 33 grains.
     XI. — 100    grains of manganese         in  a  similar   experiment
 oxidated 25    ± grains.
     It appeared from these experiments, that either barytes
contained the greatest dose of the oxidable principle, or that
it gave it out to iron with the greatest facility. It was there
fore fixed upon as the most proper subject for further expe
riment, the details of which I shall state as shortly as pos
sible.
    XII. — 100     grains of pure barytes were exposed to a heat
of 168° of Wedgwood.                An emerald-coloured glass was
obtained, which, in cooling, arranged itself into numerous
small squares ; the surface was covered with a crust or pel
licle very like an oxide of nickel.
    XIII. — l00grains of barytes mixed with 10 grains of
charcoal were exposed to the same heat.                The result was a
dark-green glass, accompanied with a similar saline crust,
rather more of a coppery colour.               The charcoal had disap
peared.
    XIV. — The      same experiment was repeated with 20 grains
of charcoal.       The fusion, though exposed to as high a heat,
was less perfect.        A greater quantity of the apparent oxide
was formed, and a proportionably less quantity of glass.
   * The result of this experiment being the same a: Experiment II., Mr. M.
has probablv made a mistake in copying his notes.
                                                   — Edit.
                                                              XV.— This

                  Experiments on various Earths.                161
    XV. — This    experiment was performed with 100 grains of
 pure  barytes,   200 grains of iron-stone, and 8 grains of
 charcoal.
    The reasoning which suggested the use of iron-stone pro
ceeded upon the supposition that the surface incrustation
was an oxide of barytes (barytium), effected to a certain
stage  of purity, in consequence of fusing pure barytes with
charcoal.     It seemed, probable that the addition of a second
affinity \vould, with the acid of the charcoal, tend to remove
the more fixed and ultimate portions of oxygen over which
the charcoal had no power. It was conceived that the iron
stone, not being saturated with oxygen, might withdraw a
portion of that supposed to exist in the partially revived ba
rytes, and tend to metallize the result. Malleable iron, as
in the other experiments, might have been used; but as this
would always have entailed the presence of a button of iron,
the result, it was supposed,       would be attended with some
uncertainly.      In   the  present experiment it was thought
proper to reduce the quantity of charcoal to eight grains,
lest any part   of the iron contained in the oxide might thereby
be revived.
   This experiment being        exposed  to  a similar heat as the
others,   a flat   blackish   mass was obtained weighing 270
grains — loss of    weight  in  the whole 38 grains.    The iron
stone alone ought to have lost 70 grains.         It was therefore
inferred, that some new combination had taken place, and
what in other experiments would have been volatilized, in
this, became fixed. When the mass was divided, it exhi
bited an uncommon appearance : the surface was covered
with a black de-vitrified glass ; the fracture showed a beau
tiful metallic crystallization and brilliancy, with some large
metallic plates not unlike carburet of iron.          Toward the
lower edges of the button the crystallization was very per
fect.   Although this mass had all the beauty and splendour
of   a metallic regulus,   yet  there  was  a great  deficiency  of
metalline property : it was eagerly brittle, and easily reduced
to a powder; exhibited little or no lustre in grain, or when
scratched with a knife point. This experiment was repeated
   Vol. 33. No.      130. Feb. 1809.            L            under

16-2                 Experiments on-varlous Earths.
under various temperatures,   but without being more suc
cessful in producing the metal in a state of greater purity.
     XVI. — 100grains of pure baryes, 200 of iron-stone, and.
10 of charcoal, fused together, gave the following result :
Surface a black shining glass of considerable thickness, co
vering a perfect crystallized regulus of the same matter as
was found in Experiment XV. The same want of metallic
property was evident iu this as in the last, though the spe
cific gravity of the mass was very much increased. On one
side (and not under the imperfect regulus of barytium) was
found a metallic spherule, supposed to be revived by the
addition of the two grains of charcoal —it weighed 1 \ grain.
  XVII. — 100 grains of pure harytes, 200 of iron-stone,
and    1 3 i-   of charcoal,    gave a result similar     to   the   former    in,
point of glass.            A  smaller and more perfect regulus was.
found under          it,   alongside of which, as in the former, was
found    ametallic spherule of iron weighing 10 grains.
     XVIII. — ldO grains of pure barytes, with 200- of iron
stone, and 20 of charcoal.                The result of   the fusion    of   this,
compound   presented something different from any    the                of
former.    button of iron was found weighing 33 grains
                A                                                              ;
this was surmounted                 by
                         a. black glass, which now con
tained no barytium.             Over this glass, and immediately on
the surface,        a   metallic crust presented itself.         It
                                                           was cry
stallized in small concentric  radii inclining to a brownish
silvery colour, and brightened   little under the file. It had,
                                            a
in every respect,   more metalline appearauce, and, so fat
                           a
aspolish, continuity of grain and lustre were concerned,
was much superior to auy of the former results.
  The same experiment was repeated again and again,
sometimes with increased doses of iron-stone and charcoal                       ;
but none of the results were more perfect than the present.
Despairing, therefore, of any thing more perfect with iron
oxide and charcoal,    was resolved to try the effect of mal
                               it
leable iron filings in place             of iron oxide.
                                          Having used all
the pure harytes in my possession, the following experi
ments were made with  fine crystallized specimen of car

mass was obtained, which evidently had been fused — weight
36 grains. Loss 4 grains, supposed to be carbonic acid.
It  was remarkable that the present result in cooling under
went several shades of colour chiefly metallic ; a green suc
ceeded by a vivid purple was the most decided.
    XXI. — 90     grains of this same carbonate, pounded small,
and 45 grains of iron filings were mixed together and fused:
the upper surface of the result was covered with a brownish
silvery enamel regularly crystallized, in small stars, each radi
ating; from a common centre.            The thickness of this me-
tallic crust was nearly one-sixteenth of an inch.            Its fraq-
ture presented brilliant     crystallized facets of a highly metal
lic  appearance.       Under the barytium was found a jet black
shining glass,      in which was inserted    a smooth button of iron
weighing 20 grains.         Beneath this button was another layer
of barytium regularly crystallized,        but of a less metallic ap
pearance than the upper stratum.             In this experiment 90
grains   of  carbonate   of  barytes   had  furnished   the mqans of
oxidating 25 grains of iron.
    XXII. — 50      grains of carbonate of barytes, and an equal
quantity of iron filings, gave by fusion a double stratum of
barytium.       Interposed between was a layer of black glass ;
the crystallization and brilliancy of the upper stratum and
the general    appearance    of  the whole were very similar to the
last experiment.        The button of iron found in this result
weighed 33 grains.         Loss   17 grains oxidated by 50 grains
of  carbonate    of barytes.
    This experiment was repeated with various proportions of
the carbonate        of barytes and the iron, and with greater
quantities    of matter,   yet none of them were so perfect as
those detailed in the foregoing experiments.           Greater quan
tities of the apparent regulus were obtained, all tending to
the same crystalline arrangement, but inferior in point: of

     I next varied the experiments in the following manner :
Iron ore was dc-oxygenated almost to a state of metallic pu
rity.     The ore in this state consisted of 90 parts of iron,
with which      a little oxygen was siill combined,    and 10 part3
of calcareous earth.
     XXIII. — 280 grains of this    ore, and 280 grains   of carbo
nate    of barytes were fused together, and the result was as fol
lows    :  A double stratum of the reguline matter was formed;
the upper evidently more metallic than         that below ; yet the
general appearance       of this was less metallic than the results
of Exper. XXI        and  XXII.   The button of iron    was covered
on its surface with a silvery-white circle delicately crystal
lized in the starry form peculiar to the barytium ; and this
being the first crystallization of that form I had ever seen on
iron, I     was led to infer that an  alloy had taken     place  be
 tween the iron and the metal      of the barytes. The weight of
 t'lis button was found to be 172 grains.          Loss 108 grains
 of matter, which, taken at the rate of 90 per cent. of metal
in the ore, gives the quantity of iron oxidated by 280 grains
 of barytes 9 7ro- grains, or 34-fL grains of iron from 100
 grains of carbonate of barytes,      a  result but little different
 from the last experiment.
      Similar experiments were performed with various propor
 tions of the barytes and de-oxygenated ore; and correspond
 ing results were obtained. When the iron existed in equal
 portions to the barytes, a quantity of crystallized regulus
 was obtained nearly equal to one half of the result — the
 other half being always a black glass. When a greater pro
 portion of iron filings was used, and to the extent of two
  parts to one of the barytes, a greater proportion of the re
  gulus was obtained ; but then the experiment was difficult to
  manage, from the great heat necessary to fuse so large a re
  lative proportion     of malleable iron, without destroying the
 barytes altogether. On the contrary, when the carbonate of
 barytes or pure barytes were used to the extent of two parts
  to one of iron filings or oxidated iron, the mass was chiefly
  resolved into a g^ass, and the greatest part of the iron was
  oxidated : the quantity of regulus small, and a perfect re
   sult always precarious, from the violent action of the barytes
                                                                upon

 upon the clay of the crucible.           In this respect barytes re
 sembles some rich oxides of iron, which are totally uucon-
 finable in a clay crucible at a high temperature.
    After making two hundred experiments without having
 obtained, what I thought, a perfect globule or regulus of
 pure metal, I abandoned the subject till new reasonings and
 after-reflection should point out any new tract which             was
 likely   to lead  to more    success.     I was satisfied that I  had
 obtained an approach to metal, and was even convinced that
 the metal at one part    of the operation was more decidedly so
 than it afterwards appeared to be when examined cold : but
 I was not at all satisfied that the regulus I had obtained
 was in its ultimate state of purity.
    Disappointed in my hopes of success with barytes, my
 experiments on lime and strontian were few ; but limited as
 they were, 1 was convinced that they were similar com
 pounds, and capable of decomposition.             I did not succeed
 in obtaining so compact reguli as with the barytes, but both
 of them showed metallic crystallization upon the surface,
although apparently more volatile and destructible than those
 of barytes.
    Should   I at any future time     increase my experiments on
these substances,     and should the results point       to any thing
new and likely to be      beneficial, I shall communicate them.
I am confident that an increased knowledge on the subject
of lime-stone will prove highly interesting to the manufac
turer of iron.     The single circumstance of its being a me
tallic substance combined with oxygen, and as such acting
its part in the operations of the smelting furnace, will enable
him to explain facts that cannot be reconciled to any past
reasoning or knowledge on the subject.
    In regard to silex or clay, considered as metallic oxides,
I have been able to ascertain nothing decisive. They seem
not    (judging from     the   experiments I have made) in the
most distant manner allied to the other three earths, though
they may be more akin to each other. Jt is possible that
silex may prove to be clay completely deprived (or nearly so)
of  all its moisture.   Or, in other words,     that clay, by fire or
other natural processes, becomes oxygenated          to such an ex-

 XXVI.       Proposal    for  altering the Scale      of  the Thermometer.
              By Richard Walker, Esq.,                   Oxford.
       To Mr. Tilloch, — Sir,
 A beg     leave to announce, through the medium               of your useful
 Miscellany,       an intention I have of offering to the public
 notice an alteration in the scale of the thermometer, which
  many of my friends, as well as myself, have adopted, from
  a persuasion of its being founded on the truest principle.
      The alteration I shall      suggest,    and   which presented itself
  during the long course         of my thermometrical experiments,
  I shall only briefly state now, reserving a fuller account of
  the reasons which induced me to adopt the scale I now pro
  pose to another opportunity.
      The two     fixed points,    viz.,  the freezing and boiling points
  of water,     as   they  have    hitherto been,      will probably never
  fail to be    continued,     as   being perfectly       sufficient for the
  accurate adjustment         of thermometers.
      The commencement of the scale, and                 the number    of di
  visions, only appear to claim attention. With respect to the
   first, since neither of the extremes of heat or cold (to speak
   familiarly) are likely to be ascertained, the hope of fixing
   0 at either of these may be entirely relinquished, and it re
   mains to fix 0 at the fittest intermediate point.
       Hence     I    presume to propose the following mode of
   graduation,      stating briefly the principle on which I pro-
   peeded.     Having     ascertained     that the temperature      of C-2°   of
   Fahrenheit      is the temperature       at which the human body in
   health is conscious of no inconvenience from heat or cold,
   and that a deviation from that point of only one or two de
   grees, above or below, actually produces that effect, under
   ordinary circumstances,          I fixed my zero or 0 there.
       With   respect to     the   divisions,   I  adopted    those  of Fah
   renheit, from an opinion of that being the fittest,              consider
                                                                            ing

 ing   those   of Reaumur,      the centigrades,    &c,    as  being too
 few, and decimal divisions           unnecessary    in a thermometri-
 ca! scale.
    Hence it will follow, that 0 being placed at 62° of Fah
 renheit, 150° will be the boiling, and minus 30°, the freez
 ing points of water       ; and    all other points on Fahrenheit's
 scale   may    be reduced     to this,  by subtracting 62 for any
 degree above 0    of Fahrenheit     ; and adding 62 for any degree
 below 0.
    I shall only add, at present, that there is a very convenient
mechanical mode of adjusting this scale in the construction
 of thermometers.
    For ordinary meteorological purposes,          a scale  of this kind
extending to 65 degrees above 0, and          as many degrees below
0, will be sufficient.

XXVII.       On the Difference between the Products obtained
    by Distillation of recent and of dried Vegetables.                 By
   Mr. Garden, of Old            Compion Street, London*.
That       most recent vegetable bodies during the process of
desiccation undergo a material change in their external ap-                .
pearances     becomes evident     from mere inspection ; but that
an alteration frequently takes place in their physical proper
ties, and also among their constituent principles, by that
process,    has not,    perhaps,   in every    case,   been   so clearly
established.
   Our knowledge indeed of the physical properties of vege
table substances,      obtained from an acquaintance with their
chemical composition, has hitherto made but little progress;
arising, mo doubt, from the exceeding alterability of their
nature, when subjected to those processes usually employed
for disuniting their component parts ; some of their ingre
dients being too volatile to be retained, while others become
so modified by the action         of   moderate   temperatures,      as to
                        Communicated by  Mr. Garden.

render it difficult to trace      the precise order   of union which
those elements maintained in the original compound. Thus
it is found that vegetables, both of the noxious and escu
lent kind, yield by that species of chemical decomposition
which       is effected  by fire, the same common           elementary
principles;      whence it follows, that the precise        nature    of  a
vegetable cannot be determined            by the mere    knowledge of
its constituent parts.
     When the recent leaves of vegetables are exposed to a de
gree of heat but little exceeding the medium temperature of
our climate, an evident change is quickly produced ; their
bulk becomes greatly diminished , their colour less vivid;
the fragrance,       if they possessed any, is in most cases con
siderably impaired, and in some instances totally destroyed :
it will   also be found that a considerable loss of weight ha9
been sustained.
    These obvious changes may chieflv be referred to the
evaporation of aqueous moisture, dissipation of the aroma,
and loss of a portion of the volatile or essential oil.             That
this last effect does not take place is an opinion entertained
by some practical operators, who maintain, that from those
vegetables      containing essential oil, the greatest quantity may
be obtained       by previous drying before they are submitted to
 the process     of distillation.
     It is not my intention either to combat          this opinion      or
 to enter into a detail respecting the chemical composition              of
 vegetable bodies, but simply to state the following                 fact,
 which has lately come under my observation.
     A  quantity of the dried leaves of peppermint (mentha pi
 perita), which had been included in casks well closed for
  nearly two years, and apparently in a state of good preser
 vation, were exposed to distillation, with a view to obtain
  the essential oil.       The operation was conducted in a com
  mon still furnished with a connecting refrigeratory,' and the
  products received in an Italian recipient, such as is usually
  employed for the separation of the lighter essential oils.
  After   a   considerable quantity of the fluid had distilled, and
  that which remained tasted but little of the plant, the pro
  cess was discontinued.          On examining    the  receiver,   it was
                                                              observedi

     On the Distillation     of recent and of dried Vegetalles.      1 69
observed,      that  the   produce of essential oil was excessively
small, notwithstanding the quantity of leaves which had
been operated       upon amounted nearly to 40 pounds.
     Apprehending some mismanagement in the operation,
another quantity similar to the preceding was introduced into
the still ; attending at the same time to every circumstance
which could possibly be imagined to facilitate the develop
ment of the oil. A piece of basket-work was placed in the
bottom of the still, and a quantity of water was added suf
ficient to give       fluidity to the mass, and prevent the possi
bility of empyreuma taking place; added to these, the boil
 ing point was attended to with care, and the first portions
 of   the  distilling liquid   were suffered only to drop slowly from
 the condensing vessel.
      In this last operation, however, the value of the products
 did not differ materially from that of the preceding ; and the
  result of several subsequent distillations appeared to show
  that the essential oil could not be obtained from the dried
  plant in    a proportion equal to that afforded when in a recent
  state.
      In  the respective    operations it was observed,   that although
  the produce      of oil  was comparatively inconsiderable,      its ab
  sence    seemed     to be balanced by an abundant produce             of
  water highly       impregnated, both with the taste and flavour
  of   the plant.
       This circumstance      appears   to warrant the presumption,
   that the herb, notwithstanding the length of time which it
   had been enclosed in the casks, had not suffered so much
   deterioration    as the diminished produce of oil might seem to
   indicate;    for although the essential oil did not appear in an
   uncombined state, its particles may have undergone some
   peculiar modification, in virtue of which it was rendered
   more soluble, and hence the increased quantity of highly
    impregnated water may be accounted for.
       The addition of alkaline substances in small proportions
    has been supposed by some to accelerate the evolution of
    volatile oils from their bases : in the present case this expe
    dient was not productive       of any remarkable   effect.

 XXVIII.      Report on a Manuscript Work of M. Andre,
   formerly known under the Name of P. Chrysologue de
    Gy, entitled A Theory of the actual Surface of the Earth.
    By MM. Hauy, Levierre, and Cuyier.                           Read to
    the Class of Mathematical and Physical Sciences in the
    National Institute*.
As this is the    first opportunity which has hitherto presented
itself of entertaining    the class with geological subjects, it will
not perhaps be considered foreign to our purpose to make some
general reflections on the manner in which a society such as
ours may and ought to consider this kind of researches.
    The natural history of unorganized bodies, commonly
called crude matter, or minerals, is divided into two principal
branches.      In the one we examine each of these bodies by
itself, and in its physical and chemical properties, and hence
determine its distinctive characters, and its rank in the ge
neral system.      This   part has more      particularly retained the
name     of mineralogy,    which has almost always been culti
vated by men      of talents,    and  has now attained       a degree   of
precision and exactness,       equal, at least,       to that of all  the
other physical sciences.
    The object of the other branch of the history of minerals
is the reciprocal position of their different species, and of
the masses composed of one or more of these species.                 It is
this branch which       teaches us    what materials constitute the
vast extent   of countries, what others are confined to vacan
cies, crevices,    and fissures of the preceding ; it shows us
what substances      respectively   form the great chains, inferior
mountains, ridges, and plains ; it is especially occupied with
the super-position of minerals, and enables us to distinguish
between those which always bear, and those which always
surmount others, or, in a word, to discover the order of the
different strata.     To this branch is given the appellation of
geology, geognosy, or physical geography, according to the
extent and profundity of the researches.
   It  is evidently a science susceptible      of   as   much accuracy
as  mineralogy properly so called.         To give it this quality,

it is only         necessary   to treat   it  all the natural sciences
                                               as
ought to be ; that is to say,         to collect with care the parti
cular facts, and to deduce no general conclusions until these
facts are collected in sufficient numbers, observing
                                                       always,
the rigid rules of logic.
     It
     is also evident that this science constitutes a part             of na
tural history not less indispenable to the knowledge                  of the
globe than mineralogy itself.      It is to the latter, what the
history of the climate, soil, and situation proper to each
plant is to botany.   Its utility to society, if it were once
completed, would be no less evident. By it we direct our
researches for divers minerals, and by the same means an
ticipate the difficulties and expenses attending numerous
works, which could not otherwise be known but by expe
rience. Thus, our engineers could not calculate the expense
of                  conduit to substitute for the machine at
      a subterraneous
Marly    geology taught them that at this place they could
               :
expect to find nothing but chalk.
  The miners, who are more interested than any other art
ists to possess this kindof knowledge, have made it a par
ticular study, according to the class of minerals in which
they are engaged.   They have determined the characters of
.mountains  with metallic veins, and know perfectly the
countries where there is nothing to be found, and those
where something may be gained. But from the very na
ture of the motives by which they are influenced, they have
almost entirely neglected to .examine districts poor in metals.
It is thus that in our vicinity each workman knows but the
kind of quarries in which he works. He who seeks plaister
of Paris neither knows what is above nor what is below the
strata      of gypsum    :   the quarrier is ignorant that under him is
potter's clay, &c.
   He who is the least acquainted with science, will feel that
a study which furnishes data with regard to all the
                                                         useful
minerals, similar to those of the miners on metallic

it extended to all the known minerals, it would form an
equally agreeable and curious branch of natural philosophy.

final result.          In   a   word, from          a   science      of facts        and obser
vations      it   has changed          into   a   tissue   of   hypotheses             and con
jectures,      so vain and socontradictory that        become              it   is               al
 most impossible to pronounce its name without          smile.                   a
   At  first fossils and petrifications were considered   as lusus
naturce, without        considering what   really meant.  But
                                                            it
when     a    more profound study had shown that their general
forms,        their texture, and     many cases their chemical
                                               in
composition, were the same as those of analogous parts in
living bodies, became necessary to admit that these objects
                       it
had also possessed life, and that consequently they had ex
isted at the surface of the earth, or in the waters of the sea.
How did they become buried under immense masses of
stones and earth How were marine bodies transported to
                            ?
the summits of mountains? But above all, How was the
order    of    climates reversed, so that we find the produc
               the
tions of the torrid zone near the pole                      ?
   When      was perceived that almost the whole surface of
               it
the globe was thus covered, the general and powerful causes
-which had so dispersed them began to be considered.     Ge
nesis, and the traditions of almost all Heathen nations, of
fered one, to which               it   was    natural that philosophers should
first have recourse          :    it   was    the    deluge.          The petrifications
passed as      proofs of        it;    and during nearly          acentury the works
on geology consisted either of efforts                          to find the physical
causes of this great catastrophe, or to deduce from                                    it   as   an
effect   the      actual state         of the     surface       of   the globe.             Their

February          2. — The reading     of Mr. Troughtort's   paper on
the    Division of Mathematical Instruments by ocular Inspec
tion was concluded.            One of the methods adopted was the
use of a roller one-sixteenth the diameter of the circle to be
divided.      The description of this principal       instrument the
author has deferred till       a future communication.
    A    most curious and interesting paper by Mr. Davy was
 read, giving an account of various experiments on the ac
tion of potassium on ammonia, from which it appears, that
a considerable quantity         of nitrogen can be made to disap
 pear,    and can be regenerated.       When it disappears, nothing
 is obtained     in  its place but oxygen and hydrogen ; and when
 it  is formed,    its elementary matter is furnished by water.
     There seem to be, at present, only two modes of ex
 plaining these extraordinary and entirely unlooked-for re
 sults : i. e. that nitrogen is either a compound of hydrogen
 and oxygen, — or, which is the most probable, that hydro
 gen, nitrogen, ammonia, water, and the nitrous compound,
 all contain the same ponderable elementary matter, and that
  their different forms depend upon different electrical states.
 The     paper concluded by stating that the author was still pur
  suing this inquiry, so intimately connected with the whole
  arrangements of chemistry and metcorplgy.
      Feb. 9. — Dr. Young furnished a series of numerical tables
  of  the elective attraction    of acids with alkalis,   by means   of
  which 100 figures are made to represent the affiuities of 100
  different salts, which would otherwise require above 5000
  words to express.
      Feb.   16. —   A   paper by    Mr. Brodie, describing    a  twin
                                                                foetus.

      foetus,    nearly the full size, seven months old, and without
      either heart, liver, or gall-bladder, was read. This was con-
  .   sidered the best formed foetus which has hitherto been known             •
      without     a heart,    although the author cited a considerable
      number.        It  appears that all such children have been twins,
      and that the present was quite          as  large   as the  other foetus
,    which      had its organs complete.
         Gapt. Burney furnished two papers, one on the motion of
     heavy bodies in the Thames, detailing some experiments
     with    loaded     sticks, to ascertain why loaded barges sailed
     faster than the current,         or than unloaded barges ; but his
     experiments only tended to confirm the fact that the heaviest
     end of a pole always went first with the current. The other
     was   a  plan for measuring a ship's way at sea, by means of
    a steel-yard and line, where £ pound weight should indicate
     a mile, or more or less, according to the power of the in
     strument.
         Feb. 23. — A letter from Mr. Knight to the President was
     read, containing some further observations on the sap of
     trees,    the formation      of radicles from    the bark, and also that
    of   the buds from the         same    source, instead of their being
    produced       from    the  alburnum,    as supposed.
        A paper of Mr. Home's, on a peculiar joint discovered
    in the squalus maximus (basking shark), lately cast on the
    sea shore, was laid before the Society, accompanied by a
    drawing. More interesting particulars respecting the stomach
    of this fish are to form the subject of another communication.

XXXI.       Remarks on Hygrometry,           and the Hygrometer            of
    J.  Berzelius.        In  a  Letter from Air.        J.   Gough,       to
    Mr. Tilloch.
                                              Middleshaw,   Feb. 25, 1809.
      SIR,
Perhaps         few additions could be made at present to the ap
paratus    of  a  meteorologist, which would prove more accept
able; than    a  cheap and correct hygrometer.         Various attempts
have been       made    to improve    the   instrument,       which have
commonly ended in adding to its sensibility : but such con
trivances seem intended to amuse the superficial observer,
rather than to assist       the lover of meteorology.            It is the
business    of those who cultivate this science, to determine
the comparative humidity of the atmosphere, not only as it
is found in different parts of the world, but also as it varies
with situation in the same country.            This project would be
carried into effect with the greatest ease and certainty, by
diminishing the sensible powers of the hygrometer rather
 than by improving them. The preceding proposal is far
 from being new; for the same notion respecting hygrometry
 occurred to Dr. Franklin, so long ago as the year 1764.
The idea was suggested to the Doctor by an incident, which
 proves the atmosphere to be drier in Pennsylvania than it is
 in England and France. The Doctor's thoughts on the sub
ject appeared in the first volume of the American Philo
 sophical Transactions, under the form of a letter addressed
 to Mr. Nairne, of London, in 1780 : and it is superfluous
 to add that his sentiments are delivered            with    the  elegance
 and perspicuity       which distinguish      the productions       of this
 great  man.
    I have entertained an opinion for some time past, that a
 common artist might construct an instrument which would
 answer the purposes already specified; and a few experi
 ments were made under my direction three or four years
 ago, which were far from discouraging the hope. The plan
 of   the hygrometer       here alluded to is very simple,         and   will
 be easily understood from the        following description,        assisted
 by the annexed       figure.
     Vol.  33.   No.   131.  March   1809.              M                  In

    In Plate VI. Fig. 5, AD            represents    a scale made     of brass,
writing slate, or marble ; in which the right line EF, nine
or ten inches long, is divided into one hundred equal parts.
This part of the instrument being prepared, take a square
rod of wood, cut across the grain ; it must be four or five
inches in length, and not niore.than a quarter of an inch in
diameter : this is represented in the plate by the rectangles
PL, QK and MN. One surface of this rod must be
marked longitudinally              by a coloured line, which is de
noted in the figure by EG and FH.                         After the rod ha3
been thus marked,            it must be suspended            for several days
in the air of a close vessel containing a quantity of quick
lime or dry potash, either of which will extract the mois
ture from the wood and bring it to a state                   of great dryness.
When        the  piece     is removed      from     the    vessel,   apply the
end     PE    to the    line     PO, making        E  coincide with the top
of   the divided      line   EF,    and mark the place         of G,   the op
posite extremity        of    the line   EG.      In   the next place, sus
 pend the rod for several days, in              the   air   of  a close   vessel
 containing a quantity of water, by which precaution the
 wood will become saturated with moisture. This being done,
 apply the end QF to the right line PQ, making F coin
 cide with the bottom           of the divided line       EF,   and   mark the
 place   of H the other extremity of FH. Lastly, draw the
 right   line  GH, which compk-tes the hygrometer. As oft
 as you wish to make an experiment with this instrument,
 make the end PE of the tod PL coincide with the divided
 line    EF, taking       care    that the point        G falls in     the  line
 GH,      and observe the degree marked              by E, which        denotes
 the state of the hygrometer. The figure MN shows how
 this is to be done ; and it is placed in a situation which
 makes the point E coincide with 50°.
     I  have not the presumption             to compare        this apparently
 insignificant     contrivance with           the   elegant     hygrometer of
 M. De Luc.         It  has,    however,     the   recommendation of sim
  plicity ; and a    common artist might construct a number of
  them with little trouble and at little expense.                  They should
  all be cut from the same board, and made to the same scale;
  after which,     those rods should         be furnished       with  plates re
                                                                      sembling

  sembling the original one, and preserved for use, and which
  were found upon trial to give correspondent results in diffe
  rent parts of the scale.        Dr. Franklin recommends slips of
  mahogany for hygrometrical purposes : my experiments,
 however, were made with rods of old dry deal, answering
  the preceding description.        The  preference   was given to this
 kind   of wood, because         temperature    has but little effect on
 its dimensions ; besides        which,   I did not recollect at the
 time the recommendation given to mahogany by the cele
 brated philosopher of America.
     Perhaps, sir, I should never have troubled you or any other
 journalist with the preceding trifle, had it not been for a
  paper which appears at the 39th page of your present vo
  lume. This is a description of a hygrometer recommended
  to the public,   by the inventor       J. Berzelius,   on the suppo
 sition that   Mr. Dalton's theory of       mixed gases is consistent
 with    the  phaenomena        of meteorology.      In attempting to
 vindicate the merits of his instrument, this foreigner asserts,
  that Dalton has proved the water of the atmosphere to be
 independent     of the air. To this we may reply, It is a fact
 established    by different philosophers of the last century, that
 water assumes the form of a gas under an exhausted receiver
 at any temperature      greater than 32°.     It has also been shown
 by M. De Luc, that         the presence   of  air retards the produc
  tion of the aqueous       gas; but I will venture to say that M.
 Berzelius goes too far when he asserts that           Mr. Dalton    has
 proved the water of the atmosphere to be independent of the
 air.   The perfect freedom of atmospherical vapour is un
 questionably a favourite opinion with this gentleman ; but
in what     part of his works, or in what manner,         i3 the propo
 sition demonstrated      ?    An explicit answer to this question
 is absolutely necessary      ; because M. Berzelius has' adopted
 principles in the construction          of his hygrometer,       which
must remain precarious until the subject in debate has been
.decided in favour     of the new hypothesis. M. Berzelius's re
marks on Mr. Dalton's table, exhibiting the expansive force
of vapour,     have nothing to do with        the business    of hygro-
metry, so long      as the   preceding uncertainty can be objected
to the opinions     of  the latter gentleman.       This  table may be

 1 SO                    Remarks on Hygrometry,
true when confined to the phenomena               of vapour produced in
a   vacuum   ;   but  I  am convinced     that  it fails in point of ac
curacy when air is present, even if the experiment be made
in Mr. Dalton's own manometer.
    Every one who allow s 1he justice of the preceding argu
ments must refuse his assent to           M. Berzelius, when       he says
that the     hygrometer should         discover to what column           of
mercury the water gas of the air belongs ; because we are far
from being certain that the air contains any water gas at all.
    The foregoing remarks relate to the hypothesis which
suggested the hygrometer in question. As for the instrument
itself, it cannot possibly have any just claim to correctness,
before the following proposition is fairly established, in con
junction     with    the other new doctrines already mentioned.
The    substances     of which     these  hygrometers have been or
shall be made, exercise no attractive force on the aqueous
gas; on the contrary, they only diminish the temperature of
this gas ; in consequence of which, part of it is condensed
upon the cooling surface by the pressure of the rest. Hence
it follows, that if this gas be equally cooled at the same in
stant by two different substances,           it will fall in  the form   of
water, and       in equal quantities, upon them both.             Various
experiments,        which   I have   made   at different   times, enable
me to pronounce the proposition to be incorrect; conse
quently the instrument of M. Berzelius cannot be admitted
into the apparatus of a meteorologist under the name of a
hygrometer. To state this objection more clearly, let me be
understood to say, that if any one would try two instru
ments of the kind at the same time, one of which consisted
of glass   and the      other of tin or silver, they would          assign
different expansive forces to the water gas of the atmosphere,
by beginning to condense it at different degrees of tempera
ture.    Besides,     if  we advert to some experiments by         Count
Rumford,       it is evident that glass attracts water from the at
mosphere when we suspect nothing of the kind, and that a
glass globe is frequently covered with a thin film of dew
when it is supposed to be dry. Moreover, the experiments of
M.    De Luc inform us that the phaenomena of the hygrome
ter succeed in a vacuum,         where it would be absurd        to ima
                                                                     gine

  gine the vapour to be condensed by a refrigerating principle
   residing in the whale-bone. — What are the genuine inferences
  from these facts ?      1st, That glass and other substances rob
  the   atmosphere of water by an attractive force ; and that a
  loss of temperature does nothing more than prepare the air to
  part with its moisture more abundantly : 2dly, That the at
 traction of the hygrometer is resisted by a similar, hut op
 posite power, residing in the atmosphere itself : 3dly, That
 the phaenomenaof the instrument are to be explained by the
 mutual reaction of these contrary forces.
     There is one circumstance which renders the hygrometer
 of little or no use to the advocates of the new hypothesis :
 for,   if I  understand them rightly, a barometer will supply
 the place of the other instrument in their opinion. The au
 thor of this system maintains the joint pressure of the per
 manent gases to be 20*.56 inches of mercury at all times and
 places, I suppose on the level of the sea. This being ad
 mitted, it will follow, that the same joint pressure may be
 found for any height ; consequently, if this given quantity
 be subtracted from an observed elevation of the barometer,
 the remainder will express the expansive              force of the
 aqueous atmosphere       for the time and place. If this be what
they    mean,   it  must convince   every meteorologist that their
 opinion cannot explain the changes that frequently take
place in the weight of the atmosphere. For instance, if the
hypothesis be true, the force of the aqueous atmosphere
ought to be greatest in summer, and the barometer to be
highest at the same season ; — but this is not the case.          On
the contrary,      the maximum of elevation      commonly happens
after the winter       solstice, and  the   minimum too; for the
barometer frequently rises during January to 30-60 or higher;
i. e. the force of the atmospherical vapour is equivalent to
one inch      of mercury or more.        The preceding conclusion
cannot be reconciled both to observation and the hypothesis ;
for   the thermometer very seldom reaches 48°, at least in
Westmoreland,        during the month of Jmnary; consequently
the force    of the aqueous     atmosphere   is never equal to -^,ths
of    an inch   of mercury in this county       at that season ; and
the hypothesis seems to confine the range          of  the barometer

    I will conclude this long letter by the bare relation of the
following experiment, which was made in a room where a
fire is kept in winter. — February 21, 1609, De Luc's hy
grometer stood at 52°, the thermometer at 50°, and the ba
rometer 29*88 inches. It is proper to remark here, that the
force of the permanent gases at Middleshaw cannot exceed
 29-22 inches by the hypothesis,        and must      be considerably
less by observation ; consequently         the   pressure  of  the   va
pour was greater than •66       of  an inch. A silver vessel con
taining a quart or more had been placed near the thermo
 meter at the commencement'of the experiment, which be
 came covered with     a very    thin  film of dew when cooled
 down to 40°.                                  I am, &c.,

 III. Of the Propagation    of an Impulse through      an elastic Tube.
 The     same reasoning that is employed for determining the
velocity of an impulse, transmitted through an elastic solid
 or fluid body, is also applicable to the case of an incom
 pressible fluid contained in an elastic pipe ; the magnitude
 of the modulus being properly determined, according              to the
 excess   of pn *sure which any additional tension        of  the   pipe
 is capable of producing ; its height being such, as to produce
 a tension, which is to any small increase of tension pro
 duced by the approach of two sections of the fluid in the
 pipe, as their distance to its decrement : for in this case the
 fore v= concerned are precisely similar to those which are em
 ployed in the transmission of an impulse through a column
 of air enclosed in a tube, or through an elastic solid. If the
 nature of the pipe be such, that its elastic force varies        as the
                                                                 excess

    extent, which is nearly the usual constitution of elastic bo
    dies, it may be shown that there is a certain finite height
    which will cause an infinite extension, and that                                                the height
    of   the modulus               of elasticity, for each point, is equal to half
    its height above               the base of this imaginary column ; which
    may therefore be called                 with propriety the modular column
    of   the pipe:              consequently the velocity of an impulse will be
    at every point equal to half                       of   that which is due to the height
    of       the     point       above        the base ; and           velocity of an im

    pulse ascending through the                             pipe being every where half as
    great as that           of a   body falling through the corresponding point
    in   the modular column,                      the whole time                of   ascent     will      be pre-
'
    cisely twice                as great as       that of the descent                     of        the   falling
    body;          and in         the same manner               if       the pipe be inclined,                    the
    motion of the impulse may be compared with that of a body
    descending or ascending freely along an inclined plane.
      These propositions may be thus demonstrated i let a be
    the diameter of the pipe in its most natural state, and let
                                                           J

    c, the tube being so constituted that the tension may vary
    as the         force.        Then the relative force of the column                                    c is re
    presented by be, since its efficacy increases, according to the
    laws of hydrostatics, in the ratio of the diamoter of the tube;
    and this force must be equal, in a state of equilibrium,                                                        to

a   conical pipe, or diverges spherically from a centre, varies
in   the simple inverse ratio of the distance from the vertex or
centre, or in the inverse subduplicate ratio of the number of
particles affected, as might naturally be inferred from the
general     law of the preservation of the ascending force or im
petus,     in  all cases of the communication of motion between
elastic bodies, or the particles of fluids of any kind. There
 is also another way of considering the subject, by which a
 similar     conclusion may be formed respecting waves diverg
 ing   from,    or converging to, a centre. Suppose a straight
 wave to be reflected backwards and forwards in succession,
 by two vertical surfaces, perpendicular to the direction of its
 motion ; it is evident that in this and every other case of
  such reflections,      the pressure against the        opposite surfaces
 must be equal, otherwise the centre of inertia of the whole
  system of bodies concerned would be displaced by their mu
  tual actions, which         is    contrary to the general laws of the
  properties of     the centre      of inertia. Now, if instead of one
  of   the   surfaces,    we substitute two others, converging in a          '
  very acute angle, the wave            will be elevated higher and higher
  as  it approaches     the angle     :  and  if its height be supposed   to
  be every where in the           inverse subduplicate ratio    of the di
  stance     of  the   converging       surfaces,    the magnitude of the
  pressure, reduced        to    the direction      of the motion, will   be
  precisely equal to that of the pressure on the single opposite
   surface, which will not happen if the elevation vary inversely
   in the simple ratio of the distance, or in that of any other
   power than its square root. This mode of considering the
   subject affords us therefore an additional reason for assert
   ing, that in all transmissions of impulses through elastic
   bodies, or through gravitating fluids, the intensity of the
   impulse varies inversely in the subduplicate ratio of the ex
   tent   of the    parts   affected at the same time ; and the same
   reasoning may without doubt be applied to the case of an
   elastic tube.
      There is, however, a very singular exception, in the case
    of waves crossing each other, to the general law of the pre
    servation of ascending force, which appears to be almost
    sufficient to set aside the universal application of this law to
                                                                         the

   the motions of fluids.       It is confessedly demonstrable that
   each   of two   waves,    crossing each other in any direction,
   will  preserve its motion and its elevation with respect to the
   surface of the fluid affected by the other wave, in the same
   manner    as if  that surface were plane     :  and, when the waves
   cross each other nearly in the same direction, both the height
  and the actual velocity of the particles being doubled, it is
  obvious that the ascending force or impetus is also doubled,
  since the bulk of the matter concerned is only halved, while
  the square of the velocity is quadrupled ; and supposing the
  double wave to be stopped by an obstacle, its magnitude, at
  the moment       of the greatest   elevation, will be twice     as great
  as that of a single wave in similar circumstances, and the
  height, as well as the quantity of matter, will be doubled,
  so that either the actual or the potential height of the centre
  of gravity of the fluid seems to be essentially altered, when
  ever such an interference      of  waves    takes   place.   This  diffi
  culty deserves the attentive consideration of those who shall
  attempt to investigate either the most refmed -parts of hy
 draulics, or the metaphysical principles           of  the laws  of mo
 tion.
 V. Of the Effect of a Contraction, advancing through a Canal.
      If we suppose the end of a rectangular horizontal canal,
 partly filled with water, to advance with a given velocity,
 less than that with which a wave naturally moves on the
surface of the water, it may be shown that a certain portion
of the water will be carried forwards, with a surface nearly
horizontal,     and that the extent      of this portion will   be deter
mined, very nearly, by the difference of the spaces described,
in any given time, by         a wave, moving on the surface thus
elevated,     and by the moveable       end  of  the canal.    The form
of    the anterior termination     of this  elevated portion, or wave,
may vary, according to the degrees by which the motion
may be supposed to have commenced ; but whatever this
form may be, it will cause an accelerative force, which is
sufficient to impart successively to the portions of the fluid,
along which it passes, a velocity equal to that of the move
able end, so that the elevated surface          of  the parts in motion
                                                                     may

                       Hydraulic Investigations.                           187
may remain nearly horizontal : and this proposition will be
the more accurately true, the smaller the velocity of the
moveable end        may be.       For, calling this velocity v, the
original depth a, the increased depth x, and the velocity of
the anterior part of the wave y, we have, on the supposition
that the extent of the wave is already become considerable,
x =             taking the negative or positive sign according
        ~=^i
to the direction of the motion of the end ; since the quantity
of fluid, which before occupied a length expressed byy, now
 occupies the length       y+v ;   and putting a          x   —  z, z
                                                                       =~-^,
The direction of        the surface  of   the margin        of    the  wave    is
indifferent    to the calculation,       and it is most convenient to
suppose its inclination equal to half a right angle, so that
the accelerating force, acting on any thin transverse vertical
lamina, may be equal to its weight : then the velocity y
must be such, that while the inclined margin of the wave
passes by     each lamina,      the lamina may acquire the velocity
v by a force equal to its own weight ; consequently the time
of its   passage must be equal to that in which a body acquires
the velocity v, in falling through          a height b, corresponding
                                                                  2b
 to that velocity    :  and this time is expressed by            —   ; but  the
 space described     by the margin of the wave is not exactly z,
 because the    lamina    in question has moved horizontally du
 ring its acceleration, through a space which must be equal
 to b ;  the distance actually described          will therefore be z + b,

be somewhat greater than the velocity -of a wave moving on
the surface of the elevated fluid                                   ;    and probably the surface

city of every small wave. The coefficient m is here assumed
the same for the motion of a wave, as for the discharge

think this estimation sufficiently correct.
   Supposing now the moveable end of the canal                                                      to remain

depression behind, will cause the fluid, immediately below
the moveable plane, to flow backwards, with the velocity
determined              by   the height,             which         is     the     difference between

     ring   a severe   Frost : — with a few Remarks on Marine Ve
     getables.     By. Air. James Graham, of Berwick-upon-
      Tweed.
        To Mr. Tili-och, — Sir,
 If you think        the  following observations       on the crust formed
 on windows         during a severe frost merit a place in your
 very     useful and entertaining Miscellany, they are much at
 your service.
     This curious phaenomenon is so common, that I believe
  there are very few who          have not taken some notice of it ;
  but, like many of the other appearances in nature, which
  strike the mind of the philosopher or the contemplative ob
  server with wonder and astonishment, with the great bulk
  of mankind it       excites    not the least surprise. Such seems
  to be the general         weakness      of the human intellect, that
  we all require some friendly hand or kind assistant to
  first  "  rear the tender thought, or teach the young idea how
  to   shoot."     The   appearauce      to which     I wish  to call the at
  tention of your leaders is the various figures which are re
  presented on the glass where this crust is formed.                    I have
  found some, whose curiosity was in a certain degree excited,
  suppose that all was merely accidental, or formed by what
   we often call chance : but, on a closer observation, this                 will
                                                                              not

J 92         On the Icy Crust formed on Glass Windows
not be found to be the case             ;   — when    strictly examined, every
figure is as regularly formed as               if drawn     by the hand of a
skilful artist, and the whole exhibits, as it were, a beautiful
delineation of various marine or sea plants. Sometimes there
is an exact representation of the plant from which that spe
cies   of   ashes or alkali commonly           called kelp is made ; — on
other parts of the glass              will be seen a perfect likeness of
some of the smaller vegetable productions, which, from a
small root, branche out into an astonishing number of very
fine fibres, joined together in such curious workmanship
as  far to excell any land production (at least that I have
observed) ; indeed no description which I can give, without
a drawing, can convey any idea either of the beauty or cu
riosity of these several icy arborifications.  A few of the
larger kinds I have sometimes observed during a continued
frost ; but the more common appearances resemble the plant
from which the kelp is made, and the smaller vegetable pro
ductions. I wish to be informed by any of your learned and
philosophical readers,             What      can be the natural cause which
produces this effect ?             Surely we cannot ascribe             it   to mere
accident     ;   for   if this   were the case, there certainly would            not
be the same regular uniformity.                   It may, however,             be ne
cessary to observe,              that this uniform appearance           will   some
times be broken    but on strict examination I have always
                           ;
found it to proceed from some such circumstance as a sudden
change in the temperature of the air in the room by an in
crease of company, or a larger tire, &c. : these will some
times in   certain degree melt the crust on the glass, and if
             a
again suddenly frozen the regularity of the figures will ap-
pear.broken ; but where Nature is left to operate without
interruption, I have always found the result the same.
   I can scarcely omit this opportunity of directing your at
tention to another observation, which I doubt not will be
grateful to some of your readers, as enlarging the sphere of
their curiosity, and giving a more ample scope to the con
templative mind : —
  The first sight of the sea to a person who has lived to the

  which Nature         presents    to the   mind    on this terraqueous
  globe.     If the survey is made on a calm summer's day, the
 clear, smooth, and extended surface, which is bounded only
 by the horizon, stretching as far as the eye can reach, fills the
 mind with the most pleasing wonder and surprise ; while
 the imagination       is left to roam at large on the supposed        ex
 panse which lies far beyond           the  circle which     the eye can
 embrace.        If  the survey is made      in the winter,     especially
 during    a  storm, what a grand and awful spectacle is pre
 sented,    particularly to any person not accustomed to the
 scene   !   The    deep and    hollow   sound of contending waves
 catches    the ear at a great distance     : but when the eye comes
 to survey a seemingly boundless           ocean rolling in constant
 succession its tremendous billows, till they dash with such
 impetuous force on the shore as to threaten destruction to the
 very rocks and banks          which    Nature has placed as a barrier
 to its almost irresistible fury, the mind is filled with amaze
 ment.
    These are appearances         so peculiarly grand, that they arrest
 the attention      of even the careless and      indifferent  spectator.
The objects to which I beg leave to direct the inquisitive mind,
 which finds pleasure in observing and examining the great
 variety of Nature's productions, is the vast quantity of ma
 rine plants which are to be found on the shore and amongst
 the rooks during the ebb tide : — these are often thrown up
 in such promiscuous heaps on the beach, that superficial
 observers do not think they can deserve any attention ? nor
will they easily be induced to believe that the mind of the
traveller is not more astonished when he first visits the torrid
zone, and finds every tree, every shrub and plant, in short
the whole vegetable         creation, different from any thing he had
seen in the       more temperate climates, than any person will
be when he first examines the productions              of the ocean. I
shall not attempt to give any delineation of this vegetable
kingdom : even if my abilities were equal to the task, it would
far exceed the limits       of a short  essay  : but  I will again assure
all who have not made the experiment, that their pains and
trouble will be amply repaid, and their curiosity fully grati-

servation : — During the ebb tide, if the shore is rocky, a
number of small pools of clear water are left, in which will
be found many of the smaller plants adhering to the stones
or rock,          which,        if carefully removed, and,               before they are
too dry, spread on                 white paper, will exhibit             a   most beauti
ful and pleasing variety without the trouble of drawing.

  Inquiry into            the Formation      of our perpendicular Facades.
.It    natural that the first great operation we proceed to in
       is
vestigate, should be the formation of our magnificent fa
cades,      one of which        the principal subject of this memoir.
                                   is
   The line df        coast that  bounds our basaltic area on its north
side, extends about twenty-five Irish miles, in which course
the precipices are nearly continuous, and more than one half
of them absolutely perpendicular for                            a   great part    of their
stupendous height.                 The operation           by
                                                  which th«y were cut
off    so abruptly,        and left   with formidable aspect towering
                                                a
over our coast,    the one we inquire into.
                           is
   That these bold precipices once projected furthei in many
places   easily demonstrated
            is                  at Beanyn Daana, and at the
                                            ;
Chimney, the columnar construction                              was    obviously     once
carried much further out.
  At the Milestone, Portcooan, and Porlnabau,                            the fragments
of dykes         extend    far beyond the face of the precipice.
  These same facts, together                 with     the projecting base, show
that these sudden abruptions were not formed                                 by   the sub
                                                                                   siding,

siding,     and   sinking of one part, leaving the remainder in its
place   still less by any violent revolution, or convulsion,
        ;
as the stratification has not sustained the slightest shock
either above or below the facade.
  The formation of our abrupt coast,                               has been ascribed                to
the action      of   the sea
                    beating violently against     washing                            it,
away the lower parts, and leaving    perpendicular facade     a
standing as we often see on the banks of rapid and en
            ;
croaching rivers.
   A cool examination of our precipices will soon prove that
our facades could not have been so formed      for we always                ;
find them on the highest part of the cliff, and receding from
the water, which            Gould        be     instrumental in bringing down
the materials        from above,
                          only                          by
                                   washing, and so wearing
away the bases of the steepest parts    but the elevations of;
these bases are utterly irreconcileable  to this supposition                                        ;
for instance, the base of Pleskin facade  two hundred feet          is
above the present level of the sea, that of Fairlwad three
hundred     :   now       had    the     sea ever  risen to either height,                          it
would have submerged                a   great part of Ireland, and none                             of
the neighbouring country (whatever its level may be) bears
the least resemblance to alluvial ground, nor shows any
mark of having been once covered     the sea.                by
   The next argument      still more conclusive
                                   is             the boundary              :
of our basaltic area on its north side,   for twenty-five miles
                                                              is
also the confine of sea and land so far       natural to ascribe
                                                    ;             it   is
its features, and characteristic marks, to the action of the
powerful element that beats against it. But when that pre
cipitous boundary ceases to be the confine of sea and land,
turns southward towards the interior, and becomes the line
of demarcation between the basaltic and schistose country
on the west,   still preserves its former character
                     it                             that                               :            is,
of range or ridge of very high land, steep to the exterior,
  a
and sometimes cut down vertically                                 into      facades,       like its
northern part that lines the shore.
  Thus Magilligan Rock (four miles inland)                                      is   not inferior
in magnificence           to any    of   our facades on the coast                      :   its    per
pendicular section     one hundred and seventy feet, and this
                            is
vCQRt,iruious for milea  the facades at B^enbraddock are nine
                                ;

                                                                                                 mile#

1 96             On the basaltic Surface       of the Counties
miles further inland, and those of Monyneeny thirteen ; while
the base of the lowest of these perpendicular precipices is
elevated      1400 feet above the sea.
   The                             east side of our basaltic
             same style prevails on the
a*rea,      its boundary ceases to be the confine of sea and
         after
land ; for the limestone facades at Garron Point (consi
derably above the level of the sea) exactly resemble those of
Dunluce and Kenbaan at the water edge ; and Cave Hill
(several miles from the sea, and nearly one from the shallow
estuary of Belfast,) exhibits basaltic facades at the height
of one thousand feet, precisely similar, and little inferior to
those of Magilligan.
   The exact resemblance between our inland facades (on
the east and west sides of our area) to those on the shore,
proves them to be all effects from the same cause,                   and that
our accumulated strata have in all these similar                    instances
been cut down vertically              by the same agent, and that this
 agent was not the sea.
       Nor
        has this powerful agent confined its operations to our
 coast, or to the periphery of our basaltic area ; we can trace
 it over its whole surface;    find throughout its interior,
                                        we
 similar, though very diminutive abruptions, executed pre
 cisely in the same manner, that                is,
                                      strata cut across                     by   a
 long vertical facade, their planes on the upper side perfectly
 undisturbed, while on the lower side all the materials of
 which that part of the stratum was once composed are com
 pletely carried off. — (See 6th fact.)
    We are now unavoidably led into discussion of ques
                                                  a                   a
 tion which has at all times occupied die attention                  of    natu
 ralists.
  Whence arise the Inequalities with which the Surface                     of   the   -
                    Earth   is   so   exceedingly diversified   ?
   I   shall not attempt to encounter this question generally,
  nor to extend my inquiries beyond the limits        have pre   I
  scribed to myself; but    shall try whether the curious facts
                                  I
  so profusely exhibited over our basaltic area, throw any light
  upon the formation         of our own inequalities, or lead         us   a   step
                                                                      towards

 towards the discovery of the operations by which such stu->
 pendoua effects have been produced.
    Some, to escape the difficulties in which this Question is
 involved,    ascribe our inequalities to original formation ; as
 if the world had come from the hand of the Creator with
 the variegated surface which now contributes so much to ivs
 beauty   ; but the frequent interruptions, and resumptions of
 the strata in our area,      with the perfect resemblance of the
corresponding parts,        however great        the     interval  by   which
 they   are separated,     can   scarcely     leave a doubt        that these
 strata were at first continuous        ;  of course, the       figure  of our
surface at that time5 must have depended                 on the original po
sitions and inclinations        of   these    strata,     which,   as appears
by the 3d fact, are now unconnected with the superficial
line, the figure of which is governed by their abruptions and
removals alone.
    Naturalists have differed much in opinion as to the direc
tion in which the causes acted that produced the inequalities
on the surface     of our   globe  ;  some referring us to the bowels
of   the earth as to the      scene    of action     ;   while others assert
that the operations were performed upon the surface itself.
    But the slightest inspection of our facades will at once
prove that the first hypothesis cannot be correct ; for obli
quity of direction must have been the result of a disturbing
cause acting     from below      ; whereas      parallelism and a steady
rectilineal    course   distinguish       the basaltic arrangements of
which    I  have been treating.
    We   have,   it is true, occasional depressions            of our  strata,
where they obviously have subsided, and                   no doubt from        a
failure of support below; but in no instance that I have met
                                                       '
with, in our area, are these attended by the slightest con
cussion ; the permanent and subsided parts, with us still
preserve their parallelism,       and the continuity of their mate
rial  ; whence it is probable this event took place previous to
the induration of the strata, and of course antecedent to the
period to which I limit myself.
    Buffon ascribes our superficial inequalities to the agitation
of the waters while they covered our earth, and argues from
the resemblance       these inequalities bear         to the waves     of  the
                                   N    3                                 sea;

  1 98           On the basaltic Surface     of the  Counties
  sea ; a resemblance        I cannot trace in any country which I
  have observed,        nor could our sudden and perpendicular ab
  ruptions ever have been produced by any agitation of the
   waters.
       Professor Playfair considers rivers as having formed not
   only the beds or channels in which they flow, but also the
  whole of the valleys through which they run, and in gene
   ral all the inequalities of our surface ; but an attentive ob
   server, tracing the course of any of our most rapid rivers,
   would soon perceive that the quantity of its depredations
   have been comparatively insignificant,           and that they can be
   determined with precision-: the river has no doubt in several
   places extended itself considerably on both sidesy but in the
   intermediate space between the remotest boundaries it ever
   reached, it levels, instead of raising inequalities.
       The  same result     I apprehend would follow from the ope
   rations of another agent, which theorists are in the habit of
   calling in to their aid, when they cannot find some certain
   material, which from their theory we had reason to expect ;
   they then tell us it has been carried off, and lost in the suite
   of degradations       and decompositions.
       But decay and decomposition, instead of creating inequa
   lities, would produce a contrary effect, and deface those ac
    tually existing; they would gradually abate the height of our
    perpendicular facades, and increase the green steep at their
    bases by the accumulation of the crumbling and mouldering
'   materials from above ; while the more diminutive facades
    formed by the abruptions of single strata scattered over the
    face of our area, and forming its most characteristic feature,
    would in time (as many are already) be converted into steep
    acclivities covered with verdure.
        Such are the principal causes to which the inequalities of
    our surface have been generally ascribed.            Previous to our
    deciding    finally   upon  their insufficiency,  it may  be proper to
    enumerate      a few   of those inequalities, where the deviation
     of our  present   surface,   from the form it probably had origi
    nally,   is not only striking, but where also the concomitant
    circumstances afford demonstration,          that some great   opera
    tion has once taken place there.
                                                                    Thus,

      Thus,    by making ourselves       acquainted with   effects,   we
  shall be better qualified to investigate causes ; and if those
 effects shall appear to be beyond the powers of such natural
 agents as we are already acquainted with, we shall be justi
 fied in admitting the performance of operations to which we
 have seen nothing        similar  ; and also in admitting the former
 existence of powers of far superior energy to any we have
 ever known in action.
 Enumeration        of some remarkable Inequalities in the Surface
    of   our    basaltic Area, produced since the Consolidation of
     its Strata.
    That   we may better understand the facts         I am proceeding
 to state,    I  shall assume (in the style of the mathematicians
puta factum) previous to demonstration, that the planes of
 our uniform, rectilineal strata, however interrupted we may
 now find them, were once continuous.
     Upon this supposition, the valley of the Mayola, between
 the stratified summits of Seqfin and Slievegallon, is an ex
cavation 1 700 feet deep, and three milts wide, of which the
whole materials have been completely carried off.
    To the northward of this excavation, between Seafn and
 Carntogher, the continuous accumulated strata of basalt are
interrupted, and taken away quite down to the schistose sub
stratum     ;   while the untouched      summits of the contiguous
mountains,        Carntogher,     Seafin, and Monyneeny, are still
stratified basalt.
    On the eastern side of our area, immediately to the
southward of Kello and Connor, a similar operation has been
performed, attended by still more extraordinary circum
stances.
    We    here find a district near four miles in diameter, called
the Sandy Braes ; over this whole space            the basaltic strati
fication has beerf carried off, and the operation has reached
deep into a very singular substratum, a reddish breccia, by
some mineralogists called a porphyry,           the mass friable,   but
the component angular particles of extreme hardness.
    The hills, of which this little district is full, are every
one perfect segments of spheres, while the loftier basaltic
                                     N4                             hills

200             On the basaltic Surface            of the   Counties
hills that surround it preserve their characteristic form, to
wit, a gradual acclivity on one side, with a steep abruption
on the other.
    Aswe sail along our northern shore we discover another
great chasm   or interruption of our strata, which also cuts
deep into the substrata : for on the west side of Ballycastle
pier, the bold basaltic precipices suddenly disappear, and at
a lower level disclose the substratum, which appears to be
an alternation of sandstone, and coal, sometimes with bitu
minous schistus.
    Amile or two to the eastward the abrupt precipice is re
sumed, and a basaltic stratum again occupies its summit on
to Fairhead, with the same angle of inclination in which it
was disposed along our whole coast, that                     is,   a   slight ascent
to the north.
  Traces of similar operations and abruptions are to be found
over our whole area, but the preceding are sufficient to make
us acquainted with the style of these interruptions of our
strata   ;   of course   it   is    time to proceed    to the suspended          de
monstration,      that our strata, so interrupted, were once con
tinuous,      notwithstanding the magnitude of the interval                       by
which the corresponding parts are now separated.
Proofs that our now interrupted Strata                 were once continuous.
    We must now turn back                to the facades  of Bengore, where
the strata themselves, and               all   the circumstances attending
them, are so happily displayed, as to throw great light on
the subject, and to lead us analogically, step  step, to the       by
conclusion we seek for.
    Letus examine and trace the summit of the precipice for
a  mile immediately eastward from the Giant's Causeway,
and we shall find   frequent interruption and resumption of
                         a
the fourth, fifth, and sixth strata, at the shortest intervals,
the interruption not always reaching to the lowest of the
three, which in that case remains continuous   so far simple       :
inspection removes all doubt, that each of these strata was
once continuous          as   far   as the great   depression to the west         of
Pleskin.
    Here indeed the interruption                becomes considerable, not
                                                                                 less

less than a mile      ;   but when we find at Portmoon                a   succession
of   three strata with the same inclination,                  in the same order,
of the same thickness each, and with the same strong cha
racteristic marks that distinguished the three interrupted, at
the depression ; above all, when we find the strata they rest
upon continuous fat least with very trifling interruptions)
for the same extent ; I think we can scarcely entertain a
doubt that this interval between                  the corresponding
                                                     parts,
though so much greater than any of the preceding,      like                  is,
them, but an interruption, and that these strata were once
continuous from the depression to Portmoon.
     The   same style     of induction would establish               the quondam
continuity of all the strata    the face of Bengore promon
                                        in
tory, for  here the strata  are so distinctly marked that we
know each of them when we find         again after any inter
                                                 it
ruption.
   In. the rest of our precipices and facades, the similarity of
the strata deprives us of this advantage    yet in their smaller
                                                        ;
interruptions, the eye,            by
                               tracing the rectilineal course of
the strata, and so connecting the separated parts, can esta
blish their former continuity  while in the greater intervals
                                        :
we must rest our proof on analogy alone.
   That we may be entitled to carry this style of induction
into the interior of our basaltic area, and to apply the same
reasoning to enable us to form               a   similar     decision    upon the
more stupendous interruptions                of our        strata,   which  Ihave
already enumerated,         it   becomes necessary to explain the geo
logical construction        of   our area, — the strata of which                   it   is
formed — their arrangement — and their inclinations.
   An extensive limestone stratum, white as chalk, and about
two hundred feet thick, seems to form the base of the whole
district   I   limit myself  to   upon this, accumulations of rec
                                  :
tilineal    and     parallel basaltic strata, are heaped up to most
unequal heights.
   This great calcareous stratum seems not to be an accurate
'
plane, but rather to resemble   bason, as every where at its
                                         a
periphery    dips to the interior; yet the plane of its section
               it
has   slight ascent to the southward
      a                                    recollection of these
                                                    :   a
circumstances will enable us to account for every appearance
                                                                                   this
                                         .

202               On the basaltic Surface        of the   Counties
this stratum exhibits,         as    it happens to be disclosed to us ;
and by the converse, an attention                 to these appearances        will
enable us accurately to determine the position                of   the stratum.
     This stratum, from Ballycastle       to Solomon's Porch, (about
twenty five miles,)          keeps very nearly the level of the sea,
often indeed sinking below the surface, but never raising its
lower edge above it : but when at Solomon's Porch, the
boundary of our basaltic area begins to deflect to the south
west, and then to the south, the ascent of the stratum to
the southward begins to operate,                and we perceive      the dotted
line of its quarries gradually to rise along the face of the
mountain from the shore to Monyneeny and Seafin, where
is has attained the height of 1 500 feet : it is true, the actual
stratum has not been opened at these two great elevations,
but the white rubble immediately below the basaltic facade
proves incontestably that it is close at hand.
     An accumulation of basaltic             strata,   had   in this southern
course,      as   well   as on the   northern shore, covered the lime
stone up to the summits              of   the hills or mountains.
     I   have already stated how the ridge             of mountain      is sud
denly interrupted by the valley of the Mayola, from 1600 to
1 700 feet deep ; but if we look   to the southward, in the
rectilineal course of the strata(the positions of which we
have been able to ascertain with so much accuracy), we shall
find near the summit of the mountain Slievegallon a similar
white limestone stratum crowned with basalt, cutting it in
the      very direction the former ought to have reached                it,   that
is         two hundred -feet higher, the ascent of the strata
     perhaps
to the southward having elevated their planes so much                         in   a
distance of four miles, the probable interval between the
summits of these mountains.
     We    are now to decide whether this calcareous and basaltic
fragment, on the summit of Slievegallon mountain, be the
last remnant of the old arrangement we have been tracing,
and ascertaining with so much precision, for seventeen or
eighteen miles from the sea, and twenty-five miles along
the coast, but now interrupted by the valley of the Mayola,
like our former more diminutive interruptions, and also like
them resumed at the next elevation, in the same                      rectilineal
                                                                        course,

                      of Derry and Antrim.                            203
course, the strata preserving the same order, and the same
characteristic marks. Or whether these strata, appearing on
the summit of Slievegallon, be the commencement of a
new arrangement,. abandoned by nature as soon as begun :
which is highly improbable, tor neither limestone nor basalt
are to be found on the mountain except in this solitary
hummock.
  We might, by        a   minute attention to the inclinations        and
arrangements of the         strata     contiguous to the other inter
ruptions I have enumerated, prove in like manner that the
basaltic masses crowning the summits of the surrounding
hills and mountains, are merely the remnants of strata once
extensive and continuous,            but interrupted and carried off,   as
in the preceding case, by the same powerful agent.
   The more diminutive inequalities scattered over the whole
surface of our area, and always produced by interruptions of
the strata, would still more easily admit the application of
the same reasoning, from the contiguity of their abrupted
parts ; but the detail would be tedious ; those who wish to
pursue the subject further must come to the scene them
selves.
               Materials completely carried off.
   A   circumstance perhaps still more extraordinary, is the
complete   removal of all the materials that once filled up the
intervals between the abrupted parts of these strata. I have
stated    in my 9th fact, that         the materials that had formerly
composed      the projecting     parts    of our northern   facades   and
precipices,   had totally disappeared.'
   The removed parts of the limestone stratum an the west
side of our area have shared the same fate, for where the
chain of mountains extending from Magilligan Rock to
Bienbraddock, is interrupted by valleys at Stradreagh, Drum-
rommer, and Ballyness, it is obvious that the limestone stra?
turn was once continuous to the high points where it show9
itself on Ready, and the mountains on each side; its thick
ness tbo, wherever we can try               it,
                                      very great  isyet this  ;
 stratum, which       in its entire state must have spread like             a
 roof far above the present surface of these valleys (which are
                                                           now

 now sunk deep into the schistose substratum) has not left a
 particle of its debris behind, nor is a single lump of white
 limestone to be found, until we come to the quarries, that
 is,   to the edge   of   the solid,   untouched stratum.
                                Conclusions.
   The conclusions that unavoidably follow, from                 the con
sideration of these facts, are,
   That the hills and mountains,    the district
                                               in           I    have been
describing, were not raised up or formed as they now stand,
but that they are the undisturbed remains of strata that were
left behind, when stupendous operations carried away the
parts that were once contiguous to them.
  That the inequalities of this surface were all produced               by
causes acting from above, and carrying off whatever they
touched, without          in   the least disturbing what was left be
hind.
          Additional Evidences.            Basaltic Hummocks*.
  The arguments on which        have founded my opinions
                                       I
have hitherto been all taken from the hollows in our surface,
and      interruptions in our strata, both which, the con
        the
comitant circumstances have led me to consider as so many
excavations but the lofty elevations, and the abrupt pro
              ;
minencies rising suddenly from our surface, when minutely
examined, lead us irresistibly to the very same conclusion.
      When you and  examined together the line of our north

ment, hoping that at the junctions of these little systems,
we should find some facts that would throw light on the
subject but we generally failed want of perpendicularity,
         ;                                 ;
or other local circumstances,          impeding us at the most in

    Navigators use the word hummock to express circular and elevated

                                                                 Whoever

      Whoever has attended to the exertions of man when em
ployed in altering our present surface, either by levelling
heights, or by making excavations, must nave observed that
it   is the practice       of  the workmen to leave      small cylindrical
portions standing,            for the purpose of determining the height
of    the old surface, and thereby ascertaining            the quantity   of
materials removed.
      To    these     may be compared the stratified basaltic hum
 mocks so profusely scattered over our area, and which seem
 to show how high our quondam surface once reached.
      The hummock of Dunmull,                 three miles south-east  from
 Portrush,        is very beautiful,      it stands on the top of a high
 ridge, and         is a   conspicuous object from all parts of the
 country       ; it is exactly circular, its flat surface contains an
 acre, it is completely surrounded by a perpendicular facade
 about twenty-five feet high, and formed by two strata, a
 columnar,         and an irregular prismatic, resting upon it.
    - From this elevated station, where I had the pleasure                of
 accompanying             you,   I showed you at six or seven miles di
 stance       to the westward,         among the Derry mountains, the
 still loftier- hummocks of Altabrian and Sconce, hemisphe
 rical in form, composed of but one stratum each, while their
 swelling out bases displayed accumulations of many more :
 and also near those the hummock of Fermayle, resembling
  Dunmull, but much larger,                 and also surrounded by    a  fa
  cade composed of two strata.
       I showed       you also at twenty miles distance to the south
  east,    the gigantic Slemisk,         one of our basaltic hummocks,
  magnified (as         it were)    into  a lofty and insulated mountain,
  completely stratified from its base to its flat summit.
       I showed you likewise from the bottom of its ridge, the
  neat but diminutive hummock, called the Rock of Clogher,
  above Bushmills.              As our time    was precious,  you took my
  word for its stratification            being precisely similar to that of
  Dunmull.
       There are many other basaltic hummocks scattered over
  the surface        of our area, all of them either stratified or por
  tions of strata; two of the most remarkable are the hill of
                                       *                             Knock

Knock Loughran,                  near   Maghera,        and a tall hummock (whose
name      I forget)         a   mile eastward from Lisanoure.
  We          meet still more frequently an imperfect style                       of hum
mock, a semicircular           one side, while on the other
                                        facade
it slopes awav gradually with the dip of the strata, as if the
operation had been interrupted before it was carried quite
round     ;    the       most remarkable               of   these   are   Ballystrone, in
Derry, and                Croagkmore,             in Antrim,        both       visible from
Dunmull.
   Regular stratifications on the summits of hills and moun
tains have been long a stumbling-block       to theorists ; the
historian of the French Academy,     for  the  year 1716, ob
viously ascribing the superficial inequalities of the earth,
                                         from below, and per
(like many others) to causes acting
ceiving how incompatible such assemblages of strata were
to his theory, thinks it safer to doubt their existence, as they
could not have been formed, he says,
                                        " unless the masses of
the mountains were elevated                       in   the direction      of   an axis per
pendicular to the horizon : ce que n'a pu etre que tres rare."
  But as these stratified mounts are in our area by no means
uncommon, they lay us under the necessity of suggesting
another alternative similar to those we have already stated.
   Were these isolated hummocks originally formed as thev
inow stand, (solitary and separate from each other) one by
one   ;or, are they the last remaining portions of a vast con
solidated mass, of which the intermediate and i connecting
strata have been carried off by causes with which we are un
acquainted           ?
  To      be able satisfactorily to resolve                    this alternative, it be
comes necessary            careful view of the contiguous
                                to take    a
.countries, and to try whether their construction, and the
arrangement of their strata, will throw any light upon the
subject.
   When         we examine               the   assemblage  of hummocks above
Knockmult,               that    is,    Sconce,    Fermoyle, and Allahrian, we
find their materials and stratification precisely similar to that
of the country below them to the eastward, where the abrup
tions of the strata are displayed in long stony ridges-— to the
                                                                                     eouth,

                  of Derry and Antrim.            207
couth, the abruptions on the summit of Ready mountain
discover the same   similarity ; and to the north-west the
grand fa9ade of Magilligan Rock, three miles distant, dis
plays an accumulation of exactly the same sort of strata con
solidated into an enormous mass.
     The hummock of Dunmull            is formed   of two     very parti
cular strata,   a   columnar,    and   an irregular prismatic ; but        I
showed you, a mile to the northward, at the facades and
quarries of hlamore and Craigahuller, at the base of the hill,
that the whole ridge, on         the summit     of which Dunmull          is
placed, was a consolidated mass, formed by alternate                  strata
of   the same description    :   and that the      arrangement of the
whole country below, and adjacent, was precisely the same
with (hat of the hummock of Clogher, I proved to you at
the curious opening of the strata at Bushmills               Bridge,    and
in the facades at the Giant's Causeway.
  After these proofs that so many (and I might proceed to
the rest) of our detached hummocks are in their construc
tion and materials, similar to, and connected with, the main
consolidated masses of which our country is formed, I think
it will scarcely be asserted that these hummocks were origi
nally formed, solitary and separate as they now stand i but
rather that they were once parts of that vast whole, and left
behind in their present form, upon the removal of the con
tiguous portions of their strata, by some powerful agent, of
whose operations and modes of acting, we have hitherto ob
tained little knowledge.
 The highest point on the facade of Cave Hill is called
Mc Art's Castle, and appears to be a solitary fragment of a
stratum, precisely similar to those          below    it,   and obviously
once extended like them.
     The irregularity of   the summit     of Fairhead, plainly shows
that its gigantic columns once reached higher.
  And in the facade of Magilligan, the highest of all, few            a
desultory patches of an upper stratum (no doubt once perfect
and continuous)       are to be traced along its summit.
     Our mountains themselves          seem to show clearly that they
 were once higher     ;   the top of Magilligan mountain         is   an ex
                                                                   tensive

     of Lower Thames Street, London *.
       SIR,
 I shall        be much obliged to you to lay before the                    Society
 of Arts,     &c,     the inclosed communication,               and a    box con
 taining      the   following fruits in bottles,              preserved    without
 sugar; namely, apricots, gooseberries, currants, raspberries,
 cherries, Orleans plums, egg plums, green gages, damsons,
 and Siberian crabs.             I have also sent some fresh English
 rhubarb plant, preserved in a similar manner.                         The same
 mode is applicable to other English fruits, as cranberries,
 barberrii.s, and many more.                   This manner of preserving
 fruit will be found particularly useful on ship-board for sea
 stores, as the fruit is not likely to be injured by the motion
 of the ship, when the bottles are laid down on their sides,
 and the corks kept moist by the                liquor, but on      the contrary
 will keep well even in hot climates.
     The cheapness of the process will render it deserving of
 the attention of all families from the highest to the lowest
 ranks of society.           If the instructions I have sent are well
 attended      to, I have no doubt that whoever tries my method
 will   nnd    it to answer his expectation.
             I am, sir, your most obedient humble servant,

A   new Method        to preserve various Sorts    of English Garden
                and Orchard      Fruit, without Sugar,
       GENTLEMEN,
   The general utility, as well as luxurious benefit, arising
from the fruit produced by our gardens and orchards, is well
known and acknowledged at the festive board of every fa
mily   ;  nor is this utility and benefit less manifested by a de
sire  of  many persons to preserve them for culinary purposes,
in  the more unbountiful        season  of  the year ; and     I am well
persuaded     that   this commendable desire        would     be greatly
extended     in most families,     was it not attended  v.  ith so much
expense as is generally the case by preserving             fruit   in the
common mode with            sugar, that article chiefly constituting
the basis by which it is effected.        In addition to the expense
of sugar, which is frequently urged as a reason for not pre
serving, there are other objections to that method^ and what
I am about      to mention     cannot be considered      as    the least,
namely, the great uncertainty of success, occasioned by the
strong fermentable qualities contained in many sorts of fruit.
It may be said by some, that fruit may be preserved for a
length of time without sugar by the ordinary mode of baking
or boiling, and being closely stopped up, to which assertion.
I freely assent ; but even that method is frequently attended
with uncertainty ; for if the cork or other means                U3ed  for
keeping the external air out of the vessel becomes                dry, or
from any other cause the atmospheric air exchanges place
with what is impregnated by the fruit, it soon becomes
mouldy and unfit for use.
   From     these considerations, and a desire     of preserving fruit
at a  trifling expense,      1 have   made    various and successful
experiments of doing it without sugar and at the same time
with a certainty of their retaining all those agreeable flavours
which they naturally possess ; and it is highly probable that
they will keep perfectly good for two or three years, or even
a longer period, in any hot climate, by which it appears to
become a valuable store for shipping or exportation, as                  I
have exposed       them to the action of the meridian sun in an
upper    room,    durine the whole of the summer, alter they

210        Method     of preserving Fruit without Sugar,
have been so      preserved (being done in 1806).         I have now
the pleasure of laying before        the Society   specimens of the
fruit alluded to.
                     Process for preservmg Fruit.
    The  bottles   I chiefly use for small fruit, such as goose
berries, currants, cherries, and raspberries, are selected from
the widest-necked of those used for wine or porter, as they
are procured at a much cheaper rate than what are generally
called gooseberry bottles. Having got them properly cleaned,
and the fruit ready picked, (which should not be too ripe,)
fill such of them as you intend doing at one time, as full as
they will hold, so as to admit the cork going in, frequently
shaking the fruit down whilst filling. When done, fit the
corks to each bottle, and stick them lightly in, so as to be
easily taken out when the fruit is sufficiently scalded, which
may be done either in a copper, or large kettle, or saucepan
over the fire, first putting a coarse cloth of any sort at the
bottom to prevent the heat of the fire from cracking the
bottles  : then fill the copper, or kettle, with cold water suf
ficiently high for the bottles to be nearly up to the top in it :
put them in side-ways to expel the air contained in the ca
vity under     the bottom    of the bottle ; then light the  fire if the
copper is used,      taking care that the bottles do not touch the
bottom or sides,        which will endanger their bursting ; and
increase the heat gradually until it comes to about one hun
dred and sixty or one hundred and seventy degrees, by a
brewing thermometer*, which generally requires about three
 quarters of an hour. For want of such an instrument it may
be very well managed         by judging    of the degree of heat by
the finger, which may be known by the water feeling very
hot, but not so as to scald it.         If the water should be too
hot,   a little cold may be added to keep it      of a proper tem
 perature, or the fire may be slackened.          When it arrives at
 a sufficient degree of heat, it must be kept at the same
 for about half an hour longer, which will at all times be
 quite enough, as a longer time, or greater heat, will crack
 the fruit. During the time the bottles are increasing in heat,
                               * Fahrenheit-s.
                                                                  a tea

                     for   House Use or Sea Stores.                  211
  a tea-kettle full    of  water must be got ready to boil as soon
  as the, fruit is sufficiently done.    If one fire only is used, the
 kettle containing the bottles must be "removed half off the
 fire, when it is at the full heat required, to make room for
 boiling the water in the tea-kettle.         As soon as the truit is
 properly scalded, and the water boiling, take the bottles out
 of the water one at a time, and fill them within an inch of
 the cork with the boiling water out of the tea-kettle.           Cork
 them down immediately, doing it gently, but very tight,
 by squeezing the cork in ; but you must not shake them
 by driving the cork, as that will endanger the bursting of
 the bottles with the hot water: when they are corked, lay
 them down        on their side,   as by   that means the cork keeps
 swelled, and prevents       the air escaping out : let them lie un
 til cold, when they may be removed to any convenient place
 of keeping, always observing to let them lie on their side
 until wanted for use. During the first month, or two, after
 they are bottled, it will be necessary to turn the bottles a
 little round, once or twice in a week, to prevent the fer
 mentation that will arise on some fruits from forming into a
 crust, by which proper attention the fruit will be kept moist
 with the water, and no mould will ever take place. It will
 also be proper to turn the bottles a little round once or twice
 in  a month afterwards.
     Having laid down the method of preserving fruit without
 sugar, in as clear and concise a manner as possible, I will
 recapitulate the whole in a few words, which may be easily
 remembered       by any person.      Fill the bottles quite full with
fruit.     Put the corks in looselv.        Set them in a copper, or
 kettle of water. Increase the heat to scalding for about three
 quarters of an hour ; when of a proper degree, keep at the
same half an hour longer.         Fill up with boiling water. Cork
down tight.       Lay  them on their side until wanted for use.
    It may be said as an additional reason as well as cheapness,
for using wine or porter bottles, instead of gooseberry,
is the difficulty of obtaining them, even at any price, in some
parts of the country; and indeed they are eqiia.v ux.hu iir
small fruit, and answer the purpose quite           as well, excepting
the little inconvenience      of getting the fruit out when wanted
                                  0   2'                            for

212        Method       of preserving Fruit without Sugar,
for  use,   which may        be easily    done by first pouring all the
liquor out into a bason, or any other vessel, and then with
a bit of bent wire, or small iron meat skewer, the fruit may
be raked out.          Some of the liquor first poured off, serves to
put into the pies, tarts, or puddings, instead of water, as
it is strongly impregnated with the virtues of the fruit, and
the remainder may be boiled up with a little sugar, which
makes a very rich and agreeable syrup.
   In confirmation of         the   foregoing    assertions,   I now pro
duce twenty-four         bottles  as  samples, containing      twelve dif
ferent sorts        of fruit, viz. apricots, rhubarb, gooseberries,
currants, raspberries, cherries, plums, Orleans plums, egg
plums, damsons, Siberian crabs*, and green-gages — which
have all been preserved in the manner above described.
   In order      to diversify the degree     of heat, and time of con
tinuance over the fire,        I  have   done some in one hundred
and ninety         degrees,   and    continued    them in it for three
quarters of an hour, from which experiments it is evident
that the heat is too powerful, and the time too long, as the
fruit by that degree and continuance is rendered nearly to a
pulpf.       In    the   summer     of  1807   I   preserved   ninety-five
bottles of fruit, the expense of which               (exclusive of bottles
and corks) was ll. Qs. 5\d.; but having some fruit left, it
will not    be right to judge them at a higher rate than           \l. 9s. ;
and allowing         55.  for the extra     coals consumed in conse
quence    of my not having a conveniency of doing more than
seven    or eight at a time, and this being done at fourteen
different times, it will amount to ll. 14s. the average cost
of which      is nearly   4\d.  per bottle, exclusive      of the  trouble
of attending       them ; but    if   we estimate     their value in the
winter    season, at     Is. per bottle, that being in general as low
or lower than the market price, they will produce 4l. I5s.f
but losing one bottle by accident, reduces it to 4/. 14s. leav
ing a net profit of 3/. on ninety-four bottles, being a clear
gain   of nearly two hundred            per cent.      Another   great ad
vantage    resulting from this statement will appear by making
it an article of store for shipping, or exportation ; and I shall
     • Apples and pears may be done for shipping, &c.
     f Some of these samples of 1807, were doue in 180 and 190 degrees.
                                                                   submit'

                         for  House Use or Sea Stores.                      2 13
 submit      a  few ideas tending to promote such a beneficial ob
ject by doing it in large quantities ; for which purpose suf
 ficiently extensive premises must be fifted up, with a proper
 number of shelves, one above another, at a distance of about
 five inches.
     The     vessel     for scalding the fruit in, should be a long
wooden trough of six, eight, or ten feet in length, two or
 three in breadth, and one in depth, fitted with laths across
to keep the bottles upright, and from falling against one
 another; this trough of water to have the heat communi
cated to it by steam,             through    a pipe  from  a closed   boiler at
a   little distance.       The boiling water wanted        to fill the bottles
with, may           be conveyed through a pipe and            cock over the
trough, by which              arrangement, many hundreds of bottles
might be done in            a short time.       It may be prudent to ob
serve that this idea is          only speculative, not having        been ac
tually practised, but at the same time seems to carry with
it a      great    probability     of  success,    and  worthy the experi
ment.
     It remains now          that   I  state some     reason  or object for
troubling the Society, whom I have taken the liberty to ad
dress, with these communications.                   The first is a desire of
publicity, «anctioned by their investigation of the experi*
ments nude for preserving fruit without sugar, thereby les
sening the expense attending an object of so much public
benefit and utility. The second arises from a personal or
private consideration ; but on this subject I shall only ob
serve, that I wish to throw myself entirely pn that protec
tion which has ever characterized the liberality of the Society;
and that I shall feel highly honoured if they conceive what I
have communicated              deserving any mark       of their favour.

XXXVI.         Method       of raising large Stones out of the Earth.

1, Robert Richardson, of Keswick,                             in the parish      of
Crosthwaitt, and county of Cumberland, beg leave to in
form you, that I have found out a method of taking large
self-stones out of the ground in a very expeditious manner,
and that by this means two men will take as many stones
out of the ground in one day,                  as  would require twelve men
in  the usual       way of blasting, and afterwards using large
levers, &c.
    Where      stones     of from two to four tons each are to be
taken up, two men will raise as many as twenty men in the
usual way. The work is done by the power of a tackle, but
by my method of fixing the tackle to the top of the stone,
by the plug which I have invented, it will hold till the stone
is pulled out of the ground, and laid upon the surface, or
upon     a carriage,     if required, all which can            be done in a very
little time.
    Stones     of four tons weight, or upwards, may                      be taken
out of the ground within the time of five or ten minutes,
by two men, without any earth or soil being previously
taken from around them, or without any digging with hacks
or spades.        J.  C. Curwen, esq., of Workington, has seen
and approved of my performance with this invention, and
if the Society should think it deserving of a premium, it
would ever he gratefully acknowledged by,

216        Method of raising large            Stones out     of the Earth.
          STR,
     I   am favoured with      your letter, desiring my opinion of
the utility of       the iron plug invented by Robert Richardson,
of Keswick.           That which I use is about six inches long,
and one inch      and a quarter in diameter ; it requires a hole
of            size, only two inches deep ; the plug is to be
         its own
driven in a little short of the bottom, and will raise a stone
of six or eight tons, with the assistance of three men, in the
course of ten minutes after the hole is prepared ; and I do not
hesitate to say, that three men, thus furnished, will clear
the ground of large stoues in less time, and more effectually,
than  twelve men by any other method yet come to my
knowledge.    The plug should be made of good beaten iron.
The simplicity and cheapness of the whole apparatus is a
great object, as a good plug of the size I use will only cost
two shillings and sixpence. I am fully of opinion, that by
adding more and stronger ropes and pulleys, woik might be
done by it to an amazing extent.   I have reaped great ad
vantage in my farm from the aid of the iron plug, and. in
justice to the inventor, am happy in thus vouching for its
extreme usefulness.                 Several   of my   respectable     neighbours
have       experienced      the aid        and benefit     of the   above instru
 ment, and will vouch,               if required, for    the truth   of    the above
 statement.                            I   am, sir,

           DEAR SIR,
 When           your son was in Manchester, he called to see my
 nephew's, Samuel Clegg's, improved gas lights, and was
 desirous to have a plan of his method, which my nephew
 promised to him, and            I undertook      to get it conveyed to you.
 I have,      accordingly,      taken     the   opportunity of sendmg to
 the Society of Arts, 8cc,             a  plan and explanation of his ap
 paratus.
     He lighted      a large    factory in Yorkshire some vears ago
 upon this principle,          and has since lighted some buildings in
 this neighbourhood,           and   I  believe he is the first person who
  succeeded      m rendermg these lights           free from the oflensive
  smell     which     generally     accompanies them.             My nephew
  served an apprenticeship to Messrs. Boulton and Watt, of
  Birmingham, in the steam-engine business, in which he is

   Your       esteemed favour            I   have received, and, according to
your request, have sent you a fuller explanation of the ga-
zometer and lamp, accompanied with further drawings.
  A gazometer, containing seven hundred cubical feet of
gas, weighs about twenty hundred weight, and costs about
two pounds ten shillings the hundred weight.
  The whole of an apparatus complete, capable of support
ing forty lamps for four hours, each lamp affording light
equal to ten candles of eight in the pound, will cost about
two hundred and fifty pounds.                          Each
                                        lamp consumes six
cubical feet of gas per hour.   I am happy to find that the
Society have honoured my communications with their at
tention, and I remain, with great respect,

put the coals intended to be decomposed by means of a fire

veys all the volatile products       of  the coal to the refrigeratory
of  cast     iron  E, in which    the tar,   &c,   extracted from th*
coal is deposited, and from whence they can be pumped out
by means of the copper pipe F.              G is the pipe which con
veys the gas to the top of the cylindrical vessel or receiver
H;    this receiver      is air tight at the top, and consequently
the gas displaces the water in the vessel H, to a level with
the small holes, where the gas is suffered to escape and rise
through the water of the well         I,  into the large gazometer K.
The use of the vessel H is pointed out as follows, viz. IF
the pipe G reached all through the water, without passing
into the vessel H, the gas would not be rendered pure or
washed     ;   and  if part ot the pipe did not rise above the water,
the water would have free communication with the tar, be
sides exposing the retort        A to  a very great pressure,   so as to
endanger its bursting when red hot. This vessel or receiver
H, in a lar^e apparatus, is about eighteen inches diameter,
and two feet long ; the quantity of gas, therefore, which it
contains, is sufficient to fill the pipes and retort when cool,
and prevents the pipe G from acting as a syphon, and ex
poses the gas to the water without endangering the retort.
   When the operation begins, the upper part of the cylin
drical gazometer K, fig. 1, made of wrought iron plates, is
sunk down nearly to a level with the top of the circular
•well  /,   and is consequently     nearly filled with water,     but  it
rises gradually as the gas enters it and displaces the water;
the two weights         LL  suspended over pulleys by chains keep
it steady and prevent its turning round, otherwise the lower
stays   M     of the gazometer would come into contact with the
vessel    H.     There are two sets    of  these stays,   one shown at
M,    and the other at N.
   There is also an iron pipe         0  made   fast  in the centre of
the gazometer by means           of the stays,   which slides over the
upright pipe P, by which contrivance the gazometer is kept
firm and steady, when out of the well ; it likewise prevems
the gas from getting into the cast iron pipe P, and the cop
per pipe R, any where but through small holes made in the
pipe   0   at   S at the top of the gazometer,       where   the gas is
perfectly transparent and fit for use.
                                                                    The

XXXVIII.         Report of Dr. M. Garthshore and Patrick
   Colquhoun, Esq., to the Society for bettering the Con
   dition of the Poor, to whom it was submitted to consider
   the Expediency and Practicability of establishing an Ex-
   perimental Dispensary in the Metropolis, comprising in
   its Structure a Dietetic Regimen for debilitated Patients.
Before        any accurate opinion can be formed of the utility,
necessity, and practicability, of adding a dietetic to the me
dicines generally administered to the poor at the different
dispensaries     in the metropolis, it may be useful to detail a
number of prominent facts, which either bear directly or
collaterally on this subject, and which are necessary to assist
the mind in forming a correct judgment.
    According to the parliamentary returns of the year 1803,
it appears that the number of poor persons relieved in that
year in the metropolis,           comprehending     all the parishes
within     the bills  of mortality,   besides Marylcbone,    St. Pan-
 eras, Paddington, Kensington, Chelsea, and Islington, (in
 cluding a population, according to the parliamentary re
 turns of 1801, amounting in the whole to 846,845 persons,)
 was 86,120.
    Of these     86,120 poor persons relieved,

 commodated does           not exceed       17,000 men, women,           and
 children.
   The number of              objects who do not receive any
                         distressed
 parish relief, but who are supposed, in many instances; to
 require it as much as those who are relieved, may be esti
 mated at about 20,000 men, women, and children.
   It will   be seen from the above abstracts,           that   the perma
nent out- door relief seldom averages above 2?. to 2*. 6d. per
week, while the occasional relief is infmitely less, which is
barely sufficient to pay the weekly rent          of    a miserable     half-
furnished lodging.
   It will also be seen, that many thousand cases may occur,
where half- famished families cannot obtain an asylum in their
parish workhouse for want of room.  And that the propor
tion of those who are relieved af their own dwellings, is
nearlyybwr to one.
  Hence it follows         as a clear    proposition,    that   there   ever
has been,     and always must         be, a very large proportion of
the poor     of   the metropolis,     who can derive no benefit from
the maintenance afforded        in the parish workhouse : and that
the pittance allowed in money,          can afford little for food,
where-a family is broke down by sickness, and their only
property (the labour of their hands) no longer effectual or
productive.    Hence, in such cases, the pawnbroker assists
in filling up the chasm until their little all is exhausted, and
they are not only without food, but also deprived of their
apparel and bed clothes.
  To relieve this numerous class, who are subject to so
many casualties, reducing them to a state of extreme indi
gence, benevolent individuals have founded hospitals and
dispensaries in different parts of the metropolis ; but many
of the hospitals are    endowed and from
                         ill            ;        deficiency of

funds,   they are not adequate to the relief           of one-tenth     part
of the patients who would be glad to become inmates during
sickness and disease.
  The    dispensaries    are more numerous.        It   appears from an
anthentic     return from thirteen of these establishments in
different parts of the metropolis, that, the course of the
                                                 in
year 1803, medicines were dispensed to 28,154 patients, at
                                                                        tbe

  the expense of aboul 1200 to 1500Z. for drugs, and perhaps
  about 2000/. for house-rent, taxes, salaries, and oiher ex
  penses — in the whole, between three and four thousand
  pounds    a year.     These nearly comprehend all the dispen
  saries  in the metropolis.
      But it requires little investigation to convince the mind,
  that drugs alone will not restore an enfeebled body to health,
  where the cause        of the disease originated in the want of
  nourishing diet. On the contrary, they are often pernicious,
  unless accompanied by a dietetic regimen, which is out of
  the reach of     a    considerable proportion of those distressed
  objects who become patients to the different dispensaries.
  There, every medicine is to be found, but that alone which
  in many cases is to effect a cure. Their bodies are wasted,
   and must be restored by nourishing         food.   Their recovery
   depends on this    ;  but it is not attainable  — it  is not to be
   found in their miserable dwellings ; and the workhouse is
   shut against them — it is already full ; and the hospitals are
   also inaccessible.
       That this evil exists, in  a great degree,  in the metropolis,
   must be evident from the state      of the poor, which    has been
   already explained,     and which rests on the    solid foundation
   of parliamentary documents.
       That such also is the state of many patients who are re
   lieved at dispensaries, every candid medical man who attends
   these dispensaries will admit.      If the evil therefore exists,
   and if its magnitude is as great as the facts stated afford the
   strongest grounds to suppose, a question will arise among
   those who are benevolently employed in their laudable en
   deavours to better the condition of the poor in the metropo
   lis — In what way       a remedy can be applied?      — a remedy
   which shall restore parents to their families, and children to
   their parents, who must otherwise drop into the grave.
       In suggesting new and untried objects, difficulties natu
   rally occur to the mind, which often vanish on a patient in
   vestigation ; and such it is earnestly hoped will be the case
   on the present occasion.
       The dispensaries at present administer those medicines
,   which are most generally applicable to that part of the com

nmmity who are in easy                  circumstances.   To adapt them to
the poor, there ought to be superadded, a certain moderate
proportion of spirits for cordials — strong porter — soups — and
also flannel waistcoats and shifts and shirts.'                        These will avail
more in many           d isorders       arising from scanty food,               than all
the materia medica. Nor will the difficulty of preparing and
dispensing these auxiliaries be so great, or the expense so
formidable, as may appear to those who have not minutely
investigated the subject in detail.                         The dietetic is proposed
to be dispensed as medicine, not                       as    food.  It will make a
part of the     physician's             and      surgeon's prescription,         where,
upon due inquiry,           and according to the nature                  of    the case,
such auxiliary aid, together with the flannel garments, are
found to be necessary to give effect to the drugs. Both are
to be dispensed  in small portions, and only to those who
actually require such aid, and cannot otherwise obtain it.
The soup to be prepared and taken in the kitchen of the
dispensary, on the order of the medical attendant, only in
extreme cases.   The dietetic is capable of being so syste
matized as to prevent not only the shadow of abuse, but also
at no additional expense            of      servants ; and the materials com
posing  it,   and all      the   other auxiliaries           will cost infinitely
less than can be supposed                   at   first view, as will appear from

     The usual expense of medicines           is here reduced, because
  in many instances the dietetic will        be substituted for drugs,
  which would otherwise be administered,              producing at pre
  sent little or no benefit to debilitated patients, whose disor
 ders   have     been    chiefly  occasioned     by  deficient nourish
 ment.
    The soups      to be  of two kinds : — Beef   tea for debilitated pa
 tients  ;  and a stronger broth mixed with vegetable substances
 for  those who are in a state       of convalescence, and       can bear
 a stronger diet.       Not more than a pint of any of            the two
 soups    will probably    be ordered   by the physician      or surgeon
 to any one patient, which must be taken in                the   common
 kitchen    of  the dispensary. The cost of a pint of either kind
 of   soup   cannot     be estimated at more than twopence, (in
 cluding the expense of fuel,) and this to be given in lieu of a
 composition of medicine which would probably cost double
 that sum. Two common boilersi such as are used in pri
 vate families,      will be sufficient to prepare the soups for each
 day's delivery     ; and  admitting that twenty patients (although
 an opinion prevails that ten        will be the utmost number) re
 quire soup, the whole quantity to be prepared on any one
 day will not exceed four gallons, and the total expense will
 be 3.J. 4d.     Other patients may require strong porter — a pint
 of which (in a pint bottle) is to be delivered to the patient on
the prescription of the physician or surgeon ; and supposing
 ten pints to be      issued   in one day, the expense will not ex
ceed 2s.    6d. — the patient    to bring back the bottle to be again
filled, or not, according to the prescription of the medical
gentlemen. It has already been observed, that the common
kitchen of the house will be amply sufficient for every pur
pose; and the design, is capable of being so systematized as
to prevent     the possibility of abuse. The labour to the cook-
maid will be next to nothing.            The spirits will be made up
in cordials, by the direction of the physicians, and admi
nistered to such patients as may require this species of as
sistance in order to promote their recovery.              It will be de
livered in the disguised state of a drug, to be taken at dif
ferent times, under circumstances where no abuse can pos
sibly take place, at the residence of the patients.

     Considering this limited dietetic in the light of new and
 more appropriate medicines, nothing in the general oeconomy
of the system can be supposed to experience any change.
One prescription        from the physician or surgeon goes to the
 apothecary, and another to the kitchen.             Nothing is in the
smallest degree disturbed, and the utmost regularity would
prevail.
     Under   a self-evident presumption,        that this dietetic is to
save     the lives of many individuals, who would otherwise
sink under their complaints ; and, by thus giving effect to
the power of the medicines, preserve many useful lives, — it is
scarcely possible for the human mind to devise any scheme
where so much good is likely to be done at so small an ex
pense.      Nor   is there any way in which the condition         of the
sick poor in. the metropolis can be so much improved            ;  since
the    success   of   an    experimental dispensary, with    a dietetic
auxiliary, upon the plan now proposed, (as to which there
can be no doubt,) woul,d be the means of extending the same
system to the other dispensaries             in the metropolis ; and
thereby contribute to the recovery of many hundred poor
persons in the course of a year, to whom, for want of a
small portion of nourishing food applied at a critical mo
ment, medicines can be of little use in effecting a cure.
     For  these and other reasons      which could be adduced, the
reporters    are decidedly     of opinion, that an experimental dis
pensary, upon the         plan now proposed, would prove an in
calculable benefit to the poor, and that it highly merits the
patronage and countenance, not only of this society, but of
the public at large.

              Is Grafting    attended   with Advantage ?
Fifty     years ago they used to graft the vines on the moun
tains, and they generally obtained very fine vines with large
fruit. This plan has now been abandoned, because it has
been discovered that a grafted vine does not last so long as
an ungrafted one, and the grafted vine is always more ten
der and delicate;      besides,  it produces  a poorer kind  of wine.

                                       a    ?
     The first dressing, which       is called     becherie    (hoeing),   is
 given immediately after the frosts have disappeared.
     In general, as soon as the bud of the vine makes its ap
 pearance the women proceed to prune, and the men follow
 with the first dressing. This is      a pernicious system ; but the
 prejudices of the proprietors have not yet given way to the
 counsels of men of science.
     The vines    are pruned at the same time with the first hoe
 ing ; but this method is not practised           in  the  Marne district,
 where they prune subsequently to the hoeing : it frequently,
 however, saves the primings from the effects of the frost,
  and presents a resource to the proprietor            if  the vines    have
  suffered from this accident.
     Two other dressings are afterwards given, one in June and
  the other in    August; but some proprietors, who are jealous
  of  the good qualities   of their vines,      give them a third dress
  ing in September.
  What     are the Processes employed       in gathering and pressing
                     the Produce    of the Vintage ?
      In order  to make red      wine, — when the fruit is perfectly
  ripe,   the black grapes only 3re carefully picked and gather
  ed.    The white     grapes   are laid aside,      as   well  as those red
  ones which are not ripe      ;  and these are afterwards made into
   wine of an inferior quality.        The ripe red fruit, when thus
   separated, is put into panniers, or small wooden boxes called
   barillets or cuvelets,    and conveyed        on   the backs    of  beast9
   of burden    to the pressing-place     :   here  they    are pressed    by
   small portions at a time, and the juice then put into a tub
   to ferment.      In performing this operation some proprietors
   employ an utensil called a martyr, which is very useful.
   This is an oblong coffer, less than the diameter of the fer-
   menting-tuh, and about a foot or eighteen inches high. This
   coffer rests upon beams placed across the fermenting-tub,
; and its bottom and sides are pierced             with holes in such a
   manner as to allow the expressed         juice of the grapes to flow

               How long         is the    tFine allowed           to ferment    ?
   It would be difficult to fix any precise time for the dura
tion of the fermentation ; this depends entirely upon the na
ture and maturity of the fruit, and upon the influence of the
atmospheric air. Grapes gathered in the morning will more
slowly go into fermentation ihan those which have been
gathered after noon-day in fine weather: — mists, rains and
hoar-frosts,   all retard fermentation more or less.
     In   some years, three or lour days are sufficient for pro
ducing a fermentation sufficient for preparing the fruit for
the press : — in other years, ten, fifteen, and even twenty days
are required.
By what Sign           is   it ascertained that           lite    Fruit   has attained a
                      proper Degree            of   Fermentation ?
     We cannot         assign any certain symptoms                        that the        wine
has sufficiently           fermented, as the period proper for                      placing
the     bruised fruit        into.   the       presses     depends         upon     various
causes     ;    the pleasure and experience of the proprie
               upon
tor, and  upon the quality and colour which he wishes to
give to his wine.    Some place the fruit in the press at the
strongest degree  of  fermentation, and others when it has
slackened.
     After     the fermentation begins, in order to hasten                          it,   they
squeeze down the fruit              in    such      a   manner    as to keep the          must
always uppermost     poles armed with spikes are used for
                            :
this purpose or, what
                  ;        better, some strong workmen de

and the wine          is   made.

that case the wine might assume a dry and hard taste which
 even time could not correct, particularly in Champagne
 wines, which are prized on account of their pleasantness
 and lightness.       The most consummate experience is some
 times unsuccessful in the above operations, and there has
 been     no instrument yet invented which              can be depended
 upon.
 Is it   advantageous    to mix    the extractive   Liquor of the Tubs
             with that which     is produced    by pressing    ?
     This   may be answered      in the affirmative, with respect to
 the whole of Champagne;          — and it is very advantageous for
 the following reasons :               v
      1st,  The wine    made from the tub would be paler             in cq-
 lour and more delicate than that which               is expressed     from
  the husks.
     2dly, The wine which came from the press only, would be
  harder, stronger, and redder, than the other ; so that from
  the same tub we should certainly have two different kinds of
  wine: — The mixing of        them is therefore     indicated by expe
  rience, and it is at all times necessary        to have wines of an
  equal quality.
       Is it advantageous    to bruise the Stones     of the  Graphs ?
      This operation    depends upon        the season,    and    upon the
   ripeness   and nature   of the   fruit.    When     the  fruit  is small
   and the stone large, or when the fruit has not acquired all
   its maturity, the stones should be bruised-
      When     the fruit is full and well grown,        when the season
   has been     rather dry than humid,          this operation may be
   omitted.     It has been ascertained,      however, that the strong
   and rough taste     of the stones      is  necessary,   as one     of the
   constituent parts of wine.
    To what Accidents are Red Wines liable when in the Casks ?
      The accidents to which        red wines    are liable, are yellow
   ness,   muddiness, and      a wormwood taste.          These accidents
    happen   when the wines are kept in badly-aired              cellars, or
                                                                       when

                         of  Champagne      in France.                  231
  when the fruit has been damaged during the vintage season
  by frosts or continual rains.
                How are       tlie Red   Wines managed ?
    When     the red    wine which comes out of the tub,          and that
 which has been expressed from the husks, are well mixed
 together in a vat procured for the purpose, the whole is
 poured into new puncheons previously rinced with hot wa
 ter; but they      are not filled at once, because the wine always
 ferments for    a  few days longer: — as the fermentation ceases
 they are filled and bunged up, leaving a small spiggot in the
 bung in order to allow the gas to pass out : when the fer
 mentation has entirely ceased the puncheon is hermetically
 closed.
    About the end of December, and if possible in dry wea
 ther, the wine is drawn off and freed from the greatest part
 of  the lees.
    About   the middle      of May, before       the warm season com
 mences, the wine is        again drawn off      clear.    Before putting
 the   puncheons      into  the   cellar  they  are  furnished  with new
 hoops, where they are kept during the summer, or till they
 are sold, otherwise their contents would be spoiled.
         What   is llie Method      of clarifying Red Wines ?
    This consists in drawing off the wine a third time. The
 whites of five or six fresh eggs are diluted in a chopin of
 water ; and this quantity is sufficient for each piece or pun
cheon containing 240 bottles.
   There are only 200 bottles in           a puncheon of white wine.
   The whites of eggs are            well  beaten up and then thrown
into the puncheon, the contents of which. are then briskly
stirred up by    a   cleft stick.
   This operation is performed previous             to  bottling the wine
or sending it off to a market.
          uit what Age should Red Wines              be lottled ?
   In general,     the red wines      of Haute Montagne        are bottled
in the month         of November         succeeding the vintage, i. e.
thirteen months afterwards.            This  season of the year is fixed

233             Memoir    on the Vineyards and Wines
 upon because all germination has ceased, and Nature is in a
vstate  of perfect repose ; thereby all fermentation is avoided ;
 and red wines may therefore be safely bottled from the first
 of October until the end of December : at any other season
 great inconveniences would arise ; for I know of nothing
 worse than red wine bottled in spring time ; it retains a
 slight degree of fermentation, and is very disagreeable to
 the taste.   -
     There are some excellent and generous wines which can
 remain three or four years on their lees : of this description
 are the wines of St. Thierry.
            How long will Red Wines          keep in Bottles  ?
     The more body         and   spirit the wine has, the better is it
 preserved     in bottles  : the  more tender, delicate, and light it
 is, the more difficultly is it kept.
     This  is the reason why the wines       of Mailly, Chiny, Che^
 nay, and Hermonville, keep worse than those of Verzenay,
 Bouzy, and Verzy; and these last worse than those of St.
 Thierry. To conclude: — We may safely venture to say, that
 the best red wines of Haute Montague will keep in good
 cellars for six, eight, ten, and twelve years.
  W hat Degree of 'Temperature,         according to Reaumur's Ther
                 mometer, ought the Cellars to have ?
     The cellars in Champagne are from 25 to 40 feet in depth,
  particularly those which are dug in beds of chalk, and in
  which it is necessary to dig low, in order to obtain such a
  solidity of earth above, as to render an arch unnecessary. It
  results from experiments made by Messrs. Dubois, mer
  chants at Rheims, that several good thermometers placed
  in various situations in their cellars, always marked five
  degrees below the temperature of the atmosphere.              The va
  riations between     winter   and   summer    were  not half a degree,
  and could not be noted.

                     General Observations.
   We    have only mentioned the culture        of   vines in general,
without detailing those of       the high   and  low    grounds sepa
rately. There are many vineyard?, however, and particu
larly in St. Thierry, where the greater part of the vines is
always raised to the height of about live feet, and supported
by props of oak, six feet high, and an inch in diameter.
This kind of vine can only answer in strong and vigorous
ground.
   The difference between the culture of the high and low
vineyards, consists in the shaping, tyeing, and pruning.
    1st, Shaping consists in choosing from the sucker the
best stalk,    in preference to others which are cut off, and all
the small collateral shoots are lopped off.
   2dly, The tyeing is effected when the sap is most abundant,
and the bud already developed : the above single stalk is
bent like   a  hoop, and tied to the prop in two or three places.
    3dly, Pruning consists in reinserting into the earth, and
into small and long holes, every ten or fifteen years, the
old sucker, upon which three or four stalks are left, which
are also buried in the earth ; and they send out an excellent
                                                                plant

 department of the Marne.
    An intelligent proprietor, who     has a large extent of vine
yard, should bury some vines (ravaller) every year, in order
 to have a sure and constant supply of plants for replanting.
    The methods of treatment are in every respect the same
 with high and low plants.
XL.    On tlie Affinity existing between Oxides     of Carbon and
               Iron.    By  David   Mushet,      Esq.
In   my late communications to the Philosophical Magazine,
 a number of experiments were adduced to exhibit the uni
versal diffusion of carbon, and to convey a tolerably correct
idea in what proportions it enters into the composition of
 animal,  mineral,    and vegetable substances.
   The affinity that exists mutually betwixt iron and carbon is
every day manifested as the basis of one of our greatest na-      -
tional manufactures     : in particular,  in the various modifi
 cations of cast iron, steel, plumbago, &c.
   Any inquiry that has for its object the investigation of
those means, and of their peculiar modes of formation, to
which we exclusively owe the existence of the most widely
diffused and most useful metal that has hitherto been known
in civilized society, commands attention, not only as a
matter of curiosity,      but as an object of the highest impor
tance.
   The natural mutual affinity of iron      and   carbon is such,
that they may be reciprocally used as tests and agents of
each others existence respectively; and upon this principle,
chiefly, the experiments which are to follow were performed.
   The first object  to be ascertained, in pursuing this investi
gation, was the nature of oxide of carbon, whether in the
state of charcoal, coke, plumbago, &c; and wherein, and
in what, it differed from the matter of carbon that existed
naturally in the substances from which these were obtained.
   If any two oxides of carbon were taken similarly com
                                                         pounded

                      Oxides  of Carbon and Iron.                   235
pounded       as to the alloy of foreign matter, and employed un
der the same circumstances, to revive equal quantities of the
same metallic oxide,         Would in not     be just to infer,   that if
the quantities of metal        were equal, so were the qualities       of
the oxide ; and the reverse        if a different result were obtained?
And      does  it not appear equally fair to deduce,      that where the
greatest quantity of metal is
                                      revived, the appropriated oxide
is of superior quality ? The former deduction holds uni
versally correct ; but the latter, if admitted, would often
 lead into error, particularly where the oxides exist in the
 state    of coal or coke.
      I  was once    of opinion that   the carbonating powers      of any
  oxide depended upon the real quantity of combustible mat
 ter which it contained ; and that the substance found to
  yield the largest portion of coal or coke, and to contain the
  smallest portion of ashes, would, every thing else being
  alike, revive the greatest quantity of metallic oxide ; or,
  in other words, would be found to contain the largest quan
  tity of pure carbon, or diamond : but upon investigating
  the nature and properties of a variety of carbonaceous oxides,
  chiefly obtained by the distillation of pit coal, with a view
  to fix an unerring list whereby to judge of coal fit for iron
  making, it was found that not only this conclusion was
   of itself erroneous, but that, in general,        the very reverse of
   this theory took place.       It  not only appeared that the car
   bonating powers of the oxide depended upon some other
   cause, remote from the actual quantity of combustible mat
   ter, but that the process of distillation, or of coking, sub
   jected the oxide to new laws, the very reverse of what at
    first view ought to have taken place. This, then, was at once
    attributed to the state of oxidation of the oxide ; and a direct
    probability inferred, that that coke or coal that revived the
    greatest    quantity of metallic oxide would be the least oxi
    dated ; or, in other words, approach more nearly to the state
    of diamond.
        This theory, however plausible,         was found    incompatible
    with practice,- and in the event it        was found that    the coke
    or coal that became most deoxidated in burning, revived,
     under precisely the same circumstances, the least quantity

  236             On the Affinity existing letween
  of metallic oxide    : and  from the experiments hereafter to
  be detailed, it will not appear rash to infer, that this in
  verse  ratio of carbonation     proceeded     exclusively from an
  approximation,     however remote, to the state of diamond ;
  arising chiefly from a new and more dense arrangement of
  the particles of the coal, in consequence of parting with a
  portion of oxygen.
     These experiments were arranged and conducted in the fol
  lowing order : — About 50 pounds of oxide of iron were pre
  pared, and thoroughly mixed, that there might not exist any
 variety of quality arising from different preparations.        This
-was kept during the whole series      of experiments in the same
 temperature, that none of the results might be affected by
 the moisture of the atmosphere.           A parcel of hand-made
 crucibles, all nearly of the same size, prepared from Stour
bridge clay, with ground covers, made so as to form a water
 tight joint, were set aside for the experiments.             These,
 from time to time, before the introduction of the mixture,
were brought to a red heat : when in this state, the mixture
 was introduced, the cover was slipped on, and the whole was
 put directly into the assay furnace. This mode had not only
the advantage of facility, but, which in these experiments
 is absolutely indispensable, prevented the carbonaceous mat
 ter introduced from being dissipated by the moisture, which
 is always contained in the clay when crucibles are put into
the furnace in a green state.
    The proportions of oxide of iron        and oxide of carbon,
used in the most       of these experiments, were oxide of iron
200 grains, of carbon 15 grains.
    These were intimately mixed, and put into a square of
thin paper containing about Ave superficial inches of mea
surement, and productive exactly of half a grain of char
coal : this, and I4y grains of the substance to be tried,
formed the quantity of 15 grains.          Sd that in all these ex
periments there is nearly l-20th      of carbon of     paper united.
When      the experiments were     directed   to comparative views
betwixt     the  raw and coked materials,        a quantity   of  the
former was used, that would,        by accurate experiment, have
formed     15  grains of coal, or prepared   oxide of earbon.    The
                                                               paper

                    Oxides   of Carbon and Iron.                   237
paper    and   mixture   were    with  facility introduced into the
crucibles    respectively, and    the  immediate introduction of
the cover prevented     the most minute contact of air, or dis
sipation of the subject of experiment. The duration of the
crucible and degree and management of the heat in the
furnace were scrupulously attended to, and many of the ex
periments were repeated three times.
    The first class of experiments was with various woods,
from which the following were selected :
                            Experiment I.
    Charcoal prepared from Walnut, composed of
                 Oxide of carbon          -      96•048
                 Ashes      -                     3-952
                                                100    parts.
     15 grains of this oxide and 200 grains of oxide of iron,
 were subjected to'fusion, after being carefully mixed, and
 the result was a metallic button which weighed 36 grains,

     It was found, upon a calculation of what this wood lost          in
 distilling, that 76 grains of raw wood would have formed
 15 grains of the charcoal operated upon.             This quantity of
 wood was therefore rasped down, and, in a similar manner
 with the former, introduced into the crucible.         The result  was
       A  metallic button weighing            -              49 grains.

        Sir John,
 At      a   time like the present, when Spanish wools, though at
 a price unheard-of       in the annals of traffic, still continue to
 find   a       thus clearly proving, that their value in the
             market     ;
estimation of the consumer is far above any price that has
been        hitherto        offered   for them by the manufacturer ; and
when we must all agree, that the interruption of our trade
         may still continue for some time longer, I trust
with Spain
that    a paper    written with a view to facilitate the production
of this      valuable  article in the United Kingdom, and to com
municate some information                    relative to the important present
of Merino         sheep lately received           by our most gracious Sove
reign from the government of Spain, will be interesting to
you, sir. I beg the favour of you, in case you shall approve
it, to do me the honour of placing     at the disposal of the
                                                           it

Vol. 33. No. 131. March 1809.                         .           Q             A con-

246      Some Circumstances telative to       Merino  Sheep,
   A considerable          part  of Estreinadura,    Leon,   and th*
neighbouring provinces of Spain, is appropriated to the main
tenance of the Merino flocks, called by the Spaniards Tra-
shumantes,     as are  also broad green roads, leading from one
province to     the other, and extensive resting-places, where
the sheep are baited on the road.        So careful is the police of
the country to preserve them during their journeys from all
hazard of disturbance or interruption, that no person, not
even a foot passenger,      is suffered to travel upon   these roads
while the sheep are in motion, unless      he belongs to the flocks.
   The country on which the sheep          aTe  depastured, both in
the southern and the northern parts, is set out into divi
sions, separated from each other by land- marks only, with
out any kind of fences ; each of these is called a Dehesa,
and is of a size capable of maintaining a flock of about a
thousand sheep ; a greater number, of course, in the south
country,    where the lambs are reared, and fewer in the north
country,    where the sheep       arrive after the flock has been
culled.
   Every proprietor must possess as many of these in each
province as will maintain his flock.          In the temperate sea
son  of winter and spring, the flocks remain in Estremadura,
and there the ewes bring forth their lambs        in December. As
soon  as  the increasing heats of April and      May have scorched
up the grass, and rendered       the pasturage   scanty, they com
mence their march towards the mountains of Leon ; and,
after having been shorn on the road,         at vast establishments
called Esquileos, erected for that purpose, pass their sum
mer in the elevated country, which supplies them with
abundance of rich grass ; and they do not leave the moun
tains till the frosts of September begin to damage the herbage.
   A  flock in the aggregate is called a Cavaua : this is divided
into as many subdivisions as there are thousands of sheep
belonging to it ; each sheep, besides being scar-marked in
the face with a hot iron when young, is branded after every
shearing with a broad pitch brand, generally of the first
letter of the name of the proprietor, and each subdivision is
distinguished from the rest by the part of the sheep's body
•n which this mark is placed.
                                                                 By

            Some Circumstances relative to Merino Sheep.                                243
     By   the laws     of   the Mesta,       each Cavaiia must be governed
by an officer called Mayoral             ;    for each subdivision of           a   thou
sand      sheep,   five
                  shepherds        four dogs are appointed.
                                             and
Some of these inferior shepherds obtain the office of Rabadan,
the duty of which is to give a general superintendance under
the control of the Mayoral, also to prescribe and administer
medicines to the sick sheep.                  At     the time       of travelling, and
when the ewes are yeauing,                   one or two extra shepherds                  are
allowed for each thousand sheep.
   The number of Merino sheep in                              Spain is estimated         by
Burgoyne at 6,000,000 ; these                 of course must           be attended by
30,000 shepherds, and 24,000 dogs at ordinary times, and
they find occasional employment for 5 or 10,000 additional
persons in the seasons of lambing and of travelling.
  In their journey, each subdivision is attended by its own
shepherds and dogs, and kept separate as far as may be from
all others. The duty of the dogs is to chase the wolves,
who are always upon the watch when the sheep are on the
road, and are more wily than our foxes; they are taught
also, when a sick sheep lags behind unobserved by the shep
herds, to stay with and defend     till some one returns back
                                                   it,
in   search   of it.        There are besides            in    each subdivision about
six tame wethers, called Mansos                     ;    these wear bells, and are
obedient to the voices of the shepherds, who frequently give
them small pieces of bread    some of the shepherds lead, the
                                     :
Mansos are always near them, and this disposes the flock to
follow.
   Every sheep    well acquainted with the situation of the
                       is
Dehesa to which its subdivision belongs, aud will at the end
of the journey go straight to                it,
                                 without the guidance of the
shepherds. Here the flock grazes all the day under the eyes
of the attendants when the evening comes on, the sheep
                            :
are collected together, and they soon lie down to rest  the                         ;
shepherds  and their dogs then lie down on the ground round
the flock, and sleep, as they term       under the stars, or in

       is                                           allowed,               is
in his turn, an absence of about month, which he spends

with his family       ; and     it is remarkable, that the families              of
these shepherds        reside entirely in       Leon.
    The     shepherds    who came          with his majesty's flock were
questioned on the subject of giving salt to their sheep : they
declared that this is only done in the hottest season of the
year, when the sheep are on the mountains; that in Sep
tember it is left off ; and that they dare not give salt to ewes
forward with lamb, being of opinion that it causes abortion.
     It  is scarcely credible,       though it appears on the best au
thority to be true, that under the operation of the laws of
the Mesta, which confide the care of the sheep to the ma
nagement of their shepherds, without admitting any inter
ference on the part of the proprietor, no profit of the flock
comes to the hands-of the owner, except what is derived from
the wool ; the carcases of the culled sheep are consumed by
the shepherds*, and it does not appear that any account is
rendered by them to their employers, of the value of the
 skins, the tallow, &c. : the profit derived by a proprietor
from a flock, is estimated on an average at about one shil
 ling   a  head, and the produce of            a  capital vested in a flock is
 said to fluctuate between five and ten per cent.
     The sheep      are always low kept.            It is the business     of  each
 Mayoral to        increase     his flock to      as large   a number       as  the
 land allotted to it can possibly maintain : when it has ar
 rived at that pitch, all further increase is useless, as there is
  no sale for these sheep,          unless some neighbouring flock has              *
 been reduced        by   mortality below its proper number : the
  most     of  the lambs are therefore          every year killed as soon as
  they are yeaned,       and each      of  those preserved       is made to suck
  two or three ewes ; the shepherds say, that the wool of an
  ewe that brings up her lamb without assistance is reduced
  in  its value.
      At shearing time the shepherds, shearers, washers, and a
  multitude of unnecessary attendants, are fed upon the flesh
  of  the culled sheep ; and          it seems that the consumption             oc-

 Mutton in Spain       is not a favourite fond ; in truth,      it is nof
 in that country       prepared   for the palate as  it is in this. We
 have our lamb-fairs,       our hog-fairs, our shearling- fairs, our
 fairs for culls,   and our markets for fat sheep ; where the
mutton,       having passed through these different stages of pre
 paration, each under the care of men whose soil and whose
 skill  are best suited to the part they have been taught by their
interest to assign to themselves, is offered for sale; and if fat
 and good, it seldom fails to command a price bv the pound,
from five to ten per cent. dearer than that of beef/ In Spain
they have no such sheep-fairs calculated to subdivide the
 education of each animal, by making it pass through many
hands, as works of art do in a manufacturing concern ; and
they have not any fat sheep markets that at all resemble
 ours. The low state of prizing in Spain ought not therefore
to be wondered at. nor the poverty of the Spanish farmers ;
they till a soil sufficiently productive by nature, but are rob
bed    of  the   reward due    to  the occupier,   by the want      of an
advantageous       market for their produce, and the benefit        of an
extensive     consumption ; till the manufacturing and mercan
tile parts of a community become opulent enough to pay
liberal prices, the agricultural part of it cannot grow rich by
selling.
    That    the sole purpose   of  the journeys   taken annually by
these sheep is to seek food in places where it can be found ;
and that these migrations would not be undertaken, if either
in the northern or        the southern provinces a sufficiency of
good pasture      could  be  obiained during the whole year, — ap
pears a matter of certainty.          That change of pasture has no
effect upon their wool,         is .clear, from all the experiments
tried in other countries,        and    in Spain also : for Burgoyne
tells us, that there are stationary flocks, both in Leon and
in Estremadura, which produce wool quite as fine as that of
the Trashumantes.
    The sheep lately presented to his majesty arc of the Ca-
vana of Paular, one of the very finest in point of pile, and
esteemed idso above all others for the beauty of carcase.

both these opinions, M. Lasteyrie, a French writer on sheep>
who lived many years in Spain, and paid diligent attention
io the Merino sheep, entirely agrees : he also tells us, that
the Cavana of Negrete, from whence the sheep imported by
his majesty in the year 1791 were selected, is not only
one of the finest piles, but produces also the largest-carcased
sheep     of all   the   Merinos.       Mr. Burgoyne        with him
                                                             agrees
in asserting,      that the    piles of Paular, Negrete, and Escurial,
have been withheld from exportation,                   and    retained        for the
royal manufactory             of Gaudalaxara,         ever since it was first
established.
      The Cavana of Paular consists of 36,000                 sheep.       It origi
nally belonged           to   the        monastery of that
                                    rich Carthusian
name, near Segovia ; soon after the Prince of the peace rose
into power,  he purchased the flock from the monks, with
the land belonging to           it,
                         both in Estremadura and   Leon,                   in
at    price equal to twenty French franks

English. All        the sheep lately arrived are-marked with                  a   large
 M.    the mark of don Manuel.
      The number         sent from Spain to the king was 2000, equal
 to two subdivisions           of     the    original Cavana. To make the
 present the more valuable,                 these were selected       by   the shep
 herds from eight subdivisions,in order to choose young,
 well-shaped,                 animals. This fact
                    and fine-woolled                evident,             is
 from the marks which are placed on eight different parts of
 the bodies of the sheep now at Kew.
    The whole number embarked was-2,214;                           of   these,     214
 were presented          by
                   the Spaniards to some of his majesty's
 ministers, and 427 died on the journey, either at sea or on
 their way from Portsmouth to Kew.     His majesty was gra
 ciously pleased to take upon himself the whole of the loss,
 which reduced the royal flock to 1573; several more have
 since died. As the time of giving the ram in Spain                                   is
 July,    the ewes were        full of lamb when          they embarked,            se
 veral of them       cast their lambs when the weather                  was bad at

  halting on some swampy district, in their journey from th*t
  mountains to the sea at Gijon, where they were embarked,
 as one sheep died rotten at Portsmouth ; there is every rea
 son however to hope, that the disease will not spread, as the
 land on which they are now kept has never been subject to
 its ravages, being of a very light and sandy texture.
     It   is well     worthy of observation, that although the
 Swedes, the Saxons, the Danes, the Prussians, the Au-
 strians, and of late the French, have, either by the fore
 sight of their governments, or the patriotic exertions of in
 dividuals, imported Merino sheep, no nation has hitherto
 ventured to assert,        that they possess the complete and un
 mixed race       of any one Cavana ; this circumstance does not
 appear    to  have    been attended to any where but in England ;
 though in fact, each Cavana is a separate and distinct breed
 of sheep, not suffered by the Spaniards to mingle with
 others.      The difference in value of the wool of different
 Spanish flocks is very great ; at this time, when Spanish
 wool is unusually dear, the prima piles are worth more than
 75. a pound, and yet the inferior ones scarce reach 5s.*
Even the French,           attentive as that nation is to all things
that concern the interest of individuals, appear to have over
looked this circumstance, and to have contented themselves
with making up           the numbers    of their importations,        without
paying any regard to it ; they have not at least stated in any
of their publications, that attention was paid to the securing
sheep     of  a  prima pile, and keeping the breed of that pile
pure and unmixed after they had obtained it.
    Our merchants in Spanish wool range the prima piles in
the following order of value,             as appears    by   a statement in
the year     1 792.

    Negrete.

very differently ; he states them          as  follows    : but both      En-

   The Danes, he tells us, procured their sheep from the best
piles ; but there is no appearance of their having, since they
obtained them, kept the flocks separate, nor are they at
present     so remarkable        for fine wool              as   the,Saxons,     whose
wool       is now    at least     as    fine    as    that of Spain      is,    upon an
average     of prima    and second rate piles.
     The   Swedes    were the first people
                                   who imported the Spa
nish breed. This good work was undertaken and completed
by the patriotic exertions of merchant of the name of Al-

debted for the benefits they enjoy from the improvement of
their wools to the prince Xavier, administrator of the elec
torate during the minority of the elector, and brother-in-law
to the king of Spain.   The prince obtained    flock of these      a
valuable animals in 1766, and in 1778 an addition to        of                      it
100 rams and 200 ewes.          The Danes followed his useful ex
ample, as also        did both Prussia and Austria. Every one of
these countries continue at this moment, to profit largely                               by
the improvement these sheep have occasioned in their agri
cultural concerns. So far from truth   the too common as   is
sertion, that their wool will not continue fine in any country
but Spain, that in the year 1806, when the ports of Spain
were closed   against us,    very large quantity of fine wool,
                                   a
the produce of German Merino sheep, was imported into
this country from Hamburgh, and used            our manufac       by

     SIR,
In   your Magazine of the last month, Capt. Burney made
certain experiments on unloaded and loaded barges, with re
spect to their velocities in a running stream           : and there was
an allusion     also  to  beams,       or sticks,   or timber, always
moving with the heavy end foremost.               These    two problems
may be solved in the same way, — they are the result of
gravity.    The heavier a barge is loaded the quicker will it
move, because all water that is in motion moves down
an inclined plane seeking its level ; the loaded barge that
Swims or floats in it will of course move down a regular
inclined plane, endeavouring by the force of gravity to de
scend, and its velocity will be in proportion to its weight ;
viz.   to the quantity   of matter moving together;           and unless
resisted   or opposed by      a    contrary force, or irregular cur
rents, it will acquire an increased velocity in a certain ratio.
This is exactly a parallel case to loaded or unloaded carriages
going down hill, the heavier they are, with the greater ve
locity will they press downwards ; — or, to put another case,
let a cannon shot and a round piece of turned wood of the
same dimensions be rolled down an inclined plane, the can
non ball will roll quickest, because it contains more matter;
in  the same way it would descend quicker through the air.—
A beam or stick in the water observes exactly the same laws
of matter   and motion,      and    will  go  down the stream        with
its heavier end foremost       :   so in the air,  if a stick be thrown
upwards, the heavier end will first reach the ground. — The
 savages in the South Sea Islands know this, and make cer-
tain short spears or clubs, which they throw at their ene
mies, over wherever they see a crowd of them ; and these
clubs fall with the heavy end downmost, and if they hit
disable or   kill.         I  am, sir, your obedient servant,

   March 9 — 16. — Earl of Morton, vice-president,             in the
chair.   A  very long memoir was read on the nature and mo
difications of coloured concentric rings, exhibited in glasses
brought into contact, by Dr. Herschel.           It is impossible to
give any adequate idea of the numerous and diversified ex
periments performed by this indefatigable philosopher, whose
narrative of them is divided into above 60 subdivisions.
From    these experiments    it appeared    that no coloured rings
were produced if the glasses were of the same quality, uni
formly level, and brought perfectly into contact. Sir Isaac
Newton's opinion       respecting <' fits of transmission" was
explained on his own principles of the known difference of
refrangibility of coloured rays. Various other optical phx-
nomena, relating to coloured rays, chromatics,            and refrac
tion, were incidentally illustrated.
   March 22. — Earl of Morton in the chair.           An account of
experiments     on  Brazilian   platina, by   Dr.  Wollaston, was
read.    The very small specimen of platina from the silver
mines in Brazil, which      Dr. W. analysed,      was given to   him
by the chevalier de Souza,      the   Portuguese minister in this
country. Vauquelin having found platina, but no palladium,
in the silver mines of Guadalcanal, it was thence supposed
that this metal was peculiar to the Peruvian platina.            The
Brazilian platina, , however, has some external characters
different from that of Peru ; it is brighter, flat, not rounded
off at the corners, and has not that worn aspect which the
Peruvian platina presents.       It  also contains a small quantity
of gold, which was not found in the platina of Estrema-
dura. But notwithstanding           the smallness of the speci
men, native palladium was discernible in it by its external
characters ; although white, like the platina, it exhibited flat
                                                              square

chanically detached from               the other metals. The specimen
which Dr. W. received was too small to admit of his ascer
taining the exact proportions of native palladium, gold, and
platina it contained ; but on examining the palladium apart,
and dissolving      some sensible traces of iridium were dis
                   it,
covered   ;       Doctor supposes that, when sufficiently
              and the
large specimens of the Brazilian platina are received, will    it
be found to contain not only palladium and gold, but also
iridium and osmium, like the Peruvian platina.

   timid animal; communicated by Mr. Laskey ofCrediton.
      At this meeting also, Mr. Laskey (who is at present with
  his regiment in Scotland, and who is well known in the

  Dr. Yule read an interesting memoir on the natural order
  Gramineae, with     introductory observations on monocotyle-
  donous plants, in which he contrasted these with the dico
  tyledonous class, from the period of germination to the
  complete evolution of their stems.     The Doctor is to con
  tinue the subject in a future paper.
      Capt. Laskey laid before the Society a list of Scottish
 Testacea, as far as they had fallen under his owu observa
 tion   ;  with remarks on the new and    rare species.   Of  the
 genus Cbiton he enumerated 4 species ; of Lepas 3 ; Bala-
 nus G ; Pholas 4 ; Mya 9, including 3 new species ; of Li-

 formed; containing 126 species of multivalve        and bivalve,
 and 142 species of univalve shells; in all 268.
     At   the same meeting the Secretary read a communication
 from George Montagu, escj., of Knowel House, giving an

genus, in the Apodal order ; and Mr. Montagu has bestowed
on it the generic name of Ziphotheca, and the specific one
tetradens. The communication likewise contained accurate
descriptions    of four  rare species   of English     fishes ; arid was
accompanied with correct and elegant drawings of these, as
well as of the ziphotheca. — At the same time, Mr. Mon
 tagu presented the Society with copies of his Testacea Bri-
tannica, and Supplement, three vols. 4to., with coloured
plates, and of his Ornithological Dictionary, two vols. 8vo.

  XLV.       Observations    on a late Paper by Dr. Wm. Richard
      son,    respecting the basaltic District in the North of Ire
     land, and on the Geological Facts thence deducible ; in Con-
    junction with others observable in Derbyshire and other En
     glish Counties : with tlie Application of these Facts to the
     Explanation of some of the most difficult Points in the
     Natural History of the Globe. By Mr. John Earey.
    "  By making ourselves acquainted with effects, we shall be better qualified
 to investigate causes ; and if those effects shall appear to be beyond the powers
 of such natural agents as we are already acquainted with, we shall be justified
 in admitting the performance of operations to which we have seen nothing
 similar; and also in admitting the former existence of powers of far superisr
 energy to any we have ever known in action." — Dr. W. Richardson.
          To Mr. Tilloch, — Sin,
 IN ext      to the delight     occasioned by the discovery of any
 truth     of important       application,        few things can be more
 pleasant     to an   ingenuous mind, than to observe others ar
 riving at a similar conclusion, by modes sufficiently distinct
 to give additional evidence to the truth acquired.
    I  was led to these reflections,           from having considered all
that    I  had read or heard, concerning             the basaltic districts of
our globe, previous to the perusal of Dr. William Richardson's
late able paper in the Philosophical Transactions,                     (reprinted
in your two last Numbers, and which I shall take the liber
ty therefore of referring to,) as showing, t,hat no part of the
surface or crust of the whole earth was less likely to harmo-
aize with the conclusions,             to which      I  had   been led,     seven
or eight years ago, by an attentive consideration of the geo
logical facts which Bedfordshire then presented to my mind,
and    which     have since received ample, and                I think   I  might
say complete confirmation,              in  a more extended        field   of ob
servation.
    Of    the nine geological facts deduced             by   Dr. Richardson,
as applicable     to his basaltic district or          area,   seven    of them
appear exactly conformable              to all my experience            in other
districts, including very various kinds of strata; and perhaps
my not fully comprehending some expressions in his 4th
and 5th facts, (page 113,) may alone have prevented a like

                                             great pleasure there
    fore to find, the results of my observations on the denudated
    districts in Sussex, Derbyshire, &c, communicated fully
    to numerous friends                within          three    years   past, whjch are
    shortly     alluded to        in your volumes                  (xxviii. p. 120: and
    xxxi. p. 37),          and    more     fully explained under the article
    Denudation,        and others,       ia Dr. Rees's New Cyclopcedia, thus
     fully confirmed by Dr. Richardson's able investigations,
    conducted, as far as I am acquainted, without any know
    ledge of what I have been doing, and tending to remove all
    doubts as to the regular stratification of basalt.
      The cutting          and carrying           off of       the upper strata,      observ
    able in numerous instances in the north   of Ireland, has been
    termed     by    Dr. R.

    denudations already explained, as above. The word hum
    mock, introduced by Dr. R., notwithstanding the seamen
    have limited its use to circular knowls or points of hills, may
    have its meaning as            a geological            term extended,        as   Dr. R.
_   has done, to include such as are            precipitous       irregularand
    also in their shape,               and such I shall hereafter adopt
                                                 as                                           it,
    instead    of   cap,    (a   term much too numerous in its meaning*
    already,) which    have hitherto used, in pointing out to my
                           I
    friends    in
               Derbyshire, the numerous hummocks on their de
    nudated hills  where these detached pieces of strata, being
                      ;
    mostly accessible on all sides, have furnished the strongest
    evidence both to myself and others on the spot, (as similar
    ones have done in Ireland to Dr. Richardson,)    that the in
    tervening parts of the same stratum, once continuous,                                have
    been torn off from our globe.
      Before    I    had ever seen           a      of denu
                                                 hummock          or heard         a
    dated district, from observing the universality of fissures
    or faults in Bedfordshire, having their sides always po
    lished or worn, pursuing rectilinear courses, quite incon
    sistent with the crater-like action of any force hitherto sup
    posed to have acted from below,       was irresistibly led to
                                                          I
    the consideration of forces acting from above, as Dr. R. has
    also been,     the evident excavation of valleys and leaving
                     by
    of hammocks in his basaltic area.
                                                                                         The

          the Basaltic  District in  the North ef Ireland.       259
    The worn state of those faults, which make at present no
alteration in the level of the strata on each side of them, in
common with those which, as doing otherwise, might admit
of explanation by the mere slip or subsidence of one side,
obtruded the conclusion,       that successive and general heav-
ings of the surface were necessary, to account for this phae-
nomenon, so universally overlooked by geologists in their
writings ; and Gravity, that most powerful of known         agents,
which, now that no satellitic body remains nearer            to the
earth than 240,000 miles, daily heaves up a mass or column
of sea water, perhaps 1000 miles diameter and ten feet high 1
appeared    to me as tjie probable cause,    through the medium
of  a large and perhaps very dense body, that might have re
volved round this globe, at that awful but important period,
when " God said, Let the waters be gathered together, and
let tlie dry land appear."
    These ideas of accounting for the universality        and worn
state   of faults, I  had  very shortly after    the opportunity  of
explaining to the worthy President of the Royal Society,
when on a visit to that inestimable character the late Duke
of Bedford, in a day's ride over the district which bad fur
nished the materials for these speculations, and while the
progress of His Grace's extensive works then carrying on,
admitted of verifying most of the facts. The sudden loss
of my former patron, having occasioned           the turning of my
attention    more particularly  to the acquirement of geological
knowledge, I have since had the happiness of finding these
first ideas of mine, when applied to a satellite moving near
enough and with attraction sufficient, to reverse the direc
tion of gravity for the instant of its passage, over any given
tract on the earth's surface, as fully adequate to account for       ,
the numerous, and to me new and astonishing facts, which
my researches in Sussex, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, &c,
have since furnished : the details of these 1 intend to pub
lish, as soon as my observations on Derbyshire and the sur
rounding borders     of other counties shall    be completed,   and
my professional     avocations will allow.      In  the mean time,
I  have been anxious, to suggest the above effects and their
causes, for the consideration of those, who, like Mr. Wm.
                                 R 2                         Smith,

860    Observations on   Dr. Richardson's Paper respecting
Smith,   Dr. Richardson, M. Andre, &c, may                   engage   in
extended   and minute inquiries,       as to  " the actual    surface of
the earth,"   (p.  1 70 of the  present   volume,) without which
direction to their inquiries,      the mention of geology must
continue to be received with        a smile,   as   M.  Cuvier and hit
very able associates justly remark.
   In order to show that hummocks or isolated caps of strata
are not confined to basalt, or any other stratum in particu
lar, but are of common occurrence in denudated districts,              I
beg to present the following list of a few which I have ob
served, and noted most      of them, in    the part   of my geological
map of Derbyshire, a copy of which                has been now some
time in possession of my worthy patron           in these pursuits, the
 President qf the Royal Society, referring       for some further par
ticulars, to my Section plate II. of your         thirty-first volume.
Hummocks with Coal measures on their tops.                               4
      Hill North of Ounston, near Dronfield,
      Shutlings   Low,    near Macclesfield,       Cheshire.
Hummocks with First or Millstone Grit on them.
      Stanton Moor, near Winster,
      Hartle Moor, ditto,
      Comb's Moss, near Buxton,
      Lose Hill, N.E. of Hope,
      Grindlow Rime, N. of Edale,
      Sheenhill,    near Longnor, Staffordshire,
      Revedge, near Warslovv, ditto.
 Sometimes these appear, as single or romantic isolated Rock-,
 on the millstone grit districts, as
      Alport Tor-stone, in Wirksworth,

      Endle Stone,        -       ditto,          -    ditto,

   Hill N. of Miller's dale, near Tidswell,
        Wormhill, near ditto,
        Tunstead Hill, near Wormhill,
        Bole-end Hill, ditto.
Hummocks of          the    Third Limestone.
   Aldwark,          near Brassington,
        Hill N. E. of Green        Fairfield,       near   Buxton,
        Buxton Town.

   Staden Hill, near Buxton,
   Knot Low, near Wormhill,
   Cawton Low, near Chel merlon,
        Harborough Rocks,           near Brassington.
   The hummocks of              the Fourth Limestone differ from many
of the others      above,        in our not being able to see these iso
lated masses, resting on any under stratum, since none of
the very deep valleys which intersect                 it,
                                         are excavated deep
enough, to reach any under measures.    The numerous iso
lated conical and peaky hills in Hartington, and other pa
rishes on the W. side of the Limestone district, are all                     a
sort   of massive hummocks, too numerous    here to be named.
   In   Dove-dale,in this stratum very extraordinary small
hummocks occur, or rather perhaps, in the rude and very
wide barren veins     which the vale was intersected — these
                           by                                        :
are called Tissington Spires, the Sugar Loaves, &c. — Rey
nard's Tor, Hoc-cliff, Pike Tor, &c, in Brassington, are
also among the interesting hummocks of this stratum.
   The above list, contains none of the many curious and
 conspicuous hills of this district, which are crowned by pro
jecting or suddenly elevated points or edges of strata, still
connected with the mass, but ouly such whose strata or up
per beds, are entirely isolated          by
                                    surrounding denudation.

   Small hummocks of Gravel on the heights of this denu-
dated tract, consisting of sand, mixed with quartz and other
very hard and highly rounded pebbles, (not of the rocks of
any known part of the globe, as has been said,) at some
                                     R 3                                 miles

262      Observations    on   Dr. Richardson's Paper respecting
miles distance from any other gravel, are perhaps among ite
most curious phenomena : — these I have observed at
          Thorney Ley,        W. of          Chapel le Frith,
          E. of Kilburn,         Horsley,
                               near
           S. of Strelly, Notts,
           On Sheepston Hill, W. of Annesley, Notts.
      After revolving the circumstances of excavated valleys in
my mind, .as I have travelled in these pursuits, for weeks
and months together, and observed these valleys wonder
fully distributed over        the       whole surface    of     large      districts,
effecting a descending outlet or drainage to every part there-,
of, as perfectly, though with none of the constant regula
rity, in which     the veins are distributed over an                   animal, for
returning its blood from every part to the heart                   :   I   have been
lost in conjecturing any application of mechanical or
known principles, that could have directed the almost irre
sistible forces which effected this important, and as it were,
finishing operation upon the matters of our globe, but must
refer the same to Omnipotent Power itself, acting perhaps in
this instance, without the intervention of the agents, whose
operations in nature the light of science enables us in so
many instances to trace.
  Dr. Richardson's expressions in his 3d fact, (p. 112) and
mine above, might perhaps be construed as asserting, that
the form of the surf ace of a denudated tract or excavated
valley, is uninfluenced by the arrangement or alternations
of its strata: such, however, is seldom strictly the case; for
though to a cursory or inexperienced observer, the contour
of most valleys    and    hills    regular, except where there
                                     seems
are facades or cliffs, yet a more attentive examination of the
outline of such denudated or abraded surfaces, will dis
cover the edge or top         of    every     stratum which
                                                   is materially
harder than that above         it,
                               grit-stone
                                        asunder  clay, &c,                         by
means of slight protuberance, or tablet as some have called
           a
it, visibly projecting the surface, but so slightly as in most
instances to have escaped the notice of persons on the spot,
and yet  I   have scarcely         ever failed    of late,    in
                                                             being able to
discover the position of the strata              in denudated tract, com
                                                   a
posed of several strata,           by
                            this means alone, and frequently
                                                                                   at

          the Basaltic District in      the North of Ireland.         263
at some distance, and can often distinctly trace the bases to
three   or four different strata at the same           time,    as I ride
along, sometimes for miles             together, before    an) pits or
quarries are found open, by which to identity the substances
of which they severally consist.
   I  mention     the above, both as a circumstance of great
practical importance in minera'.igfical surveying, and also as
tending to prove, that the strata had acquired their present
comparative hardness, before the denudation ahd excava
tions spoken of, took effect : the faults likewise have hap
pened since the consolidation of the strata, as their ground
edges in numerous instances          prove, and the disarrangement
they   occasioned    in the  strata must likewise have occurred,
prior to the final denudations and excavations of the surface,
since very few of the numerous faults which raise the mea
sures on one side or depress those on the other, are visible
by any inequalities on the surface, except that a very atten
tive and experienced eye may often discover their situation,
by means, of the interruptions they give to the faint tablets
of strata, above described : by which, I have sometimes
greatly surprised practical miners in tracing out the principal            ,
faults of their district : a circumstance often of the utmost
importance in practical mining.
    I cannot conclude this letter, without heartily congratu
lating Dr. Richardson on the very great progress which he has
made in these inquiries, and expressing a hope, that he will
still persevere; endeavouring also to bring frtsh labourers
into the field, for the purpose of giving us a general and
connected idea, of the order and position of all the principal
strata of the interesting island wherein he resides.               Maps
also, showing by different colours, the surface occupied by
each particular stratum, and vertical sections in particular
 directions similarly coloured, are much wanted, and will, I
 hope, ere long, be undertaken.

N ewton,       by publishing his Principia and the immortal
discovery of universal gravity, gave a new direction to the
physical and mathematical sciences.             He was the first who
demonstrated that, in order to discover truth in the study of
nature, it was not necessary to imagine precarious causes
in order to deduce from them hypothetical results, but to
ascend   by a course      of well-directed       inductions    from   the
pheenomena     observed    to the laws which produce them ; and
in this point of view     we may regard this great man as having
prepared   the way for all      the  discoveries    of his successors,
Newton    presented under the synthetical form, results which
might probably have been attained by a different route ; and
herein he perhaps attached himself to his avowed predilection
for the method of the ancients         ; and probably, also, he gave
way to a desire of concealing the course which he had pur
sued.    Modern geometricians, without entirely abandoning^
constructions,    which     are always satisfactory       to the   mind,
have felt that the     assistance    of analysis    was   necessary for
giving  to the' principle of     universal gravity all the develop
ments of which it is susceptible;           and   it is to this happy
idea, and    to the progress      of  the integral calculus,     that the
theory of   the system    of  the world owes the perfection which
has now been attained ; a perfection so great, that there does
not exist any astronomical phaenomenon, the causes and
laws of which cannot be assigned.             But these valuable dis
coveries, the results of the labours of a small number of
men, were too isolated from each other, and the chain by
which they were united too difficult to unravel, in order to
bring them within the reach of the greater number.                 It be
came important      therefore     to collect them in a work of the
same   nature, but in       a   form different and more complete
than that of Newton.         This task required an equally inti
mate acquaintance       with astronomy and with analysis, and
particularly that philosophical mind          which    discusses    phae-

task fitted   M. La      Place exactly, who from the outset of
his career directed      his researches towards the celestial phe
nomena,     and    who has since taken an active             part  in   the
progress of this science, by publishing, upon every point                   /
eonnected with the system of the world, a crowd of Me
moirs   filled with important discoveries.             It is principally
from these memoirs that M. La Place has derived the ma»
terials of this    great work     :  and   if he has connected       them
with each other by an admirable coincidence, it has arisen
from all of them having become peculiar to himself, either
because he had been the first to discover them, or from the
new liirm which he has given to them.
   Astronomy, considered under the most general point of
view, is a great problem in mechanics, the elements of
which   are furnished by observations.           This problem is very
susceptible of being submitted            to calculation ; because the
immense      distances    which      separate the celestial    bodies, at
tenuating the secondary        causes, which might act upon them,
in order to bring into view only the principal forces which
animate them, give to their movements a rigour and preci-
sion truly mathematical.             To develop the relations which
exist between the motions           and   forces which produce them ;
to deduce from thence the nature of the force which ought to
animate celestial bodies, in order that their movements may
 be such as are presented        to us by observation;      thus to raise
ourselves to the principle of universal gravity, and to re-de
scend from this principle to the explanation of all the ce
lestial phaenomena,       even to their minutest details, such is the
object of the Mccanique Cileste, an4 such             has been the ob
ject of the labours of M. La Place.
                              BOOK FIRST.
    After having first     detailed    the principles of the compo
sition and decomposition            of forces, the author establishes
the conditions     of equilibrium for any point wanted, by any
number of forces acting in any given directions             ;.  conditions

  which    reduce  it to  this, namely, The sum of the products of
  each force by the element        of its direction   is  null. He  teaches
. us to determine, when the point is not free, the pressure ex
  ercised by it upon the surface or upon the curve to which
  it is subjected. Considering        afterwards the point in the state
  of motion,     he seeks the relation which exists between the
  forces that animate it and the velocities which should re
  sult from it ; and by a very delicate analysis, and considera
  tions drawn from experience, he demonstrates that, in na
  ture, this relation    of   the force to the velocity is the propor
  tionality.     After having      developed     the   immediate conse
  quences    of this law,    the author gives      the equation of the
  movement of      a  point animated by any given forces, and de
  termines the pressures exercised by this point upon the sur
  face or upon the curve to which it may be subjected.                   He
  afterwards makes       the application     of  these principles to the
  motion     of bodies animated by gravity in a resisting medium,
  and to that of a point gravitating upon a spherical surface.
  The isochronism of the very small oscillations of this move
  able point leads to the problem of tautochrones which tjie au
  thor resolves, in the case where the resistance of the medium
  is proportional to the two first powers of the velocity.               He
  is afterwards occupied with the conditions of the equilibrium
  of any     system of bodies considered as points : he writes
  down for each of them the equation of the equilibrium; and
  uniting these results, he extracts from it the principle of the
  virtual velocities, which is thus demonstrated in a direct and
  general manner.         After having shown how we deduce from
  this the    reciprocal actions of the bodies of the system, and
  the pressures which they exercise upon external obstacles,
  he makes the application of them to the case in which all
  the points of the system are invariably united together; and
  this leads him to treat of the centre of gravity,             The author
  afterwards considers the conditions of the equilibrium of
  fluids  : the property which characterizes them              being a per
  fect mobility, it is necessary, in order that a fluid mass be
  in equilibrium, that each of the molecules composing it be
  in equilibrium in virtue of       the forces which animate it.        The
  author, setting out from this principle,           determines the rela
                                                                        tion.

 system in order to fulfil this condition,            and he makes appli

 cation of it to the equilibrium of a homogeneous fluid mass
covering a fixed solid nucleus, and of a given figure. He
afterwards gives the genera! equation of the movement of
any system of bodies, which he deduces from that of equili
brium ; and he draws from it the principles of the preser
vation of living forces, of areas, of the motion of the centre
of gravity,       and  of    the least action.     He   fixes the  circum
stances in which these principles              take  effect, and gives the
method of estimating the alteration which that of living
forces undergoes in the sudden changes of the motion of the
system.        In treating of the principle of the areas,         he shows
that    in the motion of a system of bodies animated              solely by
their mutual attraction,           and   by   forces directed  towards the
origin of the coordinates, there exists a plane passing by this
origin, and which enjoys the following remarkable proper
ties  :    1st,   Tlie  sum    of the  areas traced    upon this plane by
the projections of the vector radii of the bodies, and multi
plied respectively by their masses, is here the greatest pos
sible.    2dly, This same sum is null upon all the planes which
are   perpendicular         to it; the principles ot its Iivinc forces
and    of the   areas,   stiil taking place with respect to the centre
of gravity, even supposing it to have an uniform and recti
lineal movement. Hence it results that we may determine a
plane passing by this moveable origin, and upon which the
sum of the areas described by the projections of the vector
radii of bodies, and multiplied respectively by their masses,
is the greatest possible. The author shows that this plane
is parallel to that which passes by the fixed origin, and sa
tisfies the same conditions.           Hence he infers, that the plane
passing by the centre of gravity, and determined according to
the precedmg conditions, always remains parallel to itself in
the movement         of the   system ; a singular advantage, and which
renders     it of  the greatest     utility.   It is another remarkable
circumstance,         that every plane parallel to the above, and
passing by any one of the bodies of the system, will enjoy
analogous properties. After having obtained these valuable
results, the author examines the laws of movement which
                                                                      could

  could    take place    in  every  possible mathematical relation
  between the velocity and force. He shows that there exist
  in this general case, principles analogous to those of the
  conservation of the living forces, of the areas, of the move
  ment of the centre of gravity, and of the least action in na
  ture. He draws from these results the conditions which es
  sentially distinguish the state of motion from that of equili
  brium. — These very remarkable connections are entirely new.
  The laws of      the   motions of transposition and rotation of
  solid bodies are afterwards developed with the greatest extent.
 The author here demonstrates the properties of the principal
 axes, and their use in the determination of the momenta
 inertia : he searches for the place of the points which re
 main immoveable during the instantaneous movement of the
 body   ; and he is led   in a very simple manner to observe, that
 these   points  are situated    upon a straight line, whence he
 infers,   that every movement of rotation, of whatever kind
 it may be, is nothing else than a movement of rotation
 around a straight line fixed during an instant, and variable
 from one instant to another,       a property which has procured
it the name of instantaneous axis of rotation. The author
 applies these principles to the case where the movement of
 the body is owing to a primitive impulsion which does not
pass by its centre of gravity : he shows how we may deter
mine the distance of the centre of gravity from this impul
sion, when the circumstances of the movement of the body
are   known, and he gives an example of it drawn from the
movement of the earth.
    He afterwards considers the oscillations of a body which
turns very nearly round one of its principal axes. He de
monstrates that this movement is stable around the two
principal axes, the momenta inertice of which are the greatest
and the smallest, and that it is not around the third princi
pal axis ; so that this last motion may be sensibly affected
by the slightest cause.        He afterwards integrates the equa
tions which determine the movement of rotation in the hy
pothesis of the very small oscillations. Finally, he examines
the movement       of  a body subjected     to  turn around a fixed
axis] and supposing this body animated by gravity alone,
                                                                 be

he determines the length of the simple pendulum which
would make its oscillations in the same time.              The author
afterwards takes up the motion of fluids : he establishes the
conditions necessary, in order that this movement may take
place, and that the continuity of the fluid at the same time
may be always satisfied : he discusses certain cases in which
these    equations are integrable, such as the case where the
density being any given function of the pressure, the sum of
the velocities parallel to the three rectangular axes, multiplied
each by the element of their direction, forms an exact vari
 ation; a condition which will be fulfilled at every instant if it
 be   in one alone. This    case takes place when the motions         of
 the fluid are very small ; and the author draws from it the
 equations which involve the theory of the very small undu
 lations of homogeneous fluids.          Considering afterwards a
 homogeneous fluid mass, endowed with a motion of rota
 tion uniform around one of the rectangular axes, he shows
 that this hypothesis verifies the equations of the movement
  and of the continuity of fluids ; whence he concludes that a
  similar movement is possible. This case is one of those in
 which the sum of the velocities multiplied respectively by               - •
  the elements of their direction is not an exact variation;
  whence it follows, that motion may take place without this
  condition being fulfilled.
     The author afterwards determines        the oscillations of a fluid
  homogeneous      mass,  covering   a spheroid    endowed with an
  uniform movement of rotation around one of the rectangular
  axes,   supposing   this fluid mass     to  be deranged     from   the
  state  of equilibrium,   by the action of very       minute forces    :
  applying   these considerations to the       sea, and    regarding its
  depth as very small, relatively to the terrestrial radius, he
  thence deduces the conditions of its motion; and comparing
  them with those of its equilibrium, he shows that each point
   of the spheroid covered by ihe sea is more pressed in the
   State of motion than in that of equilibrium, from the weight
   of the small column of water comprehended between the sur
   face of the sea and the surface of level ; this excess of pres
   sure becoming negative in the points         where the surface is
   lowered below the level.      It results also from the same ana
                                                                   lysis

  lysis, that supposing the initial velocities and their first dif
  ferences, divided by the element of the time, had been the
  same with respect to the molecules situated upon the same
 terrestrial radius, these molecules will remain upon the same
 radius during the oscillations of the fluid. The author treats
 the motions of the atmosphere in the same manner, looking
 only to the regular causes which agitate it. He first con
 siders it in the state of equilibrium; and, comparing the con
 ditions resulting from this supposition with those which the
 equilibrium of the seas necessitates, from this he infers,
 that, in the state of equilibrium, the stratum of air contiguous
 to the sea is every where of equal density ; and that the
 atmospheric strata       of   equal density are every where equally
 raised above the level     of  the sea, with very      small exceptions,
 which, in   the exact calculation       of the height of mountains by
 barometrical observations, ought not to be neglected.
     The author afterwards examines if it is possible that the
molecules of air situated originally upon the same terrestrial
radius, still remain upon this radius during the motion which
takes place   in the oscillations of the sea. He shows that this
supposition     satisfies   the conditions        of the motion,    and  of
the    continuity of the atmospheric fluid : in this case the
oscillations of the various strata of level are the same. These
variations of the atmosphere produce analogous oscillations
in barometrical altitudes. The author determines them, and
shows that they are similar to all elevations above the level
of the sea, and proportional to the altitudes of the mercury
in the barometer, in       the state    of equilibrium,    at these eleva
tions.

Should you deem the following                 description,   and the ac

Magazine, you will oblige                         me      by giving it that distinc
tion.
  The        basis       of the invisible          fence is elastic iron wire,             ma
nufactured and applied on principles discovered by Mr.
James Pilton, King's Road, Chelsea, Middlesex.
  This infrangible material for the main wires is drawn out
to the thickness of a common quill, of which continuous
strings are inserted horizontally through upright iron stan
chions       :     the      interval         strings is about nine
                                        between          the
inches       ;    between the stanchions, about seven feet. The ho
rizontal wires, in                    of tension, are fastened to two main
                                a state
stanchions at the              extremity of the fence, passing at freedom
through holes drilled in the intermediate stanchions.    The
tension of every horizontal wire is preserved by the superior
stability of the extreme stanchions ; on the construction of
which,           and the mechanism              of the   base work, the resistance             of
the whole,           as a   barrier against heavy cattle, depends. When
the extent          of    the fence is great, the main stanchions are re
lieved       at expedient distances            by other principal stanchions :
an improved mode                 of    joining horizontal wires qualifies every
part    of       the length to bear the highest degree                   of tension.
  The invisible fence, in this  simple, form, of the height of
three feet six inches, has, in the Royal Pleasure Grounds at
Frogmore, and in various parks of the nobility and gentry,
been found adequate to exclude the largest and strongest
kinds    of grazing stock.Increased in height two feet, the
fence becomes applicable to deer parks.    Deer have never
been known to injure                      it,

 coating of paint they art preserved from the effects           of the
 weather.
    The strength attained, by the principles on which the ma
 terials are manufactured and the erection of the fence is
 conducted, cannot be justly conceived but by a person who
 has witnessed the effect      of a considerable force, impressed,
 or weight lodged on     a single wire of a fence erected.        The
 tempered elasticity   of  the  tort  string allows it  to bend, and
 on the removal of the pressing force, the wire vigorously
 recoils, vibrating till it reassumes a perfectly straight line ;
 which shows that a violent shock cannot warp it.
    With regard to the effect of these transparent boundaries
 in opening a view, a pleasure-ground intersected or sur
 rounded with     them must be surveyed before an estimate
 can be formed    of  the small distance at which they vanish
from the eye and leave the prospect free; — this distance may
be fixed by experience at seventy yards.
    To  advert a moment to the utility of the new principle,
 (by  which  the invisible fence can be rendered strong and du
rable in any degree demanded,) — from the theory of Mr.
Repton, previous to their discovery, it may be collected, that
a secure substitute for the heavy and unsightly        fences, often
found indispensable near the basement windows of a man
sion, was a desideratum ; and his practice, since the satisfac'*
tory trials made in many counties of the new transparent
fence, sanctions its adoption. In his large and elegant pub
lication on Landscape Gardening, that able improver of rural
scenery states many objections         to  the Ha Ha   ; and regrets
the   necessity for interposing substantial boundaries to a

   From    the   result  of  these   experiments,      it will  appear at
one glance, that the extent and purity of the carbonaceous
matter in charcoals do not at all depend upon the absolute
quantity   of combustible matter they contain respectively.
   The  largest portion    of  revived  iron is obtained with char
coal of birch,     the quantity   of combustible matter in which
(by Experiment XVIII.)        is 89-681.    Iron revived      62   grains.

    This contrast is quite sufficient to show that the different
carbonating powers of charcoal of wood depend upon a
principle different from any that has been developed in the
foregoing experiments.
    From the same experiments,       however,  we are warranted
to conclude, that the carbonating powers of the matter of
carbon contained in different woods in their natural state, are
greater than when the same is reduced       to charcoal by distil
lation or any other mode of operation.         This curious fact,
the reverse from what might have been expected, may be ac
counted for in three different ways.
    1st, From   the decomposition     of the oleaginous  or resi
nous juices of the wood by the oxide of iron ; part of the
carbonaceous matter of which, being set free, may either
unite itself to the iron, or unite with the oxygen of the ox
ide, and by this means leave greater scope to the carbonating
powers of the concrete carbon.
    2dly, From a large surface being exposed by wood in the
 state of fine sawdust to the same bulk and weight of oxide.
    3dly, And what seems to be the most permanent cause,
this fact may arise from a certain degree of oxidation being
necessary in the carbon, which facilitates its union with
the oxygen of the oxide; and as the degree of oxidation in
 raw wood is greater than in charcoal, so in proportion to
 this degree of oxidation we find the affinity      more speedily
 and more extensively exerted.

XLIX.       On the native Gold Dust found in the Hills In the
    Environs of the Commune of St. George, in the Depart
    ment   of Le Loire. By Mr. Giulxo, Prefect of the De
   partment of the Sesia*.
It    has long been      known that      a great   number      of rivers      and
rivulets carry with them particles of native gold, of larger or
smaller size ; that independently of the places where this
metal is found in its matrix, it is disseminated in grains in
their sands, as those of the Rhone, the Arriege, and the
Ceze in France,         and with     us in those of the rivers Loire,
Balthee, Cervo, Elbo,           Mallon,     and Orba, and of the rivu
lets Oropa, Oremo, Evancon, Vison, &c.                           It is equally
known that there are persons who make it their whole busi
ness to search for this gold, who are called,                in the language
of the country, arpailleurs, orpailleurs,              or pailloteurs.
    Mineralogists are not agreed respecting              the origin     of  these
gold grains : the older mineralogists, and Brochant among the
moderns, maintain that this gold is washed by the currents
from its native mines, commonly situated in primitive moun
tains.      " Native gold,"      says Brochant       f, "    is found chiefly
in primitive mountains, where it is met with in veins, and
sometime* disseminated in the rock : it occurs also in allu
vial strata, where it is frequently wrought with advantage.                           -
The     sand  of  several    rivers is mixed        with grains of gold,
 which are separated from it by washing.                  It is unquestion
ably evident,      that   the   gold    here   is met   with    accidentally ;
and that it is deposited by the water that has washed it                            •
away from its original          situation,    which     was     probably       the
same as is     indicated above." — Others think that                 these me
tallic    particles were originally disseminated in auriferous
strata,   in the very places where they are exposed to view, by
great floods, or overflowings of the rivers, or that they have
been washed into the latter by torrents in storms or heavy
 rains.
    I  do not mean to enter into the question at large.                   This    I
 leave to the learned, whose chief study is the improvement

 382                   On the native Gold Dust found in
 of the science of mineralogy.              My inductions go no further
 than the small number       of researches I have made : yet                     I
 think      I
          may   venture   to  say, from the observations I am
 about to present to the reader respecting the locality and si
 tuation of the native gold dust in the commune of St. George,
 that such dust is not always washed down from mines in the
 mountains by rivers. And if such were the primitive origin
 of their dissemination amid the strata, it certainly could
 have happened          only     at some very remote period         of the grand
 disruptions that have taken place on the surface and ex
 terior of the strata of our globe. But these revolutions, of
which we have no records, are buried in the night of time.
For we shall see that strata which furnish gold dust are
found at a considerable depth in some hills, equally remote
from mountains capable of furnishing                    it,
                                            and from rivers-
that could force from its native situation.
                        it                     could, there    It
fore, have mingled in them only at      remote period, when
                                                a
the strata of the hills assumed the arrangement they have at

    Mr. Balbo agrees with M.            de  Robillant respecting this
species of native gold, in his learned Memoir on the auri
ferous sand of the Oreo.          " Every one," says he, " knows
that gold dust is collected in the Oreo. — But I do not believe
it is equally known, that gold is found, not in the bed of
the river alone, but to the distance of several miles, every
where mingled more or less with the sand. — It is very posi
tively asserted that it occurs in all the little rivulets between
Valperga and Rivara. — I endeavoured                 to discover whether
 all the waters rise sufficiently near to each other to lead us
to suppose that they equally derive their gold from the same
mine;. as it is in this way that the vulgar, and even most
 of the learned, generally account for the gold found in
 rivers.     But  I  was completely convinced           that the waters     of
 which     I speak    arise from   different heights at some distance
 from one another;         so that, as we cannot suppose all these
 places to contain mines, from which the gold may be de
 rived, we must necessarily admit that the particles of gold
 are not separated daily by the action of the water, and car
 ried along by its streams, but that the water finds them in
 the soil itself Over which it flows. — And it is further con
 firmed by the observation, that the auriferous                strata   disap
 pear as     we proceed      up  the  Oreo;     that    we   find    them at
 furthest only as high as the bridge ; that above this all traces
 of them are lost, though this is very far from the springs ;
  while as we descend into the plain these strata are every day
 exposed by the action of the water, and particularly in
 floods*."
     In  a second    part  I shall speak of the theory proposed by
 M. Napion, in his Memoir on the mountain's of Canavais f,
 who, having observed that all the pyrites of those mountains
 are auriferous, attributes the particles of gold" to their de
  composition or attrition.        This is   the opinion      of our worthy
  colleague, Dr. Bonvoisin.
     The observations I am now about to communicate appear
  to me still more decisive than the proofs alleged by these

authors ; and      if   the earths   of which I shall speak do not
furnish    so large a quantity     of gold dust, they afford indis
putable proofs that the gold certainly does not proceed from
any mine traversed by water, at least in the present day.
    In Ihe north of the commune of St. George, in the cir
cle of Chivas, in the department of the Loire, we find fer
tile rising grounds, and hills almost wholly covered "with
vineyards, which continue till we come to the highest of
them, the hill of Macugnano, part of which is cultivated,
part covered with wild chestnut trees; a distance of about
three miles.   — In our     progress from the outer and upper sur
face  of  these hills to the bottom     of the valleys, which inter
sect   them in different directions,      we  find in general three
very distinct strata.     — The upper stratum is for the most part
argillaceous,     as  it furnishes  an excellent earth for making
bricks and tiles. The thickness of this stratum varies in
different places from three or four feet to twenty-five or
thirty. The second stratum, which stretches likewise hori
zontally beneath        the stratum  of clay, is a few feet thick. It
is composed of        a considerable portion of sand, of gravel,
and of pebbles of different natures, argillaceous, calcareous,
and quartzose.         Of these I shall speak more particularly in
the second part, as well as of the fragments produced by their
being broken or decomposed. The third or lower stratum,
which forms the bed of the valleys, and of the rivulets that
run through them in rainy weather, is composed in great
measure     of the fragments of the argillaceous and calcareous
stones    of the second stratum. —The rains have gradually
 produced little gullies in different directions ; which by the
falling of   fresh rain, and the quantity and rapidity of the'
 water, have in the course of time been extended and con
 verted into valleys, more or less broad and deep, in different -
places. Part of the water of several gullies accumulates par
 ticularly in one valky, where during storms and long rains
 it forms a torrent, called in the country the Afycrdanzone.
 Now    the gold dust is found chiefly amodg the sands of this
 torrent, and of the small lateral rivulets that flow into the
 Merdanzone or other similar valleys.
    Does this gold proceed equally from the different strata        I
                                                                 have

                          the Department   of Le Loire.                    285
have mentioned above,              or from one of them only      ?     I   first
examined the brick earth (that of the upper stratum) in
different places and at various depths : I also examined con
siderable depositions of this earth accumulated in the shallow
valleys   :   but   I never discovered     the smallest particle     of gold
in it.    The    searchers      for gold know this so well by long ex
perience and        a great      number of fruitless trials, that they
never pay any regard to this stratum.  It is the stratum be
neath the argillaceous composed of gravel, sand, micaceous
and calcareous stones, in which the particles of gold are
found.
     Of this Ihave convinced myself by several trials: and
though   in general, if equal quantities of earth be taken from
this stratum, and from the bed of the torrent or rivulets
flowing into        it,
                  the latter will yield most gold,    seldom or
                                                            it
ever happens that no gold     found in the former upon trial.

The particles of gold obtained from the auriferous stratum
itself, which have not yet been rolled along with the sand
 bythe rains, have     duller and deeper yellow colour than
                            a
those collected in the bed of the torrent or of the rivulets,
which are of      more shining yellow, no doubt in conse

sand that  more or less fine and blackish, and apparently
               is
of   siliceous and ferruginous nature. The earth of the same
     a
nature, which reaches to some distance, equally contains
gold.     Thus brook that runs on the east of the commune
                    a

                             the
the rain water that washes down an earth composed of dif
ferent strata of the same nature as those of the auriferous
hills of St. George, equally rolls along particles of gold
disseminated beneath the argillaceous stratum, which in
some places   of very considerable thickness.

  Between fifteen and twenty years              ago   several    persons      in
the commune of St. George made             their principal em

  shillings a day, at other times scarce a fourth or fifth of this
  sum. The size of the particles too varied much, from an
  almost invisible atom to the weight of nine or ten grains or
  more.      They were afterward sold            to  merchants, who sent
  them to the mint.
     I  do not speak here of gold dust disseminated in arable
  land.     Earth of this kind in the territory of Salussole, as I
  am informed by my colleague Giobert, contains particles of
  gold.     The earth of gardens is known to contain them. It
  Las been proved in our days by the experiments of Sage,
 Berthollet, Rouelle, Darcet, and Deyeux, that there are
  particles of gold in vegetables.               Berthollet has extracted
 about S*14 gram. (33 grs.) from 48900 gram, or a hundred
 weight of ashes.
     Gold has not yet been found in the arable land in the en
 virons     of St. George, but only in the stratum beneath the
 clay,    the  surface of which is cultivated.                The auriferous
 stratum,     as  I have observed, is more than             thirty feet deep
 below the argillaceous         stratum    in  some    places.
     We have nothing to do here with particles of gold mixed
 with the surface mould by            the decomposition         of plants, or
 which plants have derived from the earth.                   I have no doubt
 that the particles of gold found in the environs of St.
 George have the same origin as those met with from Pont
 to the entrance      of  the Oreo and        of  the  Mallon into    the Po,
 from Valperga and Rivara, to Aglie and St. George's ; as
 well as of those which Dr. Bonvoisin observed in the en
 virons of Challant in the valley of Aoste. The famous piece
 of native gold      preserved    in the arsenal was found there.          In
 that space, pieces of gold of the weight of a louis have
 sometimes been found ; and other pieces are mentioned of
 the value    of more than loolivres (4l.          3s. 4c?.).    Probably the
 gold   found    in the  earth   in  the valley   of  Brozzo,    and in other
 places, has the same origin.               My conjectures on this sub

L.    Some    Circumstances relative     to   Merino Sheep, chiefly
    collected  from   the Spanish Shepherds, who attended those
    of the Flock of Paular, lately presented to His Majesty by
    the Government of Spain; with Particulars respecting that
    great National Acquisition ; and also respecting the Sheep
    of the Flock of Negrete, imported from Spain by His Ma
   jesty in the Year 1791-         By Sir Joseph Banks.
                          [Concluded from p. 248.]
In     the year 1787 the king, guided by those patriotic mo
tives which are ever active in his majesty's mind, gave orders
for the importation of Merino sheep for his own use, and
for the improvement of British wool. As it was doubtful at
that time whether the king of Spain's license, without
which these       sheep   cannot    be embarked at a Spanish port,
could be obtained, it       was deemed advisable to make the first
purchases     in  the parts of Estremadura adjoining to Portugal,
and to ship the sheep for England at Lisbon. The first im
portation of these valuable animals arrived in March 1 788,
and a little flock    of them    was soon after completed ; but as
these were     of various qualities, having been drafted from
different Cavauas, his majesty was pleased to order an ap
plication to be made to the king of Spain by lord Auckland,
then his majesty's minister at that court, for permission to
 import some sheep drafted from one of the prima piles.
This     was obtained ; and a little flock, consisting   of 36 ewes,
4 rams, and       1  manso, arrived safe and well at Dover, in
 1791.      These   sheep had made apart of the Cavafia called
Negrete, one of the three piles restricted from exportation,
 and which is likewise remarkable for producing the largest-
carcased     sheep that are to be found among the    Merino flocks,
 as has been before stated.
     On the receipt of this treasure, (for such it has sit.ce proved
 itself to be,) the king, with his usual prudence and foresight,
 ordered the whole of the sheep that had been procured by
 the way of Portugal to be disposed of, (which was imme
 diately done,) and directed the Negrete breed to be increased
 as much as possible, and maintained in its utmost purity. -

  288      Some Circumstances relative to      Merino    SJieep.
     From that time to the present the opinion of the public,
  sometimes perhaps too unwary, and at others too cautious,
 in appreciating the value and adopting the use of novel kinds
 of    sheep,  has gradually inclined to give      that preference to
 the Merinos which is so justly their due. At first it was
 impossible to find a purchaser willing to give even a mode
 rate price either for the sheep or for      their wool ; the shape
 of the   sheep did not please the graziers, and the wool-sta
 plers were utterly unable to judge of the merit of the wool,
 it being an article so many times finer and more valuable
 than any thing of the kind that had ever before passed
 through their hands. The butchers, however, were less ti
 morous ; they readily offered for the sheep, when fat, a fair-
 mutton price ; and there are two instances in which, when
 the fat stock agreed for was exhausted, the butcher who had
 bought them anxiously inquired for more, because he said
 the mutton was so very much approved of by his best cus
tomers.
    It  was not, however,   till the year 1 804,  thirteen years after
 their first introduction, that it was deemed practicable to sell
them by auction, the only certain means of placing animals
in   the hands of those persons who set the highest value upon
them, and are consequently the most likely to take proper
care of them.      The attempt, however, succeeded ; and the
prices given demonstrated that some at least of his majesty's
subjects had at that time learned to put a due value on the
benefit his royal patriotism offered to them.             One of the
rams sold at the first sale for 42 guineas, and two of the
ewes for 1 1 guineas each ; the average price at which the
rams sold was i9l. 45., and that of the ewes 8/. 1 55. 6d. each.
    This most useful mode of distribution        has since that time
been annually continued,         and the sales have     taken place in
the beginning of August. The last sale was held on the 17th
of August,     1808, when the highest price given for a ram
was 74l. \ Is., for an ewe 38/. 175.         The average prices of
rams was 33/. 105.       id., of    ewes  23/.   125.  bd.   ; —a most
decisive proof not only that the flock had risen very mate
rially in public estimation, but also that the sheep have not
in any way degenerated from their original excellence.
                                                                  The

            Some Circumstances relative to      Merino  Sheep.      299
   The wool       was at first found to be quite as difficult  of  sale
as the sheep themselves         ; manufacturers were therefore em
ployed     to   make a considerable        quantity of it into cloth,
which, when finished,          was allowed by both woollen-drapers
and tailors to be quite as good as cloth          made of wool im
ported from Spain.          But even this proof would not satisfy
the scruples      of  the  wool buyers, or induce them to offer a
price at all adequate to the real value of the article : it was
found     necessary,     therefore,   to have the wool scoured, and
to sell it in that state    as Spanish wool, which, though grown
in England, it really was. Thus managed, the sales were
easily effected for some years, at a price equal to that de
manded for the prima piles of imported Spanish wool at the
times when the bargains were made.
   Time and patience have at last superseded all difficulties,
and his majesty's wool has now for some years been sold as
clipped from the sheep's backs, the sheep having been
washed, and the whole management of them carried on ex
actly    in the English manner,          at a price not lower     than
As. 6d. a     pound, which, allowing for the loss of weight in.
the scouring, costs the buyer at least 5s. 6d. a pound, a tole
rable price for Spanish wool when plenty of it could be pro
duced, though not possibly so high an one as ought to have
been given or as will be obtained for the Anglo-Negfete pile,
when the value of the article is fully understood.
   The    race of another capital Cavaiia has now been added
to  the  riches   of this country, the Paular, and the draught
from it is larger than on any other occasion has been suf
fered   to    leave   Spain ; the animals have been selected with
skill and attention, the pile they belong to stands at the very
top of our English list, and the sheep have been most for
tunately placed at the disposal of our most gracious king,
whose shepherds have demonstrated to the public, in an ex
perience of 1 7 years of their management of these interesting
animals, that they can not only continue the breed in its
original purity, but can als» preclude all danger of degene
ration in the article of wool. What more can be wished for
on this head      ?
   That spirit of patriotism,       which induced our sovereign to

race, will also, it is most earnestly to be hoped, induce his
 majesty to extend the same protection to the newly arrived
 Paulars      ;  by this measure, and by this alone, the public       will
be effectually guarded          against all danger  of rhe admission   of
 impure blood, which the avarice of ill-judging individuals,
 seeking after a premature improvement of the carcase, has
 too often, it is feared, introduced into our English flocks.
 Thus protected, the twofold treasure obtained for the advan
 tage of his subjects by his majesty's wisdom and foresight,
 will become a perennial fountain of true Merino blood, to
 which those agriculturists who are wise enough to adopt the
 breed may from time to fime resort, to correct their errors
  if they fall into     bad practices,   to carry  on their crosses,     if
  any such are found to be advantageous, to the highest degree
  of perfection, and to restore the originality of their stock,
 if, in consequence of any unsuccessful experiment, it should
  have suffered deterioration.

          DEAR    sir,
   In     the    Connaissance    des Tevis for 1809,   I observe  the de
   scription of      a new telescope, invented by the celebrated M.
   Burckhardt,       of an intermediate nature between the Gregorian
   and Newtonian         telescopes; and requiring a tube only half
   as   long as    other instruments of the same focal length.        The
   large concave speculum AB, Fig. 1, (Plate IX.) is perfo
   rated as in the Gregorian telescope, so that the diameter of
   the aperture ef may be half the diameter AB.. The parallel
   rays    Rra, Rn, which, after reflection,        would   have   formed
   the image at      F,  are intercepted by a plane speculum      C, per

  where an image is formed, and viewed with the eye-glass G,
  By giving a small inclination to the plane speculum, the
 image may be formed at A, above the speculum, without a
 perforation in its centre.
    The merit of this invention does not exclusively belong to
 the French astronomer. The same principle was employed in
 the construction of the reflecting telescope more than six
 years ago by     Mr. Paterson, who      had then the       management
 of  the Observatory at Edinburgh, and                instruments con
 structed in this manner were advertised for sale in that city.
 In order to try the performance of a telescope made on this
 principle, I constructed a small one several years ago, with
 out perforating the concave speculum ; but the great loss of
 light when the plane speculum intercepted the incident rays
 that would otherwise have fallen on the central and the most
 perfect part of the concave one, and the distortion of the
 image when the great speculum was inclined a little and the
 plane one placed out of the incident rays, induced me to
 think that the convenience which arises from shortening the
 tube could by no means       compensate for the disadvantages
 with which it was necessarily attended. This was also the
opinion of the late celebrated Dr. Robison, to whom Mr.
 Paterson showed one of his new telescopes^             M. Burckhardt,
 however, seems to think that the advantages              resulting from
 shortening the tube greatly preponderate           ;  and that the loss
of light, which I     have before stated, may be remedied          by en
larging     the aperture  of the concave speculum.            The Board
of Longitude      at Paris have seconded      the views of M. Burck-        .
hardt, and have ordered       a telescope   to be constructed on the
principle already described.
    As this subject has been taken up by the French astro
nomers, it may not' be uninteresting to give an account of
two other contrivances which have occurred to me for
shortening the tubes of telescopes.          If instead    of  the   plane
speculum C, we substitute a^convex             one so     as to  form an
image at O, the telescope becomes Casscgrainiam, requiring
a tube only about one- half the focal length of the concave
speculum.        This construction    is preferable to that which is
described by Burckhardt ; because it is much easier to give a
                                 T2                                correct

S92       A    Reply to    Earl Stanhope,      on his Defence    of
 correct figure to a convex than to a plane speculum ; and it
 is well known to practical opticians, that the errors of one
 spherical speculum often correct those of the other.
     If any   real advantages     arise from     shortening the tubes of
 reflecting telescopes, it becomes a matter of importance that
 refracting telescopes should possess similar properties.                By
 means of the following contrivance the tubes of refractors-
may be so much shortened             as   to be   only one third of      the
focal length of the object-glass.               A plane speculum       CD,
whose diameter is two-thirds            of  that of the object-glass    AB,
is so placed that CA is one-third of the focal length of               AB.
By giving      a  small inclination to      CD,   the rays are reflected to
a second     plane speculum EG, equal to one-third of the dia
meter of AB, which again reflects the incident rays to F,
where the image is formed and magnified by the eye-piece.
In this construction, the only disadvantage is the loss of light
occasioned by two reflections ; but this may be obviated by
increasing the aperture of the object-glass, and is by no
means such a serious evil as that which arises in M. Burck-
hardt's contrivance,         from the loss     of such     a lapge  central
portion of      the great    speculum.

   of Earl Stanhope, printed in your Magazine (vol. xxviii.
  p. 144, and xxx. p. 34,) as relate to the scientific principles
   of Tuning: and similar feelings towards the                very respectable
   individual     alluded to, alone induce me to refrain from again
   touching     on   the tw o " Plain Statements," and the " Narra

   sical reputation I think I ought, that he never, I believe,
   perused or saw the Stanhopian

   ed by His Lordship in vol. xxx. p. 25, previously to its pub
   lication*, except in the hands of Mr. Ferguson, from whom
   he refused to take the proof sheets, or look at them : but, as
   Mr. F. himself told        me, directed him to take them again to
  the printer ; intending, as he (Dr. C.) has often told mc,
  that His Lordship should be responsible for what he had'
  written and got printed, and not suspecting, under the cir
  cumstances,         that the name        of J.   IV.    Calcott       would   be
   affixed to it when published. After this, there needs no more
  for me to say at present, than request those who happen to
  have the two pamphlets, to compare them together, as the
  worthy and unfortunate Doctor intended, by stitching up and
. distributing them, as I mentioned in a former communication.
      There    are six questions     touched upon in His Lordship's
  two Letters       referred  to, on each     of which I wish to be in
  dulged in saying        a few words    : — these   are shortly,
   1st,   Whether      a  monochord board should be divided into 120
      or 100 parts ?
  2d, Whether the difference of the lengths of string, can ac

      strings, of the same size, weight,           and tension        ?

  29  1      A    Reply to Earl   Stanhope,   on his Defence  of
  3d, Whether four or jive columns arc to be found in pages
      7 and 22 of the Stereotype pamphlet ?
  4th, Whether the intervals called the four tierce wolves are       of
      the same or different magnitudes ?
  5 th, Whether equal temperaments            of successive concords
      of the   same   kind, produce equality in the rates of their
      beating    S
 6th, Whether the notation of musical intervals generally,
     by 2, f and m, rather than by their most simple ratios, be
     analogous to substituting a notation by scores, dozens, and
     otld, in place of the universally received decimal nota
     tion ?.
     I. — In    addition to the reasons I have given at page 192 of
 vol. xxvii., for preferring a decimal division of the mono-
 chord, I have further to remark, on what has fallen from
 His Lordship        (page 144  of vol. xxviii.) that  those " impor
 tant lengths"        which His Lordship's scale      is calculated to
 show      in round numbers, are perfectly unimportant ; for?
 what person using a monochord, other than as a play-thing,
v-ants to use the scale attached to the string at all, in tuning
 a. perfect concord      of any kipd ? And does not the use of its
 scale as a tuning apparatus        wholly consist, in either setting
or taking off       tempered  intervals ? And whether is it easiest,
 to set   a  tricqual quint for instance, on a decimal scale by my
 number -6694329, or on His Lordship's scale of 120, by
              ....     .    .   .     2,008Q8,85() +

     II. — T   have maintained     (and am backed by all mathema
tical writers) that it is ratios only, and not lengths, except
of such things as in their nature measure ratios, as logarithm
scales &c. do, that can define musical intervals.                 And
thpugh His Lordship expressly asseits (p. 145, vol. xxviii.)
that " deviations from perfect intervals are concisely, as
well as accurately and conveniently expressed, by means of
the difference of the lengths of wires," I shall take the very
example which he alludes to, (Stereotype p. 8,) wherein, it
is said, 'that 1-44 the difference qf two strings, of which the
                                                                octave.

wolf; in order          to show,     that i.,000»    instead   of expressing
an interval called the enharmonic diesis (21 2 + 2 tn) as it
ought to do, represents an interval exceeding 0 octaves by a
superfluous third (3905 £ + 77 f + a38 m) !
     III. — Five     columns certainly appeared to my eyes, when
I was     commenting on the Stereotype pages 7 and                      there
fore, unluckily it should seem, I mentioned yiVe; but have I
anywhere sajd or insinuated, that His Lordship therefore
intended to represent Jive wolves, besides that produced by
the quints?         And I could not myself hove . intended to re
present five such wolves, when his Lordship is severe upon
me for saying there are but two in all.                 His Lordship's sar
casms, about dividing           12  into  5  aliquot parts, might there
fore have been spared.
     IV. — My       arguments for the exact equality of all His
Lordship's four tierce wolves, (al page 900, vol. xxyii.) re
 tain their force, and are not invalidated by what His Lord
ship has advanced           at page    14 9, vol. xxviii.    ; where, fortu
nately, His Lordship           has let us into the secret       of his blun
ders in this respect, by the mention           of "  monochord lengths,"
showing,^that when His Lordship argues for as complete a
distinction between his tierce wolves, as to magnitudes, as
between half-guineas,             half-crowns, sixpences, and half
 pence, he had no better ground than their different lengths
on the monochord ; 'forgetting what I had endeavoured to
 impress on him, under the second head above, as to the
 fallacy of these lengths as a test of the'magnit tides of inter
vals.      Could not His Lordship as easily " distribute" or di
vide the same interval in four different ways in his                   CGD
 and A columns, as he can so distribute four different inter
vals?      unless he confines his idea of equality, to mono-
 chord lengths,        as then   of course, they would only fit where
 the    octave and       thirds are also    of   the proper proportionate
 lengths    !    Absurdities,    to which     His Lordship surely could
 not have turned his«attention.
     V. — I did think it possible, when writing my                    observa
  tions page     2Q1  tq 2Q3,    vol. xxvii., that slips of His Lord-

296       A Reply     to  Earl Stanhope, oil   his Defence     of
6hip's pen had occasioned his appearing to advance a doc
trine, so opposite fa all that had heen demonstrated by Dr.
Smith, Dr. Robison, and a host of other mathematical
writers ; but" his defence of the same in pages 150 to 152,
vol. xxviii., precludes any such charitable suppositions in fu
ture. The scientific terms, or rather the " scientific jargon,"
of His Lordship, I certainly do not understand, if by that
he means, that I am to receive them, in opposition to the
authorities above quoted, by whom His Lordship was cer
tainly not " obliged to use" his new terms, for they have
uniformly and consistently used pulses or vibrations for
what His Lordship would now for the first tjme call beats ;
and what he would exclusively call beatings they have gene
rally called beats, but have sometimes used beatings as sy
nonymous therewith.
    Before His Lordship took pen in hand on this subject,                 I
well knew that the rate of beating increased along with every
increase of the imperfection of a consonance ; but His Lord
 ship   is the qnly      one    I ever  heard assert,   that it  increases
 *' As   the imperfection increases," which is no more true,
 than that the sine of an angle increases as the angle increases,
 or that gravity increases as the distance decreases.                   His
 Lordship     refers (page 151,) to an example, and attempts             to
 prove, that the triequal quints DA, one an octave above the
 other, beat equally quick : let us therefore see what evidence
 numbers furnish in this case.          By referring to my table in
 page 5, vol. xxx.       it will appear, that the two D's vibrate or
 excite   1 34*44   and 2C8-88 complete pulses in the air in one
 second    of   time respectively, and the two A's 200-83 and
 401-66 pulses respectively, and by using these in the proper
  theorem for the purpose, we get 1-666 beats per second
  made by the lower, and 3-333 beats per second by the upper
  of these, tempered      or tri-equal quints; the one just double of
  the other, instead      of their being equal as our noble author
  has maintained;       and thus we see, that no      " beating between
  the  two   beatings"     could  in this case happen even in theory,
  and certainly none in practice could b» expected ; for who
  besides Earl Stanhope ever talked of hearing beatings, be
  tween two noises which          themselves occur but        1«   and   3:'r
                                                                      times

             his Principles for Tuning Instruments,                    tsfc.        $97
times per second ! or not above one-eighth of the rate neces
sary to constitute continuous or musical sound?        In the
case of equally tempered intervals, situate at the exact di
stance of any of the concords from each other, it is gene
rally true, that no " beating between the beatings" either
in theory or practice can happen. Suppose for instance, His
Lordship's minor sixth C A which                   is flattened about           — parts
                          20
of   a   comma (not — as printed by mistake p.                     1 95,   vol. xxvii.) ;
this in the middle septave beats 22-6335 times per second
(or rather, in practice won't beat at all, but produce a con
tinuous   third discordant note) : if we tune another similar
or equally tempered sixth, on anote, a true minor sixth below
C the     bass       of the former one, that is, on His Lordship's first
bass     E   :   we shall find,       that this will beat just 5-eighths as
fast as the above,                 or 14* 1459 times per second, but no
" beating between the beatings" will take place, although
each are quick enough to produce them, owing to their
having the true relation of minor sixth between them, and
not because they are unisons as His Lordship would contend.
Let us, however, abandon the supposition of the tempered
sixths having basses that are exactly at concordant di
stances, and tune just               a   similar minor sixth below        C to that
which His Lordship                 has above   C, that     is,     take two of these
6ths      in     succession;       then we shall     find,       the    lower note    E
making 151-79 vibrations per second,                       and the 6th           EC will
beat at the rate of 14*3144 times in                  a    second:             which not
bearing      true concordant relation to the beating of the
                 a
upper   6th,  the sounding of the two together will be found
 by calculation to occasion   '* beating between the
                                          a          beatings"
at the rate of 1-3477 per second    thus we see, that " beat
                                               :                                a
ing between the beatings"           may happen to equally tempered
concords   and the same
                 :                  will indeed always happen, in
theory           at least, to the tempered  concords of which His
Lordship   treats (although His Lordship asserts the cdntrary)                         ;
for all his tuning      to be performed
                              is                      by
                                          perfect intervals ex
cept two successive biequal thirds, and three successive tri-
equal quints, all of which will have such                  a   "   beating between

  BQS       A  Reply to      Earl Stanhope,     on his Defence      of
  the beatings," and of course so acute an observer as Hi*
  Lordship cannot fail of perceiving them : and will be ne
  cessitated to     "  beat" a retreat, out of the labyrinth of error
  into which     he has with temerity advanced, instead of think
 ing to    " beat"    his pretended " facts" and           f  important mu
 sical truths" into mc, or any one else who has the least pre
 tensions to mathematical knowledge.
     VI.^I     have here to complain of the same superficial view
 of the subject, as His Lordship took when commenting on
 decimally divided monochords ; the object of any general
 notation of musical intervals cannot be to represent the per
 fect, concords, as       |      J, f, &c, more simply than they
                                     f
 are already expressed, but for comparing inconcinnous inter
 vals, such    as His Lordship's biequal third for instance, with
 any other intervals       :  if we examine the        " important    musical
 truths" in     Stereotype     with this view, what do we find, more
 <han     that the biequal        third   has  an    approximate      ratio of

 that the least interval had the largest numerator, here our

 logous to the conversion of simple ratios by the new notation

 time on a comparison of His Lordship's monochord and
 equal-beating systems, with the systems of other writers,
  particularly those which His Lordship has in so summary a
 way condemned, as I originally proposed, by the help of a
 table of the temperaments and beats of every concord which
  can arise    in each      system   respectively :  and as  I am  kindly
  assisted  in  the labour     of these calculations,    by  a gentleman
 pf more leisure      than myself, with whom        His Lordship   is well
  acquainted, he has in the mean time the opportunity through
  him, of himself anticipating my intended comparisons, and
  of giving, any further support to his systems, which such
  comparative evidence will warrant.

JLIII,              of floating Bodies in running Water,
           On the Motion
     By Peter Barlow, Esq., of the Royal Military Aca
     demy, Woolwich.
      To Mr. Tilloch, — Sir,
In  your Magazine for March, I have observed a letter from
Mn. G. Orr, wherein he endeavours to account for some par
ticular circumstances in the motion of floating bodies in
running waters, that have been noticed by Capt. Burney,
and which, it seems, formed the subject of a paper that was
read before the Royal Society.    In order to accomplish this,
Mr. Orr has called in the assistances of the inclined plane,
and the doctrine of gravity, or, as he calls them, the laws of
matter and motion. Mr. Orr will excuse me, at least I hope
so, when I inform him that he does not seem to compre
hend what those laws are. He is not, perhaps, aware that, in
the sense that he attaches to them, he is reviving the old
exploded notions of Aristotle, which ever since the time of
Galileo have been known to be erroneous : — that celebrated
philosopher proved that, by the law of gravity, all bodies,
whatever their magnitude and density may be, fall through
equal spaces in equal times ; and when this is not the case,
it   arises from those laws being counteracted          by some other
force      .Thus in   the case given by     Mr.   Orr, of two globes of
equal magnitudes and different densities rolling down an in
clined plane, were they left solely to the action of gravity, —
fdr instance,      had the experiment been made in vacuo,            they
would both have descended          in the   same   timei   and the reason
they do not in ordinary experiments, is because the force of
gravity is counteracted by the resistances of the atmosphere;
for, both bodies having equal dimensions, they experience
equal resistances in their descent, and consequently that
body which opposes the greatest force to this resistance,
that    the heaviest body, will descend with the greatest
         is,
velocity.      We see, therefore, that instead of gravity being
the cause      of the different rates of descent of the two bodies,
the circumstance must be attributed to its laws being coun
teracted. Mr. Orr    not less mistaken in considering this
                         is
as   a   parallel case to two bodies   floating     in running water    ;
                                                                  for

                         On floating Bodies.                      30l
fpf in the former case the bodies move through a medium
which is perfectly at rest ; and in the latter the medium it
self is in motion, and is the cause of the motion of the
bodies.
    Having thus,    I think,   satisfactorily shown that Mr. Orr's
laws    of matter and motion are not sufficient to account for
the circumstance alluded to by Capt. Burney, I will venture
to offer my own conjectures on this subject ; — but this I do
with considerable diffidence, and soliciting          a correction of
any errors that may be discovered therein by any of your
ingenious correspondents.
     Let us then suppose the case      of a beam    of timber loaded
at one end ; and let us conceive that        in the first instance the
beam moves parallel to itself,        or that the velocities of the
two ends are equal     :  then it is evident that the heaviest end
will acquire the     greatest   momentum,       and consequently, if
the beam should experience any resistance in its motion,
 that end of it which possesses the greatest momentum will
oppose that resistance with the greatest effect, and will thus
 be thrown foremost ; and this will continue to be the case,
 till its direction coincide with that of the stream.
     What the resistance is that the beam experiences, and
 from what cause it arises, are not difficult to determine. In
 such a river as the Thames, where the experiments were
 made, and where the tide is constantly ebbing and flowing,
 every particle of water cannot be supposed to move with
 equal velocities;    small   eddies, contrary currents, and va
 rious other circumstances will prevent that uniformity,
 though perhaps they may be imperceptible to the eye of even
 an attentive observer.       This being the case, if the beam
 should be struck by any particles of water moving in a con
 trary direction,   or should the beam        strike any that are at
 rest, or moving in the same direction as itself, but with a
 less velocity, any of these circumstances will oppose a re
 sistance to the motion of the beam, which it has been shown
 will be more effectively overcome by that end of it which
 has the greatest momentum.            And in a similar manner we
  may account for the motion        of the two barges.
                                                                Should

 in your next Number, they             are very mifch at your service.

LIV.     Memoir       Upon the Formation        of the Phosphoric       Ether,
    ly  Means of a particular Apparatus.                  By M. Boullay,
    Chemist, in Paris. — Read to the First Class of the Na
    tional Institute tlie 23d       of March, -1807*.
Scheele        and Lavoisier         had repeatedly       tried without   sue—,
cess,   to transform alcohol into ether, by the action of the
phosphoric acid; when at last M. Boudet jun.. an apothe
cary of Paris, published a Memoir upon the subject, in
tome xl. of the Annaks de Ckimie.                The     phaenomena     which
he describes       announce       a real action between the acid and
the alcohol,      and    manifest     several circumstaiices       which ge
nerally accompany the process of etherification. According
to his own admission, however, the produce he obtained
was not very volatile, totally insoluble in water ; and although
it had   a peculiar smell, it did not present the characters of a
true ether.
   Convinced by various trials that the want of action of the
concentrated or even vitreous phosphoricvacid upon alcohol,
was particularly       owing to the difficulty of uniting these two
substances,     of multiplying and prolonging                 the contact of
their reciprocal molecules, I resumed the experiments, and
the hope I entertained of attaining a more satisfactory result
was realized by the following experiment : —
   To   a tubulated retort placed upon a sandbath,                 I adjusted
a bell-glass also tubulated,          which communicated by           a Wel
ter's tube of safety with a         flask filled with limewater.        From
this flask issued      a second tube which proceeded under a bell-
glass attached      to the hydro-pneumatic apparatus.
   1  introduced into the retort 500 grammes of pure phos
phoric acid, resulting from the combustion of phosphorus
                  * From  Annates  de Chimie, tome liii. p. 192.
                                                                            by

               by Means     of a particular Apparatus^             303
 by the nitric acid, vitrified, redissolved, and reduced by
 evaporation to the consistence of honey.
     I afterwards placed upon the tubulure of the retort an in
 strument of glass, which may be called the reservoir? of an
-oblong form, open at both extremities, each of which may
 be made perfectly      air-tight  by means  of  a stop-cock.    From
 the lower     extremity    issued a tube   which   descended to the
 bottom    of  the   retort, and entered into the phosphoric aeki.
 The upper extremity surmounted by a funnel, the commu
 nication between which and the reservoir might be inter
 rupted, had also a small aperture with a ground stopper, in
 order to let out the air when it was displaced by            a liquid.
  (See Plate IX. Fig. 3.)
     The apparatus being thus arranged, carefully luted, and
 the first receiver cooled by a mixture of ice and sea salt,
 afire was lighted under the retort, increasing it gradually so
 as to heat the acid to 95 degrees       of Reaumur. Five hundred
  grammes of alcohol at 40 degrees were then introduced into
 the reservoir, and, by means of the lower stop-cock, drawn
  drop by drop through the phosphoric         acid warm and liquid.
 The mixture took place with            great effervescence: it was
 coloured     black,   and   abundant streaks immediately covered
  the arch and neck      of the retort.
     The fire was kept up, and distillation continued      to dryness  :
    There passed into the bell-glass :
      1. One hundred and twenty grammes of alcohol               feebly
  etherized.      f                                         .
     2. Two hundred and sixty grammes of a white light liquor,
  of a lively sijjell, and much more etherized than the first.,
     3. Sixty grammes of water saturated with ether, and on
  which four grammes of        a lemon-coloured    fluid floated of an
  empyreumatic smell, very analogous           to that which comes
  after the sulphuric ether, and which is commonly distin
  guished under the name of sweet oil of wine.
     4. Another liquid of a foetid insupportable smell, redden
 ing turnsole tincture, and uniting with effervescence with
  the carbonate of potash.         This combination evaporated to
 dryness was a deliquescent scaly salt, perfectly resembling
  acetate of potash, .
                                                                Lime-

  304     Oh the Formation    of  the Phosphoric Ether",   &c.
     Limewater     became   turbid,   but not until after the distil
 lation was over.
     Besides the air in the vessels, a gas of a pungent smell
 was collected, which burned with a white flame, depositing
 upon the sides of the bell-glass a very abundant charry coat
 ing : this was a little ether which had escaped condensation,
 passed over at the same time with the most etherized liquid
 product, and a little before the white vapours which an
 nounce the presence of oil.
    There remained in the retort a vitreous blackish substance,
 composed of phosphoric acid and a little charcoal.
    The two first products united, of the weight of 380 gram
mes, rectified over dry muriate of lime at a heat of about 50
degrees, furnished about 60 grammes of a liquor having the
greatest possible resemblance, in point of smell and taste,
to the purest sulphuric ether. Like the latter, it marked 60
degrees in Baume's areometer, the thermometer being at 10° ;
it was dissolved in eight or ten parts of cold water, was ra
pidly evaporated     in the   air, entered into ebullition at thirty
degrees of temperature, dissolved the resins and phosphorus,
burned with a whitish flame, leaving a charry residuum, and
without any     trace of acid having been exhibited by its com
bustion over the surface of water.
   The other products of the rectification    were alcohol slightly
etherized    : this alcohol when     again passed, in the manner
already shown, through the phosphoric acid used in the ex
                                                                     '
periments, occasioned the formation of a new quantity of
ether in every respect similar to the first.
    It seems to result from the preceding facts, and from the
examination .of the above products,
    ISt, That the phosphoric acid can transform alcohol into
a  perfect ether by means     of  the apparatus which I used, and
by attending to the precautions already described.
    2dly, That the ether which results from the action of the
phosphoric acid upon alcohol is, of all the ethers known,
that which has the most analogy with sulphuric ether, both
with respect to its properties and to the phaenomena ob
served   in its preparation.

in   the mind with all its connections.                               In    some constitutions

mad fro'm the pain                  this idea occasions.                    So that the object
of   madness      generally
                       is                   a      delirious idea,          and thence cannot

minates the paroxysms                         of the epilepsia dolorifica, and an
insanity of greater permanence                             is   frequently induced                   by   the
pains or bruises of parturition.

   Where     the patient is debilitated a quick          pulse sometimes
attends   insane people, which is nevertheless              generally only
a  symptom of      the debility,    owing to the       too great expendi
ture  of sensorial power ; or of the paucity of its production,
as  in inirritative, or in sensitive inirritatcd fever.
    But nevertheless where the quick pulse is permanent, it
shows the presence of fever ; and as the madness then gene
rally arises from       the   disagreeable      sensations attending the
fever, it is so far   a good symptom          ;  because when the fever
is cured, or ceases spontaneously,              the   insanity   most fre
quently vanishes at the same time.
    The stimulus     of  so much volition         supports insane people
under variety of hardships,         and contributes to the cure of
diseases from debility,       as  sometimes occurs towards the end
of fevers. And, on the         same account,        they bear large doses
of medicines to procure        any operation on them ; as emetics,
and cathartics, which, before they produce their effect in in
verting the motions of the stomach in vomiting, or of the
absorbents of the bowels in purging, must first weaken the
natural actions of those organs.
    From these considerations it appears, that the indications
of cure must consist in removing the cause of the pain,
whether it arises     from a delirious idea, or from a real fact,
or from bodily disease; or secondly, if this cannot be done,
by relieving the pain in consequence of such idea or disease.
The first is sometimes effected by presenting frequently in a
day contrary      ideas   to show the fallacy, or the too great es
timation,     of  the   painful ideas,      fidly, By change of place,
and thus presenting the stimulus           of    new    objects, as a long
journey.      3dly, By producing forgetfiilness of the idea, or
object, which causes their pain ; by removing all things
which recall it to their minds; and avoiding all conversa
tion on similar subjects.          For  I  suppose      no disease of the
mind is so perfectly cured by other means as by forgetfulness.
    Secondly, the pain in consequence of the ideas or bodily
diseases above described is to be removed, first, by evacua
tions, as venesection, emetics, and cathartics ; and then by
large doses of opium, or by the vertigo occasioned by a cir
culating swing, or by a sea-voyage, which, as they affect
                                                                        the

                   Memoirs     of Erasmus Darwin, M.D.                         307
the organs of sense as well as evacuate the stomach, may
contribute to answer both indications of cure.
   Where maniacs are outrageous, there can be no doubt
but coercion is necessary ; which may be done by means of a
strait waistcoat ; which disarms them without hurting them \
and by tying a handkerchief round their ankles to prevent
their escape.    In others there can be no doubt, but that
confinement retards rather than promotes their cure ; which
is forwarded by change of ideas in consequence of change of
place and     of objects,      as   by travelling or sailing.
     The circumstances which render confinement                     necessary,
are: first,   if   the lunatic is liable to injure others, which must
be judged        of
                 by the outrage he has already committed. 2dly,
If   he is likely to injure himself ; this also must be judged
of by    the despondency         of his mind, if such exists. 3dly, If
he cannot take care            of his affairs. Where none of these
circumstances exist, there should be no confinement.                           FoY
though the mistaken idea continues to exist, yet if no ac
tions are produced in consequence of                  it,
                                         the patient cannot
be called insane, he can only be termed delirious.  If every
one, who possesses mistaken ideas, or who puts false esti
mates on things, was liable to confinement,    know not         I
who of my readers might not tremble at the sight of                     a   mad
house   !
     The most convenient distribution of insanities will                 be into
general,      as      mania mutabilis,      studium     inane, and
                                                    vigilia                      ;
and into partial insanities. These last again may be subdi
vided into desires and aversions, many of which are suc
ceeded      by   pleasurable    or painful ideas,      by
                                                      fury or dejection,
according to the degree or violence          of their exertions. Hence
the analogy between the insanities of the mind, and the
convulsions of the muscles described in the precedmg genus,
is  curiously exact.    The convulsions without stupor, are
either just sufficient to obliterate the pain which occasions
them   ; or are succeeded            by
                              greater pain, as in the convulsio
dolorifica. So the exertions in the mania mutabilis are either
just sufficient        to allay the pain    which occasions them, and
the patient dwells comparatively in               a   quiet state   ;   or those
exertions excite painful ideas, which              are      succeeded     by   fu

308          Memoirs of Erasmus Darwin, M.Di
fious discourses, or outrageous actions. The studium inane,
or reverie, resembles epilepsy, in which there is no sensi
bility to the stimuli of     external     objects.      Vigilia, or watch
fulness,   may be compared         to    the   general writhing of the
body; which is just a        Sufficient exertion to relieve the pain
which occasions it. Erotomania                may be compared to tris
 mus, or other muscular fixed spasm, without much subse
 quent pain ; and moeror to cramp of the muscles of the leg,
 or other fixed spasm with subsequent pain. All these coin
 cidences contribute to show, that our ideas are motions of
 the immediate organs of sense obeying the same laws                    as our
 muscular motions.
    The violence of action accompanying insanity depends
 much on the education of the person ; those who have been
 proudly educated     with unrestrained passions, are liable to
 greater fury ;  and those whose education has been humble,
 to greater despondency.          Where the delirious            idea,  above
 described, produces pleasurable sensations, as in personal
 vanity or religious enthusiasm, it is almost a pity to snatch
 them from their fool's         paradise,     and reduce them again to
 the common lot of humanity ; lest they should complain                     of
 their cure, like the patient described in Horace,
                            Pol! me oicidistis, amici,
               Non servastis, ait, ci i sio extorta voluntas,
              Et deniptus per vim mentis gratissimus error!
     The disposition   to insanity,       as  well   as   to convulsion,     is
 believed  to be hereditary ; and in consequence to be induced
 in those families from slighter causes than in others.                  Con
 vulsions have been shown to have been most frequently in
 duced by pains owing to defect of stimulus, as the shud
 dering from cold, and not from pains from excess of stimu
 lus, which are generally succeeded by inflammation.                       But
 insanities are on the contrary generally induced by pains
 from excess of stimulus, as from the too violent actions of
 our ideas,  as  in common anger, which                  is   an  insanity of
 short duration; for insanities generally, though not always,
 arise from pains of the organs of sense; but convulsions ge
 nerally, though not always, from pains of the membranes or
 glands. And it has been previously explained, that though the
membranes and glands,         as the   stomach and skin, receive great
                                                                          pain,

                 Memoirs         of Erasmus Darwin, M.D.                                          309
pain from want of stimulus ; yet that the organs of sense, as
the eye and ear, receive no pain from defect of stimulus.
   Hence it follows, that the constitutions most liable to
convulsion,        are those which most readily                          become torpid in
some part       of the system,             that      is,    which       possess less irrita
bility    ;   and that those most liable to                   insanity, are such as
have excess       of sensibility           ;   and     lastly, that these two cir
cumstances generally exist                     in   the same constitution.    These
observations explain why epilepsy and insanity frequently
succeed or reciprocate with each other, and why inirritable
habits, as scrophulous ones, are liable to insanity, of which
I    have known some instances.
      In many    cases, however, there                   is no appearance of the dis
position to epilepsy or insanity                         of the parent being trans
mitted to the progeny. First, where the insanity has arisen
from some violent disappointment, and not from intem
perance in the use of spirituous liquors.    Secondly, where
the parent has acquired the insanity or epilepsy     habits of                     by
intoxication after the procreation of his children.   Which
habits    I   suppose       to be the general cause                 of   the disposition to
insanity in this country.
     As
      the disposition to gout, dropsy, epilepsy, and insanity,
appears to be produced                    by
                            the intemperate use of spirituous
potation, and       all of them hereditary;
                   is   in                   seems probable,            it
that this disposition gradually increases from generation to
generation,     those families which continue for many ge
                  in
nerations to be intemperate in this respect        till at length            ;
these diseases are produced    that      the irritability of the
                                            ;                 is,
system gradually     decreased
                            is     this             by
                                        powerful stimulus, and
the sensibility at the same time increased.                                  This disposition
is   communicated to the progeny, and becomes still increas
ed,   ifthe same stimulus be continued, and so on       third                           bya
and fourth generation            ;        which accounts for the appearance
of epilepsy      in   the    children         of some families, where    was                 it
never      known       before        to    have      existed,           and could         not be
ascribed      to their own    intemperance.                         A   parity of reasoning
shows, that       a   few sober generations may                           gradually in the
same manner restore              a   due degree            of irritability       to the   family,
and decrease the excess of sensibility.

   From hence it would appear probable, that scrophula and
dropsy are diseases from inirritability ; but that in epilepsy
and insanity an excess of sensibility is added, and the two
faulty temperaments are -thus conjoined.
   Colica flatulenta.— The flatulent colic arises from the too
great distention    of   the bowel bv air, and      consequent pain.
The   cause   of this   disease is the inactivity or want     of   suffi
ciently powerful contraction of the coats of the bovvei, to
carry forwards the gas given up by the fermenting aliment.
It is without fever, and generally attended with cold ex
tremities.
   It is distinguished,      first, from the pain occasioned by the
passage    of  a gall-stone, as that is felt at the pit of the sto
mach, and this nearer           the  navel.  Secondly, it is distin
guished from       the colica saturnina, or colic from lead, as
that arising from the torpor of the liver, or of some other
viSfcus, is attended with greater coldness, and with an ach
ing pain; whereas the flatulent colic being owing to disten
tion of the muscles of the bowel, the pain is more acute,
and the coldness less. Thirdly, it is distinguished from in
flammation of the bowels, or ileus,           as  perpetual   vomiting
and   fever   attend    this.     Fourthlv, it is distinguished from
cholera, because that is accompanied with both vomiting
and diarrhoea.       And lastly, from the colica epileptica, or
hysteric colic, ;is that is liable to alternate with convulsion,
and sometimes with insanity ; and returns by periods.
   M.M. Spirit of wine and warm water, one spoonful of
each.     Opium one grain. Spice. Volatile alcali. Warm fo

   The discriminations here merit the utmost praise, and are
of  the highest use to the practitioner.
    Colica saiurnina. — Colic from lead. The pain is felt about
the navel, is rather of an aching than acute kind at first,
which    increases   after  meals, and gradually becomes more
permanent and more acute. It terminates in paralvsis, fre
quently of the muscles of the arm, so that the hand hangs
down when the         arm    is extended    horizontally.    It  is  not
attended    with fever,    or increase   of heat.    The   seat of the
disease is not well ascertained, it probably affects some part
                                                                       of

kept his milk  in  leaden cisterns, used  to wipe off the cream
from the edges of the lead with her finger; and frequently,
as she was         fond    of cream, licked            it     from       her finger.      She
was   seized with the saturnine colic,  and semi-paralytic

     Gy, entitled A Theory of the actual Surface of the Earth.
     By MM. Hauy, Levierre, and Cuvier. Read to the
      Class of Mathematical and Physical Sciences in the Na
     tional Institute,    1807.
                           [Continued   from p. 173.J
 About the commencement of the 18th century, it began
 to be considered, that one single inundation, however vio
 lent it might be, could not produce such immense effects,
 of which     every day developed        more and more their extent.
     It was then necessary to admit of a long series of opera
 tions either slow or sudden ; and those geologists who still
maintained the real existence of a deluge, considered it
simply as the last of the revolutions which have contributed
 to bring the globe into the state we now see it.
     This step once taken, hypotheses were no longer li
mited.       In this branch of natural history the systematical
method of Det-cail.es was          again revived, although Newtou
appeared >o have banished it for ever from the physical sci
ences. Every one conceived a principle a priori, or founded
6olcly on a verv small number of partial observations, and
employed hi: skill to accommodate,                 well or ill,      the  facts
within his knowledge.              But, hy      \   fatality hardly con
ceivable,     hi the  midst   of  all those   efforts, it was almost en
tirely neglected     to extend our knowledge          of  facts  ;  and when
it  is remembered that Leibnitz and Buffon               1were     among the
philosophers of whom we speak, it will be allowed that it
wa;- neither for want of genius nor talents, that so erroneous
a method was adopted.
    It  is thus that the number           of  systems     of geology is so
                                                                 augmented,

augmented, that there are at present above 80, and that it
is necessary to class them in a certain order, only to aid the
memory in retaining their leading principles.                Yet the ex
ample of some          of  the  ablest   philosophers, during the last
thirty years,      has contributed so little to prevent additions to
this long list, that we every day see some new systems ad
vanced, and our scientific journals filled with reciprocal at
 tacks and defences       of their authors.
     How can      so many men of talents,        replete with science and
 integrity, be so discordant, and continue such controversies               !
 The    reason is very      simple ; it is, that    if  one of them were
 right,    neither he nor the others could ascertain          it.   To dis
 cover    if  a fact is owing to a certain cause, it is necessary to
 know the nature of the cause and the circumstances of the
 fact.      What, therefore, in       the actual state    of the sciences,
 are the authors      of geological systems, but persons who seek
 the causes of facts, before the facts themselves are known ?
  Can we imagine an end more chimerical ? Yes : we are ig
  norant,     we do not say merely       of   the nature and disposition
  of   the interior    of the globe, but       even  of its most exterior
 crust.                           ,
     The researches of miners, such as Pallas, Saussure, De-
  luc, Dolomieu, and the school of Werner, have furnished
  us with some important general observations, although not
  yet incontestable, on the primitive mountains r but the se
  condary ones, which constitute the most embarrassing part
  of the problem, are scarcely touched ; and the principal
   points, oh which necessarily depends what relates to causes,
   are yet in question.      We could     cite a multitude    of examples;
   but to be brief, we shall confine ourselves to one or two.
      Have organized beings lived in the places where their re
   mains are found, or have they been transported there ? Do
   these beings still live, or have they been wholly or partly
   destroyed    ?
      Is it not   evident   that the system of supposed         causes must
   differ  as   much   as black and white,       according as these ques
   tions are answered       in the affirmative or negative ? Never
   theless, no person can yet answer them positively ; and what
   is still more singular, no philosopher, I believe, has ever sus
                                                                      pected

   314       Report on a Manuscript       Work   of M. Andre.
   pected that it would be necessary to be able to answer them
  before attempting to make a system.
      Hence the reason why some will have millions of years
  for the formation of secondary mountains, while others
  pretend   that about 5000 years ago they were formed in one?
 ,A11 the   intermediate parts between these two extremes have
  had their defenders.
      There already exist ten or twelve hypotheses for the par
  tial explanation of the formation of the basin of Paris, yet
  not one pf those who have formed them knows what exists
  in one small corner of this basin, which contains only a few
  square toises. At Grignon there are 600 species of unknown
  shells, besides 40 or 50 that are supposed to be known.
  This fact is stated by M. de Lamarck, after several years re
  searches.    Neither does one of them knpw that our gypsum
  contains the bones of 12 or 15 quadrupeds, which neither
 resemble    those seen here or elsewhere       ;  another fact which
 has only been ascertained after ten years labour.
     Judge then what ought to be the explanations coolly ima
 gined in the closet by persons to whom these two little
 circumstances of the phaenomenon were unknown. How
 then ought      a learned  society to act, in order to extend and
 improve so interesting and useful a science, and direct it to
real and attainable objects ?        It ought in this, as in every
 other science, to encourage by its approbation all those who
 state positive facts, and preserve the most rigid silence on
the systyems which succeed them.            In this manner the au
thors of systems treat the observers or collectors of facts. It
is curious to sec them all, the moment any discoveries are
made by observers,       ready to seize them, arrange them ac
cording to their own ideas,       and convert them into weapons
against their adversaries.       It  appears as   if anatomists,  zo
ologists,    and mineralogists,     were  but workmen destined to
furnish materials for their fantastical fabrics.
     Happily for the example of those who may be tempted to
 pursue such a course, these castles in the air vanish like ap
paritions, and the more solid edifice raised on facts and in
duction begins to appear.        The plan, if we may so speak,
is already traced ; men of judgement at the end of the 18th

          Report on a Manuscript Work                  of M. Andrt.         315
century have proposed questions ; they have already an
swered some, and have indicated the only means by which
the remainder may be resolved.                   The   series   of problems   is
proposed, and nothing but enlightened perseverance           is
wanted to fill up the outline which constitutes the science.
   It is not foreign to the object of our report to present
here, as an example, some of the principal objects which
appear to us necessary to be profoundly studied, in order to
make geology a science of facts, and before attempting,
with any hope of         success,       to answer the grand problem           of
the causes which have reduced our globe to its actual state.
To this end we ought,
  1st, To search if the division of great chains in one middle,
and two lateral banks or dikes, observed by Pallas, and de
veloped by Deluc, is invariable, and examine, as Ramond
has done on the Pyrenees, the causes which sometimes con
ceal them.
   2dly, To examine if there is also any thing certain or uni
form in the succession of secondary strata, if such a kind
of stone is always below such another, and vice versa.
   3dly, To operate in a similar manner on the fossils, de
termine the species which appear the first, and those which
are only seen afterwards ; discover if these two sorts never
accompany each other,               if there    are any alternations in their
appearance ; that        is,
                        the first found appear
                               if              second time,     a
and  if
      the second  have then  disappeared.
  4th, To compare the fossil with the living species more
minutely than has hither been done, and determine     there            if
isany relation between the antiquity of the beds, and the
similarity or dissimilarity of fossils with the living beings.
  5th, To determine        there
                               if   any uniform relation of cli
                                           is
mate between         fossils and those living beings which most re
semble     them   ;   'as for example,         if
                                            they have migrated from
the north to the south, the east to the west, or                  ifthere have
been mixtures and irradiations.
   6th, To determine what fossils have lived where they are
now found, what others have been transported there, and                       if
there are, in this respect, uniform rules with regard to the
6trata,   species,    or climates.
                                                                            7lb,

     316        Report on a Manuscript      Work
       7th, To follow minutely their different strata throughout
    their whole extent, whatever may be their doublings, inclU
    nations, ruptures, and slopings; and also to determine what
    countries belong to one and the same formation,             and what
v others have been formed separately.
       8th,   To follow     the horizontal   beds  and   those which are
   inclined in one or different ways, to determine if there is any
   relation between the greater or less constancy in their hori
    zontal position, antiquity, or nature. •
       9th, To determine the valleys in which the re-entering
   and saliant angles correspond, and those in which they do
   not ; also those in which the strata are the same on both
   sides, and those in which they differ, in order to discover if
   there is any relation between        these two circumstances,      and
   if  each   of   them   taken apart has any analogy with the na
  ture and antiquity of the strata composing the heights which
  limit   the valleys.
      All   these    points are necessary to its elucidation, if we
  wish to make geology a body of doctrine or a real science,
  independent of every desire which we may have to find an
  explanation of facts. We dare affirm that there is not one
 of those points on which any thing absolutely certain is yet
 known,         every   thing   which   has   hitherto   been  advanced
 being more or less vague.        The  greatest part  of those who   have
 treated    of   such subjects, have considered them rather as they
 answered their system, than according to impartial observa
 tions.
      The fossils alone, singly considered, may yet furnish matter
 for the study of 30 years to several industrious philosophers •„
 and their connections with their strata will still require as
many more years of travel, of boring, and other arduous
 researches.              4
      What     service would not a society such as       ours render to
the natural sciences, if it succeeded in directing to these
long, laborious, but determinate researches, those persons
with     an ardent     desire  of knowledge, who      are now  likely to
be led, by the       contagious example of many men of merit, to
the adoption of systems so easily created and so flattering to
vanity ! The work of M. Andre, examined according to
                                                                   these

          Report on a Manuscript Work          of M. Andre.        317
these    principles, presents two distinct parts, only one of
which falls within the province of this class. It is that in
which     this philosopher     relates   his observations during his
travels.
     Faithful   to the laws    of  the  religious order to which he
belongs, M.       Andre has traversed on foot numerous and ex
 tensive routes: he travelled     as an  enlightened observer,    noted
 with   care the elevations and cavities      of the earth ; the nature
 of stones,     and their relative   position to each other and to
 the horizon.       He has taken for a model the geologist who
 first  merited    this honour, the celebrated Saussure ; that is
 to say, he has described in a precise manner all the objects
 which struck him on his route, in           the  order in which they
 occurred.
     A  chain   of mountains      traversed    and described with so
 much care, forms the subject of a general view which M.
 Andre has not failed to trace. It is thus that he exhibits the
  part of the Alps which he has seen, and which comprehends
  the space between St. Gothard and St. Bernard.               He after
  wards passed to the Jura, a secondary ridge very different
 from the Alps, which he examined from the fall of the
  Rhone to the Rhine, that is, nearly its whole length.             The
  Vosges are the third ridge, a part of which was examined
  from Epinal to Giromagny.            He describes the bank of se
  paration which on the one side throws the water to the
  ocean, and on the other to the Mediterranean j he likewise
  passed from the summit        of Salins almost to Cluni ; observed
  and described     a part of the plains which unite the Alps to
  the  Jura,   and those   which, commencing at the Saone, fol
  low   the course   of the Rhine to Strasburgh,
      Although M. Andre, throughout the whole of the first
  part of his work, frequently alludes to opinions which he
  endeavours to prove in the second, it is not the less valuable
  for a great number of interesting facts which he details, and
   which are independent of all system. Such in the first place
   are the  cirri, or circular  spaces sunk between high sheltered
   rocks,   which    he  frequently observed in the Alps.         Such,
   also, are his remarks on certain isolated pyramids, formed
   of divers layers or strata, the contiguous parts       of which must
                                                              necessarily

3 i8       Report on a Manuscript Work           of M. Andri.
necessarily have been carried off by some cause,            although no
vestiges of them can now be found at the feet              of   these py
ramids.
   In Vallais, M. Andre         describes     many steep banks and
erosions of the water, which             escaped Saussure, who had
seen only the lower part       of the country,      and that during no
more than two days.          Nevertheless he also shows that this
great valley,   so far  from   having saliant and re-entering an
gles corresponding on two sides, enlarges and contracts al
ternately even to five times. In general the article Vallais is
one of the most complete in this work, M. Andre having
traversed it several times and by different routes.            He points
out, in several places of the Alps, examples of schistose layers
twisted or bent in many directions, which it would be diffi
cult to reconcile with       the common         theories.     In general,
however, he appears very little favourable to            the idea of the
displacing of strata.
   His description of Mont Blanc is precise and perspicuous,
and will be read with interest even after that of Saussure, to
whose     veracity  and    accuracy he renders          perfect justice.
With    the same care he      has described      Si. Gothard      and its
environs.     He remarks that       the    highest ridges are not in
the central onain      ; a  similar    fact occurs in the Vosges.
M.   Ramond discovered       the same thing in the Pyrenees.
   In his description of Jura        he carefully     distinguishes the
compact calcareous rock without petrifactions, which forms
the central parts of the chain, from the calcareous congre
gation   of shells which compose         the lateral and   less elevated
parts.    He   observed     rolled pebbles, and large calcareous
stones worn round by moving,            like the masses of granite in
the Alps; the latter also were discovered in Jura, although
not believed to exist by Saussure, who had not sufficiently
examined it. M. Andre likewise speaks of numerous ca
verns and hollows in this chain.             He  describes   its glaciers,
particularly the lime glacier five leagues from Besangon. Of
this he giyes the temperature taken at different periods of the
year, to show that it is far from being the reverse of the ex
ternal air,  as some    persons have alleged.
   His comparison of       the  Alps, of Jura,       and  of Vosges, is
                                                                 curious ;

         Report on a Manuscript Work              of M. Andr£.             3t9
curious; in  the Alps there are longitudinal and transversal
valleys ; in Jura these are almost all longitudinal ; in the
Vosges almost all are oblique. We know that the Pyrenees
have a fourth structure, and that the vallej s there are very
nearly all perpendicular.  The Vosges are singular for the
quantity  of grcs and   of puddingstone, which cover their
isolated summits, and which appear to be the vestiges of an
immense platform.
   From these     details it    will   appear that   M. Andre        has care
fully observed the countries over which he has travelled, that
the facts which his work contains may be very valuable to
positive geology, at least in what relates to the mineral
masses; and although he was not particularly occupied with
the fossils, we consider that he must take, in this respect,
a distinguishedrank among observing geologists.
  To his own descriptions of the countries which he visited,
he has added several extracted from the best authors, such
as   Saussure, Deluc,         Dolomieu, Ramond,
                                           and Patrin, on
those which he has not seen.  Hence the author infers, that
there must be a great analogy between distant regions, and
that the theories  applicable to these countries must be
nearly so to the whole earth. At the conclusion he says
something of fossils, but solely after other naturalists.
Having thus established his data with great care, either from
his own observations or from the most respectable authori
ties, M. Andre proceeds to the consequences which he
thinks must result from            those different facts.           After what
we have said at the commencement of our report, it will not
be expected that we should pronounce judgement on this
part of the work; but we shall not abstain iron/ giving an
idea   of it.
     He thinks   that   the     actual arrangement       of   the    surface   of
the earth has not existed from a very remote epoch, and he
endeavours to prove      like MM. Deluc and Dolomieu,
                          it,                                                  by
the progress of depositions [eboulemens)       and   , that of de
                                                              by
composition  and  formation  of soil [at Itris semens). He like
wise thinks that this arrangement      totally owing to cause
                                             is                        a
unique,  general, uniform, violent, and prompt;       and ap
pears to attribute to this cause even the transport of foreign
                                                                        fossils.

   fossils. He attempts to prove that neither volcanoes, earth
   quakes, rivers, nor currents, could possibly arrange the
   surface of the earth     as it is in the present day.
      These ideas have also been entertained by several celebrated
   naturalists, especially when restricted to the last change ex
   perienced by the        earth.    Your committee (commissaires)
   even   feel themselves     able personally to adopt them in part,
   although they well know that the reasons which determine
  them cannot have the same influence on all the world. Yet,
  for the reasons which they have before stated, they do not
  wish to engage the Class to pronounce on such subjects.
  But they do not hesitate to propose, that the Class should
  testify to M. Andre the esteem which it owes to his labo
  rious researches, and to the enlightened zeal which induces
  him to continue his useful labours at so advanced an age.
 They     do not doubt that the work          of this    respectable philo
  sopher will be received by naturalists           as a   collection so rich
  in interesting    facts ought to be.
 LVII.      Observations upon Subterraneous Heat, made in the
     Mines of Poullaouen, and of Huelgoal, in Britany, in
      France.     By J. F. Daubuisson*.
There         are few questions      in physics, respecting which it
 is more necessary        to be in possession of positive and well
 established facts, than the temperature of the interior of the
globe, taken at depths which it is in our power to visit.                  I
have already published some facts on this subject with re
spect to the mines of Saxony, and now proceed to detail
some others resulting from observations made last summer
 (1806) in the mines of Poullaouen, and of Huelgoat, in
Britany.       The habits to which I have been accustomed of
examining these subjects, added              to my knowledge of the
country,      having enabled me to choose, with some discern
ment, the points where I wished to ascertain the tempera-,
ture, I hope that the facts I am about to relate will not be

                                                                         the

  the terrestrial globe.          The thermometer I used was a mer
  curial one, and graduated into twenty-tour parts, from the
  freezing point to that of boiling water.                  It was inclosed in
 a glass tube. I ascertained by experiment, that when it in
 dicated a certain degree of heat, and when it was removed
 about twelve degrees therefrom, three or four minutes were
 requisite if it was dipped in water at the freezing tempera
 ture, and eleven or twelve minutes when held in the air.
 According        to these data,      at all times when       I wished to take
 the temperature of a mass of water in mines, I plunged the
 thermometer entirely into it and kept it there five minutes :'
 when a mass of air was to be examined, I held the thermo
meter a quarter         of an hour.        All  these observations were re
 duced     to the    centigrade thermometer.             However great the
 care and patience          I bestowed, I could never answer pre
 cisely within a quarter of a degree.
                     Observations made at Poullaouen.
     I shall    begin by describing the position of the place.
     The mine of Poullaouen             is situated in 483 17' 49" of lati
tude, and 5° 55' 57" longitude west from Paris : its orifice
 (St. George's pits) is 106 metres above the level of the sea.
It is four myriametres from the north extremity of Britany,
and six from the south and east extremities.                      The country
in which it is situated forms part of the tongue of land
which, in the form of a roof, the ridge of which is 260 metres
above the level of the sea, advances into the ocean, and con
stitutes the country called Britany.                 The district in which
the mine is situated is about 150 metres above the level of
the sea : this country is broken up in every direction by
valleys; one of them resembles an almost circular basin
about a thousand metres in diameter, and it is under the
soil   of this    basin   (which is 106 metres above the level of the
sea) that the mine of Poullaouen is wrought.
     According to the law followed by the heat of the equator
at the pole, the mean temperature of the surface of the
earth at Poullaouen ought to               be   12*4°*.     The elevation of
    • I have been led both from theory and observation to use an extremely
simple expression describing the thermometrical temperature of any place, the
latitude of which is known.       This expression is, 30-7° Coss. ' ^ latitude ; or
with   a sufficient exactitude in the temperate zone, 28* Coss.   2 latitude.

the ground requires nearly a degree of diminution ; so that
we may estimate the mean temperature as 11'5°.
   My observations    were made on the 5th    of September  1 806.
During the whole of the day the sky was serene and cloud
less. The temperature taken in the shade at mid -day was 19°-
   In detailing the rest of my observations, I shall lay down
the position of the points at which they were made, as well
as what appeared to me to influence the temperature.           By
the side  of  each  thermometrical expression 1 shall give the
depth below the surface of the point to which it refers :
   1st, In the first gallery, called the level of 50 feet, near
the pit by which we descend, in a place where there is but
a feeble current  of air,  a little water which    was upon    the
ground indicated, — Temperature 13* 1°. Depth 16™.
   2d, In the gallery of St. George, under the intersection
of three branches of the ridge, in a kind of euldesne, far
distant from the place occupied by the miners, where there
was no current of air, but from the upper part of it a great
quantity of water filtered.      This water gave, — Temperature
J 1-9°. Depth 39m.
   3d, The water of filtration which fell into this gallery
(St. George's) indicated, on being brought to the mouth of
the pit, — Temperature 1 2- 1°. Depth 39m.
   4th, Thirty- six metres lower down, at the level of la
Boullaye, towards the extremity of a long gallery, where
there is neither a current of air nor a single workman ; in
the water I found, — Temperature 1 1 "90. Depth 75m.
   5th, At the very bottom of St. George's pit, in the hole
wherein the waters collect which have fallen from above;
the water indicated,  — Temperature 14'2°. Depth       142m.
   6th, The air above this water, — Temperature       15°. Depth
J41m.
   7th,  In the hole at the bottom of the pit St. Barbe, (at
the other extremity of the mine,) in the water I found,—
Temperature 13-5°. Depth 150m.
   8th, In the air above this water, — Temperature 14-4°.
                                  '

     N.B. The waters coming from the filtrations (which prin
 cipally take place in the upper parts of the ancient works)
 are cold ; and as they form the greater part of those which
 flow into the pit or well of St. Barbe, they are the cause of
 the little heat presented by those which exist there.
     10th, In an excavation not far distant from the bottom
 of the well of St. Barbe (called the furnace gallery), the sides
 of which are almost completely covered with radiated py
 rites,   partly efflorescent, the thermometer left for more
 than   a  quarter of an hour in a small hollow made in the
 midst of the pyrites, and which contain a good deal of white
 sulphate, — in this case the thermometer stood at, — Tempe
 rature 14-6°. Depth 140m.
     1 1th,   When afterwards plunged into          a small hole whence
 a very strong spring         issued, it also stood at, — Temperature
 14-6°. Depth MOm.
     Consequences.   — 1st,     Observations 2, 3, and 4, prove in-
 contestably that the heat        of the rock in the upper parts of the
mine is 12°, as the waters which indicated it filtered through
the rock ; and we find that this temperature does not sen
 sibly differ from that pointed out by theory. If the first Ob
servation gave      a greater    heat,  it is because it was made in a
place through which          air from      without   continually   passes ;
and this air was warm, the experiments having been made
at the end of summer.
    2d, Observations        5 and 6 also     show that the temperature
of   the lower parts     of  the   mine is more considerable than
that of the upper parts.           If in deep places the air appears
to be warmer than the water, it is probably because it has
preserved a part of the heat which it had upon entering the
mine.       I  have already assigned       the reason   wtych    accounts
for our having         in Observations       7> 8,  9, a less  heat   than
might be expected from the depth.
    3d, .Experiments 10 and 11 show that there are cases in
which the presence of pyrites does not produce heat : the
heat indicated in these cases cannot depend upon that cause :
in the pit of St. George there is no pyrites, and the tempera
ture is the same.
    Thus,     if we abstract every extraordinary cause,           the Ob-
                                     X   2                     seryations

324            Observations  on Subterraneous      Heat.
 servations  I  have related  appear    to me to    indicate that, at
 the depth of 1 50 metres, the temperature is at Poualiouea
 3° or ¥ higher than at the surface of the ground.
                  Observations  made at Huelgoat.
     The mine of Huelgoat is situated at 48° lb' 17" latitude,
 and 6° l' 46" of west longitude : its orifice (the mouth of
 the pit) is 1"3 metres above the level of the sea.         It is situ
 ated upon a broad hill, which separates two valleys, the
  depth of which is from 80 to 90 metres.
     From what we have said      as to the   latitude and   elevation,
  we may conclude that the mean temperature is 1 1°.
     The rock like that at Poullaouen is an argillaceous schist,
  and also contains several strata of aluminous schist.
     The following are the Observations          made   by me on the
  5th of September, being on the same          day with those made
  at Poullaouen.
     1st, In a gallery about five metres below the one by which
  the workmen generally enter the mine, which has no other
  orifice but one, and which no person has entered for many
  years, where there- is no current of air, the thermometer
  placed at its northern extremity marked in about 20 mi
  nutes, — Temperature 1 1°.
      After having descended the pit called the Miners' pit, I
  entered another pit which adjoined a gallery absolutely         with
   out any communication with the rest of the mine, and in
  which there was consequently no current of air.
      2d, The thermometer, when plunged into a little stag
  nant    water upon the ground,      rose to, —Temperature 12-2°.
   Depth 70m.
      3d, I reascended to the first gallery, and in the water of
   a gutter, in a place through which a current of air passed,
   the thermometer marked, — Temperature           13- 7°. Depth 60m.
      I then proceeded    southward, to the spot where they were
   then working.
      4th, In the second gallery, a little way from the pit by
   which the produce of the mines is extracted, in a place where
  there was a continual and strong current of air, a little stag
  nant water marked, — Temperature         1 5°.  Depth 80m.
                                                                   5 th,

    3th,   In  the fifth gallery, the thermometer, plunged into A
water tank near the great pit, rose to,-»-Tempetature 17°.
Depth l60m.
   6th, At the extremity        of the gallery No. 9-}-, a great quan
tity of  water is seen to issue from the rock slightly vitriolic       :
the thermometer, when held           a quarter of an hour in the midst
of the jet, constantly marked, — Temperature 1Q- 7°. Depth
230m.
    7th, When held in the air on one side, it also marked,—
Temperature 1Q- 7°. Depth 230m.
    8th, About 60 paces nearer the mouth             of the pits, the
water of the stream formed from the above               jet stood  also
at, — Temperature ig-7°. Depth 230m.
   The bottom of          the  mine was under water which was 16
metres deep.         I descended through a small pit, a short way
from the great one, to the level of the subterraneous lake.
    9th, The thermometer, when kept for a quarter of an
hour upon a plank floating in the water, marked,— Tem
perature 18*8°. Depth 238m.
    10th, When plunged in water it also             indicated,—Tem
perature    18'8°.    Depth 238m.
    All the    water   which flowed into this southern part of the
mine proceeded to the subterraneous lake from which it was
pumped up.
    11th, The temperature of the water poured into the gal
lery No. 7, from the pump, was, — Temperature 19-4°.
Depth     180m.
    Proceeding along this gallery the water flowed into
 another pit in the northern part of the mine.
    12th, Here it mingled with a small quantity of water,
the temperature of which was 15°. Depth 120m.
    13th,   And when       the whole together were poured, by means
of pumps,       into  the  uppermost gallery, they marked, — Tem
 perature    1 8*4°.
    We    have here two classes      of observations, which must be
kept distinct ;       namely, thoge made in the northern, and
in the southern part of the mine.
    The former, in my opinion, indicate the natural tempera
 ture of the soil. No. 1, being made 20 or 30 metres below
                                     X  3                            the

the surface   of the ground, ought       to be regarded   as giving the
real degree   of heat  of   the surface   of  the country in general.
I see  no cause which could         alter the temperature naturally
proper for this place, which is far distant from any working
places : one thing is certain, that it continues, the same
during the whole year ; and the result is precisely the
same as pointed out       by theory-       Observations 2 and 3 also
show that this temperature increases in proportion as we
descend. The current of air in the first gallery accounts
for the trifling excess of heat we remark there, in propor
tion  tq the depth.
   As   to the temperature      of the Observations made in the
southern part of the mine, it is visibly influenced by an ex
traneous causae ; namely, by the vitriolic water which flows
from the south.       Qn digging a new pit 100 metres distant
from the south part of the present workings, they have cut
through     beds  of  an aluminous        schistus,  which has a very
strong styptic taste.      By the h^-lp of a microscope we dis
cover in it a multitude of pyritous points, which, by their
decomposition arid their action upon the schistus,                 have
probably produced a disengagement of caloric, which               must
have heated the water passing through these beds.                  The
latternot being very deep, communicate with the atmosphere
by some fissures, while decompositions and disengagements
must have been effectuated in the interior pf the earth-
   However this may be, it seems certain that it is by pass
ing through these beds that the water must have acquired &
heat   of 20°,   a heat  far superior to that which        agrees  with
the depth at which      it is found,
   I shall also  here, observe,     that if we ascribe this heat to
the pyrites, they produce        it  by their action upon the schis
tus. In the observations made at Poullaouen, we have seen
pyrites in a considerable quantity occasion no particular in
crease   of heat. I shall repeat here what I have said in an
other place : I have seen workings of pyrites, and I have
not found the heat sensibly stronger than in other mines:
thus I am led to think that the pyrites in a mass, at least
those not radiated, produce uo subterraneous heat : but those
which    are disseminated     in minute particles in    a body upon
                                                                 which

    which the sulphuric acid can have an action, act different
    ly when there is an accession of atmospheric air.   I have
    femarked in another Memoir, that it is not the coal which
    contains most      pyrites, which gives                       in the inside of the
    mines     the inflammable gas known                           by the name of fire«
damp, but rather the coal which contains little or none
visible to the naked eye, and in which the sulphuret of iron,
    probably exists in particles not discernible.

Society,       asI     have formed them                 with   great attention.

tained similar information among my acquaintance. Hence
I collected, that the increase in the circumference of trees
is generally from about one to two inches annually, and
from twelve to eighteen inches the annual increase in height.
Some fall little short, and some exceed those measures.

328                Method of ascertaining         the Value
    I shall   now briefly notice a few        of the        advantages      to be
derived from the first Table.
     1st,  The first Table shows         every fourth year, from twelve,
years old to a hundred, the rates per cent. per annum at
which all trees increase, whether they giow fast or slow,
provided their rate of growth does not vary. This table may
be the means of saving young thriving woods from being
cut down,       by showing how great a loss is sustained by fell
ing    timber   prematurely *.
     2d, And it. may be the means of bringing old trees to
market, by showing the smallness of the interest they pay
for the money they are worth, after they are 80 or 1 00 years
old.
    But this    table   shows the interest which they pay, only,
whilst the     trees continue      growing at their usual rate.                 Ia
case     they   fall short only a little of their usual increase in
girl,    this  considerably diminishes the rate per cent. per an
num qf their increase. And trees do decrease in their rate
of growth      before they appear to do        sof.        A  pale and mossy
bark are certain indications of it.
    3d, The first Table may also assist the valuer                      of such
 timber    as is  not to be cut down,        but to continue growing,
by enabling him to estimate its present value more accurately
   * "A    wood, near West Ward, in Cumberland, of more than 200 acres,
was felling in 1794, it was little more than SO years old. The whole was cut
away without leaving any to stand." See Miller's Gardener's Dictionary, last
edition, under the Head of floods.
   At 30 years old timber pays 10 per cent, for standing, and probably this
wood might have paid 7 per cent. per annum on an average for the next SO
years.
   t In Mr. Pringle's Agricultural Report of Westmoreland is a paper of tl«4
Bishop of LandafF's, stating, " That a very fine oak, of 82 years growth,
measured in circumference at six feet from the ground, on the 27th of Oc
tober 1792, 197 inches, and on the same day of the same month in 1793, it
measured 108 inches."      He then states the interest it paid to be only about
2 per cent., and says  this tree was a singularly thriving one. It is evident
that, with all this appearance of thriving, it was on the decline.       For if we
divide 108, its inches in circumference, by 82, its age, we find, its average
annual increase had been one inch and a third.     Its falling off to one inch re
duced the rate per cent, of increase one-fourth.
                                                                             than'

than is usually done, especially when it is increasing after a
high rate per cent. per annum"*.
    The second Table shows the rate per cent. to be the same
as in the first  Table, though the annual increase is more bo;h
in height and circumference.
   The third Table is calculated to show the number of trees
that will stand on an acre of ground, at the distance of one-
fifth of their height, (which distance is recommended by
Mr. Salmon, in         a paper    in the Society's 24th volume,) and
the number of         feet   the trees will contain, both those to
be cut out,     and those to be left standing,          « the end of every
four years, from 16 to 64 years old, supposing they increase
 12 inches in height and 1 in circumference aunually.                     This
distance may suit fir trees, but will be too near for oaks.
   The fourth and fifth Tables show the same particulars
when the trees grow at greater rates.
    The sixth Table is calculated to show the same particulars
when the trees are constantly thinned out every four years,
so as to leave them at the           distance    of one-fourth       of their
height.      According     to this table       there  will  be 48 trees left
on an acre when they are 120 years old ; and it seems ge
nerally agreed, that from 40 to 50 full-grown oak trees are
as many as have sufficient room to sand on an acre.
    The seventh Table shows the same particulars respecting
trees which increase 15 inches in height and 1{ inch in cir
cumference annually.
    The eighth Table shows the same particulars respecting
trees which increase 18 inches in height, and two inches in
circumference annually.
    The ninth Table shows the same particulars as Table 6,
till the   trees are 28 feet    high,     after which the distance is        in
creased from one-fourth           to one- third    of their height.
    The 10th, Uth, and 12th Tables show the annual in
crease in boles of 24, 32, and 40 feet long, and the differ
ence of their increase at the same ages.
   * A fir wood of more ihan 30 acres, and about 30 years old, was
                                                                          lately
valued to be sold with an estate, by several eminent wood-valuers, without
taking into consideration its rate of increase. It was then increasing after the
rate of 10 per cent. per annum, and probably would increase after the rate
pf 8 per cent, on an average for the next 20 years.
                                                                             To

   To these Tables succeed comparative statements, showing
the number   of feet contained in boles of different lengths,
when the trees, are 60 years old ; by which it appears, that,
if cut down at that age, the longest boles are not the most
profitable to the growers of timber.
   And I           have added the valuation                                                                                                                    of                    the                          plantations before

Calculations, showing every fourth year, from 12 to 100,
  the progressive annual increase in the growth of trees, and
  gradual decrease in the rate percent. per annum, that the
  annual increase bears to the whole tree.
  The whole height of     the trees is taken to the top of the
leading  shoot, and  the girt in the middle ; but no account
is taken of the lateral branches.
  If trees         increase 1 2 inches in height and 1 in circumference
annually,           their increase will be as undermentioned, viz.

     In Table X. of                                               the increase                 of    a bole                     of            24 feet                  in height,
of     a tree growing at the                                                          above-mentioned                                                             rate, it will be
observed, that the Contents at 24 years of age are the same,
and at 64 years nearly the same as in the above Table, but
the     contents                         of               the   bole at all the intermediate periods ex
ceed the above.                                              And a 40 feet bole exceeds the above con
tents  from 44 years to 100, as may be seen in Table XII.
For these reasons chiefly I did not think it necessary to take
into consideration the decrease in height that takes place in
trees at different ages, according to the kind of tree and
quality of the soil.
   The increase per cent. per annum is the same as the above
in all trees at the same age, whether they have grown faster
pr slower, provided their increase in height and thickness
annually has not varied on an average.       The progress of
trees    is sometimes greatly retarded by insects destroying
their leaves,  by  unfavourable  seasons, and by their roots
penetrating into noxious strata.    But these accidents cannot
enter into calculations.
Calculations, showing every fourth year from 12 to 64, the
   progressive annual mcrease in the growth of trees, and
   the gradual decrease in the rate per cent. per annum that
   the annual increase bears to the whole tree.
   The whole height of the trees is taken to the top of the
leading shoot, and the girt in the middle ; but no account
is taken of the lateral branches.
   If trees increase eighteen inghes in height, and two inches
in circumference, annually, their increase will be as under
mentioned, viz.

  332                       Royal Society.
      Explanation of the Construction of Tables           I. and II.
     To  render   the  preceding tables easy to be understood by
  persons not accustomed to calculations, I will state the pro
  cess of the operations in the first line of Table II.
     The height of the    tree at 12 years     of  age  is supposed    to
  be 18 feet to the top   of  its  leading shoot, aud 24 inches in
  circumference at the ground, consequently, at half the height,
  the circumference is 12 inches, — one-fourth of this, being
  three inches, is called the girt.       The girt being squared and
 multiplied into the height, gives one foot one inch and six
 parts for its contents.     At 13 years old the tree will be 191
 feet high, 26 inches in circumference at the ground, and
  13 inches at half the height ; one-fourth of 1 3 gives 3| inches
 for the girt. This squared and multiplied into the height,
 gives one foot five inches and one part for the contents.
 Deduct from this the contents of the tree at 1 2 years of age,
 and there remains three inches and seven parts, which is the
 increase in the 13th year.       Then reduce the contents of the
 tree when 12 years old, and the increase in the 13th year,
 each into parts, dividing the former          by the latter, and the
 quotient will   be 3*76 ; by this number divide 100,          and the
 quotient is 26'5, which is the rate per cent. of increase made
in the thirteenth year; consequently whatever the tree might
be worth when !2 years old, it will, at the end of the 13th
year, be improved in value after the rate of 26/. 10$.               per
cent., or in other words, that will be the interest it              will
have paid that year for the money the tree was worth                 the
preceding year.
    At every succeeding period, both in this Table and Table 1.0
the like process is gone through.

April      13. — Earl  of Morton in the chair.         A  paper by the
Rev.   Mr. Mc Gregor, on native arseniate of copper, was
read.    The existence of this substance in nature has lonir
been held problematical,      and its discovery in amine between
                                                                50 and

50 and 60 fathoms below the surface of the earth, in Corn
wall, is an additional stimulus to pursue our researches.
This mineral is of a pale yellow colour ; two specimens of it
were analysed by Mr. Mc Gregor, one         of which contained
69. — of arsenic acid, and 26.— copper;     the other 72. — acid,
and 28. — copper. Some muriate of iron and silica were also
found, but they are deemed not essential to the mineral.
     April 20. — The President in the chair. Dr. Chisholm
 laid before the Society some particulars respecting a race of
 pygmies, said to exist as a nation in the centre of the island
  of Madagascar.      A M.  Baudin,  who had visited that island
  and spent 50 days among     them,  and who was in the French
  West Indies, had one of these beings preserved ; it was a
  man about 33 years of age, measuring only 32 inches, but
  perfectly proportionate in all his parts. A child of a year
  old was also preserved in spirits, and measured one foof.
  These people are represented as being much fairer than the
  other natives, and of a bright copper colour ; they are also
  said to be very ingenious, to be expert with bows and ar
  rows, or javelins; and to be hospitable, humane, and gene
  rous.    One account states them to have long hair, and an
  other short and woolly.       They are also very numerous,
  M.   Baudin   having seen above  8000 in one town.    The wo
   men are said to have little breasts and almost no milk, so
   that the children are fed with that of cows. Dr. Chisholm,
   who personally inspected and measured these preserved bo
   dies, concludes, that a pygmy race should no longer be con
   sidered as fabulous, and that such has now been discovered in
   Madagascar.      Some other French voyagers have likewise
   mentioned the existence of these singular people.

     The Most Noble George Marquis of Townshend and Earl
  of Leicester was elected President; William Bray, Esq.,

 Thomas William Wrighte, A.M., Secretary ; and Nicholas
  Carlisle,  Esq., Secretary for    the year ensuing.
    The Society afterwards dined together        at  the  Crown and
  Anchor Tavern in the Strand, according         to annua]   custom*
          LX.    Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
  On the 25th of March as Mr. John Barnes,              a Gravesend
 pilot, was proceeding in his boat to the Nore,          he observed
 the sea unusually agitated a few miles below Gravesend, and
 approaching the spot, he perceived a whale struggling in the
 water:     he immediately fired a swivel three different times ;
 the second shot struck it in the tail, and the third wounded
 it mortally in the body, when, by a violent and sudden
plunge, it threw itself on the beach, and was left nearly
 dry at low water. Four hours elapsed from the time it was
wounded until it was perfectly dead, and it was towed next
tide to Gravesend,       where it was exhibited during four days.
It  was    then brought up the Thames above London Bridge
in  a large barge, into which it had been previously put by
the barge being scuttled and sunk, and afterwards floated to
the surface, the whale having been first towed over it at high
water, so that on the ebb of the tide it was left in the barge.
                                                                The

                       Intelligence. — Lectures.                835
The scuttles     were then plugged up, and the barge floated on
the return     of the tide.
      This  is the only animal    of the kind   seen in the Thames
since the year 1780, when a whale 90 feet             in length was
 killed near the same place.
      Many seamen who have been in Greenland, after examin
 ing the whale in question, pronounced it to be a young one
 not exceeding a year old ; yet its dimensions were as follow :
      Extreme length from the lower jaw to the end of the tail
  76 feet six inches ; from the lower       jaw to the    end of the
  body at the tail 69 feet ; lower      jaw longer than the upper
 jaw 1 foot 4 inches ; end of upper jaw to its eye 14 feet;
  from the upper jaw to its dorsal tin 48 feet 2 inches ; length
  of dorsal fin at the base 4 feet; height of the dorsal fin 2 feet;
  from the body to the end of the tail 7 feet 6 inches; extre
  mity of the tail 15 feet ; circumference of the body at the
  dorsal fin 2 1 feet i eye placed from the spiracle 5 feet ; length
  of the mouth from the jaw 16 feet 6 inches ; length of pec
  toral fin 6 feet, breadth of ditto 2 feet; longitudinal       lines
   (almost straight) beginning under the mouth to the middle of
   the fish ; length of its eye 5 inches; colour of its laminae
   whitish towards the back behind ; distance of the eye to the
   mouth 5 inches ; 6| feet to the pectoral fin from back bone;
   outer skin peeled off, thickness of fine writing-paper; from
   one eye to the other 9 feet 9 inches ; breadth of the lines on
   the belly 3 inches ; orifice of its ear 3 inches ; from its eye
    to its ear 3 feet 2  inches.   It is pronounced by naturalists to
   be the Bulena boops, or pike-headed species.
       After being exhibited for about eight days to the inhabi
    tants of London, it was put up to public sale and produced
    seventy-five pounds.

    LXI.    Report on the ponderous Flint Glass intended for the
      Manufacture of Achromatic Glasses. Presented to the In
      stitute by M. Doufourgerais, Optician to His Majesty
      the Emperor and King. — Laid
                                           before the Cbass of Mathe*
      matical and Physical Sciences, by Messrs. De Pront,
      Guyton, and Rochon,            on Tuesday   April  10,  1809.
   Wh know that         the invention    of achromatic  glasses is one
   of the grandest discoveries    of the last century.    We    are in
   debted for  it to a celebrated   geometrician, who has enriched
   the mathematical sciences with the most astonishing con
   ceptions.    In 1747 Euler entertained the sublime idea of
  correcting, by the employment of several diaphanous sub
  stances, the aberration resulting from the decomposition of
  light in spherical glasses.      This was the more valuable, be*
  cause philosophers had been led to believe, according to the
  experiments of Newton, that there was no refraction when
  there was no dispersion,   — thus    banishing all hope of destroy
  ing the colours in glasses.
     Euler informs us, in theMemoirs of the Academy of Peters-
  burgh, that some experiments made upon meniscus glasses,
  the concavities of which he filled with various liquors, proved
 that the different refrangibility of the rays of light could be
 diminished, and even reduced to nothing, (these are the ex
 pressions of this great man, whose modesty was equal to
 his talents,) by employing two or more transparent sub
 stances.     He adds, what is very remarkable, that the won
 derful structure of the eyes, which represent the images of
 objects from their posterior extremity) suggested to hini
 that it would be possible to diminish, and even to annihilate,
 all the defects to which the different refraction of the rays
of light at that time seemed to be necessarily subjected.
" Here again," says Euler, " we recognise the power of the
Deity,     as well as his infinite wisdom."        He informs    us at
the same time, that his opinion was attacked by John Dol-
lond, an eminent optician of London : but upon some ob
servations of     M. Klingenstierne,    he ascertained, after a  mul-
    Vol. 33. No.     133.  May   1809.            Y          tiplicity

338       Report on the ponderous   Flint Glass intended
tiplicity of experiments, that the      great  inequality of the
dispersive powers which takes place       in two kinds of glass,
vulgarly known by the names of           flint and crown glass,
was   sufficient for realizing the idea of Euler, and thereby
good achromatic glasses were obtained.         Dollond's success
procured him a patent in 1 759, wich was called in question,
 however, by Valtines in Westminster Hall. Valtines proved
that the ingenious Chester Morehall had constructed glasses
long before Dollond, perfectly achromatic, and of an im
mense amplifying      power.    So early as the year 1 754, M.
Ayscough, an optician of Lancaster, possessed one of these
instruments, as did also Dr. Smith. These facts, although
but little known, deserve to be published, and were authen
ticated by lord Mansfield, who maintained Dollond in his
privileges,    merely because the benefit of a patent does not
belong to him who has the first scientific idea    of an inven
tion, but to him who enables the public to enjoy the ad
vantages of the discovery.
   So far Mr. Dollond deserved a recompense; and the cele
brated achromatic instrument with a triple object glass which
he presented    to the Royal Society excited a great    sensation
in the scientific world.
   The Academy of Sciences, on being informed that instru
ments were made at London upon the principles of Euler,
and which magnified one hundred times the diameter          of the
objects with the degree   of clearness and distinctness requisite
in delicate observations, proved by ingenious inquiries, that
it attached the highest possible value to the new discovery
in question. Two eminent geometricians, Messrs. Clairaut
and D'Alembert, have left nothing to desire upon the in
tricate theory of the construction of these instruments.
They fixed the spherical curvatures of glasses of unequal
dispersive forces, which reduce to the minimum the aberra
tions of refrangibility and sphericity.                   *
   M.    Clairaut afterwards ascertained    by experiments, that
the lapidaries of Paris, who endeavoured to imitate the dia
mond in their glassy compositions, made use of a kind of
glass   vulgarly known by the name of slrass ; the dispersive
power of which is greater than that of flint glass.      But this
                                                            glass,

               for     the   Manufacture of Achromatic' Glasses.                   339
    glass, to which an artist of the name of Strass had given, by
.   means   of the oxide of lead, a gravity equal to that of the
    diamond, is generally so soft (gelalineux) , that it is very diffi
    cult to succeed in employing it usefully in the manufacture of
    achromatic object glasses, which require glasses not only
    perfectly homogeneous, but also blown glasses, according
    to the remarks of the most eminent opticians, who have
    discovered,         practice of their art, the advantages of
                        in     the
    these blown glasses over those which were run into crucibles.
       M. Loysel, in his Essay upon Glass Making, gives us
     the composition of a glass imitating the dispersion of the
     diamond : it    he informs us, with 100 parts of white sand,
                         is,
     washed  in muriatic acid, combined and fused with 150 parts
     of red oxide of lead, to which must be added 30 parts of
     aerated and calcined potash, and ten parts of calcined borax,
     that the lapidaries produce,                    in   small furnaces, thecrystal
     which imitates the diamond,                          and which has the same
     weight; its specific gravity being                    as to   water 35 to 10. They
     sometimes add one part of oxide of arsenic but this com           ;
     position, which they allow to cool in crucibles, produces
     but very small masses, which can only be used in making
     trinkets.
          If, in   the origin        of   the invention          of achromatic glasses,
     M.    Clairaut made use              of this     glass    in the construction of
     some achromatic object glasses,     was because he was de
                                                          it
     sirous to make an useful application of his formulae upon
     glasses     the          power of which was much greater
                         dispersive
     than that of flint glass but M. de l'Etang, whom he charged
                                      :
     with this work, remarked to him that blown glass, such as
     flint and crown glass, was requisite for good object glasses.
     On this account the Academy of Sciences, at the suggesiion
     of the government, who were unwilling that France should
     be tributary        to England           in             of glass, proposed in
                                                   the article
     1766,     as the    subject of       a   prize dissertation,  the best process
     for imitating in France              a   ponderous glass exempt from all
     defects, and having all the properties of flint glass.
       This prize was granted in 1773 to M. Lebaude, the ma-
    onager of    glass-work, and his Memoir was printed among
                   a
     the Memoires            des Savans Etrangeres for 1774.
                                               Y     2                     M. Lebaude,

340       Report on the ponderous      Flint Glass intended
   M.   Lebaude, on this occasion,       merely produed specimens
of ponderous glass, and which could not satisfy the wants
of opticians: the Academy was therefore obliged, in 1786,
to renew the same subject as a prize dissertation, and the
sum offered was 12000 livres.         In announcing the subject
proposed, a process was required, by means of which the
quantity   of ponderous     glass   necessary   to supply the wants
of commerce might be constantly supplied, and without the
defects of flint glass.
    Since the above period, essays have certainly been pre*
tented, but they were either too imperfect or too meagre for
attaining the essential object which government had in view ;
namely,    that of furnishing France with all the ponderous
glass   requisite for optical instruments, without having re
course to foreigners.      This enterprise was not unattended
with difficulties in its execution, because the heads of
great glass-works,   who alone could enter into        these delicate
and difficult inquiries with any chance of success, could not
flatter themselves that the sale to opticians, of ponderous glass
blown without any defects, was likely to reimburse them for
the enormous      expense this degree of perfection requires.
This   consideration  is sufficient to show, that we cannot as
 similate simple essays with works which should serve to
vivify and extend       an  important      branch   of industry and
 commerce.
    M.   Doufourgerais,   manufacturer of glass to the emperor,
already known by the celebrity of his manufactory of cry
 stal glass at Mont Cenis, has certainly excited a lively in
 terest among us, on account       of the  decided preference  which
the produce of his industry has generally obtained over the
glass of England and
                         Bohemia, although he had to surmount
many powerful obstacles. The Institute could not view
without extreme satisfaction       the works on agreat scale   which
this ingenious and zealous manufacturer has recently exe
cuted. One specimen consists of 600 kilogrammes of a glass
weightier than flint glass. It is 9000 millimetres thick, and
270 centimetres high.       He has already sold upwards of 300
kilogrammes of it to opticians, and the remainder will soon
be bought up also,      without   the   price being adequate to the
                                                              capital

             for     the Manufacture             of Achromatic            Glasses.        941
    capital generously sacrificed for the attainment                           of an object,
    the importance and utility of which he knew      how to ap-
,   predate.
       We shall now give an account to the Institute of the na
    ture and quality of the ponderous glass which has been sub
    mitted to our examination.
      We ought          to premise, that the most eminent opticians are
    fully          of the qualities of the glass in question, and
            satisfied
    that a great number of achromatic telescopes have been made
    with it. We now call the attention of the Institute to a
    letter to     M.     Doufourgerais               from   M.  Freminville, chief
                                                                     de
    engineer      of   roads and bridges, who is specially charged             with
    furnishing the        telegraphs           and    the navy with the glasses re
    quired for the observation of signals.
       " Pieces of glass from your magazine, taken at random,
    and subjected to the necessary operations for employing them
    as optical glasses,     produced object glasset comparable to the
    best    of   Dollond's of the same dimensions. You have there
    fore attained, and           I    am   proud to bear witness to                     it,   the
    highest degree of perfection ever possessed      English glass,       by
    whether    consider

    view, since in your article beauty and utility are united to
    cheapness."
       This impartial testimony from      person well acquainted

    corroborate from our own experience.        The glass made                                  by

 flintglass,   as 36 to three.   The mean refraction is also stronger,
 being 164, while that of flint glass is 160.
     We caused a piece of the new glass to be cut into lenses of
  160 millimetres focus; and we can assure the Institute, that
 this rigorous examination convinced us that France may now
 dispense entirely with flint glass in the construction of good
 achromatic glasses,        so necessary   in   the  naval and military
 service.     The above glasses,      which     we have examined and
 compared with English glasses,           prove   that the eulogies we
 bestow on them are well founded            : we do not mean to say,
 however, that, when taken indiscriminately, the glass made
by M. Doufourgerais can be used for the large object-glasses
used by astronomers in delicate observations : in this case,
as   in flint glass, it would    be necessary to pick out a piece, in
order to    avoid  the  air-drawn threads and streaks from which
blown glass is rarely free; and we ought not to require, in a
large mass of glass, a perfection which is perhaps chimerical,
for instruments of no importance in a commercial point of
view, however valuable in scientific pursuits. We must ob
serve, nevertheless, that the glass made by M. Doufourgerais,
although very ponderous, has generally fewer threads than
flintglass,    and its clearness equals,   if it does not surpass,  that
of English glass.
    The largest    glass made     with the article manufactured by
M. Doufourgerais, and which we examined, was only eight
decimetres in length. Its object glass had an aperture of 60
millimetres,      and it magnified the diameter of objects 30
times.      With astronomical eye-glasses we can make it ex
hibit a much greater magnifying power : but this increase
is not of any use in the examination of terrestrial objects.
We doubt if it        has all   the aperture which it can support,
because opticians        must    change the ordinary proportions,
when they use a glass which has a stronger dispersion than
strass.

which to me seems to unite every advantage that can be ex
pected for that mode of communication, I beg leave to trans
mit   to you a plan        of    it,     and to write       a   few explanatory lines
upon the subject.
     The telegraph, of modern invention,                         is   an improvement
on communication            by signals, which                   has   been    in use for
many ages.            Monsieur Chappe was,                  I   believe, the first who
proposed   machine for that purpose, which was put
             a                                           ex                         in
ecution about the year 1793.   Since that time several modes
have been proposed       different persons, none of which
                                    by
seem to have fully attained                   the object.         A   machine      of this
kind should be simple, and easy to comprehend. All those
which have come to my knowledge are executed       com                             by
binations,       which render them too complicated for common

use, and therefore liable to many errors. That which I now
submit to your consideration, seems to me to have removed
every objection     of the kind  ;  it is simple,  easy   to compre
hend, and extensive in its means         ; its combinations, which
by simple numeration may be carried to 40,000, might with
ease be extended to almost infinite numbers; but the present
seems sufficient to answer ivery purpose.            All the words in
Entick's Dictionary amount to about 25,000 ; every one of
which may thus be numbered. With how much more di
spatch would a letter be communicated by signals which
express words, than by signals which express only letters !
Words may be forwarded as fast as they can be looked for
in a dictionary ; and even whilst only an equal number of
letters could have been communicated by the present mode.
Another advantage resulting from the use of words in tele
graphic   correspondence is, that the words of the same
meaning in the several languages having the same number,
correspondence may be carried on from one language into
another, which though not grammatically correct, yet
would be sufficiently intelligible.
    Proper names must be spelt, which may easily be done,
every letter having a corresponding number.
    Though the use of telegraphs has to this time been con
fined to military purposes, yet a machine of this kind is
well adapted to accelerate commercial communication from
one end of the kingdom to the other. The arrival, the de
parture of vessels, the various transactions of commerce,
might   be speedily announced,        to the very    great  advantage
of trade.     By this method inaccessible         places might com
 municate their wants, and correspondents, thougb at a di
 stance of five or six miles, might erect them for a trifling
 expense. I made the experiment with one of eight feet by
 ten, and, with the use of a telescope, I took down every
number from a distance       of a mile and     a half.

or concentric bars, A. £. C. D. which intersect the radii, are
for the decimals       ; thus  A   stands  for units, B for tens, C for
hundreds,      D for thousands.         Over each of these concentric
bars or circles, an index, as that marked               H,  fig. 2, tra

of tens, and of units, as far as ten thousand ; for instance,
if it is required to make the number 9202, turn the hand H
in the circle D of thousands to the radius 9, then the hand
H    in the circle    C of hundreds      to the radius 2, then, as there
are no tens, turn the hand to the radius 2, upon the circle
A of units 5 but as ten thousands are not sufficient to ex
press the number          of words in the English language, two
square    boards     are  added  in the corners, of which that mark
ed E is equal to 10,000, that marked F to 20,000, and both
being shown together, are equal to 30,000, which, with
 the numbers made on the circles, bring it up to 40,000,
 which number is more by many thousands than all the words
 in the English language.

          SIR,
  Herewith             you will receive the model of a plan for fitting
  ships' jury masts, to be formed from the spare spars usually
  carried on board king's ships, and in every merchantman
  that is properly found.                By having jury masts so fitted,
 ships will be enabled to carry as much sail as on the usual
 regular mast ; the great use of which I need not dwell on,
 only observing that it may be of great importance to fleets
 after a general action, or when in want of proper lower
 masts, either at home or abroad, and enable ships, after the
 loss of their mast, to prosecute their voyage, or service,
 without any deficiency of sail.
      I  beg you     will    be pleased to lay it before the Society,            and
 I   have the honour to be,
                                Sir, your obedient humble servant,

  In    the model in the Society's possession                    the main mast is
broken about one-third of its length above the deck, proper
partners are secured on the deck, in which a hand mast and
spare main top mast are fixed               on each         bide   of   the    broken
main mast, and secured thereto by two spare caps, morticed
on a-square made in its centre. A strengthening cap, move
able   on these       additional       masts, connects them,                  and    the
upper parts    of   these masts are secured firmly by trustle trees
in the main top.         The foot*of a spare fore top mast passes
through             from strong plank, morticed into the
            a cap made
heads of the two temporary masts above mentioned, goes
through the main top, and rests in the moveable strength
ening cap, which connects those two masts, and enables
the fore top mast to be raised to any height which the main
top will admit, and be then firmly secured by the upper cap,
the main top, and the strengthening cap below it. The
fore top mast being thus adjusted, the cross trees and top
gallant mast are mounted upon        which completes the
                                                     iti
whole business.
     Two          the only things necessary to be made ex
           caps are
pressly for the purpose, the other articles being usually ready
on board the ship.

         SIR,
   J. he    great expense     of timber in the navy for anchor stocks,
 and the frequency of their failing or giving way in the cen
  tre, where the square of the anchor is let into the stock,
 have induced me to offer to the Society of Arts, &c, a plan
 of an anchor which may be cheaper in construction, and
 more likely to hold in various situations than those in com
 mon use.
     The model I have sent will sufficiently explain my inten
 tion, and show how beneficial it may be in strengthening
 the anchor stocks.         I  wish much to notice to you its proba
 bility of holding in the ground longer than other anchors,
 on account of the additional weight of the stock ; and this
 will more particularly be the case in banks which shelve
suddenly down from the shore, such as at St. Helena, Caw-
 sand Bay, and indeed in most of the islands in the West
 Indies.       The proportion of additional iron,             as explained by
my model, is in all anchors to be twice and a half the dia
meter of the shank from each side at the stock, and of

which are only intended to prevent the stock from slipping
in  and out, whenever it becomes loose ; which accident
anchors are very liable to in hot climates. My anchor stocks

    likewise beg leave to offer to the Society a model of a
double fish hook,  for the purpose of fishing the anchor, an
operation which, in the common mode of doing             fre                          it,   is
quently attended with accidents both to the ship and crew,
from the anchor suddenly slipping unexpectedly in raising
it to its proper position.
 I       flatter myself that these                   improvements will meet with
the Society's approbation.
              I   am, sir, your most obedient humble servant,

sometimes slips, and occasions mischief to remedy which,            ;

keep firmer hold. These hooks are shown upon an enlarged

     Reference   to the   Engraving of Captain        H. L. Ball's Im
        provement    in the Formation       of Anchors.      See Plate X.
        Figs. 6, 7, and 8.
        This anchor, in external        appearance,    differs very little
    from    the common       anchor ; the improvement consists in
    forming and fixing of the shank of the anchor to the stock.
    The stock a a, figs. 6 and 7, is made of two pieces of oak
,   bolted together, and well secured by hoops. In the common
   method, in order to prevent the anchor stock from slipping
   off the shank, a square projection 1 b, fig. 8, is forged upon
   the shank ; this is improved by captain Ball, as shown in
   fig. 6, where this projection dd is extended on each side of
   the shank,     far enough to receive two bolts through each of
   these extensions,      which bolts hold firmly together the two
   pieces   of timber which form       the stock, and secure the stock
  fast to the shank.         Two iron hoops, fig.     .7, ee,   are driven
   on the stock between the bolts, and           ffff    are other hoops,
   and   gggg     are tree-nails to strengthen the whole.
  LXV.       Method    of ascertaining   the Value   of Growing Timber
       Trees, at different and distant Periods of Time. By
       Mr. Charles Waistell, of High Holborn.
                            [Concluded from p. 332.]
                    Observations on Tables      I. and  II.
  The       preceding tables furnish us with the following useful
  information, viz.
       1st. That all regular growing        trees, measured    as above,
  as often as    their age is increased one-fourth, contain very
  nearly    double  their quantity of timber.
      2d. That when a tree has doubled its age, its contents
 will    be  eight-fold.
      3d. That when       a  tree has   doubled its age, the annual
 growth will      be increased   four-fold.
                                                                     4th.

                     of Growing Timber Trees.                      35  1
    4th. Consequently, that when a tree has doubled its age,
the proportion that its annual increase bears to the contents
of the whole    tree is then diminished     one-half.
    This last observation explains how it conies         to pass that
a tree,  when its age is doubled, the rate per cent. per annum
that its increase then bears to the content of the whole tree,
is diminished    one-half.      -
    It may not    be unuseful to observe, that the rate per cent.
of increase in    the last columns,    is the same   as   the  rate per
cent. that the increase     of the tree that year   will   pay for  the
money it was worth the preceding year.
    In the two preceding tables, we find that the rate of in
crease per cent. per annum is the same in both at the same
ages,   although the quantity of timber in the second table is
six times as much as in the first table in trees of all ages :
therefore, when the age of a tree is known, the rate per
cent. per annum of its increase is known on inspecting these
tables, whether the tree has grown fast or slow ; provided
the growth of the tree has been regular, and that it has con
tinued its usual growth.
    And having     the age,  girt,  and height,   of  any tree given,
we can readily calculate what quantity of timber it will con
tain at any future period whilst it continues its us.ua) rate of
growth.

    In the 24th Volume of the Transactions of the Society of

                                      " the distance of trees from
each other should be one-fifth of their height."                At that
distance, which is probably sufficient for fir trees, the fol
lowing will be the number on an acre, and the number to
be cut out at the ages and heights under mentioned, and the
number      of feet   they will then contain in the bole, when
measured to the top of the leading shoot. These trees are
supposed to increase      twelve inches in height, and one in

    It will   be observed        in all these tables, that when trees have
doubled their age, there are only one-fourth of the number
remaining on an acre, in consequence of their distance being
doubled ; but as each tree will then have increased its con
tents    eight-fold, therefore            the  number of feet on an acre
must be then doubled.                 Above, at 64 years of age, there is
exactly double the number of feet that there is at 32 years
 of age.
    And     if  trees be periodically thinned out to the distance               of
 one-fifth     of their height,          and   that they increase eighteen
 inches in height, and two inches in circumference, annually,
 the number of trees on an acre, and the number to be cut
 out at different periods, and the number of feet they will
 then respectively contain, will be as under, viz.                          ?

nearly equal distances.              The distances stated in all these
tables must be considered the average distances.                         If, for in

will be 12 feet, although few of them may stand at exactly
that distance.

odically     thinned     out to the distance of one-fourth of their
height until they are 28 feet high, and to one-third of their

where the trees were from 30 to 40 ftet high and upwards.
 I have therefore calculated a table according to the distance
 of one-fourth of their height, till they are 28 feet high, and
 according to the distance of one-third of their height after
wards.
                                                                               ,   The

                          of Growing Timber        Tr$es.               357
      The timber to       be thinned out before the age       of 28 years,
   will be the same      as  in Table   VI.,   but at 28 years of age there
  are 583 feet more to be cut out according to this Table than at
  the same age        in Table   VI.;    there  will, however,   be less to
  be cut out between        the ages    of 29 and 60 years    of age.   But
  if  the trues in this Table,        in consequence of having more
  Toom, were to increase           1 £ inch in circumference annually,
  instead of one inch after they are 28 years of age, the pro
  duce of an acre at 60 years of age would equal the produce
  stated in Table VI. at the same age; taking into considera
  tion that the value of the 583 feet excess cut out at 28 years
  of age would then be more than quadrupled, if the money
  were placed out at five per cent. compound interest.                   A
  considerable additional increase in circumference may cer-
s tainly be expected, in consequence of the trees having al
  most double the room in which to extend their branches,
  and for the admission of those powerful agents,                 sunshine
  and air.
   Observations     on the Tables respecting tlie      Thinning qfJVoods,
                              and their Produce.
      Mr. Salmon       is the only person      I know of, who has given
  a general     rule for thinning       plantations.     But as I conceive
  liis distance of one-filth of their height would leave oaks too
  close, especially after they had acquired a sufficient length
  of  stem,    I have calculated both on his plan, which is pro
  per   for fir  trees, and also at greater distances.
      The preceding Tables VI. VII. and VIII. are calculated
  on   a supposition that the trees are never suffered to stand
  nearer, on an average, than one-fourth of tht ir height ; and
  although the quantities of timber thinned out and left stand
  ing on the ground at that distance, at the end of CO years,
  be only two-thirds of the quantity according to Mr. Sal
  mon's distance, yet I suppose it will be generally thought
  an ample produce and sufficiently encouraging.
      According to Table VI. which is calculated for oaks, the
  first thinning is at sixteen years old, and the second at
  twenty, but it is the advice of an eminent planter, (Mr.
                                       Z 3                        Pontey,)

358              Method     of ascertaining  the Value
Pontey,) to begin thinning at about thirteen years old, ac
cording to the state of the trees, and to cut out about 150
poles per acre annually, for the next seven years. Without
putting any value upon the thinnings before 20 years old,
we find that at the 20th and 24th years the thinnings mea
sure 945 feet, the value of which, at a low estimate, will
be sufficient to repay the rent and taxes       of ground of   a mo
derate quality, the expense of plants, planting, and after-
management, calculated at five per cent. compound interest.
   When 28 years old, and at the end of every fourth year
following, up     to  1 20,  the trees to be cut out  of an acre will
measure     from 495 to 550 feet ; but say 500, at 4s. a foot,
on an average, including the value of the bark ; this gives
1001. which sum divided by 4, leaves 25/. for the produce
per acre per annum. This deserves the consideration of those
who are inclined to convert young woods into coppices,
without leaving a reasonable number of standards.
   It may however be said, that as the trees cut out in thin
ning plantations are the bad thrivers and underlings, their
contents will be less than the average; but, if we take their
value at one-half the above estimate, that is, after the rate
of  12Z.  10*. per acre     per annum at 28 years of age and up
wards,    even  this   produce must be thought ample, together
with the value of the trees left standing.
   Table VI. was constructed chiefly with a view to oaks,
their annual increase in circumference varying from | of an
inch to I f inch, the medium of which is one inch.
   Tables    VII.  and   VIII.   were calculated for   ash,^lm, sy
camore, firs, poplars, and         other woods of swift growth,
their increase in circumference           being generally from 1|
to   2 inches annually.         If  ash trees be found to increase
after the rates of Table       VII.  or VIII.  they must be exceed
ingly profitable, at the high prices now given for that timber.
Many other observations might be made on Tables VII. and
VIII., but these will readily occur to persons interested in
quick-growing       trees.
   An    acre of  trees    increasing after the rate of Table VI.
 produces in 64 years little more than half the numberoffeet
                                                                 that

                     of Growing Timber Tress.                     359
that another acre produces which increases after the rate of
Table VII., and little more than one-third of another, in
creasing after the rate of Table VIII. in the same time.
     In planting with   a view to profit, the first object is a long,
straight, and clear stem.      This is most certainly and speedily
obtained by thick planting at first, and not thinning too
soon.      A kind of competition among the trees is thereby
occasioned, each struggling, as it were, to outgrow its neigh
bour, in search of light, heat, air, and moisture.
     This competition must, however, be judiciously mode
rated    by timely thinning; always keeping the trees suffi
 ciently strong in the stem. If they be suffered to stand some
 years too near each other, their steins will become weak, and
 bend under their small lops when thinned.           Where this has
 taken place in only a small degree,      they   will make but little
 progress    for some years afterwards.
      By the time the trees have advanced to 24 or 30 feet high
 this competition should cease, if they are intended to be cut
 down at or before 60 years of age, and they should then be
 encouraged to extend their tops more in width than in
  height, strong side branches being apparently quite as con
  ducive   as the  leading shoot, to the vigorous growth of the
  bole below them. After this period, the best rule for thinning
  will probably be, to    leave a clear space    around the top of
  each tree, in which       the branches may extend 'themselves
  without obstruction.        A tree whose top is 20 feet diameter,
  receives    four times the benefit from air, rain, and dew, as
  another does whose top is only ten feet diameter.
      The trees in the interior of young woods are smaller in
  their boles than the exterior trees. And in a fine oak wood,
  of about 40 acres, divided into squares by several avenues
  or ridings crossing each other at right angles, I observed the
   rows of trees next the avenues much thicker in their boles
   than the trees in the interior of the squares ; owing, no
   doubt, to their having more and larger branches in conse
   quence of their having more room, although it is only on
   one side.
       Being too parsimonious of ground seems to me a great
    and very general error.      If the same number of trees of 32
                                     Z  4                           feet

feet high and upwards,        in Table  VI.  were allowed the space
of two    acres   instead   of one, and, in consequence of         their
standing thinner, were to increase         annually only the fiftieth
part of an inch more in girt than they would do if they stood
on one acre, this small additional increase in girt would pay
an ample rent for the additional acre.
    In the year 1791 a paper of Observations on the Propa
gation and Management of Oak Trees in general, but more
particularly applying to his majesty's New Forest in Hamp
shire, was published by T. Nichols,           Purveyor     of the Navy
for Portsmouth Dock-yard.
   In this  paper     it is said, that   " there  are to be seen      in
many parts     of   the forest from 40 to 50 fine oaks         standing
on an acre-,    that will measure one with another two loads a
tree."
   "   Several woods in the forest are almost ruined for want
of thinning, and its being done at proper times          ;  particularly
the inclosures that were made in the year 1 700         : — these   were
originally well planted, and great numbers of trees brought
up in them, which now remain so close together that, they
are   nearly   stagnated, particularly in Salisbury,            Trench,
Brimley Coppice, and Woodfidley ; and although it is 9o
years since they were planted, the trees will not measure,
one with      another, above six or seven feet a tree ; whereas,
if  the  business of thinning had been done as it ought, the
remaining trees (after drawing much useful timber) would
by this time have been       of a  size nearly fit for naval   uses, as
in   some   of  the    woods that were planted at the same time,
the trees which have had room to expand, and a free air ad
mitted to them, will measure from 70 to 80 feet."
             Observations on the Growth        of Timber.
   The rings observable in        the transverse  section of a tree at
its butt-end,    are the same in number as the years         of its age;
an additional ring being produced annually,           in consequence
of the annual rising of      the sap.    The   rings are nearly con
centric in trees that have grown in the interior of close shady
woods, but eccentric in others, being of different breadths
on the northern and southern sides of such as have growr
                                                                 single.

lingle, or in          any other situation where their boles have been
much exposed to the rays of the sun. This difference is oc
casioned by the different degrees of heat to which the oppo
site sides of the boles of trees are exposed.   And, indeed,
we find these rings are always broadest on that side of the
bole or stem            most warmed by the sun.                  Hence we      see the
Utility of exposing their boles as much as possible                              to its
rays*. It is often seen in the stumps of trees that                                 have
stood single, that they have grown nearly twice as fast on
the southern side as on the northern, their pith being so
much nearer to the northern side.
     It  however, to be remarked, ihat the wood from that
            is,

          tree which has grown the slowest,
                  a                           heavier than         is
from the opposite side which has grown the fastest, and                               it
is probably stronger in the same degree.

order that their boles may receive the greatest possible benefit
from the direct rays of the sun.
     No doubt many gentlemen              are     in   possession       of   facts that
would          in some degree ascertain           how much faster the boles
of   trees swell that stand exposed              to receive the full benefit of
the warmth of the sun, than those that are either partially or
constantly in the shade. To make these facts known would
materially benefit planters; for   am fully persuaded that
                                             I
there are but few persons apprised of the magnitude of the
power of the sun's rays upon the boles of trees in causing

This business should commence early, never suffering the
branches on the intended stem or bole to grow to a largp
size, in order that, when cut off, the wounds may be small
and soon healed. Those who want directions for performing
the operation, may think it well to consult Mr. Pontey's
Forest Pruner. There are, however, divers opinions as to the
most profitable height to which trees ought to be pruned,
and the instruments most proper for pruning ; some persons
objecting to the use of the saw, unless afterwards smoothed
by the knife ; and not a few objecting to pruning in any
way; the consequence of which                      is,
                                     that we often find trees
that stand single, particularly oaks, with boles not more than
six or eight feet high, but with wide spreading bushy tops,
fit only for the fire. The shade and drip of one such tree                         is
sometimes found to do more injury than four well- trained
trees, and perhaps    not of half the value of one of them.

On    the contrary,       trees in close plantations are often suffered
to   stand        so   much     too      thick   as to destroy each others
branches, excepting only                 a   few small ones near their tops        ;
and not unfrequently we see tall elms trimmed up to within                         a
few feet of their summits —       certain that such trees must

    This uble shows        that the advantage            to be gained by prun
 ing trees higher than 32 feet,            is    not     an   object worthy of
 consideration, if the trees are to be cut down at the age of
 60 years.
    And if it should      be found that the higher a tree is pruned
the slower it swells in the bole, perhaps a 24 feet bole may
 measure     as much at     CO years old as           a   32    feet bole.       If   it
increases     half  an inch in girt in the last 36 years more                    than
 the  32    feet bole increases         in the same            time, it will very
 nearly equal it in measure.
    A 32 feet bole with a top from 20 to 30 feet high, with
 many lar^e lateral branches, is certainly a much finer object
 than a forty teet bole with a top only twenty feet high, with
few and small later il branches : and at sixty years old, the
former will have had to increase                  in the last        twenty-eight
years, only one quarter of an inch in girt, more than the
                                                                               latter,

 366                 Method of ascertaining               the Value
latter, to exceed it in measure, to say nothing of the excess
of timber in the larger lop and branches. It must, however,
be remarked, that at eighty years of age, the forty feet bole
will exceed the thirty- two feet bole nearly six feet; and at
one hundred years, thirteen feet, provided it swell equally
fast in thickness.   But unless the trees be oak, fit for the
use    of                                 price can be had, T
            the navy, for which an increased
imagine few gentlemen would now choose to let their trees
stand to eighty years of age, when the increase of their boles
will not            four
                per cent. ; still fewer would let them stand
               be
to one hundred, when the increase will not be three percent.
per annum.
     Again, let it         be supposed       that trees sixty years of age
have increased           annually,      during their growth, fifteen inches
in height, and one inch           half in circumference, the
                                       and       a

     Taking it for granted that                the shorter boles       will   increase
faster in thickness than the longer ones, it is reasonable to
expect that the forty feet bole will contain more timber than
the fifty feet bole when they arc both sixty years old ; and
if they are both sold at the same rate per foot, the forty feet
bole must consequently be more valuable.         If, however,
a higher price can be had for longer boles, this may com
pensate not only for their deficiency in measure at sixty
years of age, but also for their standing beyond the period
when they cease paying the common rate of interest for the
money they are worth, which I suppose is frequently the
case as to tall elm trees,   for keel pieces, and perhaps
                                           fit
beech for ship planking.                  It     is   hence   evident, that where
the soil     is   such   as   will   enable trees to grow to       agreat height,
it   will   be necessary,        before    we decide          how high to prune
them, to consider to what purposes                       the timber can be most
advantageously appropriated.

     Whatever the lengths of the boles             of  trees   increasing     as

year after their girt     in the middle is 15 inches, but not longer.
     Again,   let it be supposed         that trees sixty years of age

     Here again we may suppose that the forty-eight feet bole,
 by swelling faster than the sixty feet bole, may exceed it in
  measure at sixty years of age, and this it would do, were
  the girt increased only half an inch.              And if the thirty-six
  feet bole was increased         two    inches   in girt, it would exceed
  both the forty-eight and sixty feet boles. But trees of such
  swift growth are frequently cut down before they are^sitfty
  years old.     At forty years of age the thirty-six feet bole, if
  it swell no faster than the forty-eight feet bole, will contain
  more timber      if  measured     according to the present        erroneous
  method.       (The    greater    disproportion      there is between the
   two   ends   of   a  piece   of timber,      and the more disadvanta
   geous^ it measures, when the girt is taken in the middle.)
   I suppose that in timber of this swift growth, the longer
   boles are frequently not worth more per foot than the shorter
   boles; therefore, in this case, that length of bole should be
   fixed on which is likely to measure most at the period when
   the trees are intended to be felled.
      Whatever      the lengths     of the    boles   of  trees increasing as
   above may be, their increase is five percent. per annum, one
   year after their girt in the middle is 20 inches, but not longer.
      It  appears    from    the   last observations and calculations,
    that the annual increase in the boles of trees by their growth,
    ceases to be equal to five per cent. per annum some time
                                                                      between

    boles are shorter or longer.
          But it being generally allowed that                        oak trees,          of    a    size
    n't   for the navy, require to grow from eighty to one hundred
and fifty years,        according to the quality of the soil, and                                       it
is        so stated in the eleventh report                of    the commissioners ap
pointed to inquire into the state and condition                                   of   the woods,
forests, and land revenues of the crown                                 ;  I     have therefore
been  calculating tables, showing what the proportionably
advanced prices should be, at different periods, up to one
hundred and fifty years, to pay the proprietors for letting
their trees stand to those periods.                        These prices, especially
at the later periods, very greatly exceed any that                                      have       ever
been given.              It
                  certainly has been much the interest of the
growers of                         at about sixty years of age,
                       -oak timber to fell     it
even    they replant the same ground. To let
            if                                     stand to one              it
hundred   and twenty years   of age,  and sell   at  the present            it
prices, their loss would exceed double the whole value of
the timber at sixty years                of   age.        Nothing short of                    a    suf
ficient price will long command  sufficient supply. Owing
                                                    a
to too low prices, the quantity of  large timber on private
estates          has long been rapidly decreasing                   ;   and       it   will   be too
late to commence offering reasonable                           prices       for   it   when        it   is
all gone, and no oaks left of greater growth than sixty years.
To have to wait their growing the second sixty years, may
bring upon us evils exceeding all calculation.

the fences made and kept in good repair.
Five shillings a year, forborne 29 years, and improved at five
   per cent, compound interest, would amount to 15/. lis. od.
But   the value    of  the timber is more than twenty times this
amount.
   The   trees were about two feet      high,  and  planted at two
yards distance, in holes dug with           the spade, 1210 on an
acre. Labour of making the holes and planting the trees
cost ll. 6s. \0^d. per acre.
   About 2700        were planted on an acre in the other planta
tions,   wheje the ground was wholly broken up.
   In  the remarks on these three plantations, no notice is
taken of the thinfiings.         I am informed by gentlemen who
have kept accounts        of thinnings,  that these have repaid the
rent of the land and every expense, with compound interest,
some time before the woods were thirty years old ; and the
preceding calculations show that it may be so.           And if sot
the present value of these plantations is all clear gain.
   The valuer of these plantations has bought a good deal of
wood out of them ; and the prices he has valued at per foot,
may possibly be       a fair value there for such small timber.
   The growth of the firs in the last mentioned plantation,
is probably as great in that poor ground as it would have
been had they been planted on ground of three or four times
its value;    this mu3t be    a powerful inducement to gentlemen
to plant all such poor ground in the first instance.
   And a few of oaks, ashes, and firs, may be raised on al
most every farm in screens, that may, by their shelter, in
crease the value of the farm to the occupier, by' increasing
the produce, particularly that of grass grounds. In this case
the interest of landlord and tenant may be reciprocal ; but it
is the reverse where trees are planted in hedge-rows.
   And even the sides and tops of high mountains may be
made abundantly more productive of grass, if certain porr
tions of them were surrounded by plantations. These planta
tions, by breaking the force of cold winds, diminish their
chilling    effect  on the fields the plantations surround,     anil

genial.
    This  last kind of improvement         will generally be found
very greatly to exceed the expectation        of the improver, pro
vided it be judiciously planned and executed.
    May I    take the  liberty    to  suggest, that information of
very great value might ue obtained by the Society from the
gentlemen to whom medals and premiums have been given,
for planting trees, if they would favour the Society with
their subsequent observations respecting those plantations.
    It would, for instance, be desirable to have the nature of
the soil and under strata described, — the sorts of trees best
suited thereto, — the distance at which the trees were first
planted, — at what periods they were thinned, and how many
cut out at each thinning, and their measure and value, — the
present height, distance, measure, and value, of the trees
now growing on an acre, — what distances are found most
advantageous, and also the best height to be pruned.
    The fund of information that such communications might
 afford, would prove of very great value indeed to future
 planters, as well as to many proprietors of plantations of
different ages now growing. .
     If the Society should think it advisable to solicit this in
 formation, no doubt the ample and valuable materials they
 would thereby obtain, would enable some abler pen to do
justice to the curioir* and important subjects of the preceding
 pages.     In the mean time it is hoped, that this attempt to
 reduce our knowledge of the growth of timber to something
 like system, however imperfect it may be, will be received
.with indulgence.      Assuredly, it had not so soon seen the
 light, had not    the present     situation of our country impe
 riously demanded of every individual his utmost exertion to
 render us as independent as possible of supplies of every
 kind from the continent of Europe, from which we are now
 almost totally excluded.

      To Mr. Tilloch, — Sir,
 J.N  an age like the present, when the abilities       of  a   Rennie,
 a Jessop,    a Telford,   and numerous      other British    civil en
 gineers are so universallv known, by the great works which
have been executed within the last 30 years under their di
rection,    wherein difficulties of almost every kind have been
successfully overcome, and tunnels in the most difficult
situations have been constructed,          in considerable numbers      :
it must    excite surprise in every one to learn, that after more
than three years have been spent by a company of proprie
tors in the metropolis of the country, in ineffectual attempts
towards constructing a dry tunnel for a road-way under the
bed    of the river Thames, as a substitute for a bridge, that
the directors appointed by these proprietors should            now be
advertising (in the newspapers, and by a printed hand- bill,
which is given below,) for the schemes of inexperienced
adventurers,      rather than call in the professional aid      of one
or more of the established        engineers of the country, to the
effecting of    the purposes   which they have in view. Surely it
cannot be expected by these gentlemen, that any of the ex
perienced engineers alluded to, will submit their designs and
estimates    for the great work which the proprietors have uni-
dertaken, on the terms and for the considerations held
out ; — u ho is to decide on the merits of the different design*
which     may    be delivered  in? and ivho is to superintend and
execute    the design   which may be adopted ? On both of these
questions, the probability either of honour or profit to be
derived from their labours, will in all likelihood turn,
according      to the conditions      which   the directors have laid
down.
    In your Magazine, No. 97, for June 1806, (vol.xxv. p. 46,)
I  gave a hasty sketch of the stale of the works at that time,

 whole were alluvial, and their continuance horizontally not
 in the least to he depended on, as mentioned at page 49 of
 my paper in your Magazine, of vvhich he hid three or tour
 copies from me at his request, to distribute among the di

 directors have lately published, show, after more than two
 years of very expensive trial, that these ideas of mine have
 been confirmed, as they might have been in a few weeks time,
 by the borings in the bottom     of the river which I recom
 mended, first in   Dr. Rees's   Neir Cyclopaedia (sect. Thames,
 in the  article Canal), and again in my      paper in your Maga
 zine above referred to    ; and such   borings would doubtless
 have suggested the conclusion, without all this loss of money
 and time, which the engineer (Quere, was it Mr. V. or
Mr. T. ?) at length came to, viz. : " That an underground
 tunnel could not be made in that line, unless the fractures
 were covered by caissons, without which the further pro
gress  of the drift would be useless ;" but he continues, "that
he   had no doubt of being able to make a tunnel over the
same    line through the river, sufficiently deep into its bed,
by means of movable caissons, or coffer-dams, and at a less
expense considerably than the original estimate for the un
derground plan: and without any impediment to the naviga
tion of the river." -From the expressions of the directors
which follow, it is too much to be feared, that the counsels
which first prevailed in adopting a deep underground tunnel,
rather than one laid as near as may be to the bottom of the
water in the river, has still a prevailing influence among
them;     in which case   I  venture again    to predict, that tha
expectations of the proprietors and the public, svill be ulti
mately and grievously disappointed.
    At the time of writing the short notice of this under
taking, in connection with the navigation of the Thames
river, for the Cyclopaedia, I was too much hurried to give
the subject that consideration, which its obvious importance
                                A a 3                          has

Sf4               On the intended Thames Archway
has since occasioned it to have, particularly when I have
been in the company of ingenious and practical men in such
 matters, and have introduced the subject, in order to hear
 the ideas of others relating to it.        Instead oi ptiing off the
 river,   as I there hastily mentioned, I would suggest to        the
 Consideration of those engineers who may turn their atten
 tion to the subject, an immense tub in form of the frustum
 of  a  cone, secured by hoops outside, and polygonal framing
 inside,     but without either bottom or top, which being prin
 cipally of wood, might be floated at high water to the spot
 where the tunnel is to be begun ; the bottom edge of it
 might be so secured to the bottom of the river, by means
 which will      suggest themselves     to competent engineers,  as to
  prevent the influx of water from the river, or the pressing in
  of quick-sand or silt, after the water is extracted from the
 tub by engines ; and after a length, of 70 or 80 feet per
 haps, of the tunnel was constructed, its end might be so se
  cured as to admit    of moving    the tub, to include a new length ;
  with   scarcely any interruption to the navigation of the river.
     I have often been sanguine enough, to expect to see se
  veral tunnels constructed under the Thames and other of
  our important navigable rivers, in some instances- super
  seding, perhaps, the ancient bridges like that of London ;
  but must confess, that the origin and proceedings of the two
  Thames Archway Companies, which we have seen, and
  particularly the proposals by the directors of one of them
  which follow, have occasioned me to doubt much, whethe
  I shall live long enough, to pass through a tunnel con
  structed under their auspices, unless indeed a material chang
  takes place in their principle of proceeding.

     length,    intended   as a  dra n for the proposed road arcl
     way   :  with an account of     the progress and  present state
                                                                      tl

     the works, and of two premiums advertised by the direc
    tors for plans, according to which the tunnel may be
    constructed.
    The Thames Archway Company was established by an
 act of parliament (45 Geo. III.) "for the purpose of form
 ing a tunnel under the river Thames, either for foot passen
 gers or carriages, or for both       ;"  and by the unanimous opi
 nion of     every    engineer who      had   been    consulted, it was
 deemed necessary,         as a preparatory step, to make a drift
 way   to extend   as  far  as the deepest part of the river ; and ac
 cording to the original plan of this undertaking             it was in
 tended then to begin to construct the tunnel,                carrying it
 forward in both directions from the centre to the north and
 south sides of the river : a shaft was therefore sunk on the
 south side near the Horse-ferry, Redrifle,             and a   drift-way
made to the point first proposed.             It was, however, then
 determined to continue the drift to the opposite shore, in
the line and direction of the proposed           tunnel,   for the sake,
amongst other reasons, of exploring               the  ground through
which that      part    of  the  tunnel   was   intended to pass ; and
thereby enabling the engineer to anticipate and guard against
difficulties.
    In pursuance of this determination              the  drift-way    wa9
carried on to the extent shown in the accompanying plan,
at A, when the engineer proposed another mode of executing
the tunnel, and, in his opinion, much less difficult and less
expensive, and for which the further extension of the drift
would be useless       ;  the directors, being convinced       that there
arc many methods 'of accomplishing             the object, and that it
is their duty to procure the best in their power, thought
proper, before this or any plan were adopted, to suspend the
works, aqd to invite ingenious men of every description to
a consideration      of  the best means     of completing      so   useful
and so novel an undertaking.
    With this view       the directors are induced to offer the fol
lowing premiums, namely,
    Two hundred pounds to the person whose plan shall be
adopted and acted upon; and a further sum of three hundred
pounds    if it be executed.

  premium within three months after the tunnel shall have

 fictitious names, mottoes, or marks, and will be returned if
 not adopted to any person claiming them under the fictitious
 name, motto, or mark          ; the real name    to be enclosed in a
 sealed note, and externally marked with the fictitious name,
 &c;     which note shall not be opened unless it be that of
 the    person whose plan shall be adjudged entitled to the
 premium.
    AH    the plans   will  be submitted to the judgement        of   emi
 nent and competent persons chosen by the directors, who
 shall not be either proprietors or competitors ; 'so that every
 person offering plans may rely upon the fairness and impar
 tiality  of the decision.
    The plans must be delivered at the office of Mr. Wadeson,
 in Austin Friars, London, solicitor to this concern, on or
 before the first of June next.
    To enable engineers and others to form correct opinions
 on the subject, the directors have caused the following ac
count of such facts as were noted to have occurred in the
progress of the undertaking, to be extracted from the en
gineer's journal, which is accompanied by an engraving

the shaft, was so considerable, that         a fourteen-horse engine
could only keep the water a few feet below its natural level,
and the shaft was sunk through, by far the greatest part of
this stratum, into the blue stratum No. 3, with the water
standing in it to the depth of several feet.           It is well ascer
tained that this stratum of gravel extends through a consi
derable part of the adjoining country; but borings being
made in the shaft from the bottom of this stratum, no wa
ter was met with in the sub-strata to the depth of eighty-six
feet from high water, where a spring was discovered, which
rose in a few hours, through pipes inserted for that purpose,
to   a higher level than that in the gravelly stratum No. 2.
The shaft was therefore sunk only to the depth of seventy-six
feet four inches.
    The drift     was   then carried forward in    a horizontal    direc
 tion to the north,       five hundred and   fifty-nine   feet. And, in
 order to explore the ground in the northern part of the line
 of the then proposed tunnel, the drift was turned to the
 west twenty-tbree feet six inches from the centre of the
 former line to the centre of the new direction, and then to
 the north, as shown in Fig. 2, (intended to be enlarged af
 terwards to the size of the tuntiel) and carried forward three
 hundred and forty-one feet, making the distance from the
 shaft to the beginning of the rise at D nine hundred and
 twenty-two feet. Through the whole of this line no ma
 terial interruption occurred ; the strata, as shown above,
 consisted or firm saiid, calcareous rock, and concreted gra
 vel, with no more water than was easily kept under                  by a
 fourteen-horse engine.
     At   trre  point  D   the drift was made to   incline upwards at
 the rate of one foot in nine.         In prosecuting this part of the
 drift,  at    the distance    of twenty- three feet from the begin
  ning of the incline, the earth in the roof brbke down, and
                                                              discharged

    3S0                 On the intended Thames Archway
    d'scharged a great quantity of sand and water into the drift.
    At the time this circumstance happened, a space of only six
    inches bv thirtv ol earth in the mof and none in the face
    was left    u ni i inhered     and through this space the earth kept
    falling by d^rees,         until a hole was formed capable of letting
    a man stand up in it ; who observed a quicksand, about
    three feet thick, and about four or five feet above the roof
   of the drift. The stratum between the drift and sand was
   clav   ;  water flowed from the sand. The hole was after some
   difficulties filled up, and the works proceeded.
       From the observations which had been made in the pro
   gress    of  the    drift, the engineer found ihat    the strata dipped
   slightly    from the south to the north, and concluded that the
   gravelly stratum No. 2 in the shaft would end in quicksand.
  This inference was confirmed bv borings in the north shore
   at E, and by the fact that the wells there are much deeper
  than on the south.            In expectation therefore of drawing off
  the water from the face of the work, borings were made at
  D, through the roof of the drift, and pipes forced up to the
  top of the quick -sand, which had the desired effect.                The
  water came free from sand for a considerable time; but
  when the sand began to come through any of the pipes they
  were plugged up, and others occasionally inserted in diffe
  rent places to the south of these, with the same object in
  view ; and which kept the face of the work dry.                  By this
  means, and by using the             utmost  precaution  in all other  re
 spects,     the   drift   was   afterwards  extended  seventy    feet be
 yond ihis fracture ; where the roof broke down a second
 time, aud sand and water entered the drift-way with great
 violence, and to an alarming degree ; so that in about a
 quarter of an hour the water rose in the shaft nearly to the
 top of it. On examining the river an opening or hole at w
 was discovered in the bed, of about four feet diameter and
 nine feet deep, and its sides nearly perpendicular. Into thi9
 hole, clay partly in bags, and other materials, were thrown
 sufficient to fill it up; and which succeeded in stopping the
communication between the river and the drift.                   The face
of the drift      was again opened       ; but the men could make but
little progress,         as  the   water and sand frequently burst in
                                                                     upon

               between Hotherhithe and IAmehouie.                       381
upon (hem, ami drove thtm away.                  F'ipes were again put
up ai G,     and the drift was extended twenty feet six inches
further, in nearly a horizontal direction, through the quick
sand. The face was then timbered up, to prevent any further
fall of earth or sand ; and a pipe nine feet long forced
upwards diagonally at the lace of the drift.               The first eight
feet through which this pipe passed was blue clay, and the
last foot quicksand, of which a considerable quantity im
mediately flowed into the drift.               This pipe soon became
clogged up,     it   is   presumed    with  clay, as some lumps came
through nearly as lame as the diameter of the pipe. An
other pipe, eight feet six inches long, was inserted hori
zontally in the face, and discovered nothing but blue clay:
no sand nor water         came*   through it.
   At this period         the  engineer reported, that he had ex
amined the     bed    of   the  river, and found the hole at ui con
siderably increased both in width and depth, and the earth
at x very much sunk ; and that he had no doubt these two
fractures    communicated          underneath.       He  then    gave  it as
his opinion that an underground tunnel could                not   be  made
in  that line,  unless the fractures were covered            by caissons,
without which the further progress of the drift would be
useless ; but that he had no doubt of being able to make a
tunnel over the same line through the river, sufficiently
deep into its bed, by means           of moveable caissons, or coffer
dams, and at       a less expense     considerably     than the original
estimate    for the underground plan ;           and without any impe
diment to the navigation of the river.              Under these circum
stances the further progress of the works was suspended.
But   the   directors think it necessary to state, that although
the engineer then in the Company's service was of opinion
that an underground plan could not be executed in or very
near the proposed line,          yet  there   are others   of  a   contrary
Sentiment    ; and notwithstanding          the directors are in posses
sion of designs or plans (which may be inspected on appli
cation at the clerk's office in Austin Friars) for completing
the undertaking, yet wishing to avail themselves of all the
ability of their country,         in an undertaking of such novelty
and importance,         it becomes their duty to await the event of
                                                                       this

   this address     to  the public, before any plan be adopted,
»  however considerable its merits, or however eminent its
   authors.
       In the design of any plan for this concern, engineers will
   doubtles pay particular attention to the difficulties which are
   likely to occur, from the situation of the quicksands, the
   communication with them and the river, and the falls in the
   bed   of the river. And, that they     will not. consider themselves
   as prevented    from offering plans for executing the tunnel
   through    the river itself,   by means of caissons, coffer-dams,
   or any other method (if such method              appear to them pre
   ferable to the underground mode), provided in the execution
   of  such plans no impediment         be occasioned  to the navigation
   of  the river.
      It is  necessary   to state, that any alteration in the line of
   the tunnel can be but inconsiderable, as it must be confined
  within    the limits  of   the ground    laid down     in  the  accom
   panying plan. ^
      It is an important consideration with the Company, that
  the size of the tunnel be large enough to admit two car
  riages to pass each other ; or two of smaller dimensions,
  each to admit      a carriage.
      The Company         contemplate a foot tunnel, only in the
  event that a larger one should appear to be impracticable.
      The plans must be formed with regard to the tunnel being
  lighted.
      N.B. That plan        whose    line is the shortest, and ascent
  the easiest, will have great claims to preference,          if equal   in
  merit in other respects.

      flection of   Light, by employing Hollow Fibres of Glais.

       Society of Edinburgh, and of the Society of the Anti
       quaries of Scotland.
          DEAR SIR,
   Having        directed my attention for some years to the con
   struction of micrometers, I have had frequently occasion to
   regret the difficulty of procuring fibres sufficiently fine and
   elastic for these delicate instruments.          The impossibility of
   obtaining     silver  wire  of  a  diameter    small    enough for this
   purpose, has induced Mr. Troughton to use the web of the
   spider, which he has found so fine, opaque, and elastic, as
   to answer all the objects      of practical astronomy.           I am in
   formed, however, by         this  celebrated artist, that it is only
   the stretcher or the long line which supports the spider's
'
   web, that possesses these valuable properties.                 The other
   parts   of  the   web,  though   equally   fine  and   elastic,   are very
   transparent, and therefore completely unfit for micrometri-
   cal fibres. The difficulty of procuring the proper part of the
    6pider's web, has compelled many opticians and practical
    astronomers to employ the raw fibres of unwrought silk, or,
    what is much worse, the coarse silver wire which is manu
    factured in this country.        But whatever be the relative ad
    vantages of these different substances, they are all liable to
    the error arising from the inflection of light, which renders
    it impossible to ascertain the exact contact between the fibre
    and the luminous       body.    This disadvantage has been ex
    perienced by every       astronomical    observer, and has always
    been considered as inseparable from the wire micrometer.
    I   have,   however,    succeeded    in obtaining       a  delicate fibre
                                                                        which

 384            On the Fibres used in Micrometers,                      &c.
 which      enables us to remove the error                 of inflection-,       while it
 possesses the requisite properties                    of opacity and          elasticity.
 This fibreis made of glass, which is so exceedingly elastic,
that it can be drawn to any degree of fineness, and can al
ways he procured and prepared with facility; a circumstance
of no small importance                 to the practical astronomer, who is
frequently obliged to send his micrometers to a great distance
to be repaired.
   It is evident that this vitreous fibre, when drawn from a
hollow glass tube, will also be of a tubular structure, and
that its interior diameter may always be regulated by the
inner diameter of the original tube.    When the fibre is
formed,      and stretched          across the diaphragm           of   the eye-piece
of   a telescope,    it will appear              perfectly opaque, with a deli
cate line     of light extending                 along its axis. This central
transparency        arises      from       the    transmission         of   the incident
light through       the axis         of    the       hollow tube   :   and since this
tube can be made of any calibre, we can also increase or di
minish the diameter of the luminous streak. In a micro
meter which I have fitted up in this way, the glass fibres
are about the       1 200dth        part   of    an inch   in diameter ;        and the
fringe of light which stretches across their axis is distinctly
visible, though it does not exceed the3000dth part of an inch.
   In using these fibres for measuring the angle subtended                               by-
two luminous points, whether they be two stars, or the op
posite extremities of  luminous disc, we may, as has been
                                a
done hitherto, separate the fibres till the luminous points
are in contact with their interior surfaces  but in order to  ;
avoid the error arising from inflection,                     1   would propose to
separate the fibres      till   the raysof light issuing from the lu
minous pomts dart            through the transparent axes of the fibres.
The  rays thus transmitted evidently suffer no inflection ia
passing through the fibre to the eye; and besides this ad
vantage we have the benefit of delicate line about one thinj
                                                 a
of   the   diamuer of    the fibre itself.

   LXVIII.     Observations suggested by the Geological Paper
      of Mr. John Farey             in last Month's Philosophical
      Magazine.
             Mr. Tilloch, — Sir,
  TTo  he geological   facts communicated        by Mr. John Farey, in
   his  Paper commencing your           last  month's Number, are in
  an eminent degree instructive            and interesting.    It is only
   from the itinerant     geologist cautiously      pacing pver various
   and extensive districts, and marking, with experienced in
  telligence, the wonderful phaenomena which every where
 .present   themselves, that we can hope to obtain that accu
  mulation of practical facts which can alone guide us to a
   sober and correct theory    of  the natural causes    which,    at re
   mote periods, have operated those stupendous changes which
  are every where seen on and near the surface          of our globe.
      The almost infinitely diversified exterior of the earth, and
  its universal stratification, furnish the most interesting sub-
ejects of inquiry ; and every natural inequality upon, and
  every bed which reposes beneath, the surface is connected
  with   a history which well merits, and can only be developed
  by, the researches of the strongest intellect.             Indeed-the
  common mind is overpowered by the stunning magnitude
  of geological   facts ; it shrinks from the bold       but just con
  clusion, that    the lowest stratum        which the deepest excava
  tions into the earth have yet reached, was once itself a sur
  face, and that the highest peak of the loftiest stratified
  mountain is only the remaining speck of a vast country
  which once spread itself out on the same, and in many in
  stances much higher, level : the mountain deriving its pre
  sent form     and   exaltation,   not from masses of matter suc
  cessively piled up by unknown means, but solely from the
  superior durability of its materials, which have withstood the
  operation of those tremendous agents, that have swept away
 the surrounding country in which it was imbedded, leaving
 the mountain itself a magnificent land gauge, by which to es
 timate the immensity of the tracts that have disappeared. The
 formation of mountains in this way, and that of the exten
 sive strata of the earth, mutually elucidate each other.            The

336                 Observdtions     suggested   by
incalculable masses      of materials    necessary  to form the lattef,
Could only be derived        from the destructive transportation of
other strata equally extensive ; and the present elevation
 of stratified mountains is demonstrative evidence of the
 former existence    of   the countries     which,    in   disappearing,
 have furnished such vast masses of diversified material for
 the formation of other stratified countries in other situations.
 These simple and sublime geological truths, however they
 may now smock minds unaccustomed to the contemplation
 6f natural grandeur, will, at no distant period, be as gene-
 tally assented to   as the    gravitation of Newton.
     The just appreciation of geological phaenomena is amongst
  the most creditable things of modern science.              Already are
  the ignes j'atui of hypothetical invention disappearing, and
 we no longer hear of seas fourteen thousand feet above the
 level of the present ocean retiring into cavernous recepta
 cles, or   of the exaltation of continents, to      equal heights, by
 vulcanian energies.      Forged in the same fabulous workshop,
  they are already slumbering on the same shelf with the vi
  treous sparks of Buffon.
     The   great source,   I  conceive,   of all hypothetical reason
  ing on the formation of the earth arises from the mistaken
  opinion, that the present laws of nature are insufficient to
  account for past effects y without duly considering, that the
  natural causes which are now operating changes on our
  globe have been in action millions of years, and that it is
  the almost infinite duration and variance of their action,
  rather than the apparent little which we can now perceive
  them performing, that will enable us to account for the stu
   pendous effects which-they have accomplished. The system-
  builder by a deluge, an internal fire, an external crust, the
  vicinity^of an erratic planet, or some such fanciful creation,
  is for accomplishing,       almost in an instant,     that which, far
  more probably,     required many thousands of years to effect ;
   and it assuredly is a rigid attention to, or disregard of, the
   two important circumstances of time and agency, that marks
   the boundary line between fanciful hypothesis and genuine
   theory.    When the investigator flies off in       search  o' a cause
   which no longer exists, or no longer operates              within the
                                                                   sphere

sphere     of his inquiry,     he is certainly   indulging in hypo
 thetical visions;      but when he fairly generalizes, by some
common agreement, a multitudinous class of acknowledged
phenomena,          and directly connects them with causes still in,
operation,      he is developing a lucid    theory which      will  en
lighten and improve.
    It  is this departure from nature, by an assumption          of ex
tinct or imaginary       causes,  that has induced me to offer the
present observations.        The closet geologist may be expected
so indulge himself in the creation of hypothetical phantoms ;
but that he who has had the great and instructive volume of
Nature spread out before him, and, page after page, has read,
in her indelible and expressive characters, the history of her
magnificent transactions, should imagine her present ener
gies unequal to her past performances, and that others must
 be sought for in lunar regions, forsooth, is at once matter
of surprise     and regret.
    I  apply   this  to Mr. Farey, but with the utmost deference
 forTiis practical knowledge.         In any thing relating to effects
 which have taken place,        and to practical fsfcts resulting from
 extensive personal observation, he is clear, correct, and in
 structive ; but the instant he attempts to develop cause> the
genuine spirit of philosophy forsakes him, and he becomes
 bewildered in the unprofitable maze of hypothesis. Mr. Fa
rey is evidently preparing to add one more inventive system
 to the many that have already so much retarded the progress
of   real knowledge, by the introduction of a non-existent
satellite at some indefinite time, and from some indefinite re
gion, whose near approach to the earth is to reverse the ac
tion of gravitation, and undulate or distort the upper strata
into some or all of their present irregularities.                Before
further committing himself, it will be well for Mr. Farey to
consider whether, by the promulgation of a hypothesis so
utterly incongruous with all the present operating laws of
Nature, he is not about to sacrifice much of that fair fame
which his practical researches have so deservedly assigned
him.
    A system-builder, like a religious or political bigot, is

(hat he will hail with approbation      a liberal   criticism     which
has solely in view the expulsion       of error from his favourite
pursuit,   and the 'recalling  of his attention within     those sober
limits which experience       and observation so    justly prescrihe.
A   dwarf stationed on the shoulder of       a giant can see further
than the giant himself ; and if I      assume this visual preem'w
hence, it is only to acknowledge the Colossus that supp'orli
Die.
    Certainly the great and most desirable desideratum in ge
ology is to account, satisfactorily, for the original formation
fcf all stratified countries 3 and. when that has been clearly
accomplished, all irregularities and anomalies in the strata
themselves, which have hitherto been almost the only cir
cumstances attended to, will be comparatively an easy at
tainment; for it is impossible '.j doubt that the same power
ful agent, whatever it may be, that        has given     mobility     and
transportation    to such massive and diversified materials, and
has spread them out, on so gigantic a scale, over the face of
the globe, must also be equal to their separation, disruption,
denudation, excavation, and almost every other geological
appearance which observation has discovered.
    And I   have only   to  advance    one step funber and add,
that the only agent in nature,       with which    we are acquaint
ed, and to whose action we can assign, with any colourable
probability, all these extraordinary and stupendous effects,
is water.
    To this powerful and incessant operator allow but a suf
ficiency of duration, and a suitable diversity of fluctuating
 circumstance, and he will have a bold and arduous task to
 perform who shall undertake to advocate its limitation in
geological efficacy.     And here it is that I would more espe
cially solicit the attention of Mr. Farey, by urging him to
relinquish    his aerial as-ijstant,  which    does   not untie, but
 clumsily cut, the Gordian      knot,   and substitute     in its  stea'd
this simple and natural instrument,         in which he will      expe
rience a power and plrnbility of action competent to the il
lustration of almost every geological phaenomenon.                 It is,

 however, I think, very            unfortunate for Mr. Farey himself,
 that he either does not perceive, or is strangely indisposed,
 to admit, the most obvious effects of water on the surface
 of   the earth.       A   decisive and very singular proof of this is
 given in that most extraordinary and unphilosophical con
 clusion which he draws on the formation of valleys, and
 which unquestionably detracts, to an extent which he can
 not be aware of, from his other acknowledged merits                      as  an
 observing naturalist.
     The action of water, in operating extensive changes on our
 earth, naturally divides itself into two distinct branches ;
 those changes which are effected by streams of fresh water
 running over the surface, and those far more mighty ex
 terior and interior changes which the ocean itself has ac
 complished, during the submersion of our present continents.
     Were there any probability, Mr. Editor, that these cur
 sory remarks        of mine could merit a place in your most re
 spectable     repository of scientific knowledge, 1 would pursue
the subject in two subsequent papers on both of these
branches; first by investigating, circumstantially, the form

marine action.                           I am, sir,

were founded          merely    upon the interest which certain pro

 390         Introduction to the Study    of Mineralogy.
    Minerals, for the most     part being hid   within the cavities
 of the earth, only come out of      it in fragments, and bear the
marks of the iron instruments that have been employed to
 tear them from their beds : to the generality of mankind
 they are only crude masses, without character and without
 appropriate definition, and appear as if intended solely to
be appropriated to our wants.        It has seldom been imagined
 that a distinct science could have been reared out of the sub
ject, and that     the naturalist should hold a place between the
 miner who extracts the treasures of Nature from the earth,
 and the artist who works them.
    Those    however     who,   without   dwelling  upon first ap
 pearances, will consider minerals more closely, and with
 long continued attention, will easily perceive how much is
 to be gained by a more intimate          acquaintance  with their
 properties.
    Polyhedric forms,      the dimensions    and  angles of which
 appear to have      been regulated  by a scientific hand with the
 assistance   of the compass ;   the variations which these forms,
 without ceasing to be regular, undergo in one and the same
 substance ; and the advantage of being able, by the help of
  calculation and observation, to re-discover the traces of Pro
 teus   concealed under these metamorphoses ; ingenious ex
 periments concurring with indications which speak at ortce
 to the eye, in order to develop the properties which escape
 him   ; the  principle of Archimedes applied to the comparison
 of weights under a given volume ; the refrangent power em
 ployed- in tracing a limit between bodies through which the
 image of each object appears, simple, and those which pre
 sent two to the astonished beholder; heat substituted for
 friction in order     to  produce electrical poles, in bodies the
 crystalline form of which, by particular modifications, in
 dicates beforehand the positions of these poles; the mag
 netic needle making use of iron to disclose itself; various
 chemical     agents   presenting  methods of dispelling doubts
 which other experiments had still left ; the resources fur
 nished by analysis for the formation of a method grounded
 upon the intimate knowledge of the objects which it em
 braces; every thing conspires to make mineralogy a science

 worthy of being received by minds naturally inclined to in
 quiries susceptible of precision and vigour, presenting in
 genious combinations, and a collection of facts closely con
nected with each other.
    To such minds mineralogy            presents    itself under  a  new
 aspect.    It is a picture which is embellished by the mere
habit    of seeing and studying it; in which Nature exhibits
herself,   as she does every     where else, under an aspect which
claims for the Creator the tribute        of our homage and admi
 ration.
    Mineralogy      embraces    a multitude    of productions which
human industry has not yet been able to mould to the wants
or pleasures of life, without a certain study of their cha
 racters and of their nature, and without which art could
not    possibly clear the paths of science.          From the earliest
times the collection of these familiar productions had been
subdivided into stones, salts, bitumens, and metals.                 The
methods of the mineralogist are, as it were, the first out
lines, of a picture.      The working of metallic substances had
shown several essential differences which distinguish them.
Among the         stones there have been composed numerous
groupea    under    the names of marbles and gems, which, not
withstanding the disparity of the bodies which they served
to connect with each other, were attempts at the formation
of   the genera which subdivide the classes.            Certain proper
ties, remarkable from their being elicited under certain cir
cumstances only, have not escaped attention : the attraction
exercised   by amber when rubbed over light bodies, and the
kind of sympathy        between iron and the magnet, which had
been considered as a simple stone, have all been observed.
Even the forms of crystals were not wholly unknown to the
ancients : that of rock crystal and of the diamond have been
distinctly alluded to by Pliny*. The regular polyhedrons,
which at present excite our admiration from their multitude
and diversity,      were then also remarked as wonderful singu
larities.
    It is only since the commencement of this century, how-

ever, that the learned have begun to submit the assemblage
of inorganic bodies to methodical arrangements, and that
the term     mineral kingdom has been         adopted. Among the
various    systems    which     have   successively appeared, some
of them, such      as  those of Linnaeus, Wallerius, Daubenton,
&c,      employ in    the determination     of  the   species,   genera,
orders and classes, certain characters which are, as it were,
presented to the naked eye; such as those which are derived
from the form, texture, and transparency of the colours                  ;
 or certain properties easily verified, such as those of emitting
 light with steel, effervescence with nitric acid, &c. Other
 systems, subjected to a more scientific progress, as traced
 by Cronstadt, and followed by Bergman, Born, Kirwan,
 &c., present     the series of minerals classified according to
 their analyses ; so that, the species being determined by the
 identity of the component principles, the genera are formed of
 species which have a common principle.              The same method
  also serves in certain cases to connect together several genera
  in one and the same order: thus the neutral salts may be sub-,
  divided into alkaline      salts,  earthy salts, and metallic salts,
  according    to the kind of acid united to an alkali, an earth,
  or a metal. But when analysis failed in enabling mineralogists
  to form orders, its place was supplied by some chemical
  property common to all the genera of which each order was
  the assemblage : and with respect to the classes, they were
  in the same way characterized after the maimer in which
   the substances which       composed them were modified in the
   various operations    which    spring from chemistry.
      It must not be thought, however, that there was a line
   of separation clearly   traced betvven    the two modes        of  me
   thodical distribution   which we have mentioned.            Chemists,
   after having determined the series of the classes, orders, ge
  nera, and species, by the help of chemical properties, or of
   the results of analysis, could not descend to the varieties,
   except by employing external characters          in order to distin
   guish them from each other.          Now, in   a complete method,
   we are the less entitled to dwell upon tbe species, as they
   are frequentlv ramified into several subdivisions, the diffe
   rences  of which, much more striking than           those   light   and
                                                       _          fugitive

fugitive shades which modify the varieties in botany, pre
sent, from the different laws of Nature, or from the different
ways in which she operates, results very distinct. In calca
reous species, for example, the various crystalline forms,
stalactites, marbles, &c., are so many modifications of one
and the same substance, which, without doubt, deserve to
be separately observed and studied ; and if in all these we
were not to see any thing but lime and carbonic acid, it
would be     as  if  we contented ourselves      with  the inscription
of    a picture equally interesting        by the assemblage and by
the variety of its objects.
    On   the other hand,      it is evident  that mineralogists have
really profited       to  a  certain   point, by the results of che
mistry, in order to form the distributions which have been,
designated     by the term niineralogical methods : for without
speaking here of the use which they have made of certain
properties, such as effervescence with the acids, which is a
 true chemical      property, they never could have been able,
without the aid of analysis, to refer subsances to their true
classes.     The carbonate of lead, commonly known as white
 lead, was regarded as a species foreign to the metals, and
was probably arranged among the stones.               In the Brisgaw,
a few years ago, there was found a crystallized substance
 with small incrusted laminae, and of a white colour : mine
 ralogists had      alternately    regarded it as a zeolite, and as a
 ponderous spar.       The analysis of Pelletier, however, assigned
 jts true place, as    being among the ores of zinc, by the name
 of calamine.
     Chemistry     has   therefore been, at least tacitly, the guide
 of mineralogists in the determination of species ; and the
 formation of the genera is really the point at which systems
 in every respect begin to diverge.
     In those of the mineralogists, the species which compose
 pne and the same genus are connected with each other by
 a character derived from some quality which is common to
 them, or by several characters so combined that their as
 semblage is considered as belonging only to the colltction
 of the species in question. The genera adopted by chemists
 have their loundation in analysis itself : they depend,          as we
                                                                   have

 have said,        upon the existence of a principle common to the
  different kinds, the distinction of which afterwards bears
 upon the principles which are peculiar to them.
     We     see   from what precedes, that chemistry and mine
 ralogy necessarily concur to the formation of a method,
 whatever it may be, which has for its object the classifica
 tion of inorganic bodies ; that it belongs to chemistry to lay
 the first foundations           of  the method by      the determination      of
 the species       ; and that the difference depends             upon what is
 contributed by each to the construction of the edifice which,
 is raised upon that basis. I shall soon detail the principles
 which seem to me to conduce to the most advantageous ap
 plication of this kind of alliance.
     On the other hand, natural philosophy unites with che
 mistry in order to furnish mineralogy with distinctive cha
 racters, the more advantageous from their diving to the very
 bottom of substances, and they are much less variable than
 those    of which       we judge only      with   respect to the manner       in
 which ihey strike our              senses.    Experiments equally simple
 and easy seem to give us new organs,                  in order to penetrate
 to the most intimate properties of a substance : and we may
 answer those who think that mineralogy is svulicient for its
 own wants, without intermixing with foreign substances,
 $hat in operations so elementary, and requiring so small an
 expense, we see neither the naturalist nor the chemist pro
perly      so   called, but the         mineralogist alone, interrogating
nature in     a  more urgent and more fortunate manner *,
     Geometry, in its turn, has direct and necessary relations
with mineralogy,             by the description of crystalline forms,
and still more by its numerous applications to the structure
 Of crystals, which, of itself, is only the result of a natural
   * Although this simple indication of chemical and physical properties be
sufficient for fulfilling our principal object, wc have thought it right to add
the explanation of these properties, and thus to labour for men more particu
larly versant in the sciences by which mineralogy may      be extricated from the
labyrinth   of phrases purely descriptive, and be raised to the rank of the true
sciences, which aggrandize their object by ascending to the laws to which
thev are subjected.      They will of course do usti service, if they do not con
fine  us to the  results of solitary experiments, but, on the contrary, proceed
to show their connection with the causes upon which they depend.
                                                                     geometry,

geometry, subjected to particular rules, and by which each
solid has it: figure determined by the combination of an in
finity of other small solids, which are like the elements of
the first.    A                          will obtain for them
                  hasty glance at crystals
the appellation of pure  lusus natures ; which is only an ele-
gant way of confessing' our ignorance.       A closer examina
tion unfolds to us the laws of arrangement in them, by the
aid of which calculation represents and unites to each other
the results observed i laws so variable, and at the same time
so precise and regular ; simple in the extreme, yet display
ing the utmost fertility.
     The theory which    has served       to develop these laws,   rests
entirely upon a fact the existence of which had been hi
therto rather presumed tban demonstrated.       It consists in
this, that these small solids, which are the elements of cry
stals, and which     I
                   call their integrant molecules, have, in all
those which belong to one and the same species of mineral,
one invariable form, the faces of which are in the direction
of the natural joinings indicated by the mechanical division
qf these crystals, and of which the respective angles and di
mensions are given by calculation combined with observa
tion. Besides, the integrant molecules relative to different
                                  them more or less re
species also have diversities among
markable, except in a very few cases where their forms
have characters of regularity, whence result, as it were,
points of contact between certain species.   It follows from
this, that the determination of the integrant molecules
should have a great influence over that of the species ; and
this consideration has led me more than once, either to sub
divide into several species a groupe which, in the ancient
methods, form only one, or to refer and re-unite the scattered,
members of a single species, of which several distinct spe
cies had been made.   Some of these separations and re
unions,   ,made at a time when analysis had not yet unveiled
the true nature    of the   substance's    which were

ing to so many species distinctly circumscribed
order to distribute them afterwards in a well arranged me
thod, jt would be sufficient to have the analysis of one single
body taken in each.
    From this       we may conceive        in what   sense   to understand
what     I  have above hinted at, namely,           that to chemistry be
longs      the   determination       of  species,   It would perhaps be
more correct to say that it completes this determination by
making us acquainted with the principal molecules, of which
the integrant molecules are the assemblages.                   Already it is
easy to perceive          (and the subsequent part of the work will
contain       several    examples) how interesting it is that the in
quiries relative to these two kinds of molecules should con
spire towards one common object ; that the chemist and the
mineralogist should mutually enlighten each other by their
labours; and that goniometry, which furnishes data for sub
mitting crystalline forms to calculation, should be associated
with the scales that weigh the products of analysis,
    The principal object of this Treatise is to detail and de
velop a method founded upon certain principles, and which
 serves as a kind of survey to all the information presented
by mineralogy, assisted by the different sciences which can
 go hand in hand with it in one and the same line. It is
 calculated to bring all the minerals known under one and
 the same point of view, in order to compare them with each
 other, to study their characters, and to investigate alter
 nately by experiment and theory the different phaenomena of
 which they        are susceptible.       Every thing which can procure
 the observer the double advantage of being at once guided
 and enlightened during his progress will be employed ; and
    * These asso1ments would not be limited to crystals properly so called       :
 we might also include lamellated masses, or even those which cannot be sub

 pared with analogous crystallized substances, a relation, in point of position
 and aspect, which ascertains them to belong to the same species : and thus
 these musses,   insignificant in themselves, may be determined,  at least inter
 mediately, by the assistance of crystals which serve them in some measure as
 interpreters.                                                                   f

other science necessary to its elucidation.
     Mineralogy, in order       to he successfully cultivated, re
quires    extensive   preliminary knowledge and persevering in
dustry.      It is the lot of all the sciences, that, in proportion,
as they acquire new        degrees    of perfection, they require ad
ditional efforts also, in order to attain the point at which, as
from an elevated and commanding eminence, we can em
brace at one glance a greater number of truths.
     The result of my investigation, even supposing it to be
as complete as possible,       could not be regarded but as an in
 troduction to the study of Nature. The different substances
of which the globe is composed, placed in their respective
positions by the concurrence of various causes, the actions
of which have been directed by the Supreme Being toward*
 the object proposed by -his wisdom, present a spectacle per
 fectly novel, even to the eye the most familiarized with the
 aspect of minerals transported from the bowels of the earth
 into our collections.        Here we see them collected and dis
 posed in a perfectly symmetrical order; and Nature,           break
 ing through on all sides the artificial limits traced         by our
 systems, separates what we had united, while she associates
 and confounds those which we had separated.              On one hand
 she exhibits, by striking contrasts, substances which touch
 and adhere together ; and on the other hand she exhibits
  certain gradual transitions from one substance to another:—
 those are the successions        of shades, which   call upon a judi
  cious observer to remark      :  Here, the substance before us is
  no longer such a    mineral, nor is it any longer such another.
      We   may easily conceive how useful and even necessary a
  preparatory study is to the naturalist, to enable him to derive
  more benefit from his travels, and from observations made
 aipon the spot. Objects already familiar to him, dispose him
  to   form an acquaintance with those which will be new to
  him: he has not yet seen Nature ho^elf, but he has received
  eyes for the purpose.
      Although the observations          here  alluded to "belong to a
 branch of -stieuce which has been called gaology, the know
                                                                  ledge

 $93         Introduction to the Study  of Mineralogi/.
 ledge to   which they lead appertains too closely to mineralogy
 to be  omitted in a treatise relative to ihis last science,       t
 shall confine myself to the mention of some general facts,
 the existence of which is confessed by several celebrated ge«
 ologists ; and bhall subjoin an abridged description of the va
 rious aggregations known by the name of rocks, and of
 others which are nothing else than groupes or mixtures of
 mineralogica' species.     Those who desire more detailed no
 tions may derive them from the works of Deluc, Saussure,
 Dolomieu, Pallas, Ramond,        and other scientific  men who
have seen Nature upon a large scale, and have acquired from
her a right to describe her phaenomena.
    But independently of those who are led by a particular
taste towards researches which are the result of travels
and voyages, there exist men every where, who, while re
siding in towns, are desirous of procuring useful informa
tion respecting the various mineral productions of Nature;
and mineralogy has this advantage over the animal and ve
getable kingdoms, that the collections of objects connected
with it   are more plentiful,  and susceptible of fewer chasms,
on account of the smaller number of species, while they are
also less exposed to deterioration, and may be studied with
delight at all seasons and in all places. I have flattered my
self that there would be found in this work an additional
facility for acquiring the knowledge so proper for adorning
reason and cultivating the mind, and for exciting in the
soul a becoming gratitude for the benefits conferred by an
all-seeing Providence.      With the view of attaining every
object connected with the science,      I  have given,    as often
as opportunity offered, an idea of the purposes         to which
the minerals are applied, and of the processes employed by
artists in order to render them fit for the use of mankind.
    To return to the method which I have adopted in the
classification of minerals;      In the first place I resolved to
direct my steps, as far as I could, by chemical results.
Where, in fact, can we find relations more proper for closely
connecting various mineral substances with each other, than
those which are founded upon the existence of one identical
                                                       principle ?

             Introduction          to the Study        of Mineralogy.              399
principle?          Where can            we    find differences mor? striking,
between   the same substances, than those which depend upon
principles peculiar to each ? Now, when we classify the
substances       of one     and      the same
                                kingdom, we establish a
continued   comparison between them, according to the re
lations which connect and the differences which separate
them.       This comparison will therefore                      be   the   most exact,
and at the        time the most natural possible, and the
                 same
least arbitrary,        if the method chosen for establishing
                                                       it is
that which unveils to us the intimate composition and foun
dation of each substance, which teaches us what it is in it
self, rather than that which only shows us the outlines, or
perhaps the external effects.
   We may remark, before going further, that there are in
the present case two problems to solve. The first consists in
dividing and subdividing the collection of substances which
a system      should embrace, so that                   each      hold its true
                                                                 may
place.      This      is called classifying.             The second has for its
object the       furnishing of             easy   and convenient           methods for
characterizing each substance in such a manner that we may
ascertain     wherever
              it,         presents itself, and discover in the
                                    it
system the place which has been assigned to it.                            The solution
of   the first   of   these problem-*           is   the sole object at present.
     Let   us now examine what are the                       resources     presented   to
us    by   the present state of science, order to attain this ob
                                                        in
ject.       Among the minerals which in the common methods
compose the class of stones, there are several in which ana
lysis has demonstrated the presence of an acid combined
with    an earth.          Sucti     are      the calcareous         carbonate of the
modern chemists,   calcareous fluate, barytic sulphate, &c.
Other substances, such as the emerald, topaz, garnet, &e,
have only presented earths combined with each other, and
sometimes           with    an         We shall for
                                   alkali.               moment lay   a
aside these la-.t       substances, in order to speak of those which
Contain an acid in their composition.
   Here an important consideration presents itself relative to
the distribution of these compounds. The modern chemists',
in forming the table of the ivsuits of that new system *'hich
                                                                                 changed

  changed the face of science, by arranging in genera and
 species the acid substances, made choice of the acids for
 characterizing     the genera,   and distinguished the species ac-    \
 cording to the diversity of the bases united in succession
 with one and the same acid. This method of classifying
 seemed to be pointed out by the course         of their operations
 alone.    Oxygen being the acidifying principle, the common
 generator of the acids would become, by this kind of univer
 sality, the primitive substance, the different combinations
 of which with the different acidifiable bases we should first
 consider   :  and by a natural consequence,     the acids resulting
from    these combinations      would  become,    in their tur/i, the
 general   terms to which we should refer the classification        of
 the different and more compound substances of which they
 form part.       The activity and energy of those principles
 which    have so strong a tendency     to unite themselves with
 the earths, the alkalis,     and the metallic oxides, and seemed
 to rule over        combinations into which they entered, pre
                t^he
 sented a new      reason for assigning them the first place in
these very combinations in which they then formed the
principal part., But the mineralogist, whose object simply
is to apply the resuks of analysis to the works of Nature,
 sees things in another point of view, and is necessarily led
to choose the most fixed principles, as the common ties of
the different species which ought to concur to the formation
of genera.                     <U+2666>

    In  order to place this truth in its proper light, we may
remark that, among the metallic substances which form
one of the great divisions of the mineral kingdom, several
admit an acid into         their composition : hence it results in
the first place, that, by giving the first rank to the acids,
we could not avoid associating together in one and the same
genus, on the one hand, carbonate of lead with carbonate
of lime and barytes; on the other hand, the sulphate of
iron with the sulphate of lime and that of magnesia; and so
on with several other relations, in order to preserve the
unity of the genera.        Besides, by reasoning from combusti
bles, which frequently form part of the acids, as with these
                                                                acids

acids themselves, we should be forced to place together the'
sulphuret of iron, the sulphuret of lead, the sulphuret of
zinc, &c. This is not all : the oxygen which should have
determined the preeminence granted to the acids                 of which
it is the generator, would obtain it for itself for            a stronger
reason, relative to its combinations            with the metals, known
by the name of metallic oxides, which would still form a
single genus.        It would remain to mark these places of the
native metals in this distribution, and it seems that the only
part to take would       be to associate     them also in one and the
same genus.

LXX. A        new Method        for   detecting Arsenic.      By  Joseph
              Hume,       Esq., of Long Acre, London.
     To Mr. Tilloch,— Sir,
Jf ew    chemical tests are so interesting           as those which   dis
cover the presence of a poison, particularly that of arsenic.
It is not merely to the chemist or the mineralogist that such
assistance is advantageous, but it is often of the greatest
importance to the administration of public justice, where
the innocence or guilt of the accused depends frequently on
no other evidence than the existence of this most deleterious
substance.
   The methods principally            adopted     are  few, perhaps not
more than five     ;   and though       either of these, in many in
stances,    may   sufficiently answer the end, yet, when the
quantity of the arsenic is extremely minute, I fear these are
liable to objections, and the results mny be ambiguous.
   The    latest  observations on this subject are, probably,
those of doctor Bostock, .which were read before the Liver
pool Medical Society.            As I have not seen that gentleman's
paper, excepting merely so much as is detailed in the critical
analysis of books, published in the last number of "Medical
and Physical Journal," I am not aware of any new instruc
tions or cautions to render the usual methods more certain                ;
but the test which         I propose as a substitute, appears to be
more    efficacious,    in  as  much as it produces a more copious
   Vol. 33. No. 133. May 1809.                      Cc         precipitate

402                On the present Mode   of finding
precipitate from a given quantity of the arsenic ; the result in
all cases must, therefore, be nearer the truth, being more
evident to the senses.
    One experiment will sufficiently elucidate the plan I pur
sue.     Let one grain of white oxide of arsenic and the same
quantity of carbonate of soda be dissolved by boiling, in 10
or   12  ounces of distilled water, which ought to be done in
a glass vessel ; to this let a small quantity of the nitrate of
silver be added, and a bright yellow -precipitate will instantly
appear.      This is a more decisive test than sulphate of cop
per, which forms Scheele's green (arseniate of copper) ; and
though my process answers very well with potass or even
lime-water, yet I am inclined to prefer the common sub-
 carbonate of soda.       I remain, sir, your obedient servant,

      LXXI.     On (lie present Mode   of finding  the Rates  of
                 Timekeepers.    By a Correspondent.
 Of     all the requisites by which a seaman is enabled to con
duct his ship from one distant climate to another, no one
appears to be     of greater importance than an accurate     know
ledge    of the lime. The parliament of Great Britain, aware
of its necessity, have, for the last century, offered a large
reward to any person who may contrive a machine, that will
keep time within certain limits of error during a long voyage.
 So anxiously has this been desired by that part of the nation
who have any interest in its commercial or maritime con
 cerns, and so great has been the honour awaiting the per
 son who shall produce this desideratum, joined to the in
 citement naturally arising from the hope of obtaining a large
 reward, that many ingenious watchmakers and mechanics,
both at home and abroad, have exhausted their utmost skill
in the endeavour to bring it to perfection.          Although they
have     hitherto found this impracticable, yet by the repeated
attempts, and successive improvements of various hands,
such an approximation        to the truth has been, attained, as
                                                             reflects

                      the Rates    of Timekeepers.                   403
  reflects  great credit on their ingenuity;      and it would be un
 just not   to allow them this tribute     of praise,    when, for want
  of reaching precisely    to the point required, they are deprived
 of    those advantages,    and   remunerations      for their trouble,
 which would in that        case so  justly  become    their due.   Too
 frequently indeed does it happen in this country, that the
 most useful and ingenious mechanics, who have been re
 duced to indigence by attending perhaps to contrivances for
 the general good,     rather than to their interest      by labouring
 in   the old beaten track,    are  suffered   to   pine in want and
 languish in distress ; whilst pretenders and quacks have risen
 to affluence, basking in the sunshine of favour, although
 deluding the public with one hand, and picking their poc
 kets with the other.
     Few persons who have read the marquis of Worcester's
 Century of Inventions, and know the fate of his machines,
 have not regretted,     that no attention was paid to his peti
 tion, for pecuniary assistance to enable him to complete
 these inventions, and publish them for the general benefit
 of mankind     ; more especially, as we are now convinced from
 the circumstance of many of them having been reinvented,
 that they were not the idle fancies of        a  lively   imagination,
 but that they were realities, which            he had actually con
 structed and applied to practice.        Indeed at present, there is
 not    any one department     of the abstruse sciences, which can
 boast    of receiving that encouragement or support, which,
 from its value to a commercial nation like Great Britain, it
 has a right to expect.
     It  may appear rather extraordinary at this enlightened pe
 riod,    when so many improvements have been made in in
struments,      and  so great    a degree    of accuracy attained in
 practical astronomy,      that the present mode        of ascertaining
and applying the rate of a timekeeper, practised in our fixed
 observations, should be called in question : and although I
have looked over most        of  the   publications on this subject,
yet    I am not aware    of  any arguments by which it can be
justified.
    The object intended by obtaining a rate, is to predict how
 far from truth the chronometer will be at the end of a given
                                   C  c 2                         time ;

seem,        that in all the            trials hitherto made          of   timekeepers         in
fixed observations, this object has only been partially pur
sued   whilst another of equal importance has been alto

pened, that the rate has been obtained   the coldest part of     in
winter, when metals are most contracted, and applied to
the hottest part of summer when they are most dilated,
without any correction for the unavoidable defect of exact
compensation       or that the rate has been found in
                        ;                                                                a    very

                          the Rates   of Timekeepers.                         405
months or more, it has been the general practice to com
pute forward with the   first month's rate, (no matter what
time of the year, or in what temperature it has been taken,)
and to compare this computed error with the actual error
shown by the watch, at the end of each succeeding month
that it continued under trial.            Now it           is evident, that unless
the timekeeper could be accurately compensated for the effects
of heat and cold, which is seldom the case, there must arise
a very material difference between these two rates, when any
change     hasoccurred  in the temperature ; and that a very
small defect in the compensation must produee a very large
deviation from the computed rate, by placing the watch to go
in a different temperature, whether considerably warmer or
colder, than that in which the first month's rate was found.
Hence, if it should so happen, that the month's rate on which
this computed error is founded, has been taken in January,
when the thermometer was at 30° ; then in July, when it is at
80°, the error in some cases becomes                     immense, but in most
cases   of too   great consequence to be altogether neglected.                In
deed, let this be taken in any part            of the
                                      year, there is a great
probability against its having been taken in that month,
wherein the mean temperature occurred, of that season during
which the watch continued there for trial. On the contrary, if
the change of rate arising from the alteration of temperature
be taken into account, and applied with the computed rate,
an essential defect in the going of watches will thereby be
obviated, and they will be found to have gone considerably
nearer than people now believe they have.
  Some of the best makers of chronometers, at the time of
delivering them to the purchasers, have told them, how
much the daily rate would vary between the heat of summer
and the cold of winter.  Although this is but a vague sort
of statement,       yet    I   believe few     seamen,         who   know how,
                                        of

occasions where they could. But                         has met with a  very dif
ferent fate in our observatories, and has not only not been
applied, but has been condemned, and declared improper
to be admitted there.   Indeed, we have one publication ex
tant, wherein      it expressly asserted, that as the act of
                          is
                                      Cc   3                          parliament

    400                  On the present Mode   offinding
    parliament makes no mention of the rate, therefore the al
    lowance of a rate is an indulgence ; and that the commis
    sioners might require the maker to adjust the watch, so as
    to keep mean time accurately. With as great propriety
    might it be said, that the placing a glass over the face to
    view the hands and figures is an indulgence ; or that to make
    the balance of two or more metals is an indulgence ; or that
    the watchmaker having the power of choosing his own
-   escapement                    or iastly, that the astronomer
                    is an indulgence;
    being allowed to take the moon's place from the Nautical
    Almanack, instead of computing it with proper data and
    La Place's equations,    is an indulgence.     The act prescribes
    no  definite means by which     the object is to be attained, but
    leaves the artist entirely to his own choice: it cannot there
    fore but appear extraordinary, that the act should be thus*
    construed, to the exclusion of the most essential part of the
    principle on which the method is founded.
       Those who are acquainted with the adjustment of the
    balances of timekeepers know, that it is almost an impossi
    bility   to bring them precisely to that minute point         of   exact*
    ness, by which alone they keep accurately with mean time :
    and the difficulty of adjusting the balances for the effects of
    heat and cold, so that they shall never vary with the greatest
    extremes       of either, would    be at least as difficult to accom
    plish.    But the former is attended with no other trouble to
    the practical navigator, than merely requiring the aid of a
    Jittle calculation to allow for the deviation.    It would be
    precisely the same with the allowance for the effect of the
    alteration of temperature : and it cannot therefore but appear
    extraordinary, that any objection should be made against
    applying this correction, when, by means of             it,
                                                       so much
    greater dependence   can be placed on the time shown    the        by
    machine.        Art has always lent her friendly aid to science,
    and science      should return the kindness.   Little can be ex
    pected    in   the       of the longitude
                          progress                 either of them
                                                      by
    separately  ; but when they cordially unite their efforts, what
    is there that they cannot subdue       ?
         Nothing would        tend more powerfully   to advance    the in
    terest   of our own countrymen,        than the establishment        of   a
                                                                       public

                     the Rates     of Timekeepers.                 407
 public observatory, for trying timekeepers and keeping their
 rates; to which every maker of them, if he thought proper,
 might have access at stated hours, and he allowed always to
 keep there a certain limited number of pieces.              Here he
 could try the effect of improvements, and gain experience
 thereby ; then    alter, and try again, until he succeeded to
 his mind   : an advantage       which he could not perhaps en
joy in  his own house,       for want of instruments of sufficient
 accuracy, and leisure to make the necessary computations.
    A book containing the rate of each timekeeper belonging
 to each person might be kept, always ready for the use of
the owner, and,      if  he thought proper, for the inspection      of
the public at large ; by which,        he would be enabled    to fix a
price on the machine, proportioned to the excellence of its
going^and avoid all suspicion of partiality in giving the rate
of his piece to the purchaser.
    From this place, captains of ships or others might always
be furnished    with timekeepers, suitable to the price they
could afford, or adapted, with respect to accuracy of going,
for the purpose they might be required to execute.
   In short, so many advantages would evidently be derived*
to the makers, and the public, by an institution of this kind,
which could not fail to bring forward deserving merit as a
claimant on public favour, that I am surprised the watch
makers have not established one at their own expense, by
subscription,   as  the    amount of it when divided between         a
number of proprietors would not be an object to each indi
vidual.
   There   are many       situations   near  London   that  are   well
adapted for the    purpose     ; the  instruments  necessary    for it *
would not be expensive; and a steady careful person, capa
ble by his scientific knowledge of conducting it with ability,
might no doubt be found, who, considering it as an amuse
ment rather than       a labour, would be moderate in his terms
for the discharge    of   a duty, which must evidently be bene
ficial both to the venders and the purchasers        of  these useful
and necessary machines.

]V1ay 4. — A     paper was read on the triple sulphuret           of lead,
copper, and antimony,         discovered by count Bournon in
Cornwall. Mr. Jamtson         proposed     to call this mineral Bour-
nonite  ; but the count,    in this additional memoir,           in which
he corrects the mistakes he made respecting the figure of its
crystals in a former paper, prefers the name of the place
where it was found.       The integral molecule of this mineral
he has determined not to be a perfect cube, as at first con
cluded, but having dissimilar sides in the proportion of 3 to
5. The count, in answer to a paper of Mr. Smithson in the
Philosophical Transactions, defends the existence, not only
of binary but also of ternary and quaternary compounds,
and proves that the mineral in question is an example of the
latter combination,     a quaternary sulphuret. As an instance
of  the very singular difference     in minerals in consequence of
this variety of   combination, the count refers to the anhy
drous sulphat of lime, which is so very different from com
mon gypsum, although composed of the same materials
with the addition only of a little water.
   May    10. — A    paper    by   Mr. Home, on            the    Squalus
maximus, was read,       stating some particulars of the dimen
sions and conformation of the different basking sharks which
have been thrown on the coast of Britain in the course of
the last year.    The author considers this        species   of shark    as
occupying     an  intermediate     place     between the mammalia
(whales) and fishes, and partaking of the characters of              both.
   May 18. — Capt. Burney stated to the Society some                  more
particulars respecting the floating of heavy bodies in a
stream, and the nature of their moving faster than the cur
rent.    He  seemed to consider the cause         of all   such    motion
to he owing to the pressure       of  the atmosphere.
   Mr. Cavendish laid a paper before the Society on the me
thods of dividing mathematical instruments, in which he
proposed to substitute a balance compass and microscope for
Mr. Troughton's cylindrical ruler.           The plan    was   illustrated
by  a drawing of the instrument,         which effected the purpose
                                                                  without

always involve errors.
    A part of a letter from        Dr. Henry   to  Mr. Davy, on ox
ygen of ammonia when exposed to electrization, was read.
By some recent experiments Dr. H. has ascertained, that in
decomposing the ammonia, some oxygen was admitted in.
the process, and that consequently what was found as the
result of his former experiments was not derived from the
ammonia by electrization, but from the agents employed.
The final result, however, of his experiments proved that
ammonia, as Mr. Davy originally concluded, is composed                   i
of oxygen, hydrogen,           and nitrogen.
    The Society then adjourned over one Thursday on account
of  the holidays.

    At a late meeting of this Society, a communication from
Mr. R. Porrett jun. was read, announcing that he suc
ceeded in obtaining prussous (or sub-prussic) acid — an acid
differing from prussic,       as sulphurous does from sulphuricacid,
by containing      less oxygen.       It is a most delicate test of the
presence of silver in solution,        and has the singular property
of precipitating       iron    of a  red colour.    It has completely
 proved   the   presence     of oxygen in prussic      acid ; as by de-
 oxygenating the       latter it becomes prussous acid ; and on
adding oxygen,       it  is again capable of affording a blue preci
 pitate of iron.
    A  new process for hardening the surface of casts in plais-
 ter of Paris, has been communicated to the same Society.
 It consists in boiling the cast in a solution of one pound of
 alum in   a  pint of water for 15 minutes, and then suffering
it to dry gradually for about a month ; in this way the cast
 acquires a very considerable degree of hardness upon its sur
 face, and    is even capable of receiving a polish by friction,
 so as to resemble white marble ; and the surface of it may
 be cleaned    from     time to lime, without      the   least injury to
 the sharpness    of the    cast.

    At the meeting of this Society on the 8th of April, there
 was read the first part of a Description of the Mineral Strata

  distinct   plan or section of those strata, done from actual
  survey, and from the register of the borings and workings
  for coal in Mr. Erskine of Mar's estate in that district;
 communicated         by Mr. Robert Bald, civil engineer, Alloa.
  In this first part Mr. Bald treated only of the alluvial strata.
 In continuing the subject, he is to illustrate it still further
 by exhibiting specimens of the rocks themselves.
     Mr. Charles Stewart laid before the Society a list of insects
 found by him in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, with in
 troductory remarks on the study of entomology.              It would
 appear    that  the  neighbourhood    of  Edinburgh  affords  no very
 peculiar insects, and but few rare ones. The list contained
 about 400 species ; which, Mr. Stewart stated, must be
 considered     as the  most common,       as they were collected in
 the course of two seasons only, and without very favourable
 opportunities.       It was produced (he added) merely as an
 incitement to younger and more zealous entomologists.
    At this meeting there      were laid on the Society's table    the
 first two volumes 4to, with       a volume of figures, of Comte
 de Bournon's        System    of Mineralogy ; presented by the
 author.
    At   a meeting of this Society on the 13th of May, the
 second part of Mr. Bald's interesting mineralogical descrip
 tion of Clackmananshire was read, giving a particular ac
 count of two very remarkable slips or shifts in the strata,
 near 1000 feet in depth, and by means df which the main
 coal field of the country is divided into three fields, on all
of which extensive collieries have been erected.
    The Rev. Mr. Fleming, of Bressay, laid before the So
ciety an outline of the Flora of Linlithgowshire, specifying
only such plants as are omitted by             Mr. Lightfoot, or are
maiked as uncommon by Dr. Smith.                This, he stated, was
to be considered as the first     of  a   series of communications
illustrative   of  the natural history  of his native country.
    Mr. P. Walker       stated a curious fact in the history   of the
common eel.        A  number of eels, old and young, were       found
in  a  subterranean pool at the bottom of an old quarry,        which
                                                                   had

in June 1808.
   And he produced         a list of about     100 herbaceous    plants,

growing    there   ;  communicated        by  Mr. G. Don, of Forfar,

nimously     at   a   meeting    of  the  Society,  which was held on
the 5th instant, in consequence of a special requisition ; and
which was attended by a greater number of members than
had ever been assembled on any former occasion : consistently
with the spirit of them, Mr. Henry was re-instated                in the

            STONYHURST SCIENTIFIC ESTABLISHMENT.
     When the French        entered Liege, the gentlemen of the
  seminary at that place were forced to make a precipitate re
 treat, abandoning a large establishment, together with a
 valuable library and a fine collection of mathematical instru
 ments. Having since found an asylum in this country, they
 have formed an establishment at Stonyhurst, where they are
 making a laudable, attempt to introduce the sciences, in their
 improved state, into their common course of education. As
 a first step, a handsome room for a library and another for
 mathematical apparatus have been built, to which it is in
 tended to add a chemical laboratory as soon as possible.
    As   the arrangements     of the building appear to us to unite
 much in     a small space,   we are happy in being enabled to
 present our readers with an engraving oft the ground plan,
 (see Plate XII.)
                      which may prove useful to those who pro
ject similar establishments.
    It is not doubted that the gentlemen         at Stonyhurst    will
 not only     be soon enabled      to finish the   erection of their
 building, but to procure the books and instruments neces
 sary to the perfecting of their undertaking

LXXlV.           Thoughts on Atmospheric                  Density    and Pressure.
                By Thomas        Charlton                Sfeee, Esq.
   To Mr. Tilloch, — Sir,
-^Notwithstanding the wide                       field    of inquiry which the
mechanical history           of the atmosphere               presents     to us, and
notwithstanding         interest which such inquiry must na
                        the
turally excite in a philosophic mind, yet we must confess,
our labours in it have been but partial, and our knowledge
of it   is but limited        :— the attention of           men     of    science   has
(comparatively speaking)                 been mostly        confined to its che
mical history, probably from its more immediate connection
with, and relation to, practical and useful results. On the
former subject, therefore, I beg to offer some ideas which
have suggested themselves                to me, and which relate to one              of
its principal (though I think least understood)                          properties.
   Unaided by the lights of natural philosophy                           or the force
of experiment,        it scarcely        comes within the limits of human
conception,                     inodorous aeriform mass of
                   that that invisible
fluid surrounding our ajobe should at all be subiect to the
laws or possess the properties of matter; but particularly
that it should possess either density, weight, or pressure.
   These three properties of atmospheric air, viz., density,
weight, and pressure, are often misunderstood, and gene
rally confounded with each other, particularly the two
former.   Now we well know that attraction of cohesion and
attraction of gravitation sensibly differ from each other ; if
not, platina would be the hardest, and the diamond the
heaviest, bodies in nature.     We know that their action is
quite different, that of the one being inversely as the squares of
the distances, that of the other increasing at a much quicker
rate as bodies approach, the smaller the distance the greater
its power.   By the word density therefore, (which in parti
cular seems often misapplied, and misunderstood,) I mean,
strictlv speaking, impermeability, or that power in a body
by which it is enabled to resist or obstruct (more or less) the
passage of other bodies through       and which may be esti
                                                  it?
mated      by   the greater or less difficulty with which such re
sistance    or obstruction       conquered. .Now this imperme-
                                is
  Vol. 33. No.        134.    June       1809.                Dd               ability

i id            On Atmospheric Density and Pressure.
ability in a body must arise not only from the closeness
with which its integrant parts are connected, but also from
the weight of these parts, ahd consequently the difficulty of
removing them ; so that, in other words, density, I think,
may be defined, that power resulting           from   the union  of the
attraction of cohesion and gravitation.
     That the atmosphere is possessed          of this power is well
 known      :— -take  two bodies of different weights but equal
 bulks, drop them from the same height, it will be found
that the differences of their velocity in descent will be di
 rectly as the differences of their weights, and as the dif
 ferences of the times of their descent, and that consequently
 the spaces of atmosphere descended are directly as the squares
 of the times, and as the squares of their velocity in falling.
 To this it may be answered, that gravity is the sole cause,
 and that the air has no effect whatever          : however, that this
 is not the case is well known by the old experiment of a
 feather and guinea falling alike in the exhausted receiver of
 an   air-pump.       Hence,    were it not for the greater or less re
 sistance or impermeability of the atmosphere, the force of
  gravitation would be equal in bodies ; their absolute gravity
  depends,      more or less,   on the density of the atmosphere,
  pot the latter on the former.
      Now it     is obvious that   this power can     only exist where
  there    are particles or molecules       (see Boscovicb) : it must
  depend on the disposition of those particles, and even on
  the particles of those particles to the ultimate one, viz., on
  their size, their shape, form, &c, and their degree of
  aggregation and consequent distance from each other.               At
  mospheric air, therefore, must have its particles or mole
  cules, (though completely imperceptible to our organs of
  sensation,) certainly, from its great permeability, its yielding
  to the slightest impression,        and affording little or no resist
  ance     to the insinuation      of  bodies  denser  between   the in
   terstices   of its particles : this power in atmospheric air may
   almost be said to be at its minimum.
      This permeability in atmospheric air arises, it is supposed,
   from the very slight aggregation of its particles, and conse
   quently their small quantity and great distance from each
                                            v"                  other : —

                  On Atmospheric Density and Pressure.                  419
   Other   : — however, this may not         be the case ; it (the atmo
   sphere)     may contain     many particles, and these particles
   closely approximated together by a strong cohesive force ;
   but this permeability may arise from their extreme minute
   ness and want of gravity, from their spherical form, (their
   angles    being blunted off by friction,) and their thus sliding
   through, among, and under each other, yielding to, and
   being impelled by every motion communicated.                 Indeed the
   latter hypothesis, I think, seems the more probable. How
   ever, from whatever cause it is, a degree of tenuity or
  permeability arises which scarcely any other body possesses,
   and which may be estimated             by the velocity with which
   heat, light and sound travel through it.
      Atmospheric density is generally confounded with atmo
   spheric pressure, though distinct from each other; the one
  is a property it possesses in common with all other bodies,
   the other is peculiar to itself alone.            In the one there ap
   pears  an   inherent  and  self-existent    direction  of the particles,
  and this direction seems positive and determinate; in the
  other there appears no direction but what is given by exter
  nal and accidental causes, and therefore quite vague and
  indeterminate, and only what is possessed by all matter.
. Atmospheric       pressure may be shown in various           ways, per
  haps    one    of the   simplest   is thus   : — invert over  a bason  of
   water,    a tumbler   previously exhausted of its air; the water
  of   the bason    will  ascend in the tumbler much higher (ac
  cording to the dimensions of its column) than its level in
  the bason, — being pressed down by the external atmosphere,               '
  its particles are forced to cohere closer together, until the
  force of pressure is withdrawn ; they then recede from each
  other, the interstices between them are increased, and thus
  taking up a greater space, they consequently ascend, being
  prevented by the sides of the tumbler from expanding la
  terally.
      Now surely it is inconceivable         that a body weighing     only
  |he eight or nine hundredth part that of another, could pos
  sess the power of raising it up, and consequently forcing it
  to assume a contrary direction to that gravitating one which
  it, though in     so slight a degree,     possesses   in common with
                                    D   d 2                          other

other bodies, were it not for a self-impelling self-existing
force in the atmosphere. For instance, were the experiment
tried undi-r     a   fluid   still heavier   than air, but lighter than
water (oil for example), in a vacuum, Quere,                     Will not the
water remain level inside and outside ?
    Hence we must argue, that pressure is distinct from den
sity, self-existing in the atmosphere, and in that alone;
nor even do they always act directly of each other, particu
larly in the upper regions of the atmosphere. (See Bouguer'a
Travels &c. in the Andes.)                However, although they do
not appear       to   be one and        the same power, yet they seem
intimately connected, and to act directly with each other,
and what affects the one affects the other.
    Galilei  was the      first discoverer of atmospheric pressure,
by observing       that  fluids   rose to a certain height in a vacuum,
which had formerly been accounted for by the old idea of
"   Nature abhorring a vacuum."
    Torricelli,     his pupil, completed the discovery*, observing
 that the atmosphere pressed equally on all bodies at the
 earth's surface, and in proportion to their densities ; viz.,
 more on    a  fluid than     a  solid, and more on       a gas than     either   :
 and as fluids      are  of different densities,       and the only bodies
 susceptible of being acted on by this pressure, from the
 slight cohesion and consequent motion of their parts, he
 naturally conceived that the rarer the fluid the higher it
 would rise in a vacuum, and vice versa.
     Thus,   he first found that water, at the medium tempera
 ture of the atmosphere, would ascend about 32 feet, con
 sidering this the rarest fluid, which height or column of 32
 feet  was    consequently an equipoise to            a  column       as high as
 the atmosphere: — calculating             the comparative           densities of
 fluids,  he conceived that one twice as dense as water would
 ascend   half   as high, and so on, the density of the fluid being
 inversely   m    the height of its ascent.        Then, considering the
 comparative density of water, the rarest, with that of mer
 cury, the densest fluid known, he found it to be 14* 1 ; con-
    • After Torricelli, Pascal brought this discovery  to still further perfection,
 and made   many important additions, particularly     by liis celebrated experi
 ments ou the Puy de Dome.
                                                                       sequently

                On Atmospheric Density and Pressure*                     421
sequently he concluded that the mercury would rise -JTth the
height of the water : this he found exactly to answer. He
filled a glass tube about three feet long, closed at one end and
exhausted      of   its air, and inverted it into a bason       of mercury ;
the mercury rose 29 inches,          = -^th the height of the column
of water ; the remaining part of the tube was of course a
vacuum (the Torricellian vacuum).
    This mercurial column 29 inches high, is therefore equal
to a column of the atmosphere extending from its summit
to the earth.
    The atmosphere          presses equally on all bodies at the surface
of   the earth, or equally distant from it.
    This    pressure      decreases in a direct ratio      (generally) with
its distance upwards from the earth's surface, (the atmo
spheric column being shortened,) or rather from the level of
the sea, it being the only natural uniform level from whence
such indications           are deducible.      Hence     it follows, that it
increases     directly with its distance downwards from such
level  —  (the atmospheric column being lengthened)
                                                                   — so that
in pits the pressure must (comparatively speaking) be at its
maximum: of this, however,                I   believe   we have no direct
proofs.
    Thus    the atmosphere may be            said   to  constitute   a mass
consisting of strata lying on        each other, each stratum pressing
on the one next it with not only its own individual weight,
but with that collected weight with which it is pressed from
above, so that the lower stratum has the whole superjacent
pressure     as   it   were    on its back, and with it presses          the
earth.
    Hence (supposing the ratio to be direct), if heights in the
atmosphere be taken in arithmetical proportion, its rarity
 (from want of pressure) will be in geometrical progression :
thus,    at 7 miles        above  the earth it is 4 times rarer, at 14
miles it is        16   times rarer, at 21 miles it is 64 times rarer,
and so on, the rarity increasing            in proportion     to the  height
as  4-1.
    This principle of         the  atmosphere decreasing in pressure
as we ascend,         and this decrease      being    (generally)   equable,

has been most happily applied in the estimation                      of altitudes
(particularly those of mountains) by the Torricellian tube, or,
as it is more commonly called, the barometer *.      The mer*-
curial column decreasing as we ascend, the column of air
decreasing in height, and of course decreasing in its ability
to support the former; at that height therefore at which the
mercury would no more rise but remain in its bed, the pres
sure must either be at its               limits, or too slight        to raise so
dense a      body   as    mercury    :   but if   a rarer fluid were employed
at this height,          the force   of
                                     pressure might still perhaps sen
sibly      act on it until      that period, when, from the want of
both density and pressure         in the air, its particles could no
longer keep         together, and a vacuum must ensue : indeed
this I think          possible) the only true mode of ascertaining
                    (if
the height of the atmosphere, because where there                        is   atmo
sphere there will be pressure also.
   However, the barometer does not appear calculated for
estimating great heights in the atmosphere, because there, as
was said before, its decrease of density does not often keep
pace with its decrease          of   pressure or gravity, as appears from
the observations of Bouguer and, Don Ulloa, &c. on the
Andes, the upper regions being (from various causes) not
subject to the same laws as the lower ones.  Hence, as in
the common indications of barometer, the pressure, weight,
                                         a
and density are more or less connected with each other,
though in reality, and strictly speaking, distinct. as before
mentioned:   consequently the equability of its ascension
must, at these high regions, be considerably diminished,
from these three powers being more or less at variance with
each other, and therefore its indications must be erroneous.
If the ratio of the mercury's descent for our ascent were
known,  and was equable, the barometer might ascertain any
height, and   we might easily know that at which     would               it
remain at its level.
      In   the lower regions         (the     heights of mountains for             in
stance) the mercury,             it      is   said, generally falls an inch

 for  850 or 900 feet at a          medium*: if this ratio held good
altogether, the mercury must remain in its bed at the height
of 27000 feet.
    As    a square     inch    column      of mercury     30    inches     high
 (which various observations and experiments have proved to
be the medium pressure in those countries, or others situated
in or near their latitudes,) weighs about 15lbs., so the at
mosphere must press with a weight equal to 1 Albs, on every
square inch, or       1 80lbs.  on each square foot: calculating thus,
the whole         superincumbent pressure of the atmosphere
amounts to 12,O43,448,800,00O,o00,o00lbs.t                        Reckoning
the surface      of a man's body        to be about 14 square feet,          he
sustains    a pressure      (calculating thus)     of  11  tons   2  hundred
weight ISilbs.
    It may be wondered how man could bear such a weight
on his body and not be crushed. On the contrary, this pres
sure is indispensably necessary to our existence, and two
reasons concur in preventing its being felt troublesome                  :  1st,
its being so equal all over our bodies as not to move their,
fibres; 2dly, the caloric generally evolving from hence
counteracts and renders it less sensible.             Besides, sensations
we    have    been    accustomed to from our birth do not much
annoy us, and it is probably this pressure that occasions the
cries of the new-born babe.
    Atmospheric pressure is necessary to our existence. In
ascending into the air, we might suppose our sensations
would be more agreeable by being loosed as it were from a
heavy load      :  yet the contrary       is the fact; the blood of our
internal vessels        not being pressed down, bursts and over
flows its barriers, insomuch as sometimes to endanger death.
    These sensations are always perceived in ascending con
siderable heights       : spitting of blood, and bleeding at the nose
and eyes,     a   drowsiness, listless apathy, and iucxertion are

this pressure, though apparently such load on us, should a
be absolutely necessary to our lives,   keeping our bloodby
within its proper limits, making its particles retain their
proper cohesion, and thus giving the pulse, heart, &c, that
uniform gradation of beating in which the vital principle
consists.
   Atmospheric pressure varies considerably, (as was before
observed,) particularly in the upper regions, and these varia
tions appear to increase as we ascend into them because the              ;
decrease     of density not keeping                  pace     with       the       decrease

                                     high regions,                            be sudden
condensations and rarefactions, which must divert from their
direction the pressing down particles of the atmosphere, and
drive them        laterally and otherwise,            8ec.     Hence the secon
dary cause that affects these variations                 is   the winds        :   on this
account these variations are greatest        poles, and de

necessary     to produce the conversion          of  a liquid     into a gas
 (or evaporation) must depend on the pressure of                the air: the
greater the pressure, the greater the heat necessary from its
greater resistance to its escape, and vice versa.
   Thus, in the application of a              heat   (nearly boiling)     to a
fluid, its particles being rendered           so rare and minute acquire
a disposition to ascend, from want              of gravity. In this dis
position to ascend they come into contact with the particles
of the air pressing downwards, and are thrown down again,
their force of ascent        being inferior to the force          of descent
possessed by the atmospheric particles.                The body is there
fore still kept liquid in this degree of heat: if, however, it
is increased a little further, the particles are forced to rise
up and conquer the force           of pressure,     and thus evaporation
takes place.
   In   this    state  then    a   body is balanced between             three
powers, two of which may be said to be quiescent, and the
third divellent; if the united sum of the quiescent forces,
pressure and cohesion, amounts to more than the divellent
caloric,   its liquidity remains;        if less,   evaporation ensues.
   Then, in     a case  of evaporation,      to know    the force or power
with which it takes place, add            the sums       of the quiescent
powers, cohesion and pressure, (numerically expressed,) de
duct their united amount from the sum of the divellent ca
loric, and     the   remainder will be the sum required.               Thus,
suppose a body possessed with the three powers so, the qui
escent A and B, and the divellent C, thus A with the force
of 6, B with         the force    of  2,  and    C with    the force   of  10,
then we have        A6    + B    2  =  8 —    C  10  = 2,   the force with
which the body evaporates.              If the forces are equal, and
that there is no remainder, the body of course will remain
as it is.
   On   the other hand,       in the reconversion         of   a gas into a
liquid    (or condensation)        where    the  powers    are  reversed, to
know the force        with   which     the    body condenses, subtract
the quiescent caloric from the united sum of the divellents,
pressure and cohesion, the remainder is the sum required.
Thus, suppose a body with the powers to C, caloric with
the force of 6, B pressure with the force of 8, and A cohesion
                                                                         with

 426                            On Geometrical Proportion                   .
 with that of 2, then we have C 6 — B8 + A 2 = 10 =x 4.
 The body therefore condenses with the force of 4. Thus
 then, by numerical expression, we find the conversion of
 liquids into gases, and vice versa; and hence this conversion
 depends   more or less on atmospheric pressure.
    Although the force of pressure is too slight to affect solids,
 yet crystallization is in a certain degree dependent on it ; the
 cohesive power in the liquid would not be sufficient of itself.
    Henee, though the points of condensation and evapora
 tion are established at certain standards, it is merely because
 the pressure              is similarly      established        at a certain                standard
 point (30 inches).    The boiling point of water at this pres
 sure is 212°.   On the tops of mountains a much less degree
 of heat will suffice*, and in an exhausted receiver it will
boil at 70°.
        On            when the pressure is increase^ (in pits
             the contrary,
or mines), a greater heat is of course required, and by arti
ficial pressure water may almost sustain any heat without
evaporating f. The exact ratio of the decrease of heat for
the decrease of pressure, or the increase of heat for the in
crease       of      in the process- of ebullition in water or
                   pressure,
other fluids, has not, I believe, been hitherto determined.

The    doctrine of proportion is well known to be of so much

which authors      have defined the word proportion : thus, it is
frequently    confounded     with the words ratio, reason, ana
logy, Sec., and sometimes two, sometimes three, and some
times four quantities are said to be proportional. This mode
of procedure creates a good deal of confusion, and not a
little embarrasses    the ideas of beginners ; and it is to obviate,
in some     measure, these irregularities, that I now send you
the following short disquisition on this interesting branch
of science. I must observe further, that the manner which
 is generally practised by authors of treating the subject geo-
 metricallv, as is done in Euclid's Elements, and most of
 the modern books of geometry, is certainly not the most
 eligible, or best adapted to learners ; and, except the few
 trifling observations which may be met with in books of
 arithmetic, it is to books of.geometry alone to which a learner
  can have recourse for any information he may require.
     To prove that what I have advanced concerning the ob
  scurity of the subject, when treated geometrically, is cor
  rect, I need only appeal to those gentlemen who are in the
  practice of teaching the fifth book of the Elements ; it is
  well known that the difficulties attending it are so great,
  that very few students ever thoroughly understand his demon
  strations, owing most probably to their not being able to
  form   a correct idea of his criterion  of proportion. Again,
  "  Ordinary language (as      Professor Playfair observes) con
  veys the ideas of the different operations supposed to be per
  formed by these demonstrations so slowly, and breaks them
  down into so many parts, that they make not a sufficient
  impression on the understanding ; and this generally happens
  when the things treated of are not represented to the senses
  by diagrams, as they cannot be when we reason concerning
  magnitudes in general, as in this part of the elements of ge
   ometry.    It is obvious, therefore, that we ought to adopt
   the language of arithmetic, or algebra, which by its short
  ness, and the rapidity with which it places objects before us,
   makes up for its being a conventional language; and also for
   using symbols to denote the things we wish them to express."
      The first ideas  of proportion which   we generally acquire,
   are obtained by comparing natural objects with one another:
                                                                thus,

428                         On Geometrical Proportion.
thus,       we say one thing                  is    twice, thrice,          &c, as          large as
another, or one thing will                     cost twice, thrice,
                                                    as much                   &c,
as another : but, as our ideas expand, we wisih lo compare
all kinds of magnitudes as exactly as possible ; and then it
is that a more ample view of the subject becomes necessary.
Arithmetic instructs               us how to compare any two quantities
with each other, so                as to      determine the relation which sub
sists between         them     :       this is the first notion                      which we ac
quire of proportion,                    and        it is the foundation               upon which
we must raise our future reasonings : this comparison of any
two quantities may be called a ratio, and hence we have the
following
                —
   Definition I. The word ratio signifies the relation
which subsists between two quantities with respect to their
magnitudes.    One of the quantities thus compared is called
the antecedent, the other the consequent of the ratio, and they
are sometimes expressed by placing two points between them,
or more frequently by writing them in the form of a frac-
tion   :   thus,    3 :   4, or    -,
                                   3
                                         is the manner in which we generally
designate         the ratio   of       3 to   4, and a         :    b, or
                                                                            ^,        denotes        the
ratio of a to b.
  The ratio of             6 to 12,
                                                    6
                                            or — , is the same
                                                                                3
                                                                             as -r ,     or     as   -;
                                                                                                     I
hence it is plain that the terms of a ratio may vary, and the
ratio still continue the same :      therefore, the terms of
                                                        if,                                           a

                                                                                 bo

                                                                             711
same ratio.
  Jt       will now       be very easy to define the word proportion.
                  — Four quantities are proportional when the
   Definition II.
ratio between the first and second      the same as the ratio  is
between the third and fourth     and, in general, any number
                                                    ;
of quantities are in the same proportion when they are com
posed       of   equal ratios.
  Thus four quantities,                       a,    I,    c,   d,    are    in   the same        pro
                                                                                            portion

                                      On Geometrical Proportion,                                                         42$

d,      e,f, &c,             have the same proportion                                 when        j=           ^

    Hence we have a criterion by which proportional quan
tities may easily be distinguished, viz. an equality of ratios i
and this being understood, the whole doctrine of proportion
flows immediately from the above obvious principles.
        Four proportional quantities                                       are commonly                   expressed       by
saying that a is to b as c to d, and they are usually written
thus, a         :   I : : c : d ; where bund c are called                                         the mean terms,
and a and d the extremes ; also a and                                                     c are       called antece
dents, and     and d their consequents. The subject is further
                         b
illustrated in the following articles :
    Article I. — When four quantities are proportional, the
product of the two means is equal to the product of the two

extremes.                    For since, by hypothesis,                                j. — -j, multiply                  both
sides       of the equation by                            bd, and we have                         =

        Also, conversely,                  if the product of any two quantities be
equal to the product                       of two others, the four quantities are
proportional.                         For, since ad = be, divide by bd, and we

 LXXVI. A few             Hints concerning      the Benefit      that may        be
                 eocpecled   from   the Nature    of  Coal Gas.
       To Mr. Tilloch, — Sir,
The       gas    which    is obtained when coal is distilled            in close
vessels having lately attracted            the attention of the public,
 chiefly on account            of  its   application for the production
of artificial light, has encouraged me to lay before your
readers a few observations concerning this subject, which
bids fair to be ranked among the most beneficial applica
tions of chemical science to the useful purposes of so
ciety. . I will leave it to your judgement to abridge of these
lines, or to cancel, whatever you deem unworthy of notice,
to make room in your journal for more valuable subjects
                                                                              you

                    from     the Nature     of Coal   Gas.                 433
 you may have received            from other quarters.        The brilliancy
 or  the    light which       is   produced uui ng the combustion of
 coul gas, is so superior in splendour and beaut , that it sur
 passes not only wax caudles and the best spermaceti oil,
 but every     other substance hitherto            employed for artificial
 illumination.       The coke obtained in            the   same process       is
 so valuable,      that   it appears    inexplicable     that   men     should
 not aiail themselves        of this mode of procuring light, to the
almost total exclusion of all other methods now in use.                      As
a landholder, placed among an industrious but wholly il
literate society of men, 1 have had the more opportunity
of trying this species of J'uel or coke, which I could not
otherwise procure in this sequestered spot, at                    a  tolerably
cheap rate, for purposes to which it has not,                     as   far as  I
know,      been hitherto employed.             I must tell you that I -am
my    own     lime   burner,     plaster (of Paris) baker, and brick-
maker ; and that in these processes of rural ceconomy I
have derived      the   greatest     benefits   from this species     of  fuel^
which      I   now prepare at a cheap rate, although 1 waste
almost the whole of the light of the coal gas intentionally.
The coal which I employed formerly for the burning of
limestone into lime is a very inferior kind of small coal,
called here Welsh culm; the only kind of limestone I can
command is the gray kind, which strongly effervesces with
acids.      It readily splits into distinct layers, and becomes
 perfectly white after having been exposed to a red heat. The
kiln for burning         it into lime is a cup-*haped concavity,
surrounded with solid brick work, upen at the top, and
terminating below by an iron                  grate.   It has  a stone    door
that may be opened and closed                 tor charging and emptying
the furnace when required.             This furnace I formerly charged
with alternate straia or 'avers of small coal and limestone,
the latter      being broken previously into pieces not larger
than   a  man's fist, until the kiln was completely filled. The
Stone    is thus     slowlv     decomposed; the upper part of the
charge descends,        and when it has arrived at the bottom of
the furnace new strata are super imp ised, so                as to. keep    the
furnace continually full during a period of 50 hours. The
quantity of lime I thus procured with small coal formerly
    Vol.   33.  No.   134.   June    1809.           Ee           amounted

434            On the Benefits that may        be expected
amounted to        85 bushels.     The strata of coal necessary for
the production of this quantity of lime require to be four
inches thick, and the time absolutely necessary for the pro
 cess of calcination was, as stated already, 50 hours.               On
applying coke instead of coal, (which coke I obtained from
 the same kind of coal,) the produce of lime may be increased
 to nearly 30 per cent. from the same furnace, and the time
 required to effect the calcination of this quantity of lime
 stone is reduced to 39 hours      :  it also requires less attendance
 and less labour,    and   the whole saving thus accomplished
 amounts      to   more than     50 per cent. on the lime-kiln.
 I  have lately also   employed coke for the burning of bricks.
 My    bricks   are burnt   in clamps made of bricks themselves.
 The    place for the fuel, or fire-place,      is perpendicular, about
 three feet high.     The  flues are formed by gathering or arch
 ing   the bricks over, so as to leave a space between           each  of
 a brick's breadth;     and   as the whole of the coal,      if this fuel
 be employed,       must, on account      of  the construction    of  the
 pile, be put in at once, the charge of the bricks is not, and
 never can be, burnt properly throughout ; and the inter
 ference    of the legislature with regard to the measurement of
  the clamp is a sufficient inducement for the manufacturer
  to allow no more place for coal than he can possibly spare: —.
  the reason is obvious.       If coke be applied instead of coal,
  the arches or empty spaces in the clamp or pile, as well as
  the strata of the fuel, may be considerably smaller : the heat
  produced in this case is more uniform and more intense, and
  a saving of 32 per cent. at least is gained.          In the baking of
  my own plaster stone (the compact sulphate of lime of a
  reddish tinge) I also employ coke.            The calcination of this
  Stone for manure I perform in a common reverberatory
  furnace, and the men who conduct the process (who are
  otherwise averse to every thing new) are much pleased with
  the steadiness of the fire, and little attendance which the
  process requires, when coke is used instead of coal.             These
  are the few facts I wish to state to you, with regard to the
  useful application of this species of fuel, which, no doubt,
  hereafter will become an object of ceconomy of incalculable
  advantage to individuals,      if its nature be better understood
                                                                     than

than it is now.    In reading the ingenious observations of
Mr. Accum* with regard to this subject, who states that
the effects of different kinds of fuel may be learnt from the
time required to heat a given quantity of water, &c, the
determining, from the quantity of fuel consumed, the oeco-
nomical application of different sorts of combustible matters,
to ascertain the cost of the one when compared with the
cost of the other, particularly arrested my attention with
regard to the oeconomical application of coke, when com
pared with fuel         of other kinds now in                 use.
   It will not, I am persuaded, be regarded as indicating a
wish to detract in the smallest degree from the well-earned
credit due to the talents and skill of this chemist, so respect
ably known to the scientific public,                     when I venture to state
that I am inclined        to    believe      he        has rather over-rated              the
power of coke, in stating it                 as    three      to onef,       unless       his
coke be considerably better than mine obtained from Welsh
culm.   My experiments in the rough way gave about two
to one, comparing it with coal weight for weight.   I have
also no doubt that coke might be advantageouslv employed
in the srrelting-houses.    14 pounds of brass can be fused in
a portable chemical   furnace,  by means of coke, in 48 mi
nutes, which, with compact wood charcoal, I could not ac
complish in less than 1 hour and a quarter.     The difference
with regard to price in this case is very remarkable.   When
the coke      made      from Welsh culm               once completely ig
                                                         is
nited,                            is,        not decarbure'ted too much,)
        (which it readily               if
itthrows out      very compact and steady heat, and yields
                   a
but   avery slight sulphureous odour; and this ceases when                                it
isfully ignited.         It
                       lasts longer time in
                                  a         state of ignition    a
than charcoal       of wood in  quadruple proportion, and its
                                        a
heat  isconstantly equal, and of almost the same intensity.
Italso requires less trouble and attendance.
     Having   stated above,       (and as
                                                  is   indeed well      known,) that
the brilliancy of the light produced during the combustion
of coal gas    far superior to oil or candles, and being de
              is
sirous to know to what this preeminence was owing,                             I   made

436            On the Benefits that may       be expected
a number     of experiments, of which T, shall merely state the
results, and not the proceedings.            The gas was prepared
from Welsh culm enclosed in a common iron pot covered
with    a head made     of brick ware    ; the tubes for conducting
the gas were leaden       pipes furnished with perforated    roses like
the extremity     of  the   pipe of   a common watering-pot.         In
this manner it was found that the degree of the illuminating
 power of the coal gas differs according to the degree of heat
 employed for its evolution. Coal exposed to a dull red heat,
just sufficient for the production of the gas, yielded a gaseous
 product,    which exhibited much less brilliancy          when burnt
 than gas obtained during        a temperature    of a  bright  cherry
 redness.
     100 cubic inches of the former gas when made to burn
 §lowly from a small aperture under a gardener's large glass
 bell, connected with a stone barrel filled with          oxygen gas,
 required 259 cubic inches of oxygen for its complete com
 bustion.     On removing the residual gas into a stone pan
 containing a ley obtained from the ashes of brush-wood,
  114 cubic inches     of  the gas vanished.
      100 cubic    inches of coal gas obtained at a cherry red
  heat, required for its combustion 312cubic inches of oxygen
  gas obtained from oxymuriate of potash.              The volume of
  gas, after having been agitated with a like alkaline ley, lost
  1 17 cubic inches.      Hence the light of this gas, or its inten
  sity, is probably     in   the ratio of the quantity of oxygen
  necessary   for the combustion of the carburetted hydrogen.
  An increased temperature produces a gas better adapted for
  illumination than a gas procured by a degree of heat merely
  sufficient for its evolution.
      The gas obtained at a low temperature has a much stronger
  odour than that produced during an increased temperature.
  It contains   a considerable portion of sulphuretted hydrogen ;
  for pn collecting a quantity of it in a gasometer made of two
  puncheons, the one of which was painted with white lead
   within,  and   suffering the gas to stand in this apparatus, it
  completely    blackened     the white paint of the wooden vessel.
  The gas obtained at an increased temperature acted but
   feebly on the oxide of lead.

                            from    the Nature      of Coal Gas.                        dsj
         On   passing    a stream       of   the gas obtained from      Welsh cujrn'
    through a solution of acetite of lead                    with excess pf acetous
    acid, it instantly produced a copious black precipitate, which
    effervesced strongly with nitric acid, and yielded much sul
    phuretted hydrogen gas.
      A quantity of gas which had been repeatedly agitated                                inj
    contact with   solution of acetite of silver with excess
                        a                                                                 of
    acid, when suffered    to burn under      gardener's bell-glass
                                                            a
    filled with common air, deposited     dew on the inner sur
                                                        a
    face of the bell; the moisture produced permanently reddened
    a blue cabbage leaf, and caused     precipitate in acetate of
                                                    a
    barytes; the precipitate was insoluble in dilute nitric acid                          ;
    the gas therefore still contained either sulphureous or sul
    phuric acid    ;    and hence the gas,          when intended for the illu
    mination     of dwellings,           should be procured at bright    a               red
    heat.      The odour of         it   becomes under this condition                    di
    minished,      and the property           of blackening paint         is   but slight
    and feeble.
        The method recommended     to deprive the gas of its odour,'
    by  passing    through
                   it      lime-water,   or through lime in state                  a
    of ignition, was found to be absolutely insufficient continued*       ;
    agitation with lime diffused through water to the consist
    ence of cream, with     portion of alkaline ley, was found to

 LXXVfl.          On the   fertilizing Properties of Manures which
           contain slmmonia.          By Mr. William Cox*.
 It   is only     within  the last three weeks or a         month that any
 application       was made to me         for my opinion      on the use of
 any    of   the   articles produced by Mr. Winsor's apparatus,
 and therefore      I have not had the opportunity of making any
 experiments with this identical ammoniacal liquor, espe
 cially with regard to the use to which I beg leave to state I
 think it applicable.            But it will readily be admitted by
 several gentlemen present, acquainted with chemistry,                     that
 ammonia        is a chemical       matter,   as    identical  in one situ
 ation as in another; and as long as I am certain that it is
 ammonia, it is the same thing if it is produced here or in
•the North. I was desirous, some years ago, of making am
 monia in large quantities,          and was of course at some pains
    * From Minutet of Evidence taken fiefore     the Committee  of the House of
 Commons on the Gas-Light       and Coke Company's Bill.
                                                                             in

                         which contain Ammonia.                      43g
  in ascertaining what would be the most oeconomical process
 for its production : I had resort to the various different arti
 cles of a refuse nature, such as were easily to be procured
 at the cheapest rate, for the purpose of obtaining ammonia;
 but I found, however much I varied the article, that, accord
 ing to the quantity of ammonia I could produce from that
 article, the farmers had always been beforehand with             me  in
 raising the price      of it ;  as they found it useful in the same
 proportion in its application on land 1 and that is as far as I
 am acquainted with the matter.               Of course the production
 of ammonia, on        a great scale,   would be of great importance
 to the agricultural     interest.
    Are you acquainted with the subject of the use of am-
moniacal liquor, in agriculture? — I am.
       [The witness here read a paper to the committee.]
       Gentlemen,
    Your inquiry      as to  my opinion of the uses to which your
 ammoniacal liquor is or may be applicable, I shall endea
vour to satisfy as far as the shortness of time will permit.
 Positive evidence of the immediate result of experiments,
which require time and seasons, cannot be obtained in re
gard to such uses as, from the closest analogy and the most
reasonable inference, we should be induced to apply this
production of your process to.           There are many uses in the
arts and    manufactures to which the application of the am
monia or volatile alkali is well known, and which are al
ready in part enumerated.           But when the demand for       these
purposes     is   supplied,    and, on     the  probable great   extent
of the production           of your ammonia, should          a surplus
quantity remain, I        have reason to think, that in     some   very
considerable departments         of agriculture that surplus, how
ever great,     will find  a ready   and adequate   market.    A judi
cious application of ammonia to land before it be sown with
turnips, (but if afterwards, on no account after the plants
are up,)   is   likely   to  produce the most beneficial results.
What justifies me in this conclusion, is the simple conside
ration, that all the powerful and concentrated manures of
high price, and in great request, are just so in the degree in
which I have found them by analysis to contain either am-
                                    E  e 4                      monia

 440            On the fertilizing Properties    of Manures
 monia or the elements         that compose it.     Soot,  well known
 to be in small quantities a powerful encourager of vegeta
 tion, contains much carbonate of ammonia, combined with
 some    of    the   carbonaceous parts, rendering them extractive
 and soluble in water,           forming a brown pungent liquid.
 Pigeon dung is a dressing for turnip land in great request in
 the North, where many hundred quarters are annually sold
 at 1 2 1 a-, the quarter, though a very small proportion of the
 demand is supplied. I have found, by experiment, that this
 material is richly impregnated with carbonate of ammonia
 as well ns with the well known element of ammonia, azote,
 which, in the natural decomposition of the manure by putre
 faction,     when committed to the earth, will be produced.
 Rape dust is thai particular part of the seed (left after the
oil is pressed out} which is intended by nature to corrupt,
and become the early cause or stimulus of the growth of the
embrvo germ, and therefore contains the same element, and
 which we can readily, by a chemical process, exhibit in the
ammonia which rape dust may be made to yield. It is hardly
necessary       to mention urine,     &c,   from   which  ammonia it
obtained in great quantity,         or the dung of all animals, which
contains the same principle.            It was from the dung of the
animals which fed on the fertile plains of Egypt that all the
sal-atnmouiac         known   in commerce was for many centuries
obtained.         From that country, the site of the temple of Ju
piter Amnion, its name is derived. Soon after sal-am
moniac became an article of European manufacture, it was
discovered that the bones and horns of animals yielded its
peculiar salt. that is to say, the ammoniacal principle, in
much greater quantity than their dung, and those parts were
alone used to the exclusion of these: hence the name spirit
of hartshorn,         given to the volatile alkali used in medicine.
It has been of late years discovered, that the scrapings,
shavings, and chips of the horns used in manufactures (par
ticularly of the knife handles at Sheffield) are the most power
ful and lilt best of all land dressings known ; and it is from
these very materials also that the greatest quantity of am
monia i* to be obtained, wool, silk, and hair excepted, and
rtiese are again       in great use m agriculture,     when collected
                                                                   and

                     which contain Ammonia.                          441
and    sold   as old woollen rags.     Bones of all kinds, not ex
cepting human bones, are sent by sea in great quantity
from this metropolis into the North ; many hundred tons of
these are ground,      or rather broken small, in mills contrived
on purpose, as the quantity necessary           for an  a~re of  land is
small in comparison       of other materials.         The convenience
of   easy carriage is the cause    of the most distant lands being
brought into the richest cultivation.            It would not be pro
per,    on  this occasion,  to enter  into a  theoretical   disquisition
on the nourishment of vegetables, whether thev derive their
food wholly, or only in sma 1 part, from the earth by their
roots, or from the atmosphere by their leaves and green parts ;
but it appears clear to me, that that principle which the
farmers term warmth and force, is constantly accompanied
by the chemic element mentioned.               This stimulus of en
couragement and force is of more consequence to the growth
 and eventual vigour of annuals than of perennials, and par
ticularly at the early periods immediately succeeding the ex
 penditure of this sure principle which nature has provided
 in the seed.      The putrefactive fermentation always            gene
 rates ammonia ; the earth imbibes         the    different miasmata,
 and    holds them in store       for the use of plants; to these
 they impart health, strength, and, as may be said, ap
 petite.
     A  great difference is observed    by farmers in the qualities
 of   the   manure of cattle, when fed on oil cake or on hay ;
 it is supposed to be of four times the value in the first case.
 The beneficial effects of sometimes mixing lime with arable
 soil is easily explained in this way. The ammonia is always
 to be recognised by its peculiar smell.           As soon as newly
 slacked lime is mixed up with the mould of a good soil, but
 which is beginning to show signs of impoverishment, in this
  case,   the ammonia,     which had formed        a  chemic   combina
  tion with the fixed acids    of  the manure       (formerly ploughed
  in and fermented) is set at liberty.        These are the phospho
  ric and vitriolic acids, which, as is well knoiin, will leave
  ammonia to combine with lime.             I  have therefore   no hesi
  tation in declaring,   as  matter of opinion, that the production
                                                                        of

  to agricultural purposes, are processes of very great impor
   tance to the landed interest.

         To Mr. Tilloch,— Sir,
  A     wet morning, which            seems to threaten an interruption
 of   some hours' duration,          to my researches in the highly in
 teresting district        which     surrounds this town (Sheffield in
 Yorkshire), presenting the opportunity of looking into the
 last Number of the Philosophical Magazine, I have been
 induced to trouble you with a few lines, in explanation of
 some points,         which your able correspondent Mr. John Carr
of Manchester           has touched upon in his Letter therein.               In
the present state of geological knowledge, nothing can be
 more just than the introductory remark of Mr. Carr, which
 I have quoted above, as to the class of persons who are at
this juncture most likely to trace out and discover the natu
ral causes which have operated, in effecting the present state
and condition         of the earth ; arising from the circumstance,
that very few, of the great and \ead\ng facts appertaining to
the crust of the earth have yet been touched upon, much
less have they been so fully treated on or illustrated by geo
logical writers, that
                                " the closet geologist" can, over an
" accumulation of practical facts," sit down, and deduce
"    a sober and correct theory," or even judge of the truth or

otherwise,        of suggestions    as  to causes, which   " itinerant
geologists" may advance.             This state of things ought not,
however, longer to continue, but the exertions of every
\vell-wisher to science ought to be redoubled, in tracing out
and fully describing the tacts w hieh the British strata present ;
were it only for securing to this country the honour of per
fecting, and rendering the impoitant discoveries of Mr.
William Smith relative to the strata and their alluvial ruins,
as   subservient to science as they have already begun to be
to the mining and other ceconotiiical interests of our coun
trymen, in different counties.
     Wonderful        and  important    as the discoveries made about
 17   years    ago   have   proved,   as to the certain order and con
tinuous planes of the undisturbed strata, each of which, al
most, entombing its own peculiar remains of organized
 beings; and the more recent results, that all such are per
 fectly distinguishable from the present race of animals and
 plants occupying the surface of the strata, as well those parts
 of them which are now sub aqueous, as the others : yet,
 without the means of accurately distinguishing alluvial or
 moved matters, from the stratified sand and other substances,
 which have hitherto been almost universally confounded with
 them     ;  of discriminating between the extraneous and the
 local      alluvia   of any district ; and further acquiring the
 knowledge, that faults. or fissures, slips, throws, or what
 ever else they may be denominated, are the mere fracture
  and displacement of the piles of strata, and do not in any
 instance affect the order or nature of the strata, (beyond their
  immediate vicinity,) when an extent of the scries is taken
  into account,       commensurate with the derangement that the
  two parts of the separated pile of strata have sustained, and
  the effect of a subsequent denudation or excavation of the
  surface to its present diversified form of hills and valleys is
  duly considered :v without, I say, that these latter facts and
  their practical applications were also known and made, the
  order and continuity of the strata might still have remained
   as unproductive to geological science, or even to scientific
   mining,      as they have  hitherto proved in the hands of practical
   colliers and ironstone miners, who have been fully aware of
                                                                   these

  these two points,       nay all their operations have been founded
  upon them, from the earliest periods in the practice of their
 arts  :   but unfortunately, with some rare exceptions, such
 have     confined their researches to their own particular fields
 or to very limited districts round them, and have loo often
 satisfied themselves, wi.th the most vague and unsatisfactory
 guesses, at the identity of the particular strata worked by the
 miners in other districts, even of those which adjoin, in nu
 merous instances : and [ am sorry to add, that after visiting
 more than 200 collieries between Nottingham and this place,
 and conversing with the owners or workmen or both,               upon
 most of them, I have not been able yet to discover any two
 whose ideas are perfectly -consistent with each other, as to
 the identity or otherwise,       of the coal and ironstone    working
in places distant from their own              works  : my confidence,
however, increases daily, of being able (should health and
prudential considerations admit of a sufficient application
of time      to the subject)    to reconcile all the facts  I have col
lected,     *6 the satisfaction of this great body of practical men,
and     to   scientific  inquirers in general. The zeal which I
feel,    for stimulating others, better qualified than myself, to
enter on and pursue similar and even more minute inquiries
in this or other districts, than I have beeu able to accomplish
or attempt, has         however here      led  me beyond what I in
tended at present: and 1 return to page 3S5 of your last
Number, in order to notice the opinion advanced by Mr.
Carr, that " solely from the superior durability of its ma
terials, which have withstood the operation of those tre
mendous        agents   that have     swept away the surrounding
country,"       are we to look for the cause    of an isolated moun
tain composed of successive          piles of strata : in order, on a
point of so much moment to mention,               that though a grit*
stone rock very often occupies the very summits of hills in
the coal districts, yet that such are generally too soft and*
their blocks adhere too slightly, to admit of our referring
the Joint of the b\\\ solely to the resistance these rocks offered
either to a violent action of gravity from above, (as I have
supposed,) or to the sudden or even to the long-continued
action of " water," moving over the surface according to               *

present currents of the rivers and brooks, as to be naturally
enough referred to the torrents which hurry through these
valleys in ordinary heavy rains; not to mention the bursting
of water-spouts &c. which                        we are at liberty also to suppose
may have occurred, on the hills above.   The hummocks of
gravel in Derbyshire which     have mentioned page 261, as
                                                 I

Forest    in Nottinghamshire,   belong to the extraneous                                        al

 in proving           the distance          it   has travelled,        to its present         rest

 adopted         by   Mr. Carr, at the top of the next page, viz., that
 the    terrestrial strata              " could
                                only be derived from the de

 446                 A  Reply to   Mr. Carr's Tetter,
 From what      source can it be inferred,       thai the   " present laws
 of Nature,"      as  Mr. C    has defined     them, have been in ac
 tion millions      of years?     any  more, than that the fanciful
 creation of an       erratic planet" is mtended " for accomplish
 ing, almost in an instant, that which, far more probably, re
 quired many thousands of years to effect?"                  My personal
 acquaintances well know, that          [  have all along supposed      the
 probable period to be very long ; durmg w hich a satellite
 revolved in a continually decreasing orbit (from causes that
 are perhaps assignable, without clumsily cutting any Gordian
 knot) and effected the stupendous operations on the strata,
 previous to its fall into, and assimilation with, the com-
 pound mass of the terraqueous globe, which it is the busi
ness   of  "  closet"     as well  as "   itinerant"     ge<dngis.* to  in
vestigate    and    understand fully, befoie they pronounce the
proposer of a new application of           the principle   of gravitation
to the earth,     as a person    forsaken by the       genuine spirit of
philosophy,      and   become      " bewildered in the unprofitable
maze of hypothesis !"           Surely gravity (as exemplified daily
by the tides, p. 25y,)          may safely be classed among the
" present energies" of Nature : and who is there, that can
not perceive, that the energies,              be they what they may,
which effected the disruption and denudation of the strata,
must have acted in degrees and modes, utterly distinct from
those which have prevailed, since the             last  and great opera
tions of creative power were performed, in the creation of
the present race of vegetables and animals, and of mant
whose reasoning faculties rendered him capable of tracing
back to events, which took place long, very long prior to
the existence of his species.
    Strong   as   the   language    I have     used herein may at first
seem,    I will  not anticipate the slightest irritation in Mr.
Carr thereat, much less an explosion of any thing like viru
lence on his part, but on the contrary, cordially wish, that,
he would engage seriously in          applying the action of water,
(without the reversed and deranged action of gravity) to the
explanation of the phaenomena presented by the neighbour
hood of Manchester, or any other which he may choose,
                                                                       and

  and convey to us, both the facts and the reasonings, through
  the medium of your useful Magazine : recollecting, that the
  tides which I have supposed, necessarily imply all the me
  chanical agency of water, which is consistent with the pe
  riodic time and circumstances of the satellite occasioning
  them and giving impulse to the fluid ; and Mr. Carr will
  not, I hope, fail to consider, and inform us, of the motive
  forces propelling and directing his " incessant operator" in
  the excavation      of valleys.   The example of        the   immortal
' Newton,      in declining to attempt the definition of the cause
  of gravity, to which neither he nor any one else have yet
  found themselves equal, shall be my excuse, in not at
   tempting a conjecture on the manner in which the forces
   were    directed,    which excavated    the  valleys :   the  facts   of
   many of them having           been  mechanically excavated,         and
   that none     (comparatively speaking) of the displaced mate
   rials are now any where to be found, are, as I think, incon
   trovertible.
       Perhaps   Mr. Carr, when      he speaks  of water having given
   "mobility     and transportation to such massive and diversified
   materials,"     as compose the strata, had not contemplated a
   supposition, which forced itself upon my mind, after having
   perceived the difficulties which his position involves, viz.,
   that each successive stratum in ascending the series, was
   created since the animal or vegetable remains which it co
   vers, had completed their growth,           and the deposition of
   which stratum, or its precipitation from the superincumbent
   fluid, perhaps, occasioned the successive extinction of these
   organized beings. The universal prevalence of grains in
   siliceous strata, suggests the supposition, as I think, that
   something analogous to the formation of hail in a storm,
    (in irregular crystals) took place during the precipitation of
   silex, generally, in very minute grains ; but in the first or
    Mill-stone Grit Rock (vol. xxxi. Plate II.) it is not uncom
    mon to meet with grains half an inch, and even in some cases
    three quarters of an inch in diameter, having that smoothness
    of surface,   as to  induce  Mr. Whitehurst    and many others to
    describe   these   large siliceous grains as rolled pebbles, but
    which opiuion       I never could see reason for adopting ; the
                                                                   surface

 LXXIX.              Contrivance          for preventing Doors from Dragging
                       on Carpets.           By Mr. John Tad*.
          sir,
 I have            taken      the     liberty of laying before the Society a
 model of my invention                      to prevent doors from dragging on
 carpets,          and to keep out the current                       of cold air, which      en
 ters under such doors                   as are       not close to the carpets under
 neath them.
      I   can      affix this machinery to the bottom                          of   any door, so
that the door shall pass over the carpet with ease, and, when
shut, be air tight.   It obviates the necessity of screw rising
hinges,  and  is less  expensive than other inventions for the
same purpose.
      The machinery                    slip of well seasoned
                                 is constructed             of   a
beech wood, equal in length to the width of the door; this
slip is one and a quarter inch wide, and half an inch thick,
and to be covered with green cloth on the inside ; it is to
be hung to the bottom of the door with three small brass
hinges, and is drawn up by a concealed spring as the door
opens, and is forced down when the door shuts, by one end
of    which
      it,       semicircular, pressing upon
                        is                  concave semi                   a
circular piece of hard beech wood, fastened at the bottom of
the door case, and which holds      down close to the floor or
                                                           it
carpet, so as to   exclude  the air  from entering under it.
Hoping this invention will meet with the approbation of the
Society,        I    remain,        with respect,

     Dragging       on Carpets. See      PI. XIII.   Figs. 1,  2, 3, and 4.
      Mr. Tad's invention consists in first cutting away the bot
   tom of the door, so that it is about one inch and a quarter
   above the floor; this allows a sufficiency of room for the
   door to open over any carpet. To close the opening which
   would now be left under the door when shu , he proposes
   to fix beneath      the door,      by means of hinges, a slip of wood,
   of which aide,          figs. 2 and 3, Plate XIII. is a section. Fig. I
  is a perspective view of the bottom of a door, with the
   invention annexed to it ; fig. 2 is a section across the door
   when closed ; fig. 3 is a view of the edge of the door when
  open ; and fig. 4 is a section supposed to be made by cutting
  the door in two parts, edgeways.                 The hinges, on which
  the slip turns, are fixed to the edge, fn figs. 2 and 3, from a
  to  J,  is exactly one inch and a quarter, so that when the ruler
  is turned down upon the hinges, it reaches the floor A A
  as in fig. 2 ; in the other direction a d it is much less, being
  only half an inch, so that when it is turned up under the
  door,     as  in fig. 3, it leaves three quarters of an inch clear of
  the floor.       It now remains to show how the ruler is turned
  up or down        : — it  has always a tendency       to rise up into the
  state    of fig. 3, by the action of a steel wire spring, shown
  in figs. 2 and 4, which is concealed in a rebate cut in the
  bottom of the door ; one end of the wire is screwed fast to
  the door at     f,   the other is inserted    into an eye fastened into
  the slip at g, to throw it down into the position of figs. 2
  and 4.       The end h, fig. 4, of the slip furthest from the
  hinges-of the door, is cut into a semicircle, as seen in fig. 3.
  When        the    door is just closed, this semicircle is received
  into   a fixed    concave      semicircle k, fig. 3, cut in the end of

     different-sized Nuts or Heads of Screws.                  By Mr. Wm.

 r>
 Xermit         me to make a few observations on a shifting screw
 wrench of my invention,             which     I beg leave to lay before the
 Society      of Arts, &c,        through the hands of Mr. Brunei,
 inventor of the block machinery here.
     I have found, from long experience, the imperfections of
 the various wrenches in common use, for the screw heads
 and nuts of engines in general, which are often materially
 injured for want of an instrument which would fit variety of
  sizes, and be applied with as much advantage as a solid
  wrench. 1 have had it in view to unite steadiness with con-
  vena ncy in making such an instrument; and flattering my
  self that 1 have obtained both, I am desirous to communi
  cate my invention         to the Society,        and   have  therefore sent
  an instrument         on the      principle    I  have actually    used, and
  which      has met with      the approbation        of my employers       and
   other persons.
      This wrench, by means of               a  nut and screw, is adjusted
   with the greatest      ease   to the exact size required,        and in that
   state rendered     so steady that      in   use   it is found equal      to a
   Solid wrench.
       I have, for several        years, been intrusted with the care
   and repairs of many valuable engines of various descriptions,

have always considered it as an object of great importance,
for the preservation and neat appearance of engines, to at
tend to all the means which would obtain these advantages,
and such, I think, will arise from the use of my universal
wrench.

on this principle may be varied  its form and size, so as toin
be rendered probably more convenient for some particular
purposes for which such instruments are required.

LXXX1.         On the Natural Causes which operate in the Forma
              tion   of Valleys.         By   John Carr, Esq.
   * Revolving the circumstances of excavated vallevs in my mind, as I have
observed them wonderfully distributed over the whole surface of large di
stricts, effecting a descending outlet or drainage to any part : I have been lost
in con;ecturing any application of mechanical or known principles, that
could have directed the almost irresistible forces, which effected this impor
tant, and as it were finishing operation on the matter of our globe, but refer
the same to Omnipotent Power itself, acting, perhaps, in this instance, with
out the intervention of the agents whose operations iu Nature the light of
science enables us in so many instances to trace."
                   Mr. John Farey, Philosophical Magazine for April 1809.
      To Mr. Tilloch, — Sir,
The       above       " most    lame andimpotent conclusion" fur
nishes    a   very singular instance of the great difference between
observing and judging ; between the accurate perception of
effects, and the more rare and discriminating faculty of
drawing from their common agreement and general com
 bination, just and rational deductions of their cause. Phe
 nomena so extensive, combined in such union, and ope
 rating so indispensable an -office                   in the    wise ceconomy    of
 Nature, surely ought               to have suggested          a more natural and
 philosophical inference.    To me, there are few things more
 evident than  that " the irresistible forces" which have effect
 ed the excavation           of valleys,       are no other than the identical
 streams which now flow througli them                      ;   and that by means
 so natural and obvious, as to excite extreme                      wonder how so
 experienced and intelligent an observer, as Mr. Farey un
 questionably          is,
                 can have surveyed the practical facts, and
 reflected on the subject, without arriving at the clearest
 conviction.
     Every river which disembogues itself into the ocean                         is
 the great drainage trunk of a considerable extent of country,
 receiving through every part of its course lateral streams,
 which again receive others, and these others still,  so much          in
  that the river itself        is   frequently the receptacle of hundreds
  of other      streams      of various magnitude    and extent   and not
                                                                        ;
  only    the    river, but every             brook,    however remotely con
  nected, has its peculiar range                of valley*, which  afford  the
                                                                            it
                                                                             most

    most easy and direct communication                    with    the       stream     into
    which it falls: and all these ranges                  of   valleys      are as sub
    servient lo, and as intimately connected with, the exten
    sive and general system of drainage of the country, as the
    streams themselves ; and the uniform direction, general con
    nection,  and admirable subserviency of the whole, are so
    palpable, that we are irresistibly led to one of two conclu
    sions, — either that the several ranges of valleys have been
    purposely and specially formed for the streams which now
    flow through them, or that the streams themselves have
    scooped out their own peculiar valleys. The former opinion
    is too absurd to merit           a   moment's attention
                                                   ; and the latter
    has so many direct and    positive proofs in its  favour, as to
    yield the most satisfactory conviction to any impartial and
    competent mind, that will take an actual survey of the
    spring heads and courses of even the most trivial brooks.
      But though          there are no natural operations whatever,                  that
    from personal inspection more clearly illustrate themselves
    than this operation of streams in forming their own valleys,
    it is a subject of considerable difficulty when limited to mere
    description.    The proof circumstances, in          their com    alt
    binations, are distinct objects of visual inspection, and when
    spread out beneath the eye exhibit      connected chain of
                                                      a                                il
    lustrative evidence irresistibly convincing; but the same im
    pressive picture   comparatively faint, and its beautiful unity
                           is
    broken into fragments, like the landscape in the rippling
^
    stream, when held up to the " mind's eye" in the closet.
    Nevertheless there     bold prominency
                                is   a          the outline of   in
    this natural scenery, which         the pen can trace, and
                                             even                                      I
    will endeavour to delineate   in   brief and hasty sketch.
                                           it    a
      The horizontal parallelism  of the  upper brows of valleys,
    and of the strata and their identity in the opposite banks,
    have long ago demonstrated that the strata were formerly
    continued across, and that the valleys have been formed                             by
    the strata being cut through and the missing portions carried
    away. The truth of this no one will question, who,        ac                  by
    tual inspection, has given due attention  to the tacts upon
    which   it   rests.
      The source of         every stream        is   always situated on       a   higher
                                           Ff   3                                   level

434            On   the.   Natural   Causes which operate
level than that of the country through which the valleys
have been cut ; and were they all filled up, there would still
be a sufficient fall in the country for the stream* to flow the
same way : and as water, when left to itself, by its fluidity
•nd gravitation constantly seeks the lowest place, we may
always be assured that the conrse which the stream hat
taken is the lowest descent of the country in that direction.
With these circumstances in view, let us select any indi
vidual stream, and suppose all its valleys to be rilled up by
replacing the very materials of the strata formerly carried off,
thereby restoring the country to its pristine state before the
valleys were excavated; and then, by attending to the course
of the stream from its source, we shall acquire a clear and
correct conception of the manner in which the valleys were
originally formed. The old channel being in the lowest fall
of the country, the stream will still flow in the same direc
tion, but it will    be on     and     over the newly restored    mate
rials, which    we     have    supposed to be replaced ; and it     will
first pass over that portion which has filled "up the first val
ley, until it arrives at what was the lower end, which being
now     declivity, it will be precipitated into the hollow
        a
below.   In that hollow or flat the water will spread itself
out into a lake, wider or narrower in its dimensions ac
cording to the form and bearing of the ground ; and the lake
continuing to fill, the water will rise over the level of the
materials which filled up the second valley, and running on
to where was the lower end,       it will again descend the.
declivity into the hollow  below,   and will accumulate and
spread itself until it again rises over the third valley, and
descend     again at the lower end ; and          in this manner it will
continue  its course, falling down every declivity which it
reaches, and  accumulating into a lake wherever the nature
of the ground obstructs          it,
                              until the water reaches over the
 level of the obstructing rise; and the stream in this stage of
 its course will consist of     achain of streams, waterfalls and
 lakes, from its source to the channel of the next stream, or
 of the sea itself, the grand receptacle of the whole.      Let us
jdow attend to what will take place at the several falls. There,
in  every instance where the stratum        not an indurated rock,
                                             is
                                                                     the

the momentum and action of the descending water will cut
a channel, deep and expeditious in proportion to the height
of      fall and the yielding nature of the stratum: and as
      the
this channel deepens, the unsupported sides will tall in, and
the materials be swept away into the lake below. The water
will continue this process, but with diminished force,as the
inclined plane becomes less steep, until it has again exca
vated a valley similar to that which we have supposed to
be filled up        this new valley opening directly into the
                    :    and
lake above,       lake will, in time, be completely drained
                        the                                                           I
off, and the stream will soon work itself out a limited chan
nel in the alluvial materials which have formed the bottom
of the lake, and which had been brought down from the
detritus of the valley above.  After a certain time the whole
course of the stream will be changed, in this way, from a
succession of streams, waterfalls and lakes, into a succession
of valleys         and alluvial flats, such as we             actually now find
existing in         the course        of almost      every  stream.   If the flat
ground a little wav beyond any                       valley be examined, below
the vegetable mould, it will be found to consist of sand,
gravel, and other alluvial materials precisely similar to the
strata in the valley above               ;   and   if the   valley immediately be
low be filled up, a lake will forthwith be formed above                         it,
and covering the alluvial materials which had formed the
bottom of the former lake:                   — and
                                    these two important facts,
capable       of
            the most  direct proof    every district where val
                                                     in
leys abound, are surely decisive evidence that the original
course -of the stream did consist of chain of waterfalls and
                                                       a
lakes, and that the falls have worn out the valleys backwards
into the lakes above, thereby giving vent to their waters,
and leaving the course of the streams, as we now find them,
a succession of valleys and alluvial flats.
     may be easily imagined that the valley will be deep and
     It
capacious in proportion to the height of the waterfall where
the excavation commences, and that the exit of the water in
the lake above will increase                   the     fall in the next valley up
wards     ;   and       it   may also be readily conceived, that when the
action of the water has worn the inclined plane, down which
itdescends, to    certain point, all further excavation of the
                              a

 456               On the Natural Causes which operate
  channel will cease, and that the stream may continue to flow
  for innumerable ages with but trivial alterations in its course.
  This     is   the  true      reason   why   we do not now see streams
  forming valleys,           the work having been long since accom
  plished      by the      channels being reduced to their lowest de
  scending level       :   and only by the bursting out of a new
  spring head,       in    a  situation distant from any other stream,
  could we now practically observe the progression of falls
  and lakes into valleys and fiats, in the manner described.
  The progress of the stream flowing from such a new
  spring       head  would        most assuredly    establish the truth of
  every      thing I have already stated.              For it cannot be
  doubted that every stream must originally have formed its
  own channel ; and it must be equally obvious, that when
 first left to find its own way over a great inequality of sur
 face, it must frequently have precipitated down declivities
 into hollows, out of which it could have no other exit than
 by swelling into a lake, until the water rose over the level
 of   the lowest ground which bounded the hollow.
     In many cases a valley commences immediately at the
 source of a stream, just opening there and gradually deepen
 ing downwards           to the lower      end, where, questionless, the
 stream once fell, and where the cutting               of the valley com
 menced;         and this form,       of being shallow at     the  upper and
deepening         down       to  the  lower end, where      the fall of the
Stream first began to act for its formation,                is also common
to numerous valleys, more especially those                   near the spring
heads ; and while it perfectly accords             with the action     of the
stream, it is utterly irreconcileable with any other explana
tion.       Nothing, too, is more usual than the intersection
of one valley with another at the confluence of two streams ;
and in every such instance the angle of intersection of the
valleys and streams is acute above and obtuse below, and
the two streams           invariably meet on precisely the same level.
All     this would naturally and necessarily result from the
streams       forming their own          valleys and channels, but it is
utterly impracticable to assign the most remote probable cause
for the same union and unison of effects by any other na
tural means.          ....                       .      & .

                   in the Formation     of Valleys.                -447
    In   some cases,   indeed, the capacious magnitude of the
Valley, compared with the diminutive size of the stream,
might arrest our belief of 30 trivial an agent having accom
plished so great a work ; but those occasional and powerful
floods to which every brook is subject, the immense dura
tion of the action, and the yielding nature of the earthy
materials removed, are amply sufficient to suppress               every
doubt and to reconcile every difficulty.
    There are multitudes      of other practical facts which the
actual survey   of the   course of streams readily supplies, and all
of   them speaking the same forcible language,         of  the streams
themselves     being the only agents that have broken down
the    opposing obstacles in their course and reduced, their
channels to the regular gradation slopes down which we now
find them flowing.
    Those who may be desirous        of verifying these  observations     ,
on the formation of valleys, have only to visit           the   spring
heads of their neighbouring streams,            tracing   the channel
downwards, and they will find little difficulty           in marking
the    site of  every   former lake and waterfall, by only sup
posing the valley which lies before them to be filled up;
and the obvious effect will be a lake at the upper and a
-waterfall   at the   lower end    ; and a proper examination         of
the soil below every valley will discover the very materials
formerly brought down when the valley was excavating.
    The very intimate connection between waterfalls and lakes,
and their disappearance         together, by the former effecting
breaches    into the latter, has been very fully dwelt upon; and
accordingly where waterfalls now abound, there ought to be
a corresponding abundance of lakes ; and this is strikingly
corroborated by the fact.        Canada is productive of the most
numerous and celebrated          waterfalls, and there also, above
these falls, are the most numerous and most extensive lakes
on our globe.
    Every waterfall that now exists is produced by a stratum
of rock crossing       the course    of the stream, and     it is solely
owing to the indurated durability of the rock, that we now
 find a fall where we should otherwise have found a valley.
This is so evident, that many of our most celebrated water
                                                                    falls

 458                  On the Formation         of Valleys.
 falls are     not precipitated from an open            height     of higher
 ground,      but down into a deep chasm,               or rocky valley,
 formed, undeniably, by the violent action                   of   the  water,
 which has continued, and is still continuing,                   from the de
 tritus of the rock,       to remove the fall higher up the stream :
 such strictly is the case with the far-famed Falls of Niagara.
 The surrounding country is nearly on the same level, and
 the river is propelled over an immense bed of rock, down
 into a profound valley, which extends for nine miles below
 the falls, and with every appearance of having been formed
 by the progressive removal of the fall backwards, in conse
 quence of the gradual waste           of the rock by the destructive
 action of the water.
    But there is another point of view in which this magnifi
 cent waterfall ought to be considered as eminently illustra
 tive of the subject under consideration.  The height of the
 fall,   and what are called the rapids immediately above                it,   is
 upwards of two hundred feet      and there
                                       ;           still further
                                                        is   a
 considerable fall in the descent  of the  river from   the lake
 above.
     Now    certainly requires but
           it                       small effort of mind to
                                           a
 perceive that the vast stratum of imperishable rock which
 crosses the channel of the river, has alone prevented the
 St. Lawrence from excavating one of              the largest and most
 capacious valleys on our globe,               and that the excavation
 would have extended upwards into lake Ontario, liberating
 its waters, and leaving the river to form, for itself, chan         a
 nel through the central and deepest parts of the exhausted
 lake.
    The retreat of these waters would be productive of another
vast fall in the channel from            lake Erie, and that fall again
 excavating   valley upwards,
                a                      and into the lake,   would oc
 casion the exit of its waters which again would produce
                                   ,                                           a
 fall and excavation up into lake Huron, the retreat of whose
 waters would be followed           by   falls from,    and excavations
into,  lakes Superior and Michigan; and hence this exten
 sive chain of immense lakes would disappear, leaving in its
 place an equally extensive chain of valleys and alluvial flats,
similar,     but on   a   far more gigantic scale, to the thousands

    I fear,  Mr. Editor,      I have  trespassed much too far on the
limits of your truly estimable record of scientific papers ; yet
I trust the subject is one of superior interest, by bringing us
acquainted with the origin of those beautiful excavations
which adorn so much of our landscape, and add so much of
pleasurable variety to every excursion.              They offer, how
ever, still higher claims to our          attention   from their para
mount usefulness in the provident oeconomy of Nature, by
operating, with such admirable and subservient address, and
such a harmonized system of combination, as the universal
conduits of all the waters of every country.

But       the authors of systems of mineralogy, without even
 excepting chemists, have followed a very different course.
They have considered each metal as the base of a particular
 genus ; and in the case in which this metal existed per se,
 in the state of native metal, it would form the first species
 of the genus ; and its combinations with different principles
 would give the other species.         Thus, in    the genus  of copper,
 we should have successively,         as species,   native copper, oxide
of copper, sulphuret of copper, carbonate of copper, mu
 riate of copper, &c. In short, metallic substances have
 characters so striking, that they have been adopted with one
 accord, as the fixed points around which all the combina
 tions ought to rally of which they form part.
     Now, uniformity of method would require, that the same
 rule which had been followed in the arrangement of metallic
 substances      should also preside over that of substances pro
 duced by the union of an earth with an acid ; i. e. lime, for
                                                               example,

    example, should be considered as the basis of a genus, which
    should have as its species the combinations of that earth
    with the carbonic, phosphoric, and fluoric acids. It is evi
    dent that all the parts of a ckar and distinct distribution
    should be symmetrical, and that one method cannot be
   adapted to two different scales ; otherwise it would no longer
   be a method.
       Bui  if  the natural    order should prescribe to us to deter
   mine the genera        according to the most fixed principle of
   each compound, nothing should hinder us from generalizing
   under another view the employment of the acids, by bor
   rowing from these principles a classical character, serving
  to connect with 'each other all the substances not me
   tallic  of which     ithey form part; and henceforward' those
  substances      which bear the name of salts would be united
  in   one and the same superior division          with others ; such as
  the   carbonate    of  lime,   phosphate  of   lime, sulphate of ba-
  rytes, &c, which had been ranked among the stones. This
  intimacy had been already as it were prepared for by the
  transition of the calcareous sulphate from the class of stones
 into that of the salts.        The characters drawn from the solu
 bility in water       and from the taste,     so   little  remarkable in
 these substances,      had almost obliterated the boundary between
 the two classes; the definition of salts had become vague
 and equivocal ; and it appeared to me that it would be to
 restore order and precision into the class of bodies which
 had borne this name, to            introduce into it all     those  which
 contained an acid joined to an earth or an alkali, and some
 times to both. The collection of all these bodies will there
 fore form the first class, or that of acidiferous substances*^
 T   shall exclude the metallic salts,     in order to arrange them
 among       the   metals, always taking care not to fritter down
the sienera.        This class will be subdivided into three orders,
 the first   of which will comprehend           the     earthy-acidiferous
substances, the second the a'kaline-acidiferous substances,
and the third the alkalino-earthy-acidiferous              substances.
     * The author uses this word uniformly to express those substances  intt?
which acids enter as one of their component parts. We shall therefore re
tain the term in our translation. — Edit.

  The second          class  will be formed of the substances which
I call   earthy, i.       c.of those which admit no acid among
the earths         that   enter into their composition.    I do not
think that we are     yet sufficiently acquainted by analysis
                               as
with the number and proportions of these earths in a part of
the substances in question, to be able to subdivide this class
into genera.    Thus, I shall content myself with presenting
the series of the species it contains, taking advantage only
 (in order to arrange the terms of this series) of analogies or
differences which the knowledge we already                    possess   admits
of our perceiving among them.
   Let     us hope that the chemistry               of minerals,   which since
the days  of Cronstadt and Bergman has made so great pro
gress, will at length attain a point of perfection which will
place this class, and even certain parts of subsequently de
scribed classes, upon a level with the first.   We have seen
for several years discoveries succeed each other rapidly.
Klaproth has furnished us with zircon, uranium, titanium,
and tellurium.  To Vauquelin we are indebted for glucina
 and chrome. — Analyses                    made   by one person have been ve
 rified by others.  What may not science gain by this for
 tunate  concurrence  ?
     But if the second class still leaves any thing to desire re
 lative to the regularity of the whole, I flatter myself that                    I
 have at least contributed to perfect it in its details, not only
 by a more exact division of the substances which constitute
 the species, but also by the care which I have taken to
 apply this name only to those substances which really de
 serve     it,
          and to those which have  type susceptible of pre
                                                   a                      a
 cise determination*.                Thereby we exclude from the method,
 and throw into           a    separate  appendix, the argils, marls, and
 every other         similar        aggregate     compostd of fragments bor
 rowed from different species,                    and consequently possessing
 mixed characters.

                                                                     combustible

    combustible       substances ;     the   different   non-metallic        bodies
    susceptible of combustion, such as the diamond, sulphur,
    and minerals known by the name of bitumens.                            Among
    those substances          some have hitherto         resisted the attempts
   made to analyse them ; others, treated by distillation or by
   other means, give out several of the principles which en
   tered into their composition.              This difference naturally in
   dicates the subdivision            of the class in question into two
   orders, distinguished from each other by the denominations
   of simple      and compound combustible          substances.
       The metalic         substances     still remain,      which      give     the
   fourth      class, subdivided        into as many genera          as there are
  metals.        Under      each   of   these   genera   is to be ranked as a
   species the native metal when it exists ; then the metal com
  bined, either with another metal, with oxygen, combustibles,
  or acids. With respect to the orders which subdivide this
  class,     I  have formed      them after the example of Bergman,
  who has borrowed their characters from circumstances which
  determine their oxidation and reduction, by placing in the
  first order those which are not oxidizable, but only reducible
  by heal : in the second, those which are oxidized when
  heated, and which,           when heated more strongly, are reduced :
  and in the third,          those  which are oxidizable, but not redu
  cible by heat       *.
     * The relations which characterize the divisions and subdivisions of the
 chemical methods being founded upon the intimate properties and upon the
 composition of bodies, these methods will at first appear to give way to a
 certain point to those who employ external characters, and in some measure
 more accessible characters, in order to establish the classification.   I have at
 tempted to supply the place of it, at least relatively to the great divisions, by
 characters easily ascertained. To conclude : I have not thought that the
 consideration I have mentioned can balance the advantage of presenting a
 distribution   founded upon the very essence of the substance which it em
 braces, and at once more symmetrical, more satisfactory to the mind, by
giving legitimate order to our ideas.       What furnishes an additional motive
for supporting this preference is, that, the number of mineralogical        species
being very inconsiderable, the instant they are once clearly circumscribed, the
principal object is fulfilled. For in this case we gain by a little practice such
• stock of knowledge, that, when a mineral presents itself for the first time,
nothing remains in order to determine it than to decide between two or three
species,   successively trying the characters which distinguish each of them,
until we have removed all doubt.
                                                                             The

              Introduction     to the   Study    of Mineralogy.               463
    The choice of       a  method founded upon the results of ana
lysis naturally led me to adopt, wherever I could, the new
chemical nomenclature, so proper in other respects for facili
tating the study of science, from the advantages of present
ing names truly picturesque, which carry along with them
the exact notion of the things they express: but the manner
 in which my genera were formed, occasions a slight inver
 sion in the denominations,             the first word     of which ought       to
 express     the base of the genus, and the second the specific
 difference.       Consequently, we must substitute, instead of
 the terms fluate of lime, sulphate of baryte.i, sulphate of
 iron,    &c,    the terms     fluated lime, sulphated barytes, sul-
 phated iron, &c*
     But it is evident that these last denominations produce no
 real    change in the received language ; that they require
 nothing else than memory ; and that they present to the
 mind the same images under the same traces : mineralogy
  does nothing more here than take the counterproof                         of the
  drawing chalked out by the chemist.
      I have not dissembled the difficulties             which    may be pre
  sented in the way of my method; but the strongest appeared
  to me to arise from the state of imperfection in which che
  mistry still remains with respect to the analysis of some of
  the minerals.       I cannot foresee, for example, the manner in
  which it might be best to organize and denominate the new
  genera which future discoveries will produce in the series
  of earthy substances.            I  propose     the method which seems
  the least defective      in the present state of science.            I take ad
  vantage of what has been already done, without anticipating
  what still remains to be done : in short, I stop at the limits
  prescribed to me by experience, expecting that future la
  bours will extend them.
      But it would not have          been sufficient to have given to the
  plan of the system all             the  regularity and accuracy which
  practical knowledge requires.                I thought myself obliged
  therefore to extend this plan, by introducing the greatest
     * Bergman, who had a
                              very correct mind, and who even assumed fixed
  principles for the bases of his genera, called fiuoraled lime, aerated lime, Stc.,
  what we call Jluated lime, carbvnated lime, Sic.
                                                                         possible

 possible number of species, and by taking advavantage of
 the recent discoveries which have enriched mineralogy.
 I   here testify my gratitude to those                        ingenious    foreigners to
whom           I   am indebted        for      some   of   the greatest rarities in    my
collection, and particularly to Messrs. Abildgaard, Manthey,
Karsten, Neergaard, Esmark, Baron de Moll, Coden, and
Hoffman-Bang.                    To     some     of   these friends   I    also owe some
interesting observations, which have given additional value
to their presents.   Nothing more strongly confirms what
has been so often said of the learned of all countries, namely,
that they form one family, tha.n this division of riches, which
makes the distance between their respective countries disap
pear, and this communication of light which renders them
constantly present with each other.
  All that I have said concerns the solution                              of the first of
the two problems I have mentioned, and its object is, the
classification of substances.  Now analysis, which presents
data so  advantageous for attaining this object, requires ope
rations frequently long and delicate, and on that account
alone would become embarrassing, if it was necessary always
to have recourse     to           it,
                             order to resolve the other problem,

L    e.    order
          in     to recognize the substances.
    I   now return to the employment of characters which,
being more            easily ascertained,             more convenient         and expe
ditious, may serve as   beacon to the minerals already classi
                                      a
fied.
   To judge of this according to the manner of viewing
things generally adopted hitherto with respect to the solution
of the problem in question, the simple description of mine
rals      by
         the helps of their external characters contains all
that   sufficient to distinguish them from each other. No
         is
thing has more contributed to establish the reputation of the
system    which these characters are employed, than the per
              in
fection given to            it   by   Werner.      This ingenious mineralogist
has presented          it   under the form         of    complete system

  our senses, every thing that is tangible is carefully defined,
 in which all the different signs by which an attentive ob
 server  may recognise it are given by so many expressions,
 which are afterwards presented separately by themselves, in
 order to form the picture of each species.
    This union of     suffrages   in favour   of the system   I have al
 luded to, the great reputation which it has so justly acquired
 for its author, would present powerful motives to prevent
 me from quitting the track he has pointed out.                 But the
 plan to which    I  had referred the order of classification, by
 only admitting     into  it species properly so called, susceptible
 of a rigorous determination, led me, in order to establish
their distinct characters, to profit by what they have most
constant, most general, and most intimately connected with
the constitution      of their integrant molecules : and I have
given way to the obligation of reconciling with the fixed
principles I had adopted, relative to the whole of the science,
the method of studying its details.
    I shall here briefly mention the reasoning which directed
me in the manner 6f arranging this method.               " The picture
of a species,"    1  said to myself,      " ought to present : 1st, a
sum of characters^ by the assistance of which an observer
can ascertain that a mineral, which he endeavours to class,
belongs to this species      :  2d, theserfes of the varieties which
Subdivide the species.
    "  Now the specific        characters   being as the   fixed points
whence proceeds the knowledge relative to the species, I
shall exclude colours, at least when we speak of an earthy
or acid substance, as fugitive variable modifications foreign
to the type of the species which is the integrant molecule.
    " But I shall point out among these characters the spe
cific gravity expressed        numerically according to the result
of experiments,       and   note the hardness estimated by the
power which the body has to scratch another well known
substance employed to serve as a term of comparison.                Nor
will I omit the property of double or single refraction,
because   it belongs to the very basis of substances, although
it can be observed but very rarely when these substances are
in their natural state. The lustre will be sometimes referred

to, not so much with respect to its gr"ater or less intensity',
because in this respect it is too much subject to be modified
by accidental causes,            bul relatively to      a  certain aspect less
susceptible of being disguised by the effect of the same
causes, and which is, as it were, unctuous in certain mine
rals, and         pearly    in others, &c.        New    character's   will,  ac
cording to circumstances,               be associated    with the preceding,
such      as electricity by heal, or phosphorescence by the action
of fire.                                                           ,
     "   I shall endeavour to define precisely the character which
is inferred from the mechanical division of a mineral ; and
instead of confining myself to announce in general if it has
taken        place    in   one,   two,     or three    senses,   will    add   the
values of the angles which the natural joinings form among
 each other;— and these joinings being as the first data for
 attaining       the exact      determination, either of the primitive
 form, or of that of            the integrant molecule, it will be ne
 cessary      to indicate these forms,         a  knowledge of them being
 important         in order to form a       just idea  of the species.
     "   Finally,      I shall comprehend within the same view, the
 characters, the verification of which is reserved for agents
 which, like the acids and caloric, change the nature of a
 small part       of the substance, in order         to assist us in becoming
 acquainted         with  the  whole.
      "  So much for what concerns the species in general.                       It
 will afterwards be requisite to subdivide it ; and in order to
  this,    first to consider       the    varieties relative to the forms,
  as the most worthy           of attention.       Each of them will have
 its peculiar denomination and definition : and if this form
 is the produce of a regular crystallization, it will be cha
  racterized by an abridged sign * composed of letters and
  indications of the laws of decrement upon which it depends,
  which, added to an exact figure, will present the best of alb
  descriptions.          I shall add the respective incidences of its
  faces, determined by theoretical calculation, and in which
  properly resides the impression borne by a crystal of the spe
  cies to which it belongs.

    u In short,   the   modifications     relative  to colours,    trans-,
 parency, or opacity, will be indicated in their turns, and
will form as it were the last shades of the picture."
    Thus   a specific gravity of about triple that of water, a
hardness equal at most to that of such bodies as slightly
scratch glass, natural joints parallel to the faces and to the
bases of a regular hexahedral prism, the property of dissolv
ing without effervescence in the nitric acid, will easily as
certain that   a crystal provided with these properties belongs
to the species of phosphated lime; and if it is a regular
hexahedral prism terminated by hexahedral pyramids, the
faces   of which   are inclined to each other by about            129°*,
this particular character will point out the variety which I
denominate pyramidated .phosphated lime; and the conse
 quence already deduced from the specific character with re
 spect to the nature of the crystal observed, will even then
become an evidence, so much the more striking, that this
 measure of 129° would alone be sufficient for indicating a
 primitive form of phosphated lime; the analogous inclina
 tion being different in the forms of the same genus which
 belong to other species f. If the same crystal has trans
parency, if it is of an orange colour, as we find it in Spain,
 the indication of these accidental circumstances will com
 plete its denomination, and the observer can place it in his
 collection, with this inscription, phosphated lime, pyramidal
 orange- transparent.
    But this will not be a crystal ; it will be an irregular mass,
 in which the geometrical type of the species will have dis
appeared,     and the aspect     of it will excite a doubt in the ob
 server,  if what    he sees be not a coarse carbonated lime,
 similar to  what  we   call building-stone (pierre d batir).         His
doubts will be dispelled, when, having put a small fragment
of this  mass into the      nitric acid, he will obtain      a slow and
tranquil solution, or at the most accompanied oy a slight

themselves to him under the same aspect. But his sy
stem having accustomed him to examine objects    the                               by
eye  and touch, custom has produced an impression upon
his mind, which     awakened

     The point of view under which                       I         have considered mine
ralogy      in     this treatise,     required          that       the    reader       should        be

  T    ought not to omit how much                          I   am indebted to the in
telligence and assiduity                of    those who             have   tracedthe pro
jections relative to crystallography,                          and to the theories which
flow from mineralogical science. The idea of this great work
was conceived by M. Brochant, mining engineer, who has
begun to realize it. Several other engineers and scientific
men have endeavoured     to complete what he had begun.
M. Tremery, to whom belong, among other things, almost
all the projections depending upon calculation, which he
perfectly well understands, has carried into their execution
the intelligence and accuracy so necessary for' enabling the
eye easily to catch           the  positions of the different
                                        respective
lines, the constructions of which form the whole.   Messrs.
Cordier,   Lefroy, Gallois, Houry, Depuch, Cressac, Du-
cros, and Hericari, have also given proofs of zeal and talent,
in the drawing of figures which relate to the different classes
of minerals. Such is the masterly manner in which they have
represented, relative to a nucleus which has constantly the
same position, the different secondary forms which are so
many modifications of       that we perceive, as at one glance,
                                        it,
the relations of these forms, both with each other and with
their common nucleus                :     this   is   a   kmd of graphic treatise            of
the laws to which the structure                       is   subjected.
   The School of Mines                   has offered me another resource                     of
great value, on the subject of the very basis of my work.
Placed    an isolated situation for many years, and limited
             in

  what    I have given here.      But in the midst of this complica
  tion   of inquiries,   directed    towards so many various objects,
  there are always some which are attended with doubts, and
  there are details which either escape us or remain imperfect.

  I  found it to be placed in the same establishment with Gil-

  Coquebert,       Tonnellier, from whom I imbibed informa
  tion   and advice.     Several    important points have been fully
  and coolly     discussed   among us ; and when the sentiments
  which flow from         a perfect      intimacy are freely given in
  friendly discussions,      they produce reflections and observa
  tions of great value.       The conflict of opinions only paves
\ the way for a better understanding               among the disputants,
  and the cause     of true science is uniformly promoted by such
  discussions.

   After       having developed the laws of motion of bodies
  when actuated by known forces, the author proposes to as
  certain what should be the general cause of the celestial mo
  tions, in order to reconcile them with actual observations.
  Setting out therefore with the consideration of the ellip
  tical   motion    of  the   planets,     and    the  laws discovered by
  Kepler, he concludes that the force which attracts the planets
  and comets is directed towards the centre                of  the sun,   that
  it  is reciprocally  as the square      of their distances, and that it
   only differs in different bodies in proportion to these di
   stances.    The motion of the satellites around their planets
   presenting nearly the same phaenomena as that of the
   planets round the sun, the satellites are attracted towards
   the planets and the sun, by forces reciprocallv as the
   squares   of their distances.        This law      extends    to satellites,
                                     Gg4                               whose

  whose orbits have not yet been ascertained to be elliptic; and
   it follows from this, that, for each system of satellites, the
   squares   of    the times    of their revolutions        are as the cubes
, of their     mean distances      from the centre of the planet: the
  earth    having    but    one   satellite, we cannot apply this con
  sideration to it; but the author shows that, if we determine
  the lunar       parallax according to the terrestrial experiments
  upon gravity, and with the hypothesis that the recipro
  cal gravitation is as the square of the distance, the result
  obtained by this way is perfectly conformable to the observa
  tions, whence it follows, that the attractive force of the earth
  is the same as that of all the celestial bodies. These conclu
  sions give rise to several Important reflections, from which the
  author infers this general consequence, that the particles
  of matter    attract each other in the direct ratio         of the masses,
  and the inverse      ratio of the square of the distances.
      Conformably to this theory, the author establishes the
  differential equations which determine the motion of a
  system    of   bodies   subjected     to their mutual attraction,      and
  develops   the small       number of exact         integrals which they
  have hitherto been able to obtain           : as observation only makes
  us acquainted with the relative motions,                he gives the for
  mulae for the motion         of a system of bodies subject to the
  laws of gravitation round a body considered as the centre
  of their motions, and develops the exact integrals which we
  know how to deduce from them.                  In order to go further,
  recourse must be had to the methods of approximation,
  and we must profit by the facilities offered for this purpose
  by the constitution of the system of the world : the author
  shows that, according to this constitution, the satellites of
  the planets are moved nearly as if they only obeyed the
  action of the planet ; and the motion of the centre of gravity
  of a planet, and of its satellites, is very nearly the same as
  if  each  of  these bodies     was collected into its centre.       He af
  terwards proceeds        to inquire     into   the   attractive properties
  of spheroids,        and    establishes    some general propositions
  on this head, from which it follows that a point placed in
  the interior of a spheric stratum is equally atttacted from all
  parts, and that a point without the stratum is attracted by
                                                                           it

                               were
perties which also take place with respect to globes formed
of concentric layers, of density variable from the centre to
the circumference : the author inquires what are the laws of
attraction in which these effects subsist; and he proves that,
among the infinite number of laws which render the attrac
tion very small at great distances, the law of Nature is the
only one in which a spheric stratum attracts a point placed
without     as  it,was all collected to its centre
                          if   it                  he proves                           :
also, that this law             is    the only one in which the action                         of the

not being very considerable, the author previously gives as

partial differences, has the advantage of giving the arbitrary
quautiiies in functions of the co-ordinates, and of their first
differences, which is frequentlv useful       :  the author deduces
from it the relations which take place          between   these arbi
trarv quantities, and- the elements which determine the na
ture of the conic section and its position in space: finally,
ht ulcerates the differential equation which gives the time
in  a function of the radius vector;       and   the motion   of two
bodies is thus determmed by three equations, between the
eccentric anomaly, the true anomaly, the mean anomaly,
and the radius vector     of the orbit : these equations being of
a nttnre not capable     of being resolved except by approxima
tion,   the author details   some general    theorems upon the re
duction of lunctions into series; and applving these results
to the elliptical motion    of the planets, he deduces from them
the values   of  the eccentric anomalv,     the true anomaly,     and
of  the radius vector, in convergent series      of the sines and co
sines of the mean anomalv:          by referring the motion     of the
planet to a fixed     plane a little inclined to that   of  the orbit,
these series furnish the means       of determining by approxi
mation ihe latitude and longitude of the planet with respect
to the fixed plane, a? well as the projection of the radius of
tht orb t upon the same plane. The author explains the the
ory of motion      in  a very  eccentric ellipsis, and thence de
duces the    theory of    the  parabolic motion applicable to co
mes : he afterwards considers the hyperbolic motion; and
then arriving at Kepler's law, according to which the
squares of the revolutions of different planets are to each
other   as the cubes   of ihe transverse   axes   of their orbits, he
shous    that this law is not    accurately true, and that it only
takes place when we neglect the action of the planets upon
each other, and upon the sun, and when we consider their
masses as mfinitely small with respect to that of the sun.
He shows the use of these results in determining the ratios
ot ihe masses of the planets which have satellites, to the
mass of the sun.

                                                                orbits

   Analysis of the Micanique         Celeste  of M. La     Place.    475
orbits very much elongated, the author proceeds to determine
the elements of these orbits: he shows in the first place how
we might deduce them from the circumstances of primitive
motion, if these circumstances were known ; and it is re
markable that the direction of this motion does not influence
the nature of the conic section.          These researches       produce
the discovery of      the relation which exists between the trans
verse axis of the orbit, the chord of the elliptic arc, the
sum of the extreme radii vectores, and the time taken to de
scribe this arc.
   As  the observations do not make        known the circumstances
attending    the  primitive    motion   of  the celestial bodies, we
cannot determine from this supposition the elements of their
orbits : it is necessary for this purpose to compare their re
spective positions, observed at different epochs, with each
other  :  this is what we may do at all times with respect to
the planets, which we may observe without interruption ;
but it is not the case with comets, which are only visible to
us in that part of their orbit which is nearest to the sun : it
is important, therefore, to be able to determine the elements
of the orbit of a comet from the circumstances attending its
appearance. In order to attain this, the author in the first
place gives converging formulae, which make known for a
given time, and according to any number of adjacent ob
servations, the geocentric longitude and latitude of the co
met,   as  well  as  their first and   second  differences    divided by
the corresponding powers of the element of the time : he
shows that, by supposing these quantities to be known for a
given time in a system of bodies subjected to their mutual
attraction,    we may easily, and without the assistance           of in
tegration,    deduce therefrom the elements         of  the orbits.
    After having detailed these methods to the utmost extent
that is necessary, and given them all the perfection of which
they are susceptible ; attending also in a very simple manner             .
 to the eccentricity of the terrestrial orbit, the author applies
them to the case of Nature, in which the orbits of comets
are ellipses greatly elongated, which are sensibly confounded
with the     parabola     towards the perihelion,     which admits     of
 our considering       their transverse   axes as   infinite  : this cir

 cumstance, which makes known apriori one of the elements
 of ihe orbit, introducing a new equation, it follows from it
 that the determination of parabolic orbits of comets con
 duces to more equations than unknown quantities, which
 gives room for various methods                   of calculating them.            After
having ascertained              that method           which ought to give the
greatest precision,             the author enters upon the subject at                  full
length, and divides it into two pars: in the first he deter
mines nearly the perihelion distance of the comet, and the
time of its passage by the perihelion : in the second he gives
the method of correcting these two elements      by means of
three observations taken at a distance from each  other, and
he deduces all the others from them. There exists  a peculiar
ea«e in which the orbit of the comet may be rigorously
determined      :    it    is that     case    wherein
                                             comet has been the

     To Mr. Tilloch, — Sir,
In  benduig for your Magazine of March last     short essay         a

understand the subject,           I   beg to be allowed to trespass again
on your indulgence.
  I   am persuadedthat no person who has investigated the
Subject, will deny thai all water in motion descends an in
clined plane, and that bodies floating in it arc actuallv de
scending an inclined plane also, being influenced by two
causes in their progress ; first, by the motion communicated
to them by the fluid in which they float ; and secondly, by
their own weight arising from the inherent property of gra
vity, which, whether the body be more or less specifically
heavy, is immutable,   and peculiar to all matter. — In vacuo,
as every one knows,   a feather and a piece of gold will de
scend with equal velocity, and pass through equal spaces in
equal times ; but in air or water, the progress of bodies spe
cifically different, will vary according to their specific gra
vity; the lighter body, possessing less power to overcome
opposition, must of course be slower in its progress. — If
the wood and metal balls, which I mentioned, were let. fall
in vacuo, or if they were mathematically polished, and passed
down an inclined plane so polished and placed in vacuo, they
would both descend with the same velocity ; but in open air,
and on a rough surface, the heaviest body being possessed
of greater power, arising from a greater quantity of matter,
viz. from      greater    specific gravity,       it will    have     the greater
power in overcoming opposition,                  and will
                                            pass on with the
more rapid motion ; but still in both bodies the principle of
gravity is the same.
  Mr. B.         says that   1     in making a comparison
                                 am mistaken
between balls of different weights rolling down an inclined
plane, and barges or beams of different weights floating
down a running stream : that        as       is,
                                         understand him, he
                                                    I

Mr. B., that the air or atmosphere                 is   never perfectly at rest,
except when all its particles are in equilibria, which   sel               is
dom the case, and never generally so. Balls may meet cur
rents of air, or may overtake air moving slower 'than them
selves   :   in either   case, their motion must be retarded more or
                                                                             less,

    less, the same        as   beams floating in running water may be
    retarded     by encountering         irregular   or slower motions         in
    water.
        Mr. B. illustrates his opinion           by supposing       a  beam   of
    timber     loaded   at one      end, placed     in running water, and
   moving parallel       to itself, or, in other words, having an equal
   velocity at both ends. But this is absolutely impossible in
   the nature of things. The beam thus loaded cannot preserve
   its parallelism for an instant. It must obey the laws of gra
   vity,   and    instantaneously begin to change its situation, the
   heavy end getting foremost.              It would be just as impossible
   that such a loaded beam could preserve its parallelism, as
   that a ruler loaded at one end, and placed parallel on an in
   clined plane, should rest in that position, or that a cone
   should keep in such          a situation without force. —Mr. B. says
   again,
             " If a   beam      should meet any resistance, that end
  which     is heaviest    will   oppose     it with  the   greatest   effect."
   Certainly,      because it contains the greatest        quantity of mat
  ter : But will not the heavier end            always go foremost with
  out any resistance ? In considering this subject, allowance
  must be made for currents, eddies, &c. ; but to understand
  it the more clearly, it would be best to consider the floating
  bodies as passing down a regular stream.
      Mr. B.     seems to me to confound weight, which is only
  the result     of gravity, and of a greater quantity of matter,
 with gravity itself; for though one end of a beam be heavier
 than the other, and the beam consequently will float with
 the heavier end foremost,            yet the inherent      and   inseparable
 property of gravity         is the same in both ends       of  the beam.
                              I am, sir, your obedient servant,
                                                                     G. Obr.
      P. S.  I  do conceive that all bodies floating with the stream,
and which have a heavy and light end,                will become    depressed
at their heavier end, and be borne parallel to the                   plane on
which the water moves, — in all such cases adapting them
selves to the inclination            of the plane or bed on which the
water runs.

   analytical    Researches      on   the Nature    of certain Bodies,

                            I. Introduction.
In   the following pages,       I shall do  myself the honour        of lay
ing before the Royal Society, an account of the                   results of
the different experiments, made with the hopes of extending
our knowledge of ihe principles of bodies by the new powers
and methods arising from           the applications      of electricity to
chemistry, some of which have been long in progress, and
others of which have been instituted since their last session.
   The objects which have principally occupied my attention,
are the elementary matter         of ammonia, the nature of phos
phorus, sulphur, charcoal, and the diamond, and the con
stituents of the boracic, fluoric, and muriatic acids.
   Amongst the numerous processes of decomposition, which
I have attempted, many have been successful ; and from
those which have failed, some new phaenomena have usually
resulted   which may possibly serve as guides in future in
quiries.    On this account, I shall keep back no part of the
investigation, and I shall trust to the candour of the Society
for an excuse for its imperfection.
   The more approaches are made in chemical inquiries to
wards the refined analysis of bodies, the greater are the ob
stacles which     present    themselves, and the less perfect the
results.
   All  the difficulties which occur in analysing            a    body, are
direct proofs of     the   energy of attraction of its constituent
parts.    In the play of affinities with respect to secondary
compounds even, it rarely occurs that any perfectly pure or
unmixed substance is obtained           ; and the principle applies still
more strongly to primary combinations.

 can be drawn.
 II.   Experiments an the Action of Potassium ort Ammonia,
      and Observations on the Nature of these two Bodies.
     In  the Bakerian lecture, which        I had the honour     of read
ing before the Society, November 19, 1807, I mentioned
 that, in heating potassium strongly in ammonia, I found that
 there was a considerable increase of Volume of the gas, that
hydrogen and nitrogen were produced, and that the potas
sium appeared to be oxidated ; but this experiment, as I had
not been able to examine the residuum with -accuracy, I did
not publish. I stated it as an evidence, which I intended to
pursue more fully, of the existence of oxygen in ammonia.
    In  a paper read before      the Royal Society last     June, which
they have done me the honour             of printing,   I have given an
account of various experiments on the amalgam from am
monia,      discovered by Messrs. Berzelius and Pont in, and in
a note attached       to this communication         I ventured to con
trovert an     opinion    of  MM.     Gay  Lussac   and Thenard, with
respect to     the agency of potassium and ammonia, even on
their own statement         of facts,  as detailed in the Moniteur for
May 27, 1808.
    The general obscurity belonging to          these refined objects of
research, their importance and connection with the whole
of chemical theory, have induced me since that time to ap
ply to them no inconsiderable degree of labour and attention ;
and the results of my inquiries will, I trust, be found not
only to confirm my former conclusions ; but likewise to offer
some novel views.
    In  the first  of   these series of" operations on the action      of
potassium on ammonia, I used retorts of the green glass ;               I
then, suspecting oxygen might be derived from the metallic
oxides in the green glass, employed retorts of plate glass ;
and last    of all, I   fastened the potassium upon trays        of pla-
tina, or iron, which were          introduced into the glass retorts
                                                               furnished

 furnished with stop cocks.            These retorts were exhausted            by
 an excellent air pump,           they were filled with          hydrogen, ex
 hausted      a second time, and then filled with ammonia from
 an appropriate mercurial gas holder*.                   In this way the gas
 was operated upon in a high degree of purity, which was
always ascertained ; and all the operations performed out. of
the contact of mercury, waUr, or any substances that could
interfere with the results.
      I at first employed potassium procured by electricity ; but
I   soon substituted for it the metal obtained by the action of
ignited iron upon potash, in tho happy method discovered by
MM. Gay Lussac and Thenard, finding that it gave the
same results, and could be obtained               of  an uniform quality       f,
and in infinitely        larger quantities, and with much less labour
and expense.
     When ammonia            js brought in contact with about twice its
weight of potassium              at common        temperatures, the metal
loses its lustre and becomes white, there is a slight diminu
tion in the volume of the gas ; but no other effects are pro
duced. The white crust examined proves to be potash, and
the ammonia is found to contain a small quantity of hydro
gen, usually not more than equal in volume to the metal.
On heating the potassium in the gas, by means of a spirit
lamp applied to the bottom of the retort, the colour of the
crust is seen to change from white to a bright azure, and
this gradually passes through shades of bright blue and green
into dark olive. The crust and the metal then fuse together;
there is a considerable effervescence,              and the crust passing
    *  A  representation of the instruments will be given in the next Number
of our Magazine.
    f  When the potash used for procuring potassium in this operation was
very pure^and the iron turnings likewise very pure and clean, and the whole
apparatus free from any foreign matters, the metal produced differed very
little, in its properties, from that obtained by the Voltaic battery. Its lustre,
ductility, and inflammability were similar.     It9 point of fusion and specific
gravity were, however, a little higher, it requiring nearly 130° of Fahren
heit to render it perfectly fluid, and being to water as 7960 to 10000, at 60"
Fahrenheit.      This I am inclined to attribute to  its- containing a minute pro
portion of iron.

482                 On some new analytical Researches
off    to   the    sides,  suffers  the   brilliant surface of         the    po
tassium to appear. When the potassium is cooled in this
state, it is again covered with the white crust. By heating a
second time, it swells considerably, becomes porous, and
appears crystallized, and of a beautiful azure tint ; the same
series    of   phoenomena,       as those  before described, occur in            a
 continuation         of the process,     and   it is finally entirely con
 verted into the dark olive- coloured substance.
     In this operation,       as has been stated by     MM.       Gay Lussac
 and Thenard,          a gas  which gives      the   same    diminution by
 detonation        with oxygen      as  hydrogen is evolved',         and am
 monia disappears.
      The proportion        of  the  ammonia       which loses       its elastic
 form,      as  I  have found by numerous trials,           varies according
 as the gas employed contains more or less moisture.
      Thus eight grains of polassium, during             its conversion       into
 the     olive-coloured      substance, in ammonia            saturated      with
 water at 63° Fahrenheit,           and under a pressure         equal    to that
 of 29'8 inches of mercury,             had caused the disappearance             of
  twelve cubical inches and          a half of ammonia        ;   but the same
 quantity of ntetal acted upon under similar circumstances,
  except thai the ammonia had been deprived of as much
  moisture      as  possible by exposure for two days to potash that
  had been ignited, occasioned a disappearance                  of sixteen cu
  bical inches of the volatile alkali.
      Whatever be the degree of moisture of the gas, the quan
  tities of inflammable gas generated have always appeared to me
  to be equal for equal quantities of metal. MM. Gay Lussac
  and Thenard are said to have stated,              that the proportions in
  their experiment were the same as would have resulted                      from
  the    action of water upon potassium.                 In my trials, they
  have been rather less.           Thus, in an experiment conducted
  with    every possible attention to accuracy             of manipulation,
  eight giains of potassium generated, by their operation upon
  water, eight cubical inches and a half of hydrogen gas : and
  eight grains from the same mass, by their action upon am
  monia, produced eight cubical inches and one-eighth of in
   flammable gas. This difference is inconsiderable; yet I have
                                                                           always

                 on the Nature      of certain Bodies.                 483
 always found it to exist, even in cases where the ammonia
 has been in great excess, and every part of the metal appa
 rently converted into the olive-coloured substance.
    No other account of the experiments of MM. Gay Lus-
 sac and Thenard has, 1 believe, as yet been received in this
 country,    except    that in   the   Moniteur already referred to ;
 and in this no mention is made            of the properties of the sub
 stance produced       by the   action of ammonia on potassium.
 Having examined          them  minutely and found them curious,
 I shall generally describe them.
    1. It is crystallized,     and presents      irregular facets, which
 are extremely dark,        and in colour and       lustre not unlike the
protoxide of iron ; it is opaque when examined in large
masses, but is semi-transparent in thin films, and appears
 of a bright brown colour by transmitted light.
    2. It is fusible    at a heat a  little above that of boiling water,
and if heated much higher, emits globules of gas.
    3. It appears to be considerably heavier than water, for it
sinks rapidly in oil of sassafras.
    4. It  is a non-conductor        of electricity.
    5. When it      is melted   in oxygen gas, it burns with great
vividness, emitting bright sparks. Oxygen is absorbed, ni
trogen is emitted, and potash, which from its great fusibility
seems to contain water, is formed.
    6. When brought in contact with water, it                 acts upon it
with much energy, produces heat, and often inflammation,
and evolves ammonia.            When thrown upon water, it dis
appears with a hissing noise, and globules from it often
move in     a state  of ignition     upon the surface of the water.
It rapidly effervesces and deliquesces in air, but can be pre
served under naphtha, in which, however, it softens slowly,
and seems partially to dissolve.            When it     is plunged under
water filling an inverted jar, by means of              a  proper tube, it
disappears     instantly with effervescence,           and the non -ab
sorbable elastic fluid liberated is found to be hydrogen gas.
   By far the greatest part of the ponderable matter of the
ammonia,      that disappears in the experiment of its action
upon   potassium,      evidently exists in the dark fusible product.
On weighing a tray containing six grains of potassium, be
                                   ll   h 2                           fore

484               On some new analytical Researches
 fore and after the process, the volatile alkali employed having
 been very dry, I found that it had increased more than two
 grains ; the rapidity with which the product acts upon mois
 ture, prevented me from determining the point with great
 minuteness ; but I doubt not, that the weight of the olive-
 coloured substance        and  of   the hydrogen disengaged precisely
  equals the weight of the potassium, and ammonia consumed.
      MM. Gay Lussac and Thenard* are said to have procured
  from the fusible substance, by the application of a strong
  heat, two fifths of the quantity of ammonia that had disap
  peared in their first process, and a quantity of hydrogen and
  nitrogen in the proportions in which they exist in ammonia,
  equal to one fifth more.
      My results     have been very different,         and the reasons     will,
  I  trust, be immediately obvious.
      When the retort containing the fusible                 substance is ex
  hausted, filled with hydrogen and exhausted a second time,
  and heat gradually applied, the substance soon fuses, effer
  vesces,    and, as the heat increases, gives off a considerable
  quantity of elastic fluid, and becomes at length, when the
  temperature approaches nearly to dull redness, a dark gray
  solid, which, by a continuance of this degree of heat, does
  not undergo any alteration.
      In an experiment, in which eight grains of potassium had
  absorbed sixteen cubical inches of well dried ammonia in a
  glass retort,    the fusible substance gave             off twelve cubical
  inches and half of gas, by being heated nearly to redness,
  and this gas analysed, was found to consist of three quarters
  of a cubical inch of ammonia, and the remainder of elastic
  fluids, which, when mixed with oxygen gas in the proportion
  of 6}   to 6, and acted upon by the electric spark, diminished
  to 5t.    The   temperature      of   the atmosphere,       in this process,
  was 57° Fahrenheit,        and the pressure        equalled that of 30- 1
  inches    of mercury.
      In  a similar experiment, in which the platina tray contain
  ing   the  fusible substance was heated in a polished iron tube,
     * No notice is taken of the
                                 apparatus used by MM. G.iy Lussac and The-
.nard in the Moniteur; bjt, from the tcnour of the details, it seems that they
 must have operated in glass vessels in the way heretofore adopted over mercury.
                                                                          filled

                      on the Nature     of certain Bodies.                 485
 filled    with   hydrogen gas,       and connected with a pneumatic
 apparatus     containing very dry mercury, the quantity of elastic
 fluid given off, all the corrections being made, equalled thir
 teen cubical inches and three quarters, and of these a cubical
inch was ammonia;             and   the   residual gas, and the gas in
 troduced into the tube being accounted for, it appeared that
 the elastic fluid generated, destructible by detonation with
oxygen, was to the indestructible elastic fluid, as 2\5 to 1.
     In this process, the heat applied approached to the dull
 red heat.      The mercury, in the thermometer, stood at 62°
 Fahrenheit,       and that in the barometer at 30-3 inches.
     In various experiments on different quantities of the fu
 sible substance, in some of which the heat was applied to
the tray in the green glass retort, and in others, after it had
been introduced into the iron tube ; and in which the tem
 perature     was sometimes raised slowly and sometimes              quickly,
 the comparative         results   were   so near  these that    I have de
 tailed,   as to render     any statement     of them superfluous.
     A  little more ammonia,          and   rather a larger proportion of
 inflammable gas*, were in all instances evolved when the
iron tube was used, which I am inclined to attribute to the
 following circumstances.              When the tray was brought
 through the atmosphere to be introduced into the iron tube,
the fusible substance absorbed a small quantity of moisture
from the air, which is connected with the production of an*»
monia.        And in the        process    of heating in the retort, the
green glass was blackened,            and I found that it contained a
very small quantity of the oxides of lead and iron, which
must have caused the disappearance of a small quantity of
hydrogen.
     MM. Gay        Lussac and Thenard,        it appears from the state
ment, had brought the fusible substance in contact with
mercury, which must have given to it some moisture; and
whenever this is the case, it furnishes by heat variable
quantities of ammonia.             In one instance, in which I heated
the fusible substance from nine grains of potassium, in a
    * The average of six experiments made in a tube of iron, is 2-4 of inflam
mable gas to 1 of uninflammable.     The average of three made in green glass
retorts, is 2-3 to 1.

49fl              On some new analytical Researches
retort that had been filled with mercury in its common state
of dryness, I obtained seven cubical inches of ammonia as
the    first product; and in another experiment which had
been made with eight grains, and in which moisture was
purposely introduced, I obtained nearly nine cubical inches
of ammonia, and only four of the mixed gases.
     I am inclined to believe, .that if moisture could              be intro
duced only in the          proper proportion, the quantity of am
monia generated, would be exactly equal to that which dis
appeared in the first process.
    This    idea is confirmed by the trials which           I have made, by
hesting the fusible substance with potash, containing its wa
ter of crystallization,       and muriate of lime partially dried*.
    In both these cases, ammonia was generated with great
rapidity, and no other gas, but a minute quantity of inflam
mable gas, evolved, which was condensed by detonation                     with
oxygen with the same phaenomena as pure hydrogen.
     In one instance, in which thirteen cubical inches of am
monia had disappeared, T obtained nearly eleven and three
quarters, by the agency of the water of the potash ; the quan
tity of inflammable gas generated, was less than four tenths
of a cubical inch.
     In another, in which          fourteen cubical        inches had been
absorbed,       I procured by       the   operation of      the   moisture of
muriate      of lime, nearly      eleven cubical inches        of volatile   al
kali,     and  half   a  cubical inch      of inflammable       gas ; and the
differences, there is every reason to believe, were owing to
an excess of water in the salts, by which some of the gas
was absorbed.
     Whenever,       in experiments on the fusible substance, it has
been procured from ammonia saturated with moisture, I have
 always found that more ammonia is generated from it by
mere heat ; and the general          tenour of the experiments inclines
 me to believe, that the small quantity, produced in experi-
    * If water, in its common form, is b'rought in contact with the fusible sub
 stance, it is impossible to regulate the quantity, so as to gain conclusive re
 sults, and a very slight excess of water causes the disappearance of a very
 large quantity of the ammonia generated. In potash and muriate of lime, in
 certain states of dryness, the water is too strongly attracted by the saline
 matter to be given off, except for the purpose of generating the ammonia.
                                                                         ments

of moisture furnished by              the hydrogen gas introduced, and
that the fusible            substance, heated out of the presence of
moisture,  is incapable of producing volatile alkali.
  MM. Gay Lussac and Thenard, it is stated, after having
obtained three fifths of the ammonia or its elements that had
disappeared in their experiment, by heating the product,
procured the remaining two fifths, by adding water to the
residuum, which after this operation was found to be potash.
No notice           is taken    of   the properties       of this residuum, which,
as the details          seem to relate to a single experiment, probably
was not examined ; nor,                  as   moisture was present at the be
ginning of their operations, could any                         accurate       knowledge     of
its nature have been gained.
   I have made the residuum                    of   the       fusible substance          after
it   has been exposed             to a dull red heat,           out of the contact of
moisture,            an object    of particular study,           and      I   shall detail its
general           properties.

that      of plumbago.
     2. It        is opaque     even in the thinnest films.
     3. It        is very brittle,     and affords a deep gray powder.
     4.    It     is a conductor      of electricity.
     5.    It     does not fuse at a low red heat,                and when raised to
this temperature, in contact with plate glass, it blackens the
glass, and a grayish sublimate rises from      which likewise       it,
blackens the glass.
     6.   When        exposed to air at common temperatures,                      it   usually
takes fire immediately,                and burns with           a   deep red light.
     7.   When        it   is   acted upon      by    water,     it    heats,    effervesces

   LXXXVI.          On the Agency     of Electricity    on  Animal    Secre
       tions.     By Wm. H. Wollaston, M.D.,                   Sec.  R.S.
  At the        time when    Mr. Davy     first communicated to me his
   important experiments on the separation and transfer of che
   mical agents by means of the Voltaic apparatus, which was in
   the autumn       of  1 806,   I was forcibly struck     with  the proba
   bility that     animal   secretions were affected by the agency of
  a similar electric     power; since the existence of this power
   in some animals was fully proved by the phenomena of the
  Torpedo, and of the Gymnotus Electricus ; and since the
   universal prevalence of similar powers of lower intensity in
   other animals was rendered highly probable by the extreme
   suddenness with which the nervous influence is communi
   cated from one part of the living system to another.
       And though      the separation    of chemical agents,      as  well as
   their transfer to a distance, and             their transition through
   solids, and through fluids which might be expected to op
   pose their progress, had not then been effected but by power
   ful batteries i yet Ll appeared highly probable that the weakest
   electric energies might be capable of producing the same
   effects, Jhough more slowly in proportion to the weakness
   of  the powers employed.
       I accordingly at that time made an experiment for eluci
   dating this hypothesis, and communicated it to Mr. Daw
   and to others      of my friends.      But though it     was conclusive
   with   regard to the sufficiency       of  very   feeble  powers, it did
   not appear deserving of publication, until I               could adduce
   some evidence of the actual employment of such means in
   the animal oeconmy.
      As   I  am   not accustomed      to making experiments on        living
                                                                    animals,

                          Animal Secretions.                        489
animals,     I had deferred    pursuing the application of my the
ory, until it was again brought back to my mind by finding
that the same thought had occurred to Dr. Young.                   And
as  it has already been printed some         months in the Syllabus
of his Course of Medical Lectures, I had for the present re
linquished all thoughts of recording conjectures, which, if
not well founded, might retard the progress of science.
   But since some experiments relating to the same inquiry
are now about to be published by Mr. Home, it may perhaps
be of use to add my experiment to the general stock of in
formation,      although I have not myself improved upon it by
any further consideration, and am not yet enabled to con
firm the hypothesis, which it appeared to support, by any
new arguments.
   The experiment        was conducted as follows     :
   I   took  a piece  of glass tube about   three quarters   of an inch
in diameter and nearly two inches long, open at both ends,
and covered one of them with a piece of clean bladder. Into
this little vessel I poured some water in which I had dis
solved -i-J-g- of its weight of salt; and after placing it upon a
shilling with the bladder slightly moistened externally, I
bent a wire of zinc so, that while one extremity rested on
the shilling the other might be immersed about an inch in
the water. By successive examination of the external sur
face   of the bladder,    I found that   even this feeble power oc
casioned soda to be separated         from   the water, and to tran
sude through the substance of the bladder.           The presence of
alkali was discernible by the application       of reddened     litmus-
paper after two or three minutes, and was generally mani
fest even by the test of turmeric before five minutes had ex
pired.
   The efficacy of powers so feeble as are here called into
action, tends to confirm the conjecture that similar agents
may be instrumental in effecting the various animal secre
tions, which have not yet been otherwise explained.                 The
qualities of each secreted fluid may hereafter instruct us as
to the species     of electricity that prevails in      each  organ of
the body.
   For instance,      the  general  redundance of acid in urine,
                                                                though

  4 90     Report   of the City and Finsbury Dispensaries.
  though Secreted from blood that is known to be alkaline,
  appears to indicate in the kidneys a state of positive electri
  city ; and since the proportion of alkali in bile seems to be
  greater than is contained in the blood       of  the same animal,      it
 is not improbable that the secreting vessels         of   the liver may
 be comparatively negative.
     With such views of       the vital functions it becomes       an  in
 teresting subject of inquiry, what other organs may              also be
 considered    as  permanently different in their state of electri
 city,   and what others may possibly be subject to temporary
 states  of opposite electric energies,      and may,       by means of
 such relation, produce the most powerful effects in the ani
 mal ceconomy.

   492         Report   of the City and Finsbury Dispensaries.
       Dissection. — A small quantity of a yellowish fluid                was
   found in each         cavity of the thorax ; the mediastinum was
   attached       only to the right side of the sternum ; the heart
   was placed on the right side, and no part of that organ
   reached heyond the middle of the sternum ; the right lung
   very small, but divided into three lobes.
v
      The left cavity of        the thorax contained the small and part
   of   the    large  intestines, which had protruded through an
  opening       in  the  diaphragm of a sufficient size to admit of
   their being essily retracted ; the left lung was also very small,
   but divided into two lobes.
      The cavities of        the heart were natural ; the foramen ovale
  of   its usual appearance        ;   the  canalis arteriosus was large ;
  the pulmonary           vessels were small, particularly on the left
  side, corresponding          to the diminished      state of the lung.
      The    vessels from the curve         of  the   aorta  and intercostals
  were     distributed      as usual ; the phrenic, coejic, emulgent,
  spermatic,        and  umbilical    vessels were natural ; the trunk of
  the superior mesenteric artery was continued through the
  opening of the diaphragm to supply the abdominal viscera
  that    had     protruded into the thorax ; the inferior mesenteric
  and     the    vessels   going to the lower extremities were distri
  buted in the usual manner.
      The liver      was   large ; the     gall-bladder and vessels were
  perfect    ;    the   spleen,      pancreas    and stomach were well
 formed      ;   the duodenum         ascended     in its course   across the
 spine to the opening in the diaphragm                ;  the jejunum ilium,
 caecum,        ascending and transverse           colon, were situated in
  the thorax,        where they appear to have been formed, as from
 the attachment of the mediastinum aniJ size of the lung
 there could not have been any viscera to have occupied the
 left cavity      of the chest.
     The descending colon             passed through      the same opening
 into the abdomen over the left kidney,                 and formed the sig
 moid flexion on the brim of the pelvis, and terminated in
the rectum.
     The superior part of the left kidney was opposed to the
opening in the diaphragm, and could be seen from the tho
 rax on raising the intestines.
                                                                         The

   The child     was much above the standard size,              but the ex
ternal parts of the body were well formed.
   Death ensued in consequence of the diminished capacity
of the lungs, their organs not being of sufficient size to ad
mit air in quantity sufficient for the continuance of respira-
tion.
   The preparation, and drawings made from the same, are
preserved in my museum, and may be seen by any person
who is desirous.

    June 1. — The president in the chair. The conclusion of
 Dr. Henry's paper on the decomposition of ammonia was
 read. The result of the author's present experiments led him
 to perceive some errors in those of his preceding paper,
 and to conclude that the oxygen which he had disengaged
 from ammonia by electrization was derived from other
 bodies, and not from the ammonia ; consequently that am
 monia should not yet be considered as an oxide.
    Mr. Davy    read  some  remarks on     Dr. Henry's experi
ments, which tended to prove that the composition of am
monia cannot be ascertained till the nature of nitrogen is
determined. Dr. H. thought the proportion of hydrogen in
ammonia,     as determined by  Mr. Davy,    rather low,  and es
timated it at 72 hydrogen and 28 nitrogen, instead of 74
hydrogen and 26 nitrogen ; but Mr. D. having repeated his
experiments, found them very nearly correct, and took
73 — 27 as the truth.
    An ingenious paper by     the  Rev.  Mr. Lax, professor of
astronomy at Cambridge, was read, on the means of gra
duating and correcting mathematical instruments.        The au
thor uses Carey's semi-circle of a foot diameter, corrects it
by microscopes and observations, and adjusts it so as to
counteract the expansion and contraction by change of tem
perature.
   June  8. — Dr. Wollaston  read a paper proving the identity
of columbium    and tantalium,   the former discovered   by Mr.
Hatchett» the latter by the Swedish     chemist Ekeberg.     Dr.
                                                        W.  pro

 W.     procured some grains of the original specimens from the
British Museum, and from Mr. Hatchett ; and notwith
 standing the smallness of the quantity, he succeeded in
 proving them to be radically the same metal.
      Dr. Wollaston also read another ingenious paper discover
 ing a method of constructing a gonyometer for measuring
  the angles of crystals by means of reflection, with micro
 scopes, which enable the observer to ascertain accurately
 the angles of crystals, whether rough or smooth.              Dr. W.
 applied this useful instrument, of which a drawing was ex
 hibited, to crystals of carbonate of lime.
      A mathematical paper by Mr. Ivory was laid before the
  Society.
      June   1.5- — A.  paper  by Sir James    Earle   was   read,    de
  scribing   a stone   in the  bladder, which occupied its whole
  contents,     and weighed 4-i ounces.
       The Society for improving       animal chemistry furnished a
  paper by     Mr. Brande, detailing    the results  of a series   of  ex
  periments on animal mucus and           albumen exposed        to   gal
   vanic electricity.
       A paper by   Dr. Pearson, on expectorated matter, was read.
   It  appears   from  the Doctor's experiments, that the different
   kinds of expectorated matter differ rather in the proportion of
   the ingredients than in kind. They all consist of albuminous
   matter, water, and the two principal ingredients are muriate
   of soda and potash neutralized by animal oxide, if not by
   a destructible    acid, besides a small proportion of phosphate
   of lime, ammonia, carbonate of. lime, and probably phos
   phate of magnesia and siliceous earth.           The Doctor an
   nounces that potash neutralized by animal matter is con
    tained in the blood, and in most or all of the secreted and ex
   creted fluids,    namely, in dropsical water, pus, both that se
    creted without breach     of surface as well as that of abscesses,
   and in the urine,     &c. He    has not found the soda, as repre
    sented by former chemists, to impregnate the animal fluids ;
    and this he seems to think might have been concluded a
   priori, because it is admitted on all hands, that almost every
1
    kind of    vegetable   food contains the potash united to some
    matter destructible by fire, which is not the case of soda ;
                                                                       and

  496                            Royal Society.
 and that   it is  as  little likely the potash should be altered by di
 gestion, as the muriate of soda itself so constantly taken with
 our food. It is worthy of remark, that the potash is in much
 larger proportion in expectorated matter than in the serum
 of  the blood; so much so, that expectorated matter when
 exsiccated commonly shows signs of deliquescence on ex
 posure to the air.
    June   22. —   A    letter from    Mr. T. A. Knight       was  read,   on
 the relative    influence of      the male and female on the size and
 character of the offspring.            Contrary to the opinion of Lin
naeus, Mr.       K.   considers     the  female as influencing      the size
and character, but opposes             Mr. Cline's opinion, that large
females     should       be   used   for   breeding ; because, although
their legs will be longer in proportion to the size of the foe
 tus, yet their bodies will want the due proportion of depth
and thickness, and the animal will be less vigorous and
powerful.       Thus, for instance, foals of large mares and
small horses have the chest thin and narrow, whereas the
contrary is the case with those of small mares and large
horses. Mules from large mares the author found unser
viceable from their want of proportion, and consequently
want of strength.
    The Society for improving animal chemistry furnished a
paper by Mr. Home, on animal secretions. Mr. H. formed
some plausible conjectures on the probable effects                of electri
city in assisting the secretion of blood, serum, albumen,
and the other animal fluids. He was induced to this opinion
by examining the electric eel, and the immense quantity of
nerves which appear necessary to produce the electric power.
    Some interesting additional observations by Messrs. Pepy>
and    Allen   were read,       on the azote disengaged by respira
tion.     The authors in all their experiments on this subject
found that     a  considerable quantity of oxygen was lost in the
process    of  respiration, and that azote was formed ; that an
animal can breathe oxygen and hydrogen an hour without
any inconvenience, but that hydrogen alone occasions sleepi
ness.     The term azote, they observe, is an indefinite name
for all gas that is incombustible,                irrespirable, and inab-
sorbable by water ; but, from Professors Davy and Berze
                                                                       Iius's

                       French National Institute.
                                                                      497
  lius's experiments) they
                                conjecture that it is really    of  a mc~
  taltic origin.
     An additional account of M. De Luc's
                                                           atmospherical
 electroscope was read, and also some

     Astronomy. — The French astronomers, who                are now in
 possession   of excellent instruments and methods of
                                                                 singular
perfection, have not allowed any
                                         opportunity to escape of
 practising upon these instruments and these
                                                            methods all
the amelioration which reflection aided
                                                by long practice can
suggest. There were grounds for
                                             supposing, that in the
 construction of telescopes all possible
                                                    combinations had
been exhausted. In fact, the
                                    great mirror is necessarily con
cave, in order to collect under one
                                             and the same point all
the rays of light which it reflects
                                          ; but the second
                                                                   mirror
may be concave, as in Gregory's telescope,
                                                      plain as in New
ton's, or convex as in Cassegrain's ; in
                                                 short, we may sup
press this second mirror as proposed
                                                 by Lemaire, and so
happily accomplished by M. Herschel.
    Instead of these four plans, all of
                                               which have their ad
vantages and disadvantages, M. Burckhardt has
                                                            proposed to
substitute a fifth, which should have in
                                                       addition all the
merit of facility and of convenience.

focus of the great mirror, i. e. towards the upper extremity
of the tube, which renders it inconvenient to observe under
many circumstances, particularly in large telescopes, he
places it perpendicularly to the axis, and towards the half of
its length.    In this place the section of the reflected cone of
light is a circle, the diameter of which is precisely the half
of that of the great mirror : it will therefore intercept a
fourth part of the direct rays ; but M. Burckhardt remedies'
this loss by giving a larger dimension to the first mirror.
The retrenched cone assumes a reverse position : the rays,
instead of uniting, as they would have done, beyond the
plain mirror, are collected at an equal distance, but in front,
and pass through an aperture made in the centre of the great
mirror, in the space which, as we have seen, receives no
direct ray, and which is consequently useless for assisting
vision. The advantage of this construction consists in re
ducing the length of the telescope one half, which thereby
becomes easier to manage, and less costly.       It' the diameter
of the concave mirror is a little larger, the central part which
should have a hole requires qo trouble ; it is sufficient that
the speculum, the only useful part, should receive the cur
vature necessary for the distinctness of the image ; and when
it was really a little difficult to render it very exact, we might
make up for     it,since we have only       single mirror to curve,
                                                a
and because the plain mirror, on account of its dimension
being   little larger than in the Newtonian telescope, fur
         a
nishes easier and more precise verifications.  The observer
should be placed at the lower part and behind the great mir
ror,    as with Gregory's       telescope,     which   is     the   most con
venient position for following star continually changing
                                         a
its place. Finally, M. Burckhardt has calculated, setting            by
out from the measurements of Newton himself, that tele                    a
scope    of eight   metres in focal length,         reduced    in this way to
the actual length of four metres, would have three times
more light than    common telescope of four metres, and
                      a
would have     very valuable advantage over the latter for
               a
micrometrical       measurements, on account            of the double         di
stance   of its focus.
  Before putting his new idea                into execution,        M. Burck
                                                                          hardt

                       French Natwnal Institute.                 499
  hardt fairly discussed it. Several objections were started      : —
  the result was, however, that the idea deserved a trial.        M.
   Caroche undertook to make the plain mirror proposed by
  M. Burckhardt,       and to adapt it to a telescope the great
  mirror of which      was two metres in focal length, and the
  aperture about a sixth of its length.
     The invention of Borda's circle, from its exactitude, light
  ness, and     moderate price, forms an interesting period in
  the progress of modern astronomy.            The utility and con
  venience of this instrument for geodesic operations is uni
  versally acknowledged : it is admitted to be superior to every
  thing for fundamental and delicate researches, in which the
  necessity is felt of multiplying angles in order to attain the
  utmost precision.       Thus, in order to determine the altitude
  of  the pole, the obliquity of the ecliptic, the equinoctial and
  solstitial points, the declinations of the most brilliant stars
  which are not too close to. the zenith, and finally for refrac
  tions,   Borda's   circle seems preferable to the largest mural
  or entire circles which are not repeating.          It is therefore
  doing   a real service  to extend    to new objects the utility of
  so precise an instrument      :  we may also employ it in the de
  termination of the hour by absolute altitudes either of the
  »un or stars.    The astronomers who have recently measured
  the   meridian of Dunkirk         and Barcelona,  have already  de
  rived the    advantage     of   thereby  regulating their pendu
  lums ; they have supposed that in the interval of four or six
 minutes, during which four or six observations may he
 made, the altitude increases uniformly in proportion to the
  interval  of time    ; and thus we may without any risk take a
 medium       between four or six consecutive observations,      and
 treat them, by taking a simple arithmetical method, as we
 would treat a single observation. M. Delambre, in fact, as
 certained that there was no sensible error when          the obser
vations regularly succeeded each other; which is most com
 monly the case.        As the contrary, however, may sometimes
happen also, he had sought for a method of correcting the
small error of supposition and of these various methods ;
he has only published one, which, however, he had never
oocasion to make use of. These methods may also be applied

 to the observation of the distances from a star to a terrestrial
 object for the determination of the azimuths.                   M. Burck-
bardt has contrived           a new one, which he discovered         by twice
differencing the formulae of the altitudes.              The correction of
the second differences is proportional to the square of the
variation of the horary angle multiplied by a constant. Thii
square may           be taken in the table which         M. Delambre has
given    ; and     immediately we easily determine the correction,
 having     precise results for the hour, notwithstanding                 thK
 inequalities of motion in the altitude.
    In the observations of a star before and after its passage
to the meridian, in order to have the. meridian height, we
lhay   suppose       the declination    constant      when   a  star or evert
the sun is observed about the time of the solstices                ;  but to
wards the equinoxes in particular, we must take an account
of the variation in declinations ; and M. Delambre has also
given on this head a formula of a convenient application
to all the planets, and even to the moon.                   M. Burckhardt
now gives another, still simpler, since it merely consists in
adding to the mean altitude the motion in declination be
tween the mean instant and the passage to the meridian ;
but this seems to require more rigorously an equal number
 of observations before and after the passage, as well as equa
lity among the corresponding horary angles.
    The parallax of right ascension requires a second correc
tion when the moon is under observation ; M. Burckhardt
 reduces it into tables of an equally convenient construction
 and application; he is the first who examined this problem,
 by means of which Borda's circle will give the meridian al
 titudes of the moon with the same precision as that of the
 stars, the declination of which has no sensible motion.
    When      a   star is very distinct,     like the sun and      moon,    it
 is easy to bring it into the object glass for each               successive
 observation       ;  but when it is      a star, we experience greater
 difficulties   :    the   use of the azimuth circle, intended for
 these inquiries,        is tedious and inconvenient      ;  we may see    in
 the meridian the various methods resorted to by                M. Delam
 bre.     M.   Burckhardt        proposes   a moveable      arc  of a circle,
 which    he attaches       to the azimuth      circle with   a screw,    and
                                                                       which

    I.  On Deal Pendulum Rods.             By Mr. E. Walker.
     To Mr. Tilcoch, — Sir,
As my      paper,  containing a short abstract of the rates of
going of clocks with wooden pendulum rods, may appear to
some of your readers a communication of too little impor
tance   to obtain a place in the Philosophical Magazine, it
may not be improper to observe, that it is only from such
registers we can judge how much one time-keeper is prefer
able to another.      For, who would believe, without having
recourse to facts, that clocks with deal pendulum rods per
form nearly as well as the transit clock at the Royal Obser
vatory  ?
   The performance of my clock shows               some     properties in
pendulums with deal rods, which differ from those composed
ef rods of different metals, to counteract the effects of heat
and cold.  — It evidently      appears from my former         paper* :
   First, That this clock lost of      true time at     oneseassnof the
year and gained at another.
   Secondly, That twice every year it went true time : and,
   Thirdly, That those variations took place regularly during
eight years.                                «
   The   same paper also shows,        that there is very little diffe
rence in the rates    of the four pendulums, although they were
made by different artists at different times, and consequently
that they were made out of different pieces of wood.

      Now, the sum of           the   last     column in the above table di
  vided by 6, gives the mean annual variation in the daily rate
  of the transit clock at Greenwich for six years = 3-9".
      And thus the mean annual variation of my clock is found
   for the same number, of years = 5-4l". Consequently the
   transit clock at the Royal Observatory went only l"5l" per
   annum nearer true time, than a clock with a pendulum rod
   of wood. — Nor       is this a matter that need astonish any one
   who    understands      the construction of the two pendulums.

 ought always to be avoided in any compensation applied to
 time-keepers : and moreover, the length of the pendulum
 may be increased by its own weight ; indeed, the great num
 ber of times     that the bob   of the transit clock  at the Royal
 Observatory has been raised,       renders  this supposition more
 than probable.
    In  a pendulum with     a  wooden rod there is no friction ; and
as my pendulum was not altered during six successive years,
except by the vicissitudes of dryness and moisture, the
 weight   of  the bob or lens     had no tendency to increase    the
length of     the rod.    And it may be further observed, . that,
as the cleaning of the clock made no alteration in its daily
 rate, it seems probable that the pendulum is the only part of
it which measures the time into equal portions.
    It may not be foreign to, my subject to explain the hy
grometer which I made use of to determine that the length
 of this pendulum was altered by dryness and moisture, not
by heat and cold.
    It is not necessary that we should always have recourse to
philosophical instruments to investigate the operations of
Nature; for instruments         made for ordinary purposes may
sometimes, by common observation, lead us to new truths.
    My clock stands in a room in which there has been no
fire for many years. In this situation the clock case, which
is made    of mahogany, acts as a hygrometer. For in the
driest season of the year the door is so contracted as not
to touch one side of the case ; but when the atmosphere is
very moist the door is so much increased in breadth that it
cannot be opened, without using a force which might alter
the rate of the clock.
    When    the door was too little for -the clock case, the clock
always gained of true time, but it always lost when the door
could not be opened. Hence it is evident, that a damp at
mosphere, which increased the breadth of the clock case
door, increased the length of the pendulum rod ; and a dry
atmosphere, which contracted the breadth of the door, con
tracted, at the same time, the deal rod of the pendulum.

    larly the Alkalies, Phosphorus, Sulphur, Carbonaceous

As     an inflammable gas alone, having the obvious properties
of hydrogen     is given    off during   the action    of potassium upon
ammonia,      and as nothing but gases apparently the same             as
hydrogen and nitrogen,          nearly in the proportions in which
they exist in volatile alkali, are evolved during the exposure
of the compound to the degree of heat which I have speci
fied ; and as the residual substance produces ammonia                with
a little hydrogen by the action         of water, it occurred     to me,
that, on the principles of the antiphlogistic theory, it ought
to be a compound of potassium, a little oxygen and nitro
gen, or a combination of a suboxide of potassium and nitro
gen; for the hydrogen disengaged in the operations of which
it was the result, nearly equalled the whole quantity con
tained in the ammonia employed ; and it was easy to explain
the fact of the reproduction of the ammonia by water, on
the supposition, that by combination with one portion of
the oxygen of the water> the oxide of potassium became pot
ash, and by combination with another portion and its hydro
gen, the nitrogen was converted into volatile alkali.
    With a view to ascertain this point, I made several expe
riments on various residuums, procured in the way that I
have just stated, from the action of equal quantities of potas
 sium on dry ammonia in platina trays, each portion of metal
equalling six grains.
     In the first trials, I   endeavoured      to ascertain the quantity
 of ammonia      generated    by the action of water upon a resi
 duum,    by heating it with muriate         of lime or potash partially
 deprived   of moisture     ; and after several trials, many of which
failed, I succeeded      in  obtaining four cubical inches and a half
•f ammonia. In three other cases, where there was reason
                                                                        to

                  On some new analytical Researches.                   %
  to suspect a small excess of water, the quantities of am
 monia were three cubical inches and a half, three and eight
 tenths, and four and two tenths.
     These experiments were performed in the iron tube used
 for the former process ; the tray was not withdrawn ; but
 the salt introduced in powder, and the apparatus exhausted
 as  before, then filled with hydrogen, and then gently heated
 in   a small portable forge.
    Having     ascertained    what quantity   of ammonia    was given
«?ff   from the residuum,      I endeavoured to discover what quan
 tity   of nitrogen it produced in combustion, and what quan
 tity of oxygen it absorbed. The methods that I employed,
 were by introducing        the trays into vessels filled with oxygen
 gas     over mercury.       The product often inflamed spon
 taneously,      and  could  always be made to burn by a slight de
 gree    of heat.
     In   the trial that T  regard as the most accurate, two cubical
 inches and a half      of oxygen    were absorbed, and only a cubi
 cal inch and one-tenth         of nitrogen evolved.
     Surprised at the    smallness of the quantity of the nitrogen,
 I  sought for aimmonia in the products of these operations ;
 but various trials convinced me that none was formed.               I
 examined the solid substances           produced, expecting nitrous
 acid ; but the matter proved to be dry potash, apparently
 pure, and not affording the slightest traces of acid.
     The quantity of nitrogen existing in       the ammonia,    which
 this residuum would have produced by the action of water,               /
 supposing the volatile alkali decomposed by electricity, would
 have equalled at least two cubical inches and a quarter.
     I  heated the same proportions       of residuum with the redj
oxide of mercury, and the red           oxide of lead in vacuo, ex
pecting that when oxygen was            supplied in a gradual way,
the result might be different from that         of combustion    ; but
in neither of      these cases did the quantity   of nitrogen  exceed
a cubical inch and a half.
    But on what could this loss of nitrogen depend ; Had it
entered into any       unknown form with oxygen ; or did it not
really exist in the residuum in the same quantity, as in the
ammonia produced from it           ?
                                     A4                       I hoped

8                On some new analytical          Researches
   I hoped that an experiment of exposing the residuum to
intense heat might enlighten the inquiry.                I distilled one of
the portions which had been covered with naphtha, in a tube
of wrought platina        made      lor the purpose. The tube had
been   exhausted     and    filled with hydrogen, and exhausted
again, and was then connected with a pneumatic mercurial
apparatus. Heat was at first sl6wly applied till the naphtha
had been driven over.           It  was then raised     rapidly by an ex
cellent forge. When the tube became                   cherry red, gas was
developed    ; it continued to be generated            for some minutes.
When     the   tube   had    received     the   most intense heat that
could be applied, the operation was stopped. The quantity
of gas collected, making the proper corrections and reduc
tions, would have been three cubical inches and a haJfat
the mean temperature arid pressure.                Twelve measures of it
were mixed with six        of oxygen      gas,   the electrical spark was
passed    through the      mixture;      a strong inflammation           took
place,  the  diminution      was    to three   measures   and   a  half,  and
the residuum contained oxygen.               This experiment was re
peated upon different quantities with             the  same   comparative
results.
   In examining      the platina tube, which had a screw adapted
to it at the lower extremity, by means of which it could
be opened, the lower part was found to contain potash,
which had all the properties of the pure alkali, and iu the
upper part there was a quantity of potassium. Water poured
into the tube produced a violent heat and inflammation,
but no smell of ammonia;
   This result    was so unexpected and so extraordinary,                 that
I at first supposed     there was some source           of error.      [   had
calculated    upon procuring nitrogen as the only aeriform
product ; I obtained an elastic fluid which gave much more
diminution by detonation with oxygen, than that produced
from ammonia by electricity.
   I now made the experiment, by heating the entire fusible
substance, from six grains of potassium which had absorbed
twelve cubical inches of ammonia, in the iron tube, in the
manner before described.             The heat was gradually raised to
whiteness,     and   the   gas     collected   in two portions.           The
                                                                       whole

                    on the Nature      of certain Bodies.                    g
whole quantity generated,             making the usual corrections for
temperature        and pressure,     and the portion of hydrogen ori
ginally in the tube, and             the residuum, would have been
f ourteen cubical inches and a half at the mean degree of the
barometer and thermometer.                  Of these, nearly a cubical
inch was ammonia              and the remainder      a gas,  of which      the
portion destructible by detonation with oxygen,                    was to the
indestructible portion, as 2*7 to 1.
    The lower       part   of the tube, where      the heat had      been  in
tense, was found surrounded with potash in a vitreous form ;
the upper part contained a considerable quantity                    of potas
sium.
    In another similar experiment,              made    expressly for the
purposes of ascertaining          the quantity   of potassium recovered,
the same elastic products were             evolved.    The tube was suf
fered to cool, the stop-cock              being open in contact with
mercury, it was filled with mercury,              and the mercury dis
placed     by water      ;  when   two  cubical  inches   and three quar
 ters of hydrogen gas were generated,             which proved that at
least two grains and a half of potassium had been revived.
    Now,      if a  calculation be made upon the products in these
operations, considering them as nitrogen and hydrogen, and
taking the common standard of temperature and pressure, it
will   be found,      that by the decomposition         of  11    cubical in
ches    of ammonia equal to 2*05 grains, there is generated 3*6
 cubical inches of nitrogen, equal to 1*06 grains, and 9*9
.cubical inches of hydrogen, which added to that disengaged
in the first operation equal to about 6* 1 cubical inches, arc
together equal to *382 grains; and the oxygen added to 3*5
 grains of potassium would be *6 grains, and the whole
amount is 2*04 grains ; and 2*05 — 2*04 = •01 .                      But the
 same    quantity       of ammonia,         decomposed      by electricity,
 would have given 5-5 cubical inches             of nitrogen equal to i;*(;
grains, and only 14           cubical inches of hydrogen* equal to
 •33, and allowing the separation of oxygen in this process
 in water, it cannot be estimated at more than *11 or *12.
     So that    if the analysis    of ammonia     by electricity at all ap
proaches towards accuracy ; in the process just described,

   10            On some new analytical Researches
  there is a considerable loss   of nitrogen, and a production   of
  oxygen and inflammable gas.
     And in the action of water upon the residuum, in the ex
  periment page 42, there is an apparent generation of nitro
  gen.
     How can    these extraordinary results be explained?
     The decomposition      and   composition of nitrogen seem
 proved, allowing the correctness of the data ; and one of its
 elements appears to be oxygen ; but what is its other ele
 mentary matter?
     Is the gas that appears to possess the properties  of hydro
 gen, a new species     of inflammable aeriform   substance ?
     Or  has nitrogen a metallic    basis which alloys with    the
 iron or platina  ?
    Or is water alike the ponderable matter of nitrogen, hy
drogen, and oxygen ?
    Or is nitrogen a compound of hydrogen with a larger pro
portion of oxygen than exists in water ?        •
    These important questions, the two first of which seem
the least likely to be answered in the affirmative, from the
correspondence between the weight of the ammonia decom
posed, and the products, supposing them to be known sub
stances, I shall use every effort to solve by new labours,
and I hope soon to be able to communicate the results of
further experiments on the subject to the Society.
    As the inquiry now stands, it is however sufficiently de
monstrative, that the opinion which I had ventured to form
respecting the decomposition of ammonia in this experiment,
is correct; and that MM. Gay Lussac's and Thcnard's idea
of the decomposition of the potassium, and their theory of
its being compounded of hydrogen and potash, are unfounded.
    For a considerable part of the potassium is recovered un
altered, and in the entire decomposition of the fusible sub
stance, there is only a small excess of hydrogen above that
existing in the ammonia acted upon.
    The mere phenomena of the process likewise, if minutely
examined, prove the same thing.
    After the first slight effervescence, owing to the water ab
sorbed by the potash formed        upon the potassium during it*

exposure to the air, the operation proceeds with the greatest
tranquillity. No elastic fluid is given off from the potas
sium    it often appears covered with the olive-coloured sub
           ;
stance, and as if it were evolving hydrogen; this must pass
through the fluid ; but even to the end of the operation, no
such appearance              occurs.
   The crystallized            and spongy substance, formed in the first
part of the process,            I am   inclined to consider      as a combina
tion of ammonium                and potassium,         for it emits a smell of
ammonia when exposed to air, and                         is considerably       lighter
than potassium.
   1 at first thought that             a   solid compound of hydrogen and
potassium might be generated                    in the first part of this opera
tion  but experiments on the immediate action of potassium
       :
and hydrogen did not favour this opinion.   Potassium, as                             I
ventured to conclude in the Bakerian Lecture for 1807*, is
                                                                                 very
  *    MM.     Gay Lussac and Thenard seem to be of a different opinion. In the
Moniteur, to which I have     so often referred, it is related, that these distin
guished chemists, exposing hydrogen to potassium at a high temperature,
found that the hydrogen was absorbed, and that it formed a compound with
the potassium of a light gray colour, from which hydrogen was capable of
being obtained by the action of water or mercury.
  After a number of trials, I have not been able to witness this result. In an
experiment which I made in the presence of Mr. Pepys, and which I have
often repeated, and twice before a numerous assembly, in retorts of plate
glass, four grains of potassium were heated in fourteen cubical inches of pure
hydrogen.    At first, white fumes arose and precipitated themselves in the
neck of the retort. When a considerable film of the precipitate had collected,
its colour appeared a bright gray, and after the first two or three minutes,
it ceased to be formed.
  The bottom of the retort was         heated   to redness,   when the potassium began
to sublime and condense on the sides.
  The process was stopped, and the retort suffered to cool. The absorption
was not equal to a quarter of a cubical inch. When the retort was broken,
the gas in passing into the atmosphere, produced an explosion with most vivid
light, and white fumes. The potassium remaining in the retort, and that
which had sublimed, seemed unaltered in their properties.
   The grayish substance inflamed by the action of water, but did not seem
*o be combinable with mercury.    I am inclined to attribute its formation to
the  agency of moisture suspended in the hydrogen, and to consider it as a
triple compound of potassium, oxygen, and hydrogen.

                  III. Analytical Experiments on Sulphur.
     I have      referred, on a former occasion*, to the experiments
metal, and in the process there Is an absorption both of hydrogen and oxy
gen.     It is likewise produced in experiments on the generation of potassium
by exposing potash to ignited iron, at the time (I believe) that common air is
admitted, during the cooling of the tube.
    It is non-oonducting, inflames spontaneously in air, and produces potash
and aqueous vapour by its combustion.
    When potassium is heated in hydrogen in a flint glass retort, or even for a
great length of time in a green glass r,etort, there is an absorption of the gas ;
but this is independent of the presence of potassium, and is owing to the ac
tion of the metallic oxides in the glass upon the hydrogen.
    If a solid compound of hydrogen and potassium could be formed, we might
expect its existence in the experiment with the gun-barrel, in which potas
sium is exposed to hydrogen at almost every temperature ; but the metal
formed in this process, when proper precautions are taken to exclude car
bonaceous matters, is uniform in its properties, and generates for equal quan
tities, equal proportions    of hydrogen by the action of water.
    The general phenomena of this operation, show indeed that the solution
of potassium in hydrogen is intimately connected with the general principle
of the decomposition, and confirm my first idea of the action of the two bodies.
    Hydrogen dissolves a large quantity of potassium by heat, but the greater
portion is precipitated on cooling. The attractions which determine the che
mical change, seem to be that of iron for oxygen, of iron for potassium, and
of hydrogen for potassium ; and in experiments, in which a very intense heat
is used for the production of potassium by iron, I have often found, that the
gas which comes over, though it has passed through a tube cooled by ice,
inflames spontaneously in the atmosphere, and burns with a most brilliant
light which is purple at the edges, and throws oft* a dense vapour containing
potash.
    Sodium appears to be almost insolubte in hydrogen, and this seems to be
one reason why it cannot be obtained, except in very minute quantities, in
the experiment with the gun-barrel.
    Sodium, though scarcely capable of being          dissolved in hydrogen  alone,
seems to be soluble in the compound        of hydrogen and potassium. By exposing
mixtures of potash and soda        to ignited iron, I have obtained some very cu
rious alloys ; which, whether the potassium or the sodium was in excess, were
 fluid at common temperatures.         The compound containing an excess of po
tassium     was even lighter than potassium (probably from its fluidity).       All
iliese alloys were in the highest degree inflammable.         When a globule of the
 fluid alloy was touched by a globule of mercury, they combined with a heat
 that singed the paper upon which the experiment was made, and formed,
 when cool, a solid so hard, as not to be cut by a knife.

of Mr. Clayfield          and   of M. Berthollet, jun., which                  seemed
to show that sulphur,                in its common            form,   contained hy
drogen.     Inconsidering the analytical powers of the Voltaic
apparatus, it  occurred to me, that though sulphur, from its
being a non-conductor, could not be expected to yield its
elements to the electrical attractions and repulsions of the
opposite surfaces, yet that the intense heat, connected with
the contact       of    these surfaces, might possibly effect some al
teration in       it,   and    tend to separate any elastic matter                   it   >
                                                                           *
might contain.
   On this idea some experiments were instituted in 1807-
A curved glass tube, having        platina wire hermetically
                                                    a
sealed in its upper extremity, was filled with sulphur. The
sulphur was melted over    spirit lamp; and
                                          a    proper con             a
nection being made with the Voltaic apparatus of one hun
dred plates of six inches, in great activity,  contact was            a
made in the sulphur                 by
                        means of another platina wire.  A
most brilliant spark, which appeared orange -coloured through
the sulphur, was produced, and      minute portion of elastic
                                                     a
fluid rose to the upper extremity of the tube. By continua                a
tion   of   the       for nearly an hour,
                   process                  globule equal to    a
about the tenth of an inch in diameter was obtained, which,
when examined, was found to be sulphuretted hydrogen.
  This result perfectly coincided with those which have been
just mentioned           ;    but    as       the   sulphur   that   I   had used was
merely in its common state, and as the ingenious experi
ments of Dr. Thomson have shown that sulphur in certain
forms may contain water,    did not venture, at that time,
                                          I
to form any conclusion upon the subject.
   In the summer of the present year,    repeated the experi
                                                          I
ment with every precaution.    The  sulphur that    employed              I
was Sicilian sulphur, that had been recently sublimed in                             a
retort filled with nitrogen gas, and that had been kept hot
till the moment that       was used.
                                it    The power applied was
that of the battery of  five hundred double plates of six inches,
highly charged.  In this case the action was most intense,
the heat strong, and the light extremely brilliant the sul                 ;
phur soon entered into ebullition, elastic matter was formed
in great quantities, much of which was permanent and the                   ;
                                                                               sulphur,

  Ft               On some new analytical Researches
 sulphur, from being of          a pure yellow,   became     of a deep red
 brown tint.
     The   gas,   as in the former instance,      proved to be sulphu
 retted hydrogen.         The platina wires were considerably acted
 upon;     the   sulphur, at its point of contact with them, had
obtained the power of reddening moistened litmus paper.
     I endeavoured       to ascertain   the  quantity    of sulphuretted
hydrogen evolved in this way from a             given quantity of sul
 phur, and for this purpose I electrized a quantity equal to
 about two hundred grains in an apparatus of the kind I have
just described,       and when the upper part        of the tube was   full
 of   gas,  I  suffered it to pass into     the   atmosphere ; so as to
 enable me to repeat the process.
    When       I operated    in this way, there seemed to be no limit
to the generation of elastic fluid, and in about two hours a
quantity had been evolved, which amounted to more than
five times the volume of the sulphur employed.                   From the
circumstances of the experiment, the last portion only could
be examined, and this proved to be sulphuretted hydrogen.
Towards the end of the process, the sulphur became ex
 tremely difficult of fusion, and almost opaque, and when
 cooled and broken, was found of a dirty brown colour.
     The experiments upon the union of sulphur and potas
 sium, which        I laid before the Society last year, prove that
 these bodies act upon each other with great energy, and that
 sulphuretted hydrogen is evolved in the process, with intense
 heat and     light.
     In heating potassium in contact with compound inflam
 mable substances,         such   as resin, wax, camphor, and fixed
oils in close       vessels out of the contact of the air, I found
 that a violent inflammation was occasioned, that hydrocar-
 bonate was evolved ; and that when the compound was not
 in   great excess,     a  substance was formed, spontaneously in
 flammable at common temperatures, the combustible mate
 rials of which were charcoal and potassium.
     Here was a strong analogy between the action                 of these
bodies and         sulphur on potassium.         Their physical proper
 ties likewise resemble        those   of sulphur   ; for  they agree in
 being     non-conductors,          whether  fluid   or  solid, in being
                                                               transparent

transparent when fluid, and semi-transparent when solid,
and highly retractive ; their affections by electricity are like
wise similar to those of sulphur ; for the oily bodies give out
hydrocarbonate by the agency of the Voltaic spark, and be
come brown, as if from the deposition of carbonaceous
matter.
  But     the resinous and       oily substances    are compounds    of a
small quantity of hydrogen and oxygen, with a large quan
tity of a carbonaceous basis. The existence of hydrogen in
sulphur is fully proved, and we have no right to consider a
substance, which can be produced from it in such large
quantities, merely as an accidental ingredient.
  The oily substances in combustion,             produce two or three
times their weight of           carbonic acid and some water ; I en
deavoured to ascertain whether              water was formed in the
combustion of sulphur in oxygen gas, dried by exposure to
potash but; in this case sulphureous acid is produced in
much larger quantities than sulphuric acid, and this last
product is condensed with great difficulty. In cases, however,
in which I have obtained, by applying artificial cold, a depo
sition of acid in the form of a film of dew in glass retorts out
of the contact of the atmosphere, in which sulphur            had been
burned in oxygen gas hygrometrically dry, it has              appeared
to me less tenacious and lighter than the common sulphuric
acid of commerce, which in the most concentrated form in
which     I   have seen   it,   namely,   at 1-855, gave abundance       of
hydrogen   as well as sulphur,  at the negative surface in the
Voltaic circuit, and hence evidently contained water.
  The reddening of the litmus paper,                 by
                                              sulphur that had
been acted on       by
                   Voltaic electricity, might be ascribed to its
containing some of the sulphuretted hydrogen formed        the      in
process   but
          ;   even the production of this gas, as will be im
mediately seen,      is   an evidence     of the existence of oxygen in
sulphur.
  In   my early experiments on potassium, procured      elec   by
tricity,I  heated small globules of potassium in large quan
tities of sulphuretted hydrogen, and    found that sulphuret
                                               I
of potash was formed        ;     but this might be owing to the water
                                                             dissolved

   16                On some new analytical         Researches
   dissolved in the gas, and         I  ventured to draw no conclusion
  till  I  had tried the experiment in an unobjectionable                manner.
      I  heated    four grains of potassium in a retort of the ca
  pacity     of  twenty cubical inches ; it had been filled after the
  usual processes of exhaustion with sulphuretted hydrogen,
  dried by means of muriate of lime that had been heated to
  whiteness ;      as  soon    as  the   potassium fused, white fumes
  were copiously emitted, and the potassium soon took fire,
  and burnt with a most brilliant flame, yellow in the centre
  and red towards the circumference              *.
     The diminution of the volume of                 the   elastic matter, in
  this operation, did not equal more than two cubical inches
  and a half.       A very small quantity of the residual gas only
 was absorbable         by water. The non-absorbable gas was hy
 drogen,       holding   a minute quantity of sulphur in solution.
     A yellow sublimate lined the upper part of the retort,
 which proved to be sulphur.               The solid matter formed was
 red at the surface like sulphuret of potash, but in the inte
 rior it was dark gray, like sulphuret of potassium. The
 piece of the retort containing it was introduced into ajar
 inverted over mercury, and acted upon by a small quantity
 of dense muriatic acid, diluted with an equal weight of
 water, when there were disengaged two cubical inches and a
 quarter of gas, which proved to be sulphuretted hydrogen.
     In another experiment, in which eight grains of potas
 sium were heated in a retort of the capacity of twenty cubi
cal inches, containing about nineteen cubical inches of sul
phuretted hydrogen, and a cubical inch of phosphuretted
hydrogen, which was introduced for the purpose of absorb
ing the oxygen of the small quantity of common air admit
ted by the stop-cock,           the inflammation       took place     as before,
there was a similar precipitation            of sulphur on the sides of
the retort ; the mass formed in the place of the potassium
was orange externally, and of a dark gray colour internally,
    * In  the Moniteur, May 27, 1808, in the account of MM. Gay Lutaac'i
and Thenard's experiments, it is mentioned, that potassium absorbs the sul
phur and a part of the hydrogen of sulphuretted hydrogen ; but the pheno
mena    of inflammation  is not mentionqd,  nor are the results described.
                                                                              as

                     on the Nature     of certain Bodies.       i       17
as in tl)e last instance;         and, when acted on by a little water
 holding    muriatic     acid   in  solution, there were evolved from
 it five cubical inches only of sulphuretted hydrogen.
     Both these experiments concur in proving the existence of
 a principle in sulphuretted          hydrogen, capable of destroying
 partially the inflammability of potassium, and of producing
 upon it all the effects of oxygen; for, had the potassium
 combined merely with pure combustible matter, it ought, as
 will be seen distinctly from what follows, to have evolved,
 by the action of the acid,          a volume of sulphuretted hydro
gen, at least equal to that of the hydrogen which an equal
 weight of uncombined potassium would have produced by
 its operation upon water.
     Sulphuretted hydrogen, as has been long known to che
 mists, may be formed by heating sulphur strongly in hydro
 gen gas.       I  heated four grains     of sulphur in a glass retort,
 containing       about twenty cubical inches of hydrogen, by
 means     of a   spirit lamp, and* pushed the heat nearly to red
 ness.    There was no perceptible change of volume in the gas
 after the process; the sulphur that had sublimed was unal
 tered in its properties, and about three cubical inches of an.
 elastic fluid absorbable by water were formed: the solution
 reddened litmus, and had all the properties of a solution of
 pure sulphuretted hydrogen.             Now     if we  suppose   sulphu
 retted hydrogen to be constituted by sulphur dissolved in its
 unaltered    state in hydrogen, and allow the existence of oxy
 gen   in  this  gas ; its existence must likewise be allowed in
 sulphur, for we have no right to assume that sulphur in sul
 phuretted hydrogen is combined with more oxygen than in
  its common        form   : it is well known, that when electrical
sparks are passed         through sulphuretted hydrogen, a consi
 derable portion of sulphur is separated without any alteration
 in the volume of the gas. This experiment I have made
 more than once, and           1  found that the sulphur obtained, in
 fusibility, combustibility,' and other sensible properties, did
.not perceptibly differ from common sublimed sulphur.
     According      10  these ideas,   the   intense ignition produced
 by the action of sulphur,           on potassium and sodium, must
 not be ascribed merely to the affinity of the metals of the

i6    Analytical     Researches on the Nature       of certain Bodies.
alkalies for its basis, but may be attributed likewise to the
ftgency of the oxygen that it contains.
   The minute examination of         the circumstances     of the action
of potassium     and sulphur likewise confirms these opinions.
   When two grains of potassium and             one  'of sulphur   were
heated gently in a green        glass   tube   filled with hydrogen,
and connected with         a  pneumatic      apparatus, there was a
most intense ignition produced by the action of the two
bodies, and one-eighth of a cubical inch of gas was disen
gaged, which was sulphuretted hydrogen.                 The compound
was exposed in a mercurial apparatus to the action of liquid
muriatic acid    ;  when   a cubical inch and quarter of aeriform
matter was produced,        which proved to be pure sulphuretted
hydrogen.
   The    same     experiment was repeated,          except   that four
grains    of  sulphur were employed instead of one. In this
case,   a quarter of a cubical inch of gas was disengaged du
ring  the  process of combination ; and when the compound
was acted upon.by muriatic acid, only three quarters of a
cubical inch of sulphuretted hydrogen was obtained.
   Now, sulphuret of      potash   produces sulphuretted hydrogen
by the    action    of an  acid ; and   if the sulphur had not con
tained oxygen, the hydrogen evolved by the action of the
potassium in both these experiments ought to have equalled
at least two cubical inches, and the whoJe quantity of sul
phuretted hydrogen ought to have been more : and that so
much less sulphuretted hydrogen was evolved in the second
experiment, can only be ascribed to the larger quantity of
oxygen furnished to the potassium by the larger quantity of
the sulphur.
   I have made several experiments          of this kind with similar
results. Whenever equal quantities of potassium were com
bined with unequal quantities of sulphur, and exposed after
wards to the action of muriatic acid, the largest quantity of
sulphuretted hydrogen was furnished by the product con
taining the smallest proportion of sulphur, and in no case
was the quantity of gas equal in volume to the quantity of
hydrogen which would have been produced by the mere
action   of potassium upon water.
                                                                  From

          An Inquiry into Terrestrial Phcenomena, &c.                  19
    From    the general  tenour  of these various facts,     it will not
be,   I  trust, unreasonable to assume,          that sulphur,     in its
common state, is      a compound of small quantities of oxygen
and hydrogen with a large quantity          of  a basis that   produces
the acids    of sulphur in combustion,        and  which, on account
of its strong attractions for other bodies, it will probably be
very difficult to obtain in its pure form.
   In metallic combinations even, it still probably retains its
oxygen and part of its hydrogen.            Metallic sulphurets can
only be partially decomposed by heat, and the small quantity
of sulphur evolved from them in this case when perfectly
dry and out of the contact of air, as I found in an experi
ment on the sulphurets of copper and iron, exists in its com
mon state, and acts upon potassium, and is affected by elec
tricity in the same manner as native sulphur.

.Having in my last paper offered           explanations of the nu
merous excavations which streams of fresh water have ef
fected on the surface     of our globe, I      am now to undertake,
in furtherance of my former engagement, an inquiry into
the terrestrial phenomena which the waters of the ocean
have left for our contemplation.
   Of   the whole surface    of  the earth the proportion       of land
is Supposed to be about a third only ; and from the gravitating
fluidity of water, which constantly disposes it to fall in the
lowest descending direction, until it reaches a hollow where
it  is equally    supported on all sides, it might seem rea
sonable to conclude that the present elevations of land are
barrier heights which the ocean never can have ascended,
and that its present limits are those by which it has ever been
circumscribed.      But this, like every other conclusion on na
tural effects without observation for its basis, is illusory and
                                  B  2                     erroneous ;

20         An Inquiry into    the Terrestrial Phcenomena
erroneous    ; and a very moderate    acquaintance with some of
the ordinary phaenomena of the earth will afford ample con
viction, that over every portion of our present existing con
tinents the waters of the ocean have rolled during a period to
which we can assign no limit.
    Proofs of this extraordinary occurrence are abundantly
disseminated over every part of every country.          Wherever
the earth has been penetrated, a succession of strata alter
nating and varying, distinctly and specifically, is met with
Under forms which unequivocally demonstrate that they have
all originated from aqueous deposition ; and the vast remains
 of marine productions,       so extensively distributed amongst
 some,     and   in others forming whole and distinct strata,
 equally establish, that they have had one common origin.
 They have all in succession been beds of the ocean.      Nor has
 any limit yet been discovered, by any natural or artificial
 means of examination, to this peculiar conformation of our
 globe.     The high fronts and deep ravines and gullies of
 mountains,     the abrupt faces of precipitous valleys, shores,
 and islands, the natural cavernous excavations and the arti
 ficial perforations of every description, which have been dug
 by the avaricious cupidity or the necessary wants of man,
 all and every where display regularly stratified beds, generally
 parallel with each other, but always varying in their dimen
 sions, density and materials, and every where exhibiting a
 uniformity of appearance, which admits of no other expla
  nation than that of a slow and progressive precipitation from
  an aqueous    fluid.
     This universal    prevalence   of the formation   of strata  in
  the interior  of  the earth, is again most singularly contrasted
  by the indubitable evidence of an almost equally extensive
  destruction of other strata on the surface. The elevated di
  rection and abrupt termination of extensive strata from va
  rious heights, conclusively establish that they were once
  continuous to an unknown extent. Many of our principal
  eminences are formed by strata inclined from the horizon,
   and terminating in high angular asperities, presenting from
   thence a bold precipitous face, and on the other side gentle
   declivities of receding strata.
                                                                 The

               produced by the Action       of the  Ocean.            21
   The   extensive   denudations     of numerous districts laying
bare the identical      strata,  which in the vicinity are found
reposing under vast depths of other incumbent strata, leave
us without doubt that the superincumbent materials, how
ever massive and onerous, have been swept away from off
the denudated tracts. A similar disruption, but on a yet
more extended scale, is forcibly inculcated by these singu
lar eminences of isolated material which cannot be identified
with any of the surrounding strata, and which are, therefore,
only the remaining patches of the stratum to which they
formerly belonged. But the most stupendous proofs of de
structive disruption, are to be found in the numerous and
highly elevated ranges of stratified mountains, whose forma
tion, while it perfectly accords with, can admit of no other
explanation than that of their being the remaining fragments
of extensive countries which have disappeared.                And here
again,   as  we were constrained to refer the formation of all
the strata to the action      of the   sea, we are    in like manner
compelled to assign their disruptive transportation to the          only
natural agents whose gigantic forces and pow ers of mobility
are in any degree commensurate to such mighty perform
ances, — -the numerous       and sweeping currents     of the ocean.
   Let us now turn to the sea itself, and endeavour to ascer
tain the nature of its present beds, and the changes which
they are experiencing from the mighty effects of its powerful
agency. The active and interested concerns of commerce
have occasioned       such extensive and       accurate    soundings to
be taken    of  vast and various tracts     of  the sea,   that we have
from thence actually acquired a more correct knowledge of
extensive regions over which the ocean is incessantly rolling,
than of many portions of those countries which emerged
from   its waves     so many centuries ago; and          from these    it
has been     fully ascertaine'd,   that extensive horizontal      plains
are as rare below     as   above  the great     receptacle of waters,
and   that inequalities, in every         respect similar, prevail in
both regions, of banks, hollows, declivities,           and elevations,
from the least perceptible rise, up to the precipitous fronts
of unfathomable rocks. With ihis corresponding similitude
of surface there has also been discovered an equally corre-
                                   B  3                        sponding

42        An Inquiry into        the Terrestrial  Pkoenomena
spending agreement in the conformation of its beds ; and so
fully has the identity in both cases been established, that,
were any extent of the present bottom of the ocean laid dry,
and allowed      a sufficient time to      consolidate and   acquire a
vegetable covering, there can be no question that it would
exhibit all the diversified exterior, and all the internal con
formation,     of our   present inhabited countries.
    We   also  know that      the boltom    of the  sea is continually
receiving large accessions of earthy and other materials, con
veyed into it by rivers and land floods. Even in some of the
rivers  of our own country, the turbid waters of a summer's
flood may be seen distinctly spreading themselves out for
miles after their entrance into the sea; and, were an estima
tion practicable, the annua! quantity spread over the beds of
the neighbouring sea, by such a river only, would be found
very considerable indeed : but if we take into the estimation
the accumulated produce of all the rivers on the globe, the
annual accession must be immense ; and this increase, re
peated through a succession           of innumerable   ages,  must add
incalculable masses       of  fresh and various material to extensive
tracts beneath      the sea.       It may be worth remarking by the
way, that nearly the whole of the materials carried by this
 mode into the sea is from the surface, and consequently
 from the     richest part of the soil, abounding in a large pro
 portion of vegetable and animal remains; and it would cer
 tainly be at express variance with every other provident and
 ©economical provision of Nature, to imagine that this daily
 deterioration of our        lands has no other ultimate purpose
 than to incumber         the   fathomless deeps with endless suc
 cession of superfluous waste.
     But though this vast addition to the beds of the ocean is
 of itself a sufficiently important consideration in the present
 inquiry,   it is,  1 conceive, comparatively with other agency^
 but  a trivial source of terrestrial alteration ; and I think we
  can only look to the numerous and impetuous marine cur
  rents, sweeping with ponderous attrition, and irresistible
 force, over the abraded beds of the sea, for the cause of these
  stupendous phaenomena, which arrest our attention and ele
 vate our astonishment in geological research.
                                                                      It

                   produced by the Action           of the   Ocean.          23
      It is obvious to imagine, and strictly consonant with all
    our experience to believe, that a current of the ocean press
    ing with a weight and force of which we can form no esti
    mate, and for a duration which eludes              all calculation, over
    extensive tracts        of    sea beds,    abounding in every variety of
    inequality, must carry off immense quantities of materials,
    and transport them to distant situations, where they will be
    extensively precipitated in nearly the same order in which
    they were taken up, and will, therefore, in their new situa
    tions, form other strata not greatly dissimilar from those
    which were broken up. It will also readily occur, that all
    the superior eminences in the course of the current will
    experience a far more extraordinary degree of force and vio
    lence than those parts which lie lower ; and that in all these
    eminences abounding in strata of rock, the fronts which face
    the current will be laid bare and beaten into bold angular
    abruptions, while the opposite sides, protected by the emi
    nences, will fall off in gentle declivities, precisely similar to
    what we actually observe in all the hilly districts of every
    country, where the precipitous faces and declivous sides
    so wonderfully coincide in the same respective direction.
    This singular and interesting uniformity in the direction of
    the abrupt and declivous sides of the elevations of almost
    every country, frequently ranging to an unknown extent,
    is entirely an effect which a vast marine current would ne
    cessarily produce on all the eminences in its course ; and it            is,
I      think, utterly inexplicable            by
                                      any other natural agency.
        One of the principal currents with which we are acquaint
    ed, is  that stupendous movement of waters in the Atlantic
    Ocean which        is  nautically designated the Gulf Stream. It
    originates   in   the diurnal rotation and centrifugal force of the
    earth, aided      by    the        giving the waters of the
                                   trade   winds,
    main ocean an impulsive direction from east to west     and       ;      a
"
    portion of this vast movement being finally impelled into the
    Mexican Gulf,        glanced off from thence through the
                            is
    Straits of Bahama, with an impetus which hurries       over       it     a
    breadth of fifty miles, at four miles an hour, to the far              di
    stant banks of Newfoundland,     where    can still be clearly
                                                       it

  24         An Inquiry into     the Terrestrial  Phenomena
  this   extensive circuit    of moving     waters   from   the   Indian
  ocean round into the northern seas,         if  we  justly   appretiate
  the length of its duration, the incalculable weight with which
  it must incessantly press against all opposing obstacles, the
  countless inequality of depths over which it must roll, and
  the extensive tracts of various and yielding strata subject to
  its constant attrition, it will surely be consonant to all our
  experience and analogous reasoning, to believe that it is now
  progressively transporting extensive beds of strata from one
  distant region to another, and beating into high abrupt
  fronts many of the more exalted eminences in its course,
  insomuch that, were its whoJe tract laid open to our in
  spection, it would unquestionably exhibit proofs of disrup
  tion, denudation, transition, and all the bolder phaenomena
  of geology with which         we are already familiar.     The exist
  ence    of  the  extensive   banks of Newfoundland         is of itself
  sufficient to establish this. These banks are situated amongst
  the last expiring eddies of the stream, where the most con
  siderable precipitous depositions might be expected ; and the
  countless myriads ot fish, resorting thither for food, are
  proofs of the amazing quantities of vegetable and animal re
  mains brought by the stream.
      Though this current is certainly one of the most extensive
  on our globe, there are many others far superior in their
  rapidity, and consequently in their forces ; and indeed so
/ numerous are the currents of the ocean, and so diversified in
  their powers and direction, that we can assign no imaginable
  limits either   to the variety or the magnitude of their effects.
  Even the general tides are in themselves powerful and ex
  tensive currents ; and when aided by those occasional and
  terrible tempests which all seas are more or less subject to,
  their alterative effects must be such, as we have no sufficient
  data to estimate.
      It would certainly     be a superficial objection to the exten
   sive transportation    of  strata by marine currents,     to say that  "
   the turbid waters     surcharged with the earthy materials do
   not appear at the surface. The fact is not strictly so ; for
   the Gulf stream is palpably darker than the sea which it
   traverses,   and many currents      of  the   ocean  are   absolutely
                                                                  turbid.

                                                                      25
turbid. But it is not necessary to insist on this circumstance ;
for the transportation which I contend for is not such a
sudden disruption as would give to the current all the muddy
opacity of a land flood, but such a gradual and progressive
attrition, as, in carrying off the materials, the propulsion of
the water and the superior gravity of the transported parti
cles would effectually prevent from appearing at the surface.
    The extensive transportation      and spread     of  the various ex
terior materials   of our globe,     are facts   of which     we are as
certain   as of the light   and heat   of the solar     luminary   ; and
it  is equally certain that the medium      of   those vast transitions
can be no other than the ocean itself.            It  should also seem
to follow from the fairest inductive reasoning, that its cur
rents, while they are the most simple and natural, are also
the only marine agency at all equal and applicable to such
stupendous effects.
    Were it objected that the transportation and formation of
strata by marine currents must be local like the currents
themselves, it is only necessary to observe, that the mate
rials of all our present countries are so evidently the remain
ing fragments of the waste and disintegration of other
countries, which no longer exist, and bear such palpable
characters of such frequent interchanges and successions of
land and water, as remove all locality of such currents far
beyond the reach of geological determination.
    Such, Mr. Editor, are a few of the principal data which
authorize our identifying the present operations of the ocean
with its former action on our continents, when they too
                         '«                  The limits of your
were bottoms of the         vasty deep."                             very
 select publication   have necessarily circumscribed the present
 outline of  so extended a subject : but however brief and im
perfect it may be, it is an indispensable preliminary to that
investigation of the general phenomena of geology, which
my first paper announced ; and in my next I shall pursue the
 subject by continuing to trace those probabilities, for they
 are yet no higher in the scale of evidence, which encourage
 us to imagine that our globe, in common             with all its mul-
 tifarious   and  interesting   species   of production,       possesses
                                                                  within

IV. An     Account      of                   performed with a
                               some Experiments,
     View to ascertain the most advantageous Method of con
     structing a Voltaic Apparatus, for the Purposes of Chemi-
     ealResearch.    Bi/Jqhh George Children, Esq., F.R.S.*
The      late interesting discoveries by        Mr. Davy having shown
the high importance of the Voltaic battery as an instrument
of chemical analysis, it became a desirable object to ascer-
                                              it,   by
                                           which the greatest
ta'n that mode of constructing
effect may be produced,   with the least waste of power and
expense.
  For this purpose,     made a battery, on the new method,
                          I
with plates of copper and zinc, connected together     leaden             by
straps, soldered on the top of each pair of plates; which  are
                                                          two              by
twenty in number, and each plate four feet high,
feet wide   :       of all the surfaces being 92160 square
                the sum
inches, exclusive of the single plate at each end of the bat
tery. The trough     made of wood, with wooden partitions
                          is
well covered with cement, to render them perfectly tight, so
that no water can flow from one cell to another.   The bat
tery was charged with   mixture of three parts fuming ni
                                a
trous, and one part sulphuric acid, diluted with thirty parts
of water, and the quantity used was 120 gallons.
   In the presence, and with the kind assistance of Messrs.
Davy, Allen,        and Pepys,       the following experiments were
made.
   Experiment     Eighteen inches of platina wire, of -feth
                    1
                    .
of an inch diameter, were completely fused in about twenty
seconds.
            »
                From Philosophical   Transactions for 1809,   Part   I.
                                                                               Exp.

             on the Construction     of a Voltaic Apparatus.             27
    Exp.      2. Three feet    of  the   same    wire were heated to a
bright red, visible by strong day-light.
     Exp. 3. Four feet of the same wire were rendered very
hot; but not perceptibly red by day-light. In the dark, it
would probably have appeared red throughout.
    Exp. 4. Charcoal burnt with intense brilliancy.
    Exp. 5. On iron wire, of about Ji.th of an inch in diame
ter, the effect      was strikingly feeble.          It barely fused ten
inches,      and had not power to ignite three feet.
     Exp. 6. Imperfect conductors were next submitted to the
 action of the battery, and barytes, mixed with the red ox
 ide  of mercury,       and made into a paste        with  pipe clay and
 water, was placed in the circuit; but neither on this nor on
 any other similar substance was the slightest effect produced.
     Exp. 7. The gold leaves of the electrometer were not
affected.
     Exp.    8.  When the cuticle        was dry, no shock was given
 by this battery, and even though             the skin was wet, it was
scarcely perceptible.
     Before I offer any observations on the inferences to be
drawn from these experiments, I shall mention some others,
performed,       for the sake   of comparison, with        the foregoing,
 with   an apparatus very different in size and number            of plates
 from the one just described.
    This second battery was precisely the Cmironne des Tasses
 of Sig. Voita, consisting of two hundred pairs of plates,
each about two          inches   square,   placed   in half pint pots of
common queen's ware, and made active by some of the
liquor used in exciting the large battery, to which was added
 a fresh portion     of sulphuric acid,     equal to about a quarter     of
a pint to a gallon.
    To   state as shortly as possible the effects produced by this
battery    :
    Experiment       1.  It decomposed     potash and barytes readily.
    Exp.     2.  It produced    the metallization      of ammonia with
great facility.
    Exp. 3. It ignited charcoal vividly.
     Exp. 4. It caused considerable divergence of                the gold
leaves    of  the electrometer.
                                                                     Exp.

28                 An Account of some Experiments
  Exp. 5. It gave a vivid spark, after being in action three
hours. At the expiration of twenty-four hours, it retained
sufficient power to metallize ammonia, and continued, with
gradually decreasing energy, to produce the same effect till
the end of forty-one hours, when it seemed nearly exhausted.
             "
   From the results of the foregoing experiments, which,
though simple and not numerous, I trust, are satisfactory,
we see Mr. Davy's theory of the mode of action of the Vol
taic battery confirmed : he says (in his Paper on some Che
mical Agencies of Electricity, Sect. 9, after having shown
the effect of induction to increase the electricity of the op
posite plates),
                 " the intensity increases with the number,
and the quantity with the extent of the series."
   That this is so, the            effects produced          on   the     platina and
iron wires, in the first           and fifth experiments             with the        large
battery, and the subsequent experiments on imperfect con
ductors, with the small apparatus, sufficiently prove. The
platina wire being a perfect conductor, and not liable to be
oxidated, presents no obstacle to the free passage of the
electricities through            it,
                      which, from the immense quantities
given out from so large     surface, evolve, on their mutual
                                       a
annihilation, heat sufficient to raise the temperature of the

effect   is   very different, which             is   explained    by   the low       state
of   the intensity      of   the electricity         (sufficiently     proved        by   its
not causing any divergence of the gold leaves of the electro

to be attributed the total inability of the large battery to de
compose the barytes, and its general weak action on bodies

small battery proves the utility of having the cells of suf
ficient capacity to hold a large quantity of liquor, by which
much trouble of emptying and filling the troughs is avoided,
and the action kept up, without intermission, for a long
space of time, — a circumstance, in many experiments, of
material consequence.            Besides this advantage,     with very
large combinations, a certain distance between each pair of
plates is absolutely necessary, to prevent spontaneous dis
charges, which will otherwise ensue, accompanied with vivid
flashes of electric light, as I have experienced, with a bat
tery of 1250 four-inch plates, -on the new construction.
 And here I beg leave to mention an experiment, which,
 though not directly in point, cannot be considered as foreign
 to the subject of this paper. It has been urged, as one proof
 of the non-identity of the common electricity, and that given
 out by the Voltaic apparatus, that in the latter there is no
 striking distance.       That objection,       however, must cease.
 I  took a small receiver, open at one end ; through perfora
 tions in the opposite sides of which were placed two wires,
 with platina points, well polished         : one was fixed by cement
 to the glass, the other was           moveable, by means of a fine
 screw, through a collar of leathers, and the distance be
 tween the points was ascertained by a small micrometer at
 tached.      This  receiver    was   inverted over well dried potash
 over mercury, and suffered to stand a couple of days, to de
 prive the air it contained, as thoroughly as possible, of
 moisture.       The 1250 plates being excited precisely to the
 same degree as the great battery, mentioned           in the beginning
 of this communication;           and the little receiver placed in the
  circuit, I ascertained     its  striking distance  to be -^th   of an
  inch. That I might        be certain that the air    in the apparatus
  had not become a conductor            by increase  of temperature, I
  repeated the experiment several times with fresh cool air,
  and always with the same result ; but perhaps it will be ob
 jected,    that the striking distance was so small, as not to
  afford  a  satisfactory refutation of the argument alluded to,
  when it is considered to how very great ' a distance, com
  paratively, the spark of the common electrical machine caa
   pass through air.     The answer       to this is obvious  : incre^e
                                                                     the

 the number       of the plates, and the   striking distance will in
 crease ; for we see      throughout, the intensity proportioned
to the number, and it probably may be carried to such ex
tent, as even to pass through a thicker plate of air than the
common spark.           The great similarity of the appearance of
the electric light of this battery in vacuo, and that of the
common machine, might also be urged as an additional
proof of the identity of their nature.
    The effect of this large combination on imperfect conduc
tors, was,      as may be supposed,     very great;   but of the same
platina wire, of which the four-feet plates fused eighteen
inches, this battery melted but half an inch, though, had
the effect been in the ratio of their surfaces, it should have
fused nearly fourteen inches.
    The absolute effect of a Voltaic apparatus, therefore,
seems to be in the compound ratio of the number and size
of the    plates : thq intensity of the electricity being as the
former, the quantity given out as the latter ; consequently
regard must be had, in its construction, to the puq;oses,for
which it      is designed.    For experiments on     perfect conduc
tors, very large plates are to be preferred, a small number of
which will probably be sufficient; but where the resistance
of imperfect conductors        is to be overcome,   the combination
must be great, but the size        of the plates may be small ; but
if quantity and intensity be both required, then a large num
ber of large plates will be necessary. For general purposes,
four inches square will be found to be the most convenient
size.
    Of   the two methods usually employed,        that of having the
copper and zinc plates joined together only in one point, and
moveable, is much better than the old plan of soldering
them together, through the whole surface, and cementing
them into the troughs : as, by the new construction, the
apparatus can be more easily cleaned and repaired, and a
double quantity       of surface   is obtained.   For the partitions
in  the troughs,     glass seems the substance best adapted to se
cure   a  perfect insulation ; but the best of all will be troughs
made entirely      of Wedgwood's ware, — an idea, I believe, first
suggested      by  Dr. Babington.

   fromT.A. Knight, Esq., F.R.S., to the Right Hon.
    Sir Joseph Banks, K.B., P.R.S.*
     MY DEAR SIR,
 J.N a former       communication          T have      given an account of
 some experiments,          which induced me to conclude that the
buds   of  trees invariably spring from their alburnum,               to which
they are always connected by central vessels of greater or
less length ; and in the course              of much subsequent expe
rience,    I  have not found any reason to change the                   opinion
that  I  have there given       f.    The object of        the   present  com
munication       is to show, that the roots           of trees are always ge
nerated    by the vessels      which    pass    from    the cotyledons of the
seed,   and from the leaves,          through the leaf-stalks and the
bark, and that they never, under any circumstances,                      spring
immediately from the alburnum.
    The organ, which naturalists             have called the radicle     in the
seed,   is generally supposed         to be analogous to the root        of the
plant, and to become a perfect root during germination; and
I  do not know that this opinion has ever been controverted,
though I believe that, when closely investigated, it will prove
to be founded in error.
    A root, in all cases with which I am acquainted, elongates
only by new parts which are successively added to its apex or
point, and never, like the stem or branch, by the extension
of parts previously organized           ; and      I   have   endeavoured     to
show, in a former memoir, that owing to this difference in
the mode of the growth of the root and lengthened plumule
of germinating seeds, the one must ever be obedient to gra
vitation, and point towards the centre of the earth, whilst
the other must take the opposite direction J. But the radicle
of germinating        seeds elongates      by tire extension of parts pre
viously organized,         and in a great number of cases, which
must be familiar to every person's observation, raises the
cotyledons out of the mould in which the seed is placed to

vegetate.      The mode of growth of                the     radicle is therefore
similar to that     of the            which occupies the space*
                                substance
between     the buds     near the point of the succulent annual
shoot, and totally different from that of the proper root of
the plant, which I conceive to come first into existence du
ring the germination of the seed, and to spring from the
point of what is called the radicle. At this period, neither
the radicle nor cotyledons contain any alburnum ; and there
fore the first root cannot originate from that substance ; but
the cortical vessels are      filled with sap, and apparently
                                  then
in full action, and1 through these the sap appears to descend
which gives existence to the true root.
  When first emitted,           the root consists only             of cellular sub
stance, similar to that         of   the bark   parts of the fu
                                                   of other
ture tree, and within this the cortical vessels are subsequently
generated in a circle, inclosing within it a 3mall portion of
the cellular substance, which forms the pith or medulla                                 of
the root.   The cortical vessels soon enter on their office                             of
generating alburnous matter; and a transverse section of the
root then shows the alburnum arranged in the form of
wedges round the medulla, as it is subsequently deposited
on the cential vessels of the succulent annual shoot, and on
the surface    of the alburnum of            the    stems         and   branches        of
older trees*.
  If a  leaf-stalk be deeply wounded, a cellular substance,
similar to'that of the bark and young root, is protruded from
the upper lip of the wound, but never from the lower; and
the leaf-stalks of many plants possess the power of emitting
roots, which   power cannot have resided in alburnum, for
the leaf-stalk does not contain any ; but vessels, similar to
those of the bark and radicle, abound in    apparently con  it,
vey the returning sap   and from these vessels, or perhaps
                            ;
more properly from the fluid they convey, the roots emitted
by   the leaf-stalk derive their existence           f.

through the bark; and any body which contains much mois
ture be applied, numerous roots will soon be emitted into it
immediately above the decorticated space, but never imme
diately beneath it : and when the alburnum in the decorti
cated spaces has become lifeless to a considerable depth,
buds are usually protruded beneath, but never immediately
above     apparently owing to the obstruction of the ascend
         it,
ing   sap.     The roots, which     are emitted    in   the preceding case,
do not appear in any degree to differ from those which de
scend from the radicles of generating seeds, and both appa
rently derive their matter from the fluid which descends
through the cortical vessels.
   There are several varieties       of the   apple tree, the trunks and
branches       of which    are almostwith rough excres
                                         covered
cences, formed by congeries of points which would have
become roots under favourable circumstances                    ;    and such
varieties are always very readily propagated                   by
                                                       cuttings.
Having thus obtained        considerable number of plants of one
                             a
of   these varieties, the excrescences began to form upon their
stems when two years old, and mould being then applied to
them in the spring, numerous roots were emitted into                      it
early in the summer. The mould was at the same time raised
round, and applied to, the stems of other trees of the same
age and variety, and in every respect similar, except that the
tops of the latter were cut off    short distance above the
                                         a
lowest excrescence,        so that there      were      no buds or leaves
from which sap could desceud to generate or feed new roots                 ;
and under these circumstances no roots, but numerous buds
were emitted, and these buds all sprang from the spaces and
points, which under different circumstances had afforded
roots.  The tops of the trees last mentioned, having been
divided into pieces of ten inches long, were planted as cut
tings,   and roots were       by   these emitted from the lowest ex
crescences      beneath the soil, and buds         from the uppermost
of those     above   it.

calculated to carry the sap it contains, from the root up
wards, than in any other direction ; and I concluded that the
sap when arrived at the top of the cutting through the al
burnum would be there employed, as I had observed in many
similar cases, in generating buds, and that these buds would
be protruded where the bark was young and                  thin,  and con
sequently afforded little resistance*.            I had also proved the
bark to be better calculated to carry the sap towards the roots
than in the opposite direction, and I thence inferred that as
scon   as any buds, emitted by the cuttings, afforded leaves,
the sap would be conveyed from these to the lower extremity
of the cuttings by the cortical vessels, and be there employed
in the formation of roots *.
    Both  the alburnum         and    bark of trees evidently contain
their true sap; but whether the fluid, which ascends in such
cases as the preceding through the alburnum to generate
buds, be essentially different from that which descends down
the bark to generate roots, it is perhaps impossible to decide.
As nature, however, appears in the vegetable world to ope
rate by the simplest means ; and             as the vegetable sap, like
the animal blood, is probably filled with particles which are
endued with life, were I to offer a conjecture, I am much,
more disposed to believe that the same fluid, even by merely
acquiring different motions, may generate different organs,
than that two distinct fluids are employed to form the root,
and the bud and leaf.
   When alburnum            is formed in the root, that organ pos
sesses, in common          with the stem and branches, the power
of producing buds,         and   of emitting fibrous roots ; and when
it is detached from        the tree, the buds always spring near its
upper   end,   and     the  roots near the opposite extremity, as in
the cuttings above mentioned.              The alburnum of the root
is also similar to that of other parts of the tree, except that
it is more porous, probably owing to the presence of abun
dant moisture during           the period in which       it is deposited f.
And possibly      the same cause may retain the wood            of the root
permanently in the state          of alburnum ; for    I  have   shown, in

 the parts of the larger roots, which adjoin the trunk, be ex

     I would wish the preceding observations to be considered
 as  extending to trees only, and exclusive of the palm tribe ;
 but   I believe  they are nevertheless generally applicable to
 perennial herbaceous plants, and that the buds and fibrous
 roots of these originate from substances which correspond
 with the alburnum         and bark of trees.         It is obvious, that
 the roots which bulbs emit in the spring, are generated by
 the sap which descends from the bulb, when that retains its
 natural position ;• and such tuberous- routed plants as the po-
 tatoe offer rather a seeming than a real obstacle to the hypo
 thesis   I am endeavouring to establish.            The   buds   of   these
 are generally formed beneath          the soil ; but   I  have shown,    in
 a former memoir,        that the buds on every part of the stem
 may be made to generate tubers, which are similar to those
usually formed beneath the soil ; and I have subsequently
 seen,   in many instances, such emitted by a reproduced bud,
without the calyx of a blossom, which had failed to produce
fruit ; but I have never, under any circumstances, been able
to obtain tubers from the fibrous roots of the plant.
    The tube therefore appears to differ little from a branch,
which has dilated instead of extending itself, except that it
becomes      capable of retaining life during a longer period ;
and when I have laboured through a whole summer to coun
teract the natural habits        of the plant,      a profusion   of blos
soms has      in many instances sprung from the buds of a tuber.
    The runners also, which, according to the natural habit
of the plant, give        existence    to the tubers beneath      the soil,
are very similar in organization          to the stem   of  the plant, and
readily emit leaves, and become converted into perfect stems
in a few days, if the current of ascending sap be diverted
into them; and the mode in which the tuber is formed above
and beneath the soil is precisely the same.                And when the

winter,     is again called into action to feed the buds, which
elongate into parts of the stems of the future plants in the
spring, fibrous roots are emitted from the bases of these
stems, whilst buds are generated at the opposite extremities,
as in the cases I have mentioned respecting trees.
    Many naturalists* have supposed the fibrous roots of all
plants to be of annual duration only ; and those of bulbous-
and tuberous-rooted plants certainly are so: as in these Na
ture has provided a distinct reservoir for the sap which is to
form the first leaves and fibrous roots of the succeeding sea
son ; but the organization of trees is very different, and the
alburnum and bark of the roots and stems of these are the
reservoirs     of their sap during the winter f. When, however,
the fibrous roots of trees are crowded together in a garden-
pot, they      are ofen found lifeless        in the succeeding spring ;
but I have not observed the same mortality to occur, in any
 degree, in the roots of trees when growing, under favourable
 circumstances,        in their natural situation.

 which direct the roots of plants in search of proper nutri

 to the differential equations   of the elliptic motion     : the au
 thor consequently examines what       are the changes to which     it
is necessary to subject the integrals of the differential equa
tions, in order to have those of the same equations aug
mented by certain terms. The analysis which he uses gives
these integrals in a simple and exact       mariner when the pro
posed equations are linear, and furnishes in general a method
of obtaining them by approximation : we may attain the
same object by the method       of successive substitutions.     The
author details this process, which has the inconvenience of
introducing arcs of a circle, out of the periodical signs in
the approximate integral, even when they are not to be
found in the exact integral ; and this circumstance takes
place when      this last should contain,      under the periodical
signs, the very small coefficients, according to the powers
of which the approximate integral is ordered : these arcs of
a circle being susceptible    of  an indefinite   increase   would at
length render the approximate integrals defective ; and as it
is of importance that these integrals may embrace past and
future ages, it is necessary to repass from these arcs of a
circle to the functions      which produce them by their deve
lopment into series.      In order to attain this object, the au
thor gives a method applicable to any given number of diffe
rential equations ; he shows afterwards that the integrals of
the differential equations preserve the same form, when these
equations are increased by certain terms ; and from this he
deduces the means of obtaining, among the arbitrary constant
quantities, the conditions relative to this last supposition :
be afterwards shows the utility of the variation of the con
stant arbitrary quantities for facilitating the approximate in
tegration of the equations in certain cases.
   The author applies     the preceding methods to the pertur
bations   of  the celestial motions ; he obtains at first under a
finite form the perturbations of the motion in longitude, la
titude, and those of the radius vector of the orbit : he after
wards takes up the subject of the important problem which
has for its object the development of perturbations in con
 vergent series  of the sine and cosine   of angles increasing pro
 portionally to the time.     To obtain this,   he first gives a very

simple method, by which we immediately obtain the differen
tial equations which determine the perturbations ordered ac
cording to the powers and to the products of the excentricities
of the inclinations of the orbits. This method consists in sup
posing the radius vector of the disturbed orbit expressed by
a function   of the same form as that of the elliptic orbit ; the
quantity    which  enters into this function is then found, given
as in the elliptic motion by a linear differential equation of
the second    order with constant coefficients, increased by a
last term depending on the action of the disturbing forces ;
circumstances which permit us to apply to this equation the
methods of integration previously detailed : in the latter, re
gard is had only to the first power of the disturbing force.
It is necessary, for what precedes, to develop a certain func
tion of   the masses and   of the mutual distances      of the  bodies
of  the system in a converging series      of the  sines and cosines
of   angles  increasing proportionally     to the time.      The au
thor gives the method of attaining this, and employs, in
this calculation, in a very elegant manner, the characteristic
of the integrals of finite differences   :  this permits him to ex
press with much simplicity the development sought, and
the product of this development by the sine or cosine of any
angle. According to what precedes,              he determines the
perturbations of motion in longitude, latitude, and those of
the radius vector of the orbit, carrying his precision as far
as quantities of the order of the eccentricities and of the
inclinations   of the orbits, and demonstrates the convergency
of   these  results, whatever be the ratio       of  the distances   of
the planets which we consider to the sun ; a circumstance
the more important to observe, since otherwise it would
have been impossible to express        analytically the reciprocal
 perturbations of   the planets,   with respect to which the rela
 tions  of these distances approach to unity : he afterwards
 collects these results which contain the whole theory of the
 planets, when we neglect the squares and products of the
 eccentricities,  and  of the inclinations   of the orbits, which is
 most frequently permitted.        After having shown how we
 could, if it were necessary,    obtain a greater approximation,
 he gives the means of estimating the degree of precision of
                                                                   the

  the different terms     of which    these    formulae   are  composed,,
  and shows that we may easily extend              them to the case in
 which     the number of the disturbing masses is given.
     The   formulae which give the disturbed motion contain
 ing in some of their terms the time without periodical signs,
.the author      employs the method described above to make
 these    terms disappear. This process leads to differential
 equations among the constant arbitrary quantities of the
 problem which are here the elements of the elliptic motion:
 we obtain by this means the variations which these elements
 undergo in consequence of the action of the disturbing
 masses, at least so far as we neglect the second powers of
 these masses, and those        of the eccentricities    and inclinations
 of the orbits.       The first property which this analysis dis
 plays, is, that    the transverse    axes of the orbits and the mean
 motions are      unalterable ; but the expression of the longitude
 from which we draw this result being only approximate, it
 is important to examine the nature of the terms which might
  be there     introduced by successive approximations ; for, if
 there were any which were proportional to the square of the
 time, the preceding property would cease to take place, and
 the transverse axes and the mean motions might be indefi
 nitely altered. The author shows, that            if we regard only the
  first power    of  the   disturbing   masses,    however far in other
  respects    we may extend the approximation with respect to
  the eccentricities and inclinations,           the expression of the
  longitude will never contain any similar terms, at least
i while   the mean motions of the bodies of the system are in
  commensurable among each other, which is the case with
  the solar system ; whence it results, that by confining our
  selves to the first powers of the disturbing masses, the trans
  verse axes    of the orbits are constant, and the        mean motions    .
  uniform. The author afterwards integrates                 the differen
  tial equations    which    determine    the   variations   of the other
  elliptic elements j he discusses their extent, and shows that
  the solar system can only oscillate around a mean state of
 ellipticity and of inclination, from which it wanders little :
  hence it follows,      that the orbits of the planets and satellites
  never have been,       and never    will  be, considerably eccentric,

nor inclined to each other, at least         if  we   regard only the
mutual action     of  these   bodies.    The variations determined
by   the preceding analysis,     taking place with great slowness,
have been named secular ; and          we may, during a long in
terval, suppose them proportional to the time : the author
gives the method of obtaining them under that form, which
is useful for astronomical purposes.
    These inquiries make known some              relations among the
elements of the orbits which are only approximate : the au
thor develops those which take place in general, whatever
may be the eccentricities and the inclinations : he afterwards
gives the necessary formulae for determining, with respect
to the solar system, the position of the invariable plane upon
Which the sum of the areas described by the projections of
the radii vectores of the bodies of the system, multiplied re
spectively by the masses of these bodies, is a maximum.
The    research  of this plane    becomes    very important,    on ac
count of the proper motions of the stars and of the ecliptic ;
but it requires that we should know the masses of the co
mets, and the elements of their orbits : happily, these
masses appearing      to be very     small, we may, without any
perceptible error, neglect their action on the planets : con
sidering. then the motion of two orbits inclined one to the
other by any given angle, the         author shows that, indepen
dently of every extraneous       cause, the two orbits will always
cut the invariable plane relative to their system in the same
straight line, the ascending node of the one coinciding with
the descending node of the other ; and he gives, upon the
supposition of very small inclinations, the expression of the
motion of this intersection.'
    The preceding method only giving the inequalities inde
pendent of the mutual Configuration of the bodies of the
 system, the author resumes this problem by a different pro
cess   ; he infers from analytical considerations detailed above,
that the disturbed motion       of the   celestial  bodies may be re
 ferred to the laws   of elliptic motion, supposing       the elements
 of this motion variable    ; he  shows that these results may also
be drawn immediately from the consideration of elliptic mo
 tion, regarding the disturbed planet, as oscillating in a very
                                                                 small

small orb around a fictitious planet, moved according to the
laws of elliptic motion, in an ellipsis, the elements of which
vary by insensible shades : hence are deduced with facility,
the differential equations which determine these variations.
By applying these results to the case of orbits eccentric in a
small degree, and little inclined towards each other, and
neglecting the second powers of the perturbating masses, we
see in the first place that the transverse axes and the mean
motions are only subjected to periodical variations depending
upon the mutual configuration of the bodies of the system,
and thereby even not very extensive : hence it follows that
by neglecting these quantities, the major axes of the orbits are
constant, and the mean motions are uniform ; a result pre
viously found by a different method. This property only takes
place when the mean motions of the bodies of the system are
incommensurable   among each other, which is the case with
the planets      with respect to some of these bodies, very
                 :   if,
little required in order to fulfil this condition, the elliptic
        is
elements, and particularly the mean longitude which de
pends upon two integrations, acquire        certain terms very
                                                         in
large divisions,  which  introduce there some very perceptible
inequalities.    The author gives the method of determining
tho3e    which     the mean longitude, and he shows that
                     affect
when there are inequalities of this kind, which the action of
one of the bodies of the system produces upon the mean
motion of another,             it   is         which the ac

first, and he proves that these inequalities are affected                         by
contrary signs, and reciprocal to the products of the masses
of bodies     the square roots of the major axes of their or
                by
bits.  The illustrious author of this work has been the first
to demonstrate that to    similar cause

   The          afterwards examines the case in which the
             author1
most perceptible inequalities of the mean motion are only to
be met with among the terms of the order of the square of
the perturbatrix masses: this singular circumstance takes
 place   in   the system      of the     satellites   of Jupiter, and   it   depends
                                                                               upon

 upon the relations which observations point out between
 the mean motions of the three first among each other. The
 author develops at proper length this important point of the
 system of the world ; and from it he infers that the mean
 motion    of the first satellite, minus thrice that of        the second,
plus twice that of the third, is exactly and constantly equal
 to nothing, and that the mean longitude of the first satellite
 minus thrice that      of the  second,   plus thrice that of the third,
 is exactly and constantly equal to two right angles. These
elegant theorems, which would of themselves be sufficient
 to immortalize       their author, have        been   presented   for  the
first time to geometricians and astronomers, in the Memoirs
 above quoted.
*
    The author afterwards develops            the differential   equations
which determine the variations of             the other elements    of the
orbit   : he  shows that     the values    of the unknown quantities
which they contain        are composed       of two parts ; the one, de
pending upon the         mutual configuration of the bodies of the
system, contains the variations called periodic; the other, in
dependent of this configuration, contains the variations called
secular. The author gives a very simple method of obtaining
the first part ; and as to the second, he proves that it is given
by the same differential equations deprived of their last terms ;
a circumstance which refers them to those which he had
formerly treated of at full length, by the first method             of ap
proximation which we have mentioned.
    We    have said that the relations       of the  mean motions may
introduce,     in  the expression     of the mean longitude, a sen
sible inequality among         the  terms   depending upon the second
power of the disturbing masses.               The author examines the
influence of these        same    relations upon the other elements,
and he determines the inequalities resulting from them;                  he
establishes    the very simple relations .which connect these in
equalities with      those of the mean motion ; he discusses the
variations to which the same cause subjects the expressions
of the latitude     above a fixed plane a little inclined to the or
bit  ; he   shows how by means          of  these results we obtain the
values    of the latitude, longitude,       and   of the radius vector   of
the    disturbed orbit,      variable quantities       which determine
                                                                       the

 VII.   Account    of the Dissection of a Human Foetus, in which
    the Circulation of the Blood was carried on without a
    Heart. By Mr. B. C. Brodie. Communicated by Eve-
    hard Home, Esq., F.R.S.*
An     opportunity lately occurred to me of examining a hu
 man foetus, in which the heart was wanting, and the circu
 lation of the blood was carried on by the action of the vessels
only. There have been some other instances of this remark
able   deviation    from the natural structure ; but in that to
which    I  allude the growth of the child had been natural,
and it   differed much less from the natural formation than in
 any of those which are on record, and I have therefore been
induced to draw up the following account of it-
    A woman was delivered of twins in the beginning of the
seventh month of pregnancy.                 There was a placenta with
two umbilical chords, which had their origin about three
inches distant from each other.             The placenta was not pre
served ; but     Mr. Adams, who          attended      the mother      in her
lying-in,     observed   nothing unusual in its appearance.              Both
foetuses were born dead.          They   were nearly      of the   same size.
One    of them in no      respect differed from the ordinary forma
tion i the other had an unusual appearance, and                  Mr. Adams
thought it deserving of examination.                Through Dr. Hooper
it was put inlo my hands for this purpose.
    The  foetus   measured thirteen inches from the summit                 of
             * From Philosophical  Transaction*   for 1809, Fart I.
                                                                          the

the cranium to the feet.       The thorax and abdomen were
surrounded by a large shapeless mass, which         concealed the
form   of  the whole upper part   of the body. This   mass proved
to be the integuments covering the posterior part of the neck
and thorax, distended with a watery fluid about three pints
in quantity, contained in two cysts lined by a smooth
membrane.       When the fluid was      evacuated,   and the cysts
allowed to collapse, the foetus had nearly the natural form,
lis extremities had nearly the usual appearance, except that
on the right hand there was no thumb ; on the left hand
there was no thumb also, and only a single finger.          There
were three toes on the right foot, and four toes on the left
foot.    The external nostrils consisted only of two folds of
skin, under each of which was the orifice of an internal nos
tril, but pervious oaly for about half an inch. There was
a hare lip, and a cleft in the bony palate extending one-third
of  an inch backwards.
    On dissection,   the cranium   was found     somewhat    com
pressed by the fluid contained in the cyst behind it.         The
brain itself was too putrid for accurate examination, but it
was of nearly the natural size, and nothing unusual was ob
served in it.   The membranes had the natural appearance,
 and the nerves appeared to go oft" from the brain and spinal
marrow nearly as usual.
    In the thorax there was no heart, thymus gland, or pleura.
The trachea was situated immediately behind the sternum.
It had its natural appearance, and divided as usual into the
 two bronchia.     The latter terminated in the lungs, which
 consisted of two rounded bodies, not more than one-third
 of an inch in diameter, having      a smooth   external surface,
 and composed internally of a dense cellular substance. The
 oesophagus had the usual situation, but it terminated in a
 cul-de-sac at the lower part of the thorax.       The rest of the
 thorax was filled with a dense cellular       substance ; and in
 place of the diaphragm, there      was a membranous septum
 between it and the cavity of the abdomen.
    In  the abdomen, the stomach had no cardiac orifice. The
 intestine was attached to the mesentery in the usual way ;
 but it was proportiouably    shorter than natural.     There was
                                                                an

         Account   of the Dissection   of a Human Fcetus.           4h
an imperfect ccecum, but the colon was not distinguished
by any difference of structure or appearance from the rest of
the intestine.     The rectum     had  its usual situation       in the
pelvis.    The spleen and renal capsules were small ;         the kidr
neys,   bladder,  penis, and testicles had the usual appearance.
The abdomen was lined by peritonaeum, but there was no
omentum. The liver and gall-bladder were wanting.
    As there was no heart, it became an object of importance
to ascertain the exact nature     of the circulation  :  for this pur
pose the blood-vessels were traced with attention.
    The umbilical chord consisted of two vessels only : one of
these was larger than the other, and its coats resembled those
of a vein, while     those  of the smaller    vessel were   thick and
elastic, like those    of an artery.   Both    of these   vessels   en
tered the navel    of  the  child.   The artery   passed to     the left
groin by    the side  of the urachus, occupying the       usual situa
 tion  of the left umbilical artery. Here it gave off the external
and internal iliac arteries   of the left side, and was then con
tinued upwards on the fore-part of the spine forming the
aorta.     From the aorta arose the common trunk of the right
iliac artery, and the branches to the viscera and parietes of
 the thorax and abdomen. At the upper part of the thorax it
 sent off the two subclavian, and afterwards divided into the
 two carotid arteries, without forming an arch. The veins
 corresponding to these arteries terminated in the vena cava*
 which was situated on      the  anterior part of the spine before
 the aorta, and passed downwards before the right kidney
 to the right groin. Here it became reflected upwards by the
 side of the urachus to the navel, and was continued into the
 larger vessel or vein of the chord.
    It appears therefore, that, in this foetus, not only the
 heart was wanting, but there was no communication of any
 kind between the trunks of the venous and arterial systems,
 as  in the natural foetus,   where there is a heart.         The only
 communication       between the two sets        of  vessels,   was   by
 means of the capillary branches anastomosing as usual in the
 foetus and in the placenta.       The blood must have been pro
 pelled from the placenta to the child through the artery of
  the chord, and must have been returned to the placenta by
                                                                  means

means       of the vein,            so that the placent3 must have been at
once the source and the termination                            of the circulation,         and
the blood must have                      been    propelled by the action               of the
vessels only.
     It is to   be Understood, that the circulation                     in the foetus re
ceives no propelling pdwer from the                    action of the heart and
arteries     of the mother.                This, although perfectly known to
anatomists, it is proper to mention, as it may not be equally
known to all the members of this Society.
     It   appears extraordinary,                that under these circumstances,
notwithstanding                 through the placenta must
                            the circulation
have been more languid than is natural, that organ should
nevertheless have been capable of exercising its proper func-
tions,      so as to produce those changes on the                             blood which
are necessary            for the maintenance of foetal life.                       This may
be explained by considering                      that in the natural foetus the
umbilical       arteries are branches                of   the general arterial system,
and only a portion of the blood of the child is sent to the
placenta ; whereas, in the foetus which I have described, the
trunk of the             vena cava was continued into the vein                         of the
chord, and the whole of the venous blood circulated through
the placenta, and was exposed to the influence of the arterial
blood of the mother.
  But             interesting circumstance which we learn
            the most
from this examination                    is,
                             that the circulation not only can
be carried on without    heart, but that
                                     a       child so circum     a
stanced can be maintained                      in its growth,        so as to attain the
same size       as   a   foetus     which       is   possessed    of that organ. This
fact   contrary to what prior experience has led us to expect,
       is
as will appear from the following abstract of the authenti
cated cases       of this      species         of malformation,         which we find
on record.
  A     monster, in which there was no heart, 'is described by
M.     Mery*. There were twins, one of which was well
formed, and of the usual size of     six months child   thea                           :
size of the other was not mentioned, so that no comparison
could be made between them.                          In   the latter, the head, neck,

And upper extremities were wanting.                  There were no vestiges
of   a brain, nor was there any liver.                 The dissection of the
blood-vessels does not appear to have been very accurately
made; but, from the general account, I should suppose that
the circulation did not materially differ from that                   of  the foe
tus which I have described.
   Another instance of this kind is described by M. Win-
slow *. This was also a twin, only seven inches in length.
The age and size of the other child are not mentioned.                          In
this instance there was no head, nor any vestige of brain.
There were no lungs, liver, stomach, nor spleen, and only
a small portion of intestine. The arterial system is described
as being complete,           communicating with the placenta by the
umbilical     vein opening into the aorta, and the umbilical ar
teries   arising nearly as usual.            In this instance there was a
circle of vessels formed by the arteries only, for M. Wins-
low expressly states, that there were no veins ; and however
extraordinary this may appear, we cannot be otherwise than
cautious in denying an observation made by an anatomist
so remarkable for his extreme accuracy and minuteness.
   Dr. Le Cat, of Rouen, states another case of twins f bom
at  the end of the ninth month of pregnancy.                       One of them
was a well-formed           child of the usual size ; but the other was
only twelve inches and a half in length.                      The head of the
latter was very imperfect, and there was only a very minute
portion of brain.             The heart, lungs, liver, stomach, and
spleen were entirely wanting, and there was only a small
portion of intestine. The arterial system was perfect ; the
umbilical vein terminated in the aorta, and the umbilical
arteries had       their origin from the internal iliac, as usual.
There is, however, an obscurity in the account of the circu
lation,   as   it is stated that there        were     veins, but they were
not traced, nor was any communication made out between
them and the arteries, or the vessels of the chord.
   Dr. Clarke       J  has given an account of a case, in which a
woman, after         a natural labour, was delivered of a healthy-
child, and       also  of   a substance covered         by common         integn-

.DeforE epithets so harsh, as " most lame and impotent
conclusion!" are applied to the words of any writer, it behoves
him who uses them, to endeavour fully to understand the
 words commented upon ; but above all, to take care and quote
them faithfully. Having stated, page 2o'2 of your last volume,
that I had for weeks         and months together, daily contem
plated valleys,    "   wonderfully distributed over the whole sur
face   of large  districts,  effecting a descending outlet or drain
age to every part iliei'eof :" I cannot pass over as immate
rial, the alteration which Mr. Carr has made in substituting
"  any
        "   in place of the words " every part thereof," when
he quotes them (at page 452) for the purpose of "judging"
so hastily on my subsequent conclusions : because, by mark
ing those words in italics, I expressly intended, to exclude
and deny the assumption which he makes just after, of a
succession of      "  alluvial flats," existing generally in valleys,
the seats    of a former chain of lakes ; the same having been
some years ago the opinion adopted (and it is a very old one,
as I have before observed,)         by an able and scientific friend of
mine, founded on the appearances of the gravel of one par
ticular spot, and rocky cliffs below, in a long vale ; on
which, he and I have held frequent discussions, without any
conviction being brought to my mind, that a lake ever did
exist in the place alluded to, which is near to Leighton Bus-
sard in Bedfordshire : the opinion having, however, been
adopted, in the instance alluded to, by one, for whose abili
ties and talents    I  have the     highest respect, the subject has
constantly recurred to me since, without my having ever
seen any case, which could establish the probability eveai,
of  the previous existence of a lake.

at the northern end       of the district which I             am surveying,
had not then been seen by mc : but having since visited every
part of the Woodlands and been frequently full in view of
the great town whence Mr. Carr dates his letters, when in
the neighbourhood of Ashton, Duckenfield,                     Hyde- Chapel,
Wemeth-Low,           &c, I     can now speak as confidently of nu
merous valleys which           discharge into the river Mersy con
taining the " alluvial flats" of no ancient lakes,               as I can  of
all others which      I  have yet any where seen.
    Not having had an opportunity yet, of seeing the lake
districts of Westmorland,              Cumberland,          &c, I will say
nothing of existing lakes, but doubtless,               from   none of these
giving way, and becoming valleys, common as Mr. C. sup
poses such events to        have been,         the circumstances between
their situation and ordinary valleys, must be essentially dif
ferent, according to his own principles, page 386.
    The remark which         I  made     (page 445) on the very incon
siderable quantity of       native or local alluvia, to be found on
the eastern side of the grand ridge of the island, applies with
 all its force to the western side of the same ridge.                 Here a
considerable quantity of foreign alluvial matters is depo
sited, consisting principally of a reddish earthy mixture
 called Marl*, very unlike anything which the strata of these
parts produce,       and containing numerous and large highly
 rounded boulders of granite of different sorts, with other fo
 reign boulders, principally of a blue colour, and most of
 which seem to be venigenwus fossils, and not fragments of
 any rock, the granites excepted : these too are as often lodged
 on the tops of high hills, as they are in the valleys ; of which
Werneth-Low          near  Hyde Chapel            is an   instance, the very
 top of which hill exhibits numerous and very large ancient
 pits, whence our forefathers took this foreign alluvia for
 marling of their lands.
     At Hyde Lane, which is but               a  short ride from Manches
 ter, Mr. Carr may have the opportunity of seeing, perhaps,
 the finest instance of an excavated valley, (Godley Brook,)
 and   of a denudated surface, which is any where to be seen

of which       strata a vale is excavated ;                  while the surface of the
country is denudated almost to a level, and exhibits but the
faintest tablets (page 262) of the hard rocks ; whose edges
must once have stuck up in frightful confusion, and whose
several beds are now  so strikingly visible in Godley Brook

highly curious deep dry vales, branching from the Dove and
Wye rivers in Derbyshire, are well known examples.
     It   is   by   no means      a   general       truth,    that   if   the matters ex
cavated from the strata to form valleys were replaced                                   (page
454), " there would still be  sufficient fall in the country
                                                 a
for the streams to flow Ike same way:" the instances are
very numerous to the contrary.       If, for instance, Mr. C.
will take the trouble, to inspect the course of the Goyte                                    ri
vers on the S.VV. of New- Mills in Glossop, of the Derwent
river on the           S.W. of Matlock church,                     and many others, he
will   be forced also to admit,                     that excavated        vales do not       al
ways follow                the lowest ground.
     Itneither true, that
          is                               "   in    every instance       the angle     of   in
tersection of valleys                and streams        is   acute    above and       obtuse

                                     invariably meet on pre
cisely the same level:" the exceptions are numerous to both
of these positions, unless indeed, some quibble or play upon
the words be intended therein.

 IX. A       numerical       Table   of  elective    Attractions ; with Re

 Attempts           have been made, by several chemists, to obtain
 a series   of numbers,        capable   of representing       the mutual at
 tractive forces of      the,  component parts of different salts ; but
 these attempts       have    hitherto been confined within narrow
 limits,   and have indeed been so hastily abandoned, that some
 rery important consequences, which necessarily follow from
 the general principle of a numerical representation, appear to
 have been entirely overlooked.            It"is not impossible, that there
 may be some cases,            in which the presence of a fourth sub
 stance, besides the two ingredients of the salt, and the me
 dium in which they are dissolved, may influence the precise
 force of their mutual attraction, either by affecting the solu
 bility of the salt, or by some other unknown means, so that
 the number, naturally appropriate to the combination, may
 no longer correspond to its affections ; but there is reason to
 think that such cases are rare ; and when they occur, they
 may easily be noticed as exceptions to the general rules. It
 appears, therefore, that nearly all the phenomena of the
 mutual actions of a hundred different salts may be correctly
 represented      by a hundred numbers,                while,    in the   usual

    54                      Account of a numerical Table
    manner of relating every case as a different experiment,
    above two thousand separate articles would be required.
      Having been engaged in the collection of a few of the
    principal facts relating to chemistry and pharmacy, I was
    induced to attempt the investigation of a series of these
    numbers; and I have succeeded, not without some diffi-
.           in obtaining such as appear to agree sufficiently well
    culty,
    with all  the cases of double decompositions which are fully
    established, the exceptions not exceeding twenty, out of
    about twelve hundred cases enumerated by Fourcroy. The
    same numbers agree              in general         with the order of simple
    elective attractions,          as    usually laid down by chemical             au
    thors    ;   but it was   of   so much less importance to accommo
    date them to these,            that     I   havenot been very solicitous to
    avoid a few inconsistencies                 in this respect, especially as
    many of the bases of                the calculation remain uncertain, and
    as the common tables of simple elective attractions are cer
    tainly imperfect, if they are considered as indicating the
    order of the independent attractive forces of the substances
    concerned.           Although       it cannot be expected         that these num
    bers should be accurate                 measures    of   the    forces which they
    represent, yet they may be supposed to be tolerable approxi
    mations to such measures; at least, if any two of them are
    nearly in the true proportion, it is probable that the rest
    cannot deviate very far from it : thus,, if the attractive force
    of the phosphoric acid for potash is about eight tenths of
    that of the sulfuric acid of barita, that of the phosphoric
    acid for barita must be about nine tenths as great ; but they
    are calculated only to agree with a certain number of phae-
    nomena,        and    will probably require many alterations, as well
    as   additions,       when all other similar phaenomena shall have
    been accurately investigated.
         There     is,   however,       a   method     of representing       the facts,
    which        have     served as the bases          of   the determination,   inde
    pendently of any hypothesis,                  and without being liable to the
    contingent necessity* of any future alteration, in order to
    make room for the introduction of the affections of other
    substances     ;     aud this method enables               us   also   to compare,
                                                                                  upon

                         of elective Attractions.                        55
upon general principles, a multitude of. scattered pheno
mena, and to reject many which have been mentioned as
probable, though doubtful, with the omission of a very few
only which have been stated as ascertained. This arrange
ment simply depends on the supposition, that the attractive
force, which tends to unite any two substances, may always
be representedby a certain constant quantity.
  From this principle it may be inferred, in the first place,
that there must be a sequence in the simple elective attrac
tions.   For example, there must be an error in the common
tables of elective attractions, in which magnesia stands above
ammonia under the sulfuric acid, and below it under the
phosphoric, and the phosphoric acid stands above the sul
furic under magnesia, and below it under ammonia, since
such an arrangement implies, that the order of the attrac
tive forces is this ; phosphate of magnesia, sulfate of mag
nesia, sulfate of ammonia,      phosphate of ammonia, and
again phosphate of magnesia; which forms a circle, and
not   a sequence.We must therefore either place magnesia
above ammonia   under   the phosphoric acid, or the phos
phoric acid below the sulfuric under magnesia; or we
must abandon the principle of a numerical representation in
this particular case.
     In   the second   place, there must be an agreement between
the simple and         double elective attractions. Thus, if the
fluoric acid stands above the nitric under barita, and below
it under lime, the fluate of barita cannot decompose the ni
trate of lime, since the previous attractions of these two
salts are respectively greater,       than the divellent attractions
of  the nitrate of barita and the fluate of lime.   Probably,
therefore, we ought to place the fluoric acid below the nitric
under barita; and we may suppose, that when the fluoric
acid has appeared to form a precipitate with the nitrate of
barita, there has been some fallacy in the experiment.
  The third proposition is somewhat less obvious, but per
haps of greater utility : there must be a continued sequence
in   the order   of double elective attractions     ;   that
                                                    between    is,
any two acids, we may place the different bases in such an
order, that any two salts, resulting from their union, shall
                                  D   4                              always

56                    Account      of a numerical Table
always decompose each other, unless each acid be united to
the base nearest to it: for example, sulfuric acid, barita,
potass, soda, ammonia, strontia, magnesia, glycina, alumina,
zirconia, lime, phosphosic acid. The sulfate of potass de
composes the phosphate of barita, because the difference of
the attractions of barita for the sulfuric and phosphoric
acids is greater than the difference of the similar attractions
of potass; and in the same manner the difference of the at
tractions of potass is greater than that of the attractions of
soda   ; consequently the difference of the attractions o'f barita
must be much greater than that of the attractions of soda,
and the sulfate           of  soda   must decompose the phosphate of
barita   :  and   in   the same manner         it may be shown, that each
base must preserve its relations             of priority or posteriority to
every    other   in   the   series.  It is  also  obvious that, for similar
reasons, the acids may be arranged in a continued sequence
between the different bases; and when al! the decomposi
tions of a certain number of salts have been investigated, we
may form two corresponding tables, one of the sequences of
the bases with the acids, and another of those of the acids
with    the different       bases ; and    if either or both of     the tables
are imperfect, their deficiencies may often be supplied, and
their errors corrected, by a repeated comparison with each
other.
    In forming       tables   of this kind from       the cases collected by
Fourcroy,      I   have been obliged to          reject   some   facts, which
were evidently contradictory to others, and these I have not
thought it necessary to mention : a few, which are positively
related, and which are only inconsistent with the principle
of numerical representation, I have mentioned in notes ; but
many others, which have been stated as merely probable, I
have omitted without             any notice.       In   the  table  of simple
elective attractions,          I have retained      the  usual   order of the
 different substances         ;  inserting again in parentheses such of
 them    as  require     to  be transposed, in order to avoid inconse
 quences in the simple attractions : I have attached to each
 combination marked with an asterisc the number deduced
 from the double decompositions, as expressive of its attrac
 tive force ; and where the number is inconsistent                   with   the
                                                                     corrected.

                      of elective Attractions.                   57
corrected order of the simple elective attractions, I have also
inclosed it in a parenthesis. Such an apparent inconsistency
may perhaps in some cases be unavoidable, as it is possible
that the different proportions of the masses concerned, in
the operations of simple and compound decomposition, may
sometimes     cause a real difference in the comparative magni
tude of the attractive forces.       Those numbers, to which no
asterisc is affixed, are merely inserted by interpolation, and
they cau only be so for employed for determining the mutual
actions of the salts       to which they belong, as the results
which they indicate would follow from the comparison of
any other numbers, intermediate to the nearest of those,
which are more correctly determined.           I have not been able
to obtain a sufficient    number of facts      relating to the me
tallic salts,  to enable me to comprehend        many of them in
the tables.
    It has been usual to distinguish the attractions, which pro
duce the double decompositions of salts, into necessary and
 superfluous attractions ; but the distinction is neither very
 accurate, nor very important : they might be still further
divided, accordingly as two, three, or the whole of the four
ingredients concerned are capable of simply decomposing
the salt in which they are not contained ; and if two, ac
cordingly as they are previously united or separate; such
 divisions would however merely tend to divert the attention
 from the natural operation of the joint forces concerned.
    It appears to be not improbable,       that the attractive force
of any two      substances   might, in many cases, be expressed
bv the quotient of two numbers appropriate to the substances,
 or rather by the excess of that quotient above unity i thus
 the attractive force of many of the acids for the three prin
 cipal alkalies might probably be correctly represented in this
manner ; and where the order of attractions is different,
 perhaps the addition of a second, or of a second and third
 quotient, derived from a different series of numbers, would
 afford an accurate determination of the relative force of at
 traction, which would always be the weaker, as the two
 substances concerned stood nearer to each other in these
                                                              orders

 58               Account   of a numerical Table
 orders of numbers ; so that, by affixing, to each simple sub
 stance, two, three, or at most four numbers only, its at
tractive powers might be expressed in the shortest and most
general manner.
    I have thought it necessary to make some alterations in the
orthography generally adopted by chemists, not from a want
of  deference  to their individual authority,   but because it ap
pears to me that there are certain rules     of etymology, which
no modern author has      a right to set aside. According to the
orthography universally     established throughout the language,
without any material exceptions, our mode of writing Greek
words is always borrowed from the Romans, whose alphabet
we have adopted     :  thus the Greek vowel T, when alone, is
always expressed     in Latin and     in English by   Y,   and the
Greek diphthong OT by       U,   the Romans having no such di
phthong as OUorOY. The French have sometimes deviated
from this rule; and if it were excusable for any, it would be
for them, since their u and ou are pronounced exactly as the
T  and OT of the Greeks probably were : but we have no such
excuse.    Thus the French       have  used the term   acoustique,
which some English authors      have converted into " acoustics ;"
our anatomists, however, speak, much more correctly, of
the  "  acustic" nerve.    Instead of glucine, we ought cer
tainly, for a similar reason, to write glycine ; or glycina, if
the names of the earths are to end in a. Barytes, as a single
Greek word, means weight, and must be pronounced ba
rytes; but as the name of a stone, accented on the second
syllable, it must be written barites ; and the pure earth may
properly be called barita.     Yttria I have altered to itria, be
cause no Latin word begins with a Y.

composes the phosphates of barita and strontia,             (9) According to Fourcroy 's account,
the fluate of strontia decomposes the muriates of ammonia,               and of all the bases below
it ; but he says in auother part of the same Volume, that the fluate of strontia is an
unknown salt.       (10) According to Fourcroy's         account of these combinations, barita

    The comparative              use of this    table may be understood from
an example          :  If we     suppose that the nitrate           of barita decom
poses      the     borate of ammonia,              we must place            the boracic
acid above the nitric, between barita and ammonia in this
table, and consequently barita below ammonia, between the
fluoric      and      boracic in the former             :  hence the boracic and
fluoric acids must also                be    transposed       between        barita and
9trontia, and between barita and potass; or if we place the
fluoric still higher than the boracic in the first instance, we
must place barita.below ammonia between the nitric and
fluoric acids, where indeed it is not impossible that it ought
to stand.

      X.    On Crystallography.         By M. Hauv.            Translated from
          the last  Paris Edition of his Traite          de  Mineralogie*.

      Of  the Synonymies employed          in the following Treatise,        and
                             other Objects     of Detail.
     Synonymies         are as it were rallying points between the va
     rious authors who write upon one and the same natural sci
     ence. I am fully aware how indispensable it is to attend to
     them, particularly in a work containing a certain number of
    new denominations.            My greatest difficulty was to procure
    names,      which    in   the  German       language correspond         with
    those by which we designate              the different mineral species.
    M.    Leopold de Buch, a mineralogist of deserved celebrity,
    was kind enough, during his stay in Paris, to visit the cabinet
    of the School of Mines, and to        arrange and ticket a collection      of
    specimens, according to the method of the celebrated Werner.
       The figures have been traced by the method of projections,
    supposing the points of view to be removed ad infinitum.
    The full lines represent the ridges situated in the part of the
    solid, which will be turned towards the observer if he sees
   it in   the position to which the projection refers : the punc
    tured lines represent the ridges situated in the opposite part,
   or that which an observer could not see, unless the solid was
   diaphanous.
       In the figures     relating to geometrical           constructions,    we
   have represented       the diagonal and other lines as lying upon
   the faces    of  the solid, by suites of partial lines which leave
   small empty spaces between them:                     vide   mr, cm, cr,

   and we have represented          the axes and other lines which tra
   verse the solid, as well as those which are external, so far as
      * In compliance with the wishes of many of our scientific reader*, we in

 that the upper parts of the lines Ms, Rw, which are situated
 in the space, are assemblages of partial lines interspersed
 with points, while their lcm;er parts, applied upon the surface
 of the solid, are c omposed of partial lines without interme
diate points. This distribution, for the happy idea of which
we are indebted to M. Tremery, mining engineer, will assist
the reader in finding his way in the assortment of lines with
 which projections are complicated, by enabling him to seize
at the first glance the various functions of these lines.
    In indicating   the measures    of angles relative    to each  va
riety of crystalline form, I shall not repeat those which,
being common to it with other varieties formerly described,
are already   indicated by the latter.        It will be easy to re
cognise them from the conformity          of the letters, which upon
the different figures designate     the faces similarly situated.
                 GENERAL IDEA OF MINERALS.
    The name of minerals       has been    given to bodies which,
being placed on the surface or in the bowels of the terrestrial
globe, are devoid of organization, and only present assem
blages of similar molecules united to each other by a power
called affinity.
    Of this number are flints,     rubies, diamonds, gold, silver,
iron, &c. Mineralogy is the name of the science which
makes us acquainted with all these different bodies.
    The  general  classification of the bodies      which the study
of natural history    embrace^,  considered    on a grand scale, may
be referred to two terms of comparison, which are life and
spontaneous motion. From their union the distinctive cha
racter of animals is formed : pbants live, and yet cannot
move spontaneously : minerals are deprived of both faculties.
Man,     who is alone capable        of studying Nature, towers
above all the beings around      him, in point of intelligence and
reason.
    The three grand classes of which we are about to treat,
with the help of an ulterior and more comprehensive view,

may be reduced to two ; one of which includes animals and
vegetables under the common name of organic beings, and
the other comprehends minerals, or inorganic beings *.
     The manner in which the beings grow or are produced,
which are comprised within these two great divisions, pre
sents the most striking difference by which they can be di
stinguished. In animals and plants their growth takes place
by the simultaneous development of all the parts of the in
dividual, in consequence of the nourishment received by the
organs destined to elaborate it. Every thing which contri
butes to the increase of volume is the effect of internal me
chanism ; or, if new parts be formed externally, as in trees
 which      send     out branches and leaves,            these parts are only
productions         of  the    peculiar    substance      of the individuals,
which, assisted by the action of the nutritive juices, are de
veloped in the same way. In minerals, on the contrary, the
increase in volume takes place by an addition of new mole
 cules, which are applied to the surface of the body, in such
 a way that every thing which existed at each period of growth,
 remaining fixed, presents on all sides a basis, as it were, for
 the materials which arrive for continuing the edifice.                         On
     * We 6nd in the bowels of the globe, earthy or metallic stones, the
 matter of which, by succeeding to organic bodies, such as shells, is mo
 delled in the cavities which the latter had originally occupied.           What is
 called pclnjied wood also presents an apparent conversion of an organic body
 into a mineral.     Lastly, organic bodies which have undergone only slight
 alterations have been called fossil shel/s and fossil wood.    Several modern au
 thors, considering all bodies imbedded in the earth as in the regions of mine
 ralogy, have substituted the word fossil for mineral, and some have applied
  the latter to metallic ores only.    The   same  authors have denominated      the
  icience of fossils nryetogmsy. We have thought it right to conform to the
  ancient language, because the expression mineral, by the side of vegetable and
  animal, makes us perceive more clearly the gradation of the three great col
  lections of beings which have been denominated the kingdoms of Nature. We
  regard the study of fossils, properly so called, as an accessary so far as
  mineralogy is concerned, inasmuch as the consequences which we mav de
  rive frorn this study relative to the history of the globe rather spring from
  geology.    We know besides, that fossils, at least those which have been pri
   mitively in the animal kingdom, have in another point of view occupied the
   attention of several celebrated zoologists, and among others Cuvier, who has.
   as it were, recomposed the bodies of animals of which we find no living
   analogies, and restored to modern science     species of antiquity which  seemed
   to have been for ever lost.
                                                                                one

one hand, it is constantIy\he same being which merely passes
to other dimensions  ; on the other hand, it is always a new
being in proportion to what it acquires.
   We shall             have       an idea      of    the formation and increase                of
minerals,         if,
               after having dissolved common salt        water,                     in
we observe what passes while the water        evaporated    we            is              :
shall see small masses of salt deposited on the surface of the
water, or upon the sides of the vessel which contains    and                             it,
increase in proportion as they attract new particles. In this
case the figure of these masses     out of the question, and
                                                         is
we confine ourselves to considering generally the method in
which they are formed.
   The molecules of stones, metals, &c, may for time be                             a
suspended in   liquid. When this liquid afterwards aban
                        a
dons them successively, from whatever cause, they re-unite,
in obedience to their mutual affinity, and produce solid
masses      *.
   These molecules,                of which      the mineral           is   the aggregate,     are
imperceptible to our eyes,                      even      with      the     assistance   of    the
best optical        instruments.              doubt that they
                                                But       we   cannot
have determinate forms,   and that they   are  not similar in
every species of mineral.    We are even led to adopt this
idea,    by
         observations made upon     great number of mine   a
rals.
   Let   us continue to take       example the salt already
                                                as   an
mentioned.    If we cautiously strike portion of this salt,        a
we see   divided into fragments of
         it                           cubical form  and on     a                    ;
continuing         the division,           we        shall have cubes
                                                 successively
smaller, until they are no longer visible without the micro
scope.
   On       the   other hand chemistry,                        by
                                                          analysing the salt in
question, proves that                 it   iscomposed of two different prin
ciples one of which
        ;                            is   an acid called muriatic acid, and the
other an alkali called soda.                     These two principles art com-

sition at first keeps separated, afterwards acquire, upon its retreat, the liberty
of reuniting by virtue of their reciprocal affinity.

bined with      each     other in the salt, according to a certain
proportion     and      a   determinate arrangement.            Each cube
which    we take      from this salt is an aggregate,         and the con
nection and arrangement of .molecules is the same as in the
whole mass. But the subdivision of the salt into cubes suc
cessively smaller, has necessarily its limits ; and if we were
possessed of organs and. instruments of sufficient delicacy
for pushing this <Hwrsion as far as it would go, we should
even obtain      cube£ incapable of being subdivided without
being    analysed,.-^     e. without insulating the two principles,
the junction of which constitutes the essence of the salt.
     Hence we. conclude,          that  we   may consider in this salt
 (and the same may.be said of           all the minerals) molecules of
 two orders : the first, which we shall call elementary mole
 cules, and which are in the present case, on one hand those
 of the acid,   and on the other those         of the soda;     the second,
 to which we shall give the name            of integrant    molecules,   and
 which    are in the same case,        the smallest cubes which can be
 obtained separately,        without the nature of the salt being de
 stroyed.     The elementary molecules            have doubtless regular
 and constant forms also for each species of acid, alkali, &c,
 and those of one species adapt themselves to those of the
 other, forming small compartments whence result the inte
  grant molecules.
     We shall    suppose      that these last molecules        were  similar
  to the solid ones procured from a mineral by dividing it me
  chanically.     Of this we are not physically certain, since
  these molecules escape our observation              from their extreme
  tenuity.    But in      the   study  of  Nature    we    cannot act more
  wisely than to adopt this principle : That things are to be
  considered precisely as they present themselves to our obser
  vation.    The ultimate perceptible         results   of  the  mechanical
  division of minerals,        if they  do not give us the figure      of the
  true integrant molecules employed by Nature, represent them,
   at least with respect to us ; nearly as the substances which
   chemists can no longer analyse further, are simple substances
   with  respect to them, although in reality            they may still be
   susceptible of decomposition!.
                                                                            It

     It frequently happens that the cavity in which a mineral
is formed contains other minerals of an anterior existence,
which afterwards         serve it as a support when its formation is
completed. Frequently also the molecules of several minerals,
suspended at the same time in one and the same liquid, pro
duce cotemporaneous bodies.                Hence the mutual adherence
of several minerals       ; those kinds of penetrations, in virtue of
which they are often as it were interwoven or dovetailed into
each other; those mixtures of molecules of several different
bodies;     and all those sportive positions, all those varieties           of
conditions and aspects presented to the observation of the
naturalist by a continual change of contrasts and shades.
     Every mineralogical collection presents numerous exam
ples of these accidental combinations ; and although the
chief object of the mineralogist is to classify bodies from
considerations independent of their natural arrangement, it
is nevertheless       not a matter of indifference for him to know
what are the other substances which adhere most usually to
such and such species of stone or metal, and their indica
tion should have a place in the history of the substance with
which circumstances have associated them*. But the ob-
fervation     of masses frequently of stupendous siie, in which
 the respective     arrangement of the minerals results from an
 operation of Nature on a grand scale, is the object of a di
 stinct science called geology, which cannot be studied except
by travelling.

    * The French word gangtie has been applied to stony substances which
 accompany metallic veins, and matrix to substances which support, or con
tain imbedded in them, other stony substances, or of a nature not metallic.
I  thought it right to give an extension to the word gangue, by applying it in
discriminately to the supports or to the envelopes of a mineral, whatever be
jts nature. Thus, we say that such a variety of carbonated lime has a quartz
for its gangue.

u/x. Burckhardt                    proposes another new method for deter
mining        the       moon's         node.     This inquiry is          delicate ;   for
six seconds of error in   the meridian altitude may produce a
minute of difference in the place of the node. It is true that
it is not necessary to be known with any precision except
for   the calculation             of   the latitude,       and that a minute    of error
in    the     node        only produces reciprocally                    six seconds in
the moon's              latitude. This element has therefore
                                                     nearly
the same precision in the tables as the very observations
which serve to determine it. But these observations, when
the moon is very low, are subject to the irregularities of re
fraction ; they were in the same way affected     with uncer
tainty, as to the parallax and the semi-diameter, when these
two quantities were not yet so well determined as they are
now.         It   is,   therefore, the refractions which he endeavours
to avoid      making choice of
                  by            method over which thev
                                                     a
have     no influence. We do not allude to the errors in
the division of the mural circle  for we might, as M. Burck-
                                                  ;
hardt himself has proved, observe the altitudes of the moon
by the repeating circle, or determine with the same instru
ment the errors of the mural circle. The occultations of stars
would furnish               a   method,    if   their latitudes were certain;          but
these latitudes may be subject to uncertainties similar to that
of                        of the moon, when these stars are
      the meridian altitude
south    ;     order to be proper for the determination of the
             and       in

siderations singularly limit the choice which we may make;
and there   scarcely any other but Regulus and the Virgin's
                  is
Spike which will satisfy all the requisite conditions. We must
confine ourselves to these two stars, and they will be suffi
cient.  We shall choose the eclipses observed successively
when the moon was in the vicinity of its ascending and de
scending node. We may suppose the latitude of the star to
                                                                                        be

be good, and we may conclude from it the place of the two
nodes. They ought to differ 180 degree?, the known "mo
tion excepted of the node, which we must take into account.
This difference may serve for correcting the latitude of the
star: but even that is unnecessary ; for, having the node, (for
the two errors act in a contrary direction,) the mean between
the two determinations of one and the same node will be the
position which this node had at the moment of the two ob
servations, however distant from each other.          This method
is therefore general and complete; but the opportunities
of putting it in practice are unfortunately rare. On con
sulting the annals of astronomy, M. Burckhardt has only
found two observations of the Virgin's Spike, and four of
JRegulus, which are applicable.
   M. Biot, previous to his first journey to Spain, had de
termined by precise and delicate experiments the refrangent
power of the air and of gases, and this he found to be
very little different from what M. Delambre concluded from
his astronomical      observations combined with those of        M.
Piazzi.    We know that the refractions         vary with  the state
and temperature      of the atmosphere ; and for a Jong period
astronomers     applied to the mean quantities two correc
tions,  one depending upon the heat of the barometer, and
 the other upon the degree marked by the thermometer.
Since meteorology was enriched with a third instrument,
which serves for measuring the degrees 6f dryness and hu
midity in the air, astronomers were uncertain if the hygro
meter could      furnish   a third  correction.    Some trials had
been already made, which had given nothing accurate.            For
nearly a month      which M. Delambre       spent in the steeple of
Bois-commun, at a time when strong frosts had more than
once succeeded to very damp fogs, he sought to ascertain
if the variations of the hygrometer produced any change
in  the terrestrial refractions,  and   he  never found the least
indication of it.     The author of    the ^licanique   C&leste had
made the important remark, that, in point of equal elasticity,
the refrangent powers of the air and of the vapour of water
 would only differ by    a very  small quantity ; but the question
so essentially interested   astronomy, that this truth, already so
                                  E 4                     probable,

72                French National Institute.
probable, was well worthy of being established       by direct ex
periments.     This is what M. Biot undertook       last summer,
with the most delicate accuracy. He had in         the first place
to determine the effects of vapour by itself :       he dried,    by
means    of potash,  the  warm air continued      in his prism ;
outside  of it he-had air charged with   the natural   moisture   of
the atmosphere. The pressure of these two airs, indicated
by the interior and exterior barometers, was not the same;
the difference was equal to the tension of the aqueous va
pour of the atmosphere. The deviation of the luminous ray
m the prism then gave the refraction produced by the vapour;
and we might see whether this refraction differed from that
which woulrfhave been produced by the air alone at        a similar
temperature. The differences never rose above some        tenths  of
a second, and the medium was only         0"l5, a quantity truly
insensible, since it only produces  a sixtieth of a second at the
height of 45 degrees.     M. Biot hence concludes " that the
vapour of the air sensibly refracts like the atmospheric air;
and thus, in astronomical observations, we should be con
tented with having in view the height of the barometer and
thermometer, and neglect the vapours more or less with
which the atmosphere may be charged.
                                            "
   The first experiments of M. Biot were made in winter and
in low temperatures: the last took place in the greatest heat
of summer, and yet the difference upon the mean refraction
only differed by an extremely small quantity, which is still
made less by    M. Delambre's result. To conclude:       all astro
nomers will easily agree,    that the direct observations    of  the
refractions could not give, notwithstanding all possible care,
either the same agreement in the particular results, or
the same precision in the absolute quantity; because, by
the astronomical methods, this value, or the constant part
of the refraction, is always dependent upon the altitude of
the pole, because we can only determine simultaneously the
two unknown quantities; and we may always, by causiug
small changes in a contrary direction, represent the observa
tions equally well.    M. Delambre has declared that he can
not account for the small difference which exists between his
refractions and those of M. Biot. We may therefore adopt
                                                                   in

ki preference   the result   of these physical experiments; it is
only  by calculating     with  the greatest precision, millions of
observations made at different times, and with different
kinds of instruments, that we can attain this point of ap
proximation.       If we afterwards compare the new table of
refractions with those of Bradley, Mayer, Burg, and Piazzi,
we shall perhaps be astonished at the little that has been
gained by so many various observations, calculations, and
experiments : but such is the present state of astronomy, that
the greatest efforts can produce little more than almost in
sensible ameliorations, although we certainly gain in point
of accuracy in proportion as experiments become more exact
and rigorous.       The same comparison will prove that the
greatest  difference between the various tables chiefly belongs
to the constant factor of the thermometrical correction.         In
fact, as far as 80° of distance from the zenith, at which the
observations     differ more from each other than they are re
moved from the tables, scarcely can we find,' in the mean
refractions,   one or two seconds of difference among astro
nomers, if we except M. Burg, who has frequently a double
quantity in excess, instead of our seeing in very high or very
low temperatures uncertainties of 9 or 10 seconds. It was
therefore extremely necessary to verify this co-efficient ; and
this is what M. Biot has done with the same success.           The
 quantity  which    he  found,   according to his own  experiments
and those of Gay Lussac, scarcely exceeds what Mayer had
determined 50 years ago, and to which Lacaille found al
most nothing to add. Bradley made this co-efficient a little
larger, and almost every astronomer has adopted his table.
    M. Biot, who employs his time so usefully, also read se
 veral excellent memoirs to the Institute this year;- but his
 departure for Spain does not admit of our analysing them ;
 he is at present occupied at Formentera, a small island to
the southward of Ivica, in measuring the altitude of the
 pole, the length of the pendulum, and the azimuths of the
 most southern points of the triangles which he drew from
 that island to Tortosa, where the death of M. Mechain had
 caused   them    to be suspended.       Messrs. Chaix and Rodri
 guez, but above all      M.  Arago, took the most active part in
                                                                this

 this great and difficult operation, which will form a very
 excellent completion to the description of the meridian of
 Dunkirk and Barcelona. They have fortunately triumphed
 over every obstacle ; by their perseverance           in braving the
 severest cold, snows, winds, heat, and storms, they suc
 ceeded   in uniting   by two great      triangles the isles of Ivica
 and Formentera on the shores of Valencia.              What remains
to be done in order to add nearly three degrees to the grand
meridian is much easier        ; and its success is undoubted ; be
cause   from   this  moment     it depends upon the care and the
precision of the geometrical and physical knowledge with
which our young astronomers are endowed, as well as upon
their zeal and courage.
    M. Messier has presented         to the class a beautiful drawing
which    he made    of the nebulus of Orion, to which he has
added that of Legentil, and another much more difficult to
see, which he discovered in 1773.                  Some astronomers
thought they had remarked on a large scale changes of form
and of light, owing probably to the different glasses which
they used.      M.  Messier gives the dimensions and size of his
glasses ; and with his drawing, which appears in our Me
moirs of 1807, astronomers will one day be able to ascertain
if these changes     arc real,   or only optical illusions.
    The storm which       was experienced at Paris on the 21st         of
October,     1 807,  and the no less extraordinary        wind   of the
following day,        deserve    to be recorded     in the annals      of
meteorology.        M. Messier has collected all the details with
care, and has consulted all the registers of observations
kept for 50 years without finding any thing similar. At the
conclusion of a no less violent storm, which took place on
the 3d     of November following, the lightning struck the
church of Montyilliers ; and M. Messier has also presented
us with details respecting this catastrophe.
   The   year 1807    will be celebrated     by the discovery  of a new
planet,   and the long-continued          appearance    of one of the
most beautiful comets ever seen. The planet was discovered
at Bremen by M. Olbers, and the letter to M. Lalande,
announcing      the circumstance,       arrived  a few minutes      alter
the death    of that prince of astronomers.         M.  Burckardt im

                    French National Institute.                   75
mediately    gave us the first approximate elements, and he
improved   them  in proportion as his observations became more
numerous.      We have a remarkable proof of the perfection
of  the   modern methods, in this facility of finding the in
stant of the appearance of a new heavenly body, all the cir
cumstances attending its course, the form and position of
the orbit which it describes around the sun.        On this occa
sion, therefore, analogy considerably abridged the first at
tempts.     The three last planets had already the singularity
of their distance from the sun being nearly the same. Ac
cording to   M.  Olbers' ideas, which    contributed    to the dis
covery by directing him in his inquiries, the planet Vesta
ought also to have this resemblance with Ceres, Pallas, and
Juno   ; and this conjecture has been almost completely veri
fied.   In order  to obtain a more certain     knowledge of this
point, and of the      true elements, we must wait until we
have observed a greater arc, and calculated the perturbations
which Vesta ought to undergo, particularly with respect to
Jupiter.    M.  Burckhardt has already ascertained that these
perturbations are very sensible, although less difficult to cal
culate than those of Pallas.
   A   comet was discovered at Marseilles,       by M. Pons,      on
the 21st of October:     it was then south,    and   adjoining the
horizon, and his track followed nearly that of the sun. These
circumstances     hindered   more northern     astronomers from
seeing it immediately ; forM. Bouvard, on the same evening,
took an accurate view of the whole sky without seeing any
thing unusual : as it was from that moment visible to the
naked eye, it was perceived a few days afterwards by Messrs.
Vidal and Flauguergues, and by different astronomers at
Madrid,    and  in Germany.      M.   de Thulis, director of     the
observatory of Marseilles,    sent us his first two observations,
M.    Burckhardt added a third,    and next day he gave the first
elements of the orbit. He has perfected them since. Messrs.
Bouvard and Mathieu have made similar calculations upon
other observations.     The parabolic elements seem to be well
known, and v/e have nothing to add on the subject of this
 comet which we have not read in the Journals.             Its long
continuation,    however, gave   M.   Burckhardt   reason to hope
                                                                that

 that it might give rise to some interresting remarks, and ft
 is probable that he will give to the public those made by
 himself.
     The same astronomer has also been occupied with de
 scribing several former comets, of which an imperfect de
 scription has appeared. In the Imperial observatory he
 found some unpublished observations of tlfe comet of 1701,
 seen at Pau by M. Pallu. M. Burckhardt supposes that this
 comet is the same which was seen at sea in the month of
 February following; and this circumstance, in his opinion,
is worthy of being examined.           ,
    The comet of 1672 had been           supposed by some astrono
mers to have been the same with that of 1805.                M. Burck
hardt has shown by calculations,          that  this is not the case.

D r. Brewster          of Edinburgh      has invented a new gonio
metrical telescope     and microscope,     for measuring the angles
of crystals by reflection, and for ascertaining the inclination
of strata, and the apparent magnitude of angles when the
 eye is not placed at their vertex.
    The same gentleman has also invented an            instrument for
 determining distances at one station, without measuring a
 base, without a portable base being attached to the instru
 ment, or without knowing the magnitude of the object the
 distance of which is to be ascertained. A long base is ac
 tually created by the instrument, without measuring it; and
 the distance is obtained upon a principle,         which,     as far  as
 we know, has      never   been    employed in trigonometrical       in
 struments.
    The art of printing from stone continues to be practised
 with great success on the Continent. At Stutgard a printing-
 office has been established, for the purpose of a more exten

 music has been the chief branch to which            it has    hitherto
 been directed   on the Continent.

    Baron Lutoendorp, long known              as a  traveller and
voyager, has contrived a machine        by which a person may
 exist under water, without     fear  of being drowned ; it is a
kind of cuirass, which admits of the body assuming every
 possible position,   and which is said to be extremely useful
in saving persons in danger of being drowned. The police
 of Vienna have purchased a considerable number of these
machines, with the view of assisting in bringing up drowned
persons from the bottom      of the Danube.
    Aerostation. — On      the 22d of August, 1 808,, Messrs.
 Andreoli  andBrioschi,   of Padua, ascended in a balloon, amid
 an immense concourse of spectators. Soon after leaving the
ground, the barometer having fallen to 15 inches, M. Bri-
oschi began to feel an extraordinary palpitation of the heart;
his breathing, however, was not affected : the barometer
afterwards fell to 12 inches, and he was overcome with a
gentle sleep, which ended in a complete lethargy.        The bal
loon continued ascending ; and when the barometer stood at
nine inches M. Andreoli perceived that the machine waa
completely inflated, and that he could not move his left
hand.     The mercury continuing to descend, marked eight-
inches and    a half, and a violent detonation was heard from
the  balloon, which then descended with great rapidity, and
M.   Brioschi awoke.     The aeronauts alighted safely on the
hill of Euganea, not far from Petrarch's tomb and the
city of Argua, about twelve miles from Padua. The voyage
lasted from half-past three until half-past eight o'clock.

J-   HE science which you profess, and the art which             has                  it
fallen to my lot to cultivate, are so nearly allied that, had                ;

should still have wished the papers annexed to have passed
through your hands to the public.        You will readily thence
infer, how much feel myself flattered

sented to the Royal Society through         channel which must a
secure for them the most favourable reception.
    My reputatipn for the dividing of astronomical and other
instruments,           no means unknown to the world
                       is    by                                  but                  ;

    It   would ill become me, in addressing myself to the
Members of this Society upon a subject which they are so
well enabled to appreciate, to arrogate to myself more than
may be assigned as my doe, for whatever of success niay
have been the result of my long continued endeavours, ex
erted in prosecuting towards perfection the dividing of in
struments immediately subservient to the purposes of astro
nomy.      A man very naturally will set a value upon a thing
on which so much of his life has been expended ; and 1 shall
readily, therefore, be pardoned for saying, that considering
•some attainments which I have made on this subject as too
valuable to be lost, and being encouraged also by ibt de
gree of attention which the Royal Society has ever paid to
practical subjects, 1 feel myself ambitious of presenting them
to the public through what I deem the most respectable
channel in the woiid.
    It was as early as the year 1775, being then apprentice to
my brother, the late Mr. John Tmughtbn, that the art of
dividing had become interesting to me ; the study of astro
nomy was also new and fascinating ; and I then formed the
resolution to aim at the nicer parts of my profession.
    At the time alluded to, my brother, in the art of dividing,
was justly considered the rival of Ramsden ; but he was then
 almost unknown beyond the narrow circle of the mathema
tical and optical instrument makers;         for whom he was
chiefly occupied in the division, by hand, of small astrono
mical quadrants, and Hadley's sextants of large radius.
Notwithstanding my own employment at that time was of a
 much inferior nature, yet I closely inspected his work, and
 tried at leisure hours on waste materials to imitate it. With
6s steady a hand, and as good an eye, as young men gene
 rally have, I was much disappointed at finding, that after
 having made two points, neat and small to my liking,            I
 could not bisect the distance between them, without enlarg
 ing, displacing, or deforming them with the points of the
 compasses. This circumstance gave me an early dislike to
 the tools then in use ; and occasioned me tire more uneasi
 ness, as I foresaw that it was an evil which no practice,
 care, nor habit could entirely cure. Beam-compasses,
 spring-dividers, and a scale of equal parts, in short, appeared
 to me little better than so many sources of mischief.
     I had already acquired a good share of dexterity, as a ge
 neral workman.      Of the different branches of our art, that
 of turning alone seemed to me to border on perfection. This
                                                         juvenile

                          On dividing Instruments.                                 63
juvenile conceit, fallacious          as I afterwards found         fur    it,
  nished the first train of thoughts, which led to the method
  about to be described; for           occurred to ine, that
                                       it                         could
                                                                      if I
 by   any means apply the principle of turning to the art of
  dividing instruments, the tools liable to objection might be
  dispensed with.         The means of doing this was first sug
 gested,   by   seeing the action of the perambulator, or mea-
  •uring  wheel ;    the surface of the earth presenting itself as the
  edge  of  the   instrument      to be divided, and the wheel of the
  perambulator as    a     narrow roller acting on that edge; and
 hence arose an idea that some easy contrivance might be de
 vised, for marking off the revolutions and parts of the roller
 upon the instrument.           Since the year above mentioned, se
  veral persons have proposed to me, as new, dividing                the      by
 roller, and I     have been told, that       also occurred long ago
                                                it
  to Hook, Si3son, and others; but,, as Hatton on watch
 making says,
                     " do jiot consider the man an inventor,
                         1
 who merely thinks of              athing; to be an inventor, in my
 opinion, he. must act successfully upon the thought, so as
  to make  it    useful."     I had no occasion, however, to have
 made an apology for acting upon                 thought, which, un
                                                 a
 known to me, had been previously conceived                    by
                                                           others for,        ;
it   will be seen   in   the sequel, how little the roller has to do
 in the result, and with what extreme caution                    found
                                                                    it   is
 necessary to employ it.
     When  a    roller   is properly proportioned to the radius of
 the circle to be divided, and with its edge made                 small  a
 matter conical, so that one side may be too great, and the
 other side too little,        may be adjusted
                              it                    so exactly, that               it
 may be carried several times around the circle, without
 the error of    a     single second      and
                                            ;     acts with so much
                                                     it
 steadiness,    that it   may not unaptly be considered as wheel         a
 and pinion of indefinitely high numbers.                Yet, such                 is
 the imperfection of the edges of the circle and roller, that,
 when worked with the greatest care, the intermediate parts,
 on   a  radius of two feet, will sometimes be unequal to
the value of half         a  minute or more.       After having found
the terminating point of              quadrant or circle so perma
                                       a
nent, although      I   was not prepared to expect perfect equa
lity throughout, yet          I   was much mortified to find the
errors so great, at least ten times as much as               expected.;
which fact indicated, beyond               doubt, that
                                            a

is  to be trusted at all,      it  must only be trusted through                    a
very short arc. Had there been any thing slippery                   the    in

been an end  of it at once ; but, that not being the case id
any sensible degree, the roller becomes an useful auxiliary
to fill up short intervals, whose limits have been corrected
by more certain means*.     ,
   Bird, who enjoyed the Undisputed reputation of being (he
most accurate divider of the age in which he lived, was the
first who contrived the means how to render the usual divi
sions of the quadrant bisectional ; which property, except
his being unusually careful in avoiding the effects of unequal
expansion from change of temperature, chiefly distinguished
his method from others who divided by hand.         This desi
rable object he accomplished by the use which he made of a

which have a tendency to excite surprise. The first is, that the roller should.
In different parts of its journey round the circle, measure the latter so diffe
rently.    One would not wonder, however, if in taking the measure across a
ploughed field, it should be found different to a parallel measure taken upon
a gravel walk ; and, in my opinion, the cases are not very dissimilar.          Poro
sity of the metal, in one part of the circle more than in the other, must evi
dently have the same effect ; brass unhammered is always porous ; and the

which have felt the effect cf three ; and, should the edge of. the circle be in
dented by jarring-Umung, it would produce a visible similitude to ploughed

 palpable source of error ; yet, perhaps with our greatest care we may not be
 able to avoid it altogether.     The second              is,

  the experiment with good work, that on coming round to the point of com

 finely divided scale of equal parts. The thing aimed at was,
to obtain a point upon the arc at the highest bhectional
number of divisions from 0, which in his eight feet quadrants
was 1024, = 85° 20'.       The extent of the beam compasses,
with which he traced the arc upon the limb of the instrument
to be divided, being set off upon that arc, gave the points
0° and 6o° ; which, being bisected, gave 30° more to com
plete the total arc. A second order of bisections gave points
at 15° distance from each other; but that which denoted 75"
was most useful.     Now, from the known length of the ra
dius, as measured upon the scale, the length of the chord
of 10° 20' was computed, taken off from the scale, and pro
tracted froi;i 75° forwards; and the chord of 4° 40', being
ascertained in the same manner, was set off from 90° back
wards, meeting the chord of 10' 20' in the continually b"i-
sectional arc of 85° 20'. This point being found, the work
was carried on by bisections, and the chords, as they be
came small enough, were set off beyond this point to supply
the remainder of the quadrantal arc. My brother, whom I
mentioned before, from mere want of a scale of equal parts
upon which he could rely, contrived the means of dividing
bisectionally without one. His method 1 will briefly state as
follows, in the manner which it would apply to dividing
a mural quadrant.      The arcs of 60° and 30° give the total
arc as before ; and let the last arc of 30° be bisected, ajso
 the last arc of 15°, and again the last arc of 7° 30'. The
"two marks next Q0° will now be 82:i 30' and 86° 15', con
sequently the point sought lies between them.       Bisections
will serve us no longer; but if we divide this space equally
into three parts, the most forward of the two intermediate
marks will give us 85°, and if we divide the portion of the
arc between this mark and 86° 15' also into three, the most
backward of the two marks will denote 85° 25'. Lastly, if
we divide any one of these last spaces into, five, and set off
one of these filth parts backwards from 85° 26', we shall
have the desired point at 1024 divisions upon the arc from 0°.
All the rest of the divisions which have been made in this
operation, which I have called marks because they should
be made as faint as possible, must be erased; for my bro
ther would not suffer a mark to remain upon the arc to in
terfere with his future bisections.
    Mr. Smeaton, in a paper to be more particularly noticed
presently, justly remarks the want of a unity of principle in
Mr. Bird's method; for he proceeds partly on the ground of
the protracted radius, and partly upon that of the .computed
chord ; which, as Smeaton observes, mav or may not agree.

Bird, without doubt,   used the radius and its parts in order to
secure an exact quadrant ; but Smeaton, treating exactness
in the total arc as of little value to astronomy, would,                                             in,
order to secure the more essential property of equality of                                       di
vision, reject the radius altogether, and proceed entirely
upon the simple principle of the computed chord.              The
means pursued           by
                       my brother, to reach the point which
terminates the great bisectional arc,     the only part in which

is as well calculated to procure eqmlity of division, as the
means suggested             by
                       Smeaton; at the same time that                                           it   is
equal to Bird's in securing the precise measure of the total
arc.    It proceeds entirely upon the principle of the pro
tracted chord of CO0 and its subdivision             and the uncer
tainty, which       introduced into the work
                   is                                the sparing use    by ;

chords, and applying them to the arc of the instrument to

    Ramsdcn's well known method of dividing               the engine             by

tised in London, that I know of, besides my own, has not

dots, to enable him to make and keep them at an equal                            di
stance from the centre.          The bisectional arcs,_also, which
cut them across, deform them much                and, what
                                                       ;        worse,    is
the dots which require correction (about two thirds perhaps
of the whole) will become larger than the rest, and une
qually so in proportion to the number of attempts which
bave been found necessary to adjust them.                In the course
of which operation, some of them grow insufferably too
large, and    itbecomes necessary to reduce them to an equality                        .
 with their neighbours. This           done with the burnisher, and

are always ill-defined, and of              bad figure.

 siderable proportion to the whole. In my opinion,              would      it
 hea  great improvement of this method, to divide the whole
 by  hand at once, and afterwards to correct the whole; for                        a
 dot forced to its place, as above, will seldom allow the com?

 necessary.
      I will now dismiss this method of dividing, with observing,
 that it is tedious in the extreme; and did I not know the
 contrary beyond a doubt, I should have supposed it to have
 surpassed the utmost limit of human patience*.                        When I
 made my first essay at subdividing with the roller, I used
 this method, according to the improvement suggested above,
 of cqrreciing a few primitive points; but even this was too
 slow for one who had too much to do.                    Perhaps, however,
 had mv instruments been divided for me by an assistant, I
 might not have grudged to have paid him for the labour of
 going through the whole work by the method of adjustment;
 nor have felt the necessity of contriving a better way.
     I might now extend the account of my method of dividing
to a great length ; by relating the alterations which the ap«
paratus has undergone during a long course of years f, and
 the various manner of its application, before I brought it to
its present state of improvement; but I think I may save
myself that trouble, for truly I do not see its use : I will,
therefore, proceed immediately to a disclosure of the me
thod, as practised on a late occasion, in the dividing of a
four feet meridian circle, now the property of Stephen
 Groombridge, esq., of Blackheath.
     The surface of the circle which is to receive the divisions,
as well as its inner and outer edges, but especially the latter,
 should be turned in the most exact and careful manner ; the
reason for which will be better understood, when we come
to describe the mode of applying the roller : and, as no pro
jection can be admitted beyond the limb, if the telescope, an
is generally the case, be longer than the diameter, those
 parts which extend further must be so applied, that they
 may be removed during the operation of dividing.                         Fig. 1
    * At the time alluded to, the double microscopic micrometer was unknown
 to me, and I did not-learn its use, for these purposes, till the year 1790, from
 general Roy's description of the large theodolite.      Previous to that time, I
 had used a frame which carried a single wire very near the surface to be di
 vided ; this wire was moveable by a line micrometer screw, and was viewed
 by a single lens inserted in the lower end of a tube, which, for the purpose
 of taking off the parallax, was four inches long. The greatest objection to
 this mode of constructing the apparatus is, that the wire being necessarily
 exposed, is apt to gather up the dust ; vet it is preferable to the one now in
 use, in cases where any doubt is entertauied of the accuracy of the plane which
 is to receive the divisions.
    -f The full conception of the method had occupied my mind in the year
  1778; but as my brother could not be readily persuaded to relinquish a
 branch of the business to me in which he himself excelled, it was not until
 September 1785 that I produced my Cut specimen, by dividing an astronomi
  cal quadrant of two feet radius.
                                                                              and

the figure, must also be fixed to the main plate of fig. l, at
near to the former as possible, but viewing one oF the divi
sions on the roller.    With a due attention to each micro-,
scope, it will now be seen to the greatest exactness when,
by raising or depressing the roller, its commensurate diame»
ter is found.
    Fig. 3 is a representation of the apparatus for transferring
the divisions of the roller to the circle.   It consists of two
slender bars, which, being seen edgewise in the figure, have
only the appearance of narrow lines ; but, when looked at
from above, they resemble the form of the letter A. They
are fastened to the main frame, as at W and Z, by short
pillars, having also the off leg of the angle secured in the
same manner; Y is a fine conical steel point for making the
dots, and X is a feeler, whereby the point     Y may be pressed
down with a uniform force, which force may be adjusted,
by bending the end of the bar just above the point, so as to
make the dots of the proper size. The point Y yields most
readily to a perpendicular action ; hut is amply secured against
any eccentric or lateral deviation.
    The apparatus, so far described, is complete for laying"
our foundation, i.e. making 256 primary dots; no matter
whether with perfect truth, or not, as was said respecting the
divisions of the roller; precision in either is not to be ex
pected, nor wished ; but it is of some importance, that they
should be all of the same size, concentric, small, and round.
They should occupy a position very near the extreme border
pf the circle, as well to give them the greatest radius pos
sible, as that theft should be room for the stationary mi
croscope and othe mechanism, which will be described
hereafter.
    It must be noticed, that there is a clamp and adjusting
screw attached to the main plate of fig. l ; but, as it differs
jn no respect from the usual contrivances for quick and slow
motion, it has been "judged unnecessary to incumber the
 drawing with it.
    Now, the roller having been adjusted, with one micro-
Scope H upon its proper dot on the circle, and the other mi
 croscope at the first division on the roller ; place the appa
ratus of fig. 3, §o that the dotting point Y may stand directly
 over the place which is designed for the beginning of the di
visions. In this position of things, let the feeler X be pressed
 down, until its lower end comes in contact with the circle;
this will carry down the point, and make the first impres
 sion, or primary dot, upon the circle ; unclamp the appa
 ratus and carry it forwards by hand> unjtil another division

                              computation, to ascertain their abso
    lute and individual errors, and to form these errors into con
    venient tables,       the next part of the process, and makes

    very important branch of my method of dividing.
       The apparatus must now be taken off, and the circle
    mounted in the same manner that             will be

    vatory. The two microscopes, which have divided heads,
    must also be firmly fixed to the support of the instrument,
    on opposite sides, and their wires brought to bisect the first
    dot, and the one which should be ISO0 distant.            Now, the
    microscopes remaining fixed, turn, the circle half round, or
    until the first microscope coincides wit!) the opposite dot                                 •
    and, if  the other microscope be exactly at the other dot,                           it ;

    meter of the circle; and            if                 obvious that

    the degrees    ;and for the purpose of distinguishing the +
    and — errors, the heads, as mentioned before, are num
    bered backwards and forwards to fifty.          Qne of the micro
    scopes remaining as before, remove the other to             position    a
    at right angles; and, considering for the present both the

now be placed at a distance of 22° 3(/, and the half differences
of the parts of all the arcs of 45° measured and noted as be
fore ; thus descending by bisections to 1 1° 15', 5° 37' 30",
and 2° 48' 45".           Halt this last quantity is too small to allow
 the micrometers to be brought near enough ; but it will have
the desired effect, if they are placed at that quantity and it*
half, i. e. 4° 13' 7"'S; in which case the examination, in
stead of being made at the next, will take place at the next
division but one, to that which is the subject of trial.                      Du
 ring    the  whole    of  the  time   that the  examination        is made,     all
 the dots, except the one under examination, are for the pre
 sent supposed to be in their true places; and the only thing
 in this most important part of the business, from first to last,
 is to ascertain with the utmost care, in divisions of the mi
 crometer head, how much one of the parts of the interval
 under examination exceeds the other, and carefully to tabu
 late the half of their difference.
     I will suppose that every one, who attempts to divide a
 large astronomical instrument, will have it engraved                         first.
 Dividing      is a  most    delicate   operation,    and    every   coarser    one
 should precede it.           Besides, its being numbered is particu
 larly useful to distinguish one dot from another : thus, in
  the two annexed tables of errors, the side columns give signi
 ficant names to every dot, in terms of its value to the nearest
  tenth of a degree, and the mistaking of one for another is
  rendered nearly impossible.
      The foregoing examination furnishes materials for the
  construction of vhe table of half differences, or apparent
  errors*. The first line of this table consists of two varie
  ties ; i. e. the micrometers were at 180° distance for obtain
  ing the numbers which fill the columns of the first and third
  quadrant ; and at 90°, for those of the second and fourth
  quadrant.        The third variety makes one line, and was ob
  tained with a distance of 45°: the fourth consists of two
  lines, with a distance of 22° 30' : the fifth of four lines,
  with a distance of 11° 15" : the sixth of eight lines, with a
  distance of 5" 37' 30": the seventh of sixteen lines, with
  a distance of 2° 48' 45": and the eighth and last variety,
  being the remainder of the table, consists of thirty-two lines,
  and was obtained with a distance of 4° 13' 7""5-
      The table of apparent errors, or half differences, just ex-
     * If the table of real errors be computed as the ivork of examination pro
  ceeds,  there will be no occasion for this table at all ; but, I think it best not
  to let  one part interfere with another, and therefore I examine the whole
  before I begin to compute.

The rule is this : Let a be the real error of the preceding dot,
and b that of the following one, and c the apparent error,
taken from the table of half differences, of the dot under
                                                        _

                             Jit
this simple expression may not be so generally understood
by workmen as I wish, it may be necessary to say the same
thing less concisely.     If the real errors of the preceding and
following dots are both +, or both — , take half their sum
and prefix thereto the common sign ; but, if one of them is
-f-, and the other — , take half their difference, prefixing
the sign of the greater quantity : again, if the apparent error
of the dot under investigation has the same sign of the quan
tity found above, give to their sum the common sign, fat
the real error ; but if their signs are contrary, give to theif
difference the sign of the greater for the real error.    I add a
few examples.

    It is convenient, in the formation of the table of real er*
rors, that they should be inserted in the order of the num
bering of the degrees on their respective quadrants ; although
their computation necessarily took place in th" order in
which the examination was carried on, or according to the
arrangement in the table of apparent errors. The first dot
of the first quadrant having been assumed to be in its true
place, the first of the third quadrant will err by just half the
difference found by the examination ; therefore these errors
arealike in both tables. The real error of the first dot of the
second quadrant comes out in the first example; that of the
fourth was found in like manner, and completes the first line.
It is convenient to put the error of the division 90° of each,
quadrant at the bottom of each column, although it is the
same as the point 0° on the following quadrant.           The line
of 45° is next filled up ; the second example shows this ; but
there is no occasion to dwell longer upon this explanation;
for every one, who is at all fit for such pursuits, will think
what has already been said fully sufficient for his purpose.
 However, I will just mention that there can be no danger,
in the formation of this table, of taking from a wrong line
the real errors which are to be the criterion for finding that
of the one under trial; because they are in the line next to
it ; the others, which intervene in the full table, not being
yet inserted.      The last course of all             is,
                                             however, an excep
tion;    for, as the examining microscopes could not be brought
near enough to bisect the angle 2° 48' 45", recourse was had
to that quantity and its half; on which account the examina
tion is   prosecuted      using errors at two lines distance, as
                          by                                            is
shown     in the two last examples.
    When the table of real errors          constructed, the other
                                                is

will be discovered as the operation of dividing        carried on
                                                            is          ;
and, in that case, the table of apparent errors must be had
recourse to    ; indeed, not    figure should be destroyed until

                          OF CRYSTALLIZATION.
 w     e have been led by observation and reasoning to ascer
  tain that minerals were composed of similar integrant mole
  cules. The way in which they are mechanically divided has
  besides proved to us, that the cause which solicited these
 molecules to be mutually attracted, reunited them in rows
 upon planes situated in the direction of their different
 faces.    These considerations were useful for preparing the
  development of another very remarkable result of the laws
 of affinity, which is referred to the external configuration
 of minerals, and has given birth to one of the most fertile
 branches of the science of which they are the objects.
     Such therefore is the action of these laws upon integrant
 molecules, that, when nothing disturbs                  it,
                                                  the assemblages
 of these molecules are terminated       plane by
                                                surfaces,  whence
 result regular forms similar to those of geometrical solid-.
 We have frequent examples of this regularity in the garnet,
 topaz, emerald, carbonated lime, sulphated barytes, &c.                          ;
 and in   a great number of metallic substances.      The sight of
 these polyhedrons always excites the surprise of        person to a
 whom they are for the first time presented, and they must
 frequently be shown to him incrusted with their native earth
 before he can believe in the geometry of nature.
    All those regular bodies have been received under the com
 mon denomination of crystals*. The term crystallization,
which would at first sight appear to apply only to the species
of operation from which crystals are produced, has generally
a  more extensive signification.      expresses in general every
                                          It

                                                         by
nity. If these masses have symmetrical aspect, they will
                                    a
be the products of regular crystallization properly so called.
If their form vague, and cannot be determined
                   is                                       precise in   a
manner, they will belong to confused crystallization.

 by proper surfaces, and to concur all at the same time to the
 harmony which ought to result from their aggregation. The
 liquid must be in a state of repose ; its own molecules must
slowly abandon those of the mineral, in order to place them
in the position most favourable to affinity, and the cavity must
be spacious enough, and the liquid sufficiently abundant, for
the crystalline molecules to swim in it at full liberty.

regard as disturbing causes of crystallization,      will in some

would have taken place in the event of slow and tranquib    a

so called, an important consideration in the first place pre
sents itself, — consideration which places minerals

some measure, and permits its form to be entirely developed to the eyes of an
observer.    But most of the crystals which offer this advantage have been ex
tracted from certain earthy masses in which they were really solitary, and in
the midst of which they are formed at the time when these earths were diluted
in an aqueous fluid. We may conceive this formation from an experiment of
Felletier, who, having placed argil soaked in        solution of alum, cut this

size of pea. Hence he concluded that the crystalline molecules might have

obstacles which opposed their union. — Mem.      Observ. de Chimie,

similar precision.         Carbonated lime, for instance, assume*,
according to circumstances, the form of a rhomboid ; of a
regular r;exahedral prism ; of a solid terminated by twelve-
scalene angles ; or of a dodecahedron             with pentagonal faces,
&c. Sulphuretted iron, or ferruginous pyrites, produces
sometimes cubes and sometimes regular octahedrons ; here
dodecahedrons with pentagonal faces, there icosahedrorr9
with triangular faces, &c.
     It is true that, among the varieties of one and the same
species, it often happens that a more compound form differs
from a more simple form only by certain facets, similar to
those which would result from sections made on the solid
angles, or on the ridges of the latter*.                    Pyrites, for in
 stance, sometimes assumes the form of a cube, the eight
solid angles of which being beaten down would expose to
view so many triangular facets, in such a manner that this
 form may be considered as the passage from the cube to the
 octahedron, with which it is connecTed by its eight equila
teral triangles, which are situated like the faces of this se
 cond solid.
      But in addition to these transitions being already very
 singular in themselves, as appertaining to modifications mnch
 more sensible than seems to be necessary to distinguish sim
 ple varieties, we find on the other hand certain crystalline
 forms, which, by a singularity still more remarkable, do not
 exhibit any vestiges of common parts, and present the ap
 pearance of a complete metamorphose of the mineral from
 which they derive their origin.             And in order to cite a new
 example, let us place by the side of each other the regular
 hexahedral prism of carbonated lime, (PI. I., fig. 1.) and
 the scalene         dodecahedron with scalene triangular faces
  (fig. 6.). We can scarcely conceive how two polyhedrons, so
  dissimilar at first view, come to touch together, and are as
  if confounded in the crystallization of one and the same
  mineral.
      In short, as if the results of this operation of Nature were
  destined to excite astonishment of every kind, while one and
  the same substance lends itself to so many transformations,
  we meet very different substances, which present absolutely
  the same form.          Thus rluated lime, muriated soda, sulphu
  retted iron, sulphuretted lead, &c, crystallize in cubes un
   der certain circumstances; and in other cases, the same

            It was this similitude of forms which) at a time when
        the study of crystallization was scarcely in its infancy, in
        clined Linneeus to think that the salts should be regarded as
        the generators of crystallization ; that the union of any given
        call with a given kind of stone was a sort of fecundation
        which communicated to the stone the property of crystal
        lizing under the form peculiar to the salt which performed
        the function of the fecundating principle                f.
                                                           The diamond*
        for instance, he considered as a species of alum, because it
        crystallizes like the latter* and he gave it the name of alumen
        udamas%.      Thus Linnaeus thought he found in the mineral
        kingdom     the  basis of the sexual system*, of which he made
        so advantageous an use in Botany.        We know that Tourne-
        fort, on observing the ramified stalactites of the Grotto of
        Antiparos, imagined that stones vegetated in the same way
        as plants.     Botany was the favourite study of these two ce
        lebrated men, and all Nature, in their opinion, spoke the
        language of their favourite study.
            Linnaeus subjoined to his work some descriptions and
        figures of crystals, which were sufficiently accurate, consi
        dering the state of science at the time; and in this respect he
        may be regarded as the founder of crystallography*
,           Latterly, Rome de l'lsle has referred the study of cry*
        stallization to principles more and more conformable to ob
        servation. He arranged together, as far as possible, crystals
        of the same nature. Among the different forms relative to
        each species, he chose one as the most proper, from its sim
        plicity, to be regarded as the primitive form ; and by sup
        posing it truncated in different ways, he deduced the other'
        forms from       it,
                         and determined    gradation,

        itions between this same form and that of polyhedrons*
        which seemed to be still further removed from it. To the
        descriptions and figures which he gave of the crystalline
        forms, he added the results of the mechanical measurement

            tThe learned author of this classification was well aware that, among the
        bodies which he associated under one and the same species, several presented
        a form different from that which was the type of the species.        But he tried
        to bring them to this last form according to some vague traces of resemblance
        which he caught from their external aspect and as but very small number

of their principal angles,         and showed (what was a very es
sential point) that these angles were constant in each va
riety.     In a word, his crystallography is the production of a
very extensive and highly useful course of study.
    The illustrious Bergman, by endeavouring to penetrate to
the mechanism of the structure of crystals, considered the
different forms relative to one and the same substance as
produced by a superposition of planes, sometimes constant
and sometimes variable, and decreasing around one and the
same primitive form.           He applied this primitive idea to a
small number of crystalline forms, and verified it with re
spect to a variety of calcareous spar* by fractures, which
enabled him to ascertain the position of the nucleus, or of
the primitive form, and the successive order of the lamina;
covering this nucleus.             Bergman, however, stopped here,
and did not trouble himself either with determining the laws
of structure, or applying calculation to it. It was a simple
sketch, drawn en passant, of the most prominent point of
view in mineralogy, but in which we see the hand of the
same master who so successfully filled up the outlines of
chemistry.
     In the researches which T undertook about the same pe
riod on the structure of crystals fi I proposed combining
the form and dimensions of integrant molecules with simple
 and regular laws of arrangement, and submitting these laws
to calculation.        This work produced a mathematical theory,
which I reduced to analytical formulae, representing every
             case, and the application of which to known forms
   eads to valuations of angles constantly agreeing with obser
 fiossible
 vation.       I shall explain the principles of this theory by the
 help of reasoning alone, and of some projections which will
 facilitate their explanation.            Geometricians may acquire a
 more correct and more detailed knowledge of the subject by
 perusing the calculations which are given separately in this
 work.
            THEORY OF THE STRUCTURE OP CRYSTALS.
      Primitive Forms. — The        idea of referring to one of the same
  primitive forms all the forms which may be assumed by a
  mineral substance, of which the rest may be regarded as
  being modifications only, has frequently suggested itself to
  various naturalists who have made crystallography their study.
  It was in consequence of having regarded it in a false point
     • This is what has been called dent dt
                                            eochon, but which I call metastatic.

  Essays on this subject, when they received Bergman's Memoir, which was
 communicated to me as being interesting.                                 -

of view   that Linnaeus was led astray in his methodical dis
tribution of crystals.     Rome de l'lsle, by employing it with
more art and justice, avoided the breaches of natural con
nections which disfigure the system of the Swedish natu
ralist.   But there was something arbitrary in the choice of
the forms which De l'lsle regarded as primitive, by consult
ing only the external aspect of crystals, without regarding
their structure.     Bergman, who had so successfully seized
the nucleus of carbonated        lime, by mechanically dividing
the metastatic crystal, was not equally fortunate with respect
to several other crystals, and in particular with respect to
the dodecahedron variety of the same substance which was
then called tete de clou (nail head).          It would result from
the explanation which he gives of the structure of this cry
stal, that its nucleus should have angles totally different
from those of the true ; and Bergman has even been obliged
to suppose that the planes which he calls fundamental were
truncated in the present case, which presented a new excep
tion to the principle on which his system was founded*.
    The mechanical division of minerals, which is the only
method of ascertaining their true primitive form, proves
that this form is invariable while we operate upon the same
substance, however diversified or dissimilar the forms of the
 crystals belonging to this substance may be.           Two or three
example's will serve to place this truth in its proper light.
    Take a regular hexahedral prism of carbonated lime (PI. I.
 figs. 1 and 2).     If you try to divide it parallel to the edges
which form the contours of the bases, you will find that
 three of these edges taken alternately in the upper part, for
 instance, the edges If, cd, b m, may be referred to this
 division : and in order to succeed in the same way with re
 spect to the inferior base, we must choose, not the edges

surfaces of the bases will always become narrower, while on
the other hand the altitudes of the panes will decrease ; and
at the term at which the bases have disappeared,       the prism
will be changed into a dodecahedron        (fig. 3,) with penta

a single fracture at the place of one of the edges situated
around the base, by which it had adhered to the remains of
the group.     Instead of placing it in my collection, I tried
to divide it in other directions 3 and I succeeded after some

ineffectual attempts in extracting its. rhomboidal nucleus,
 which excited my surprise, mixed with the hope that I
might succeed still further.
    Let us take as a second example — the metastatic crystal
 (fig. 6,) the nucleus of which was found by Bergman. You
may obtain this nucleus speedily       by making a first sec
tion upon the edee"s EO, OF; a second upon the edges
I K, G K ; a thiuf upon G H, E H ; a fourth upon O I, I K ;
a fifth upon GK, GH; lastly, a sixth upon E H, EO;
whence it follows, that the edges of which we are speaking
are confounded with the lateral edges of the primitive form,
as we may judge from a simple inspection of fig. 7» which
represents this primitive form inscribed in the dodecahedron
with scalene triangles.
    There exist many other varieties of carbonated lime, se
veral of which have very compound forms, and all of them
contain a nucleus precisely similar to that under considera
tion.    But if it be singular to see this nucleus issue from
varieties which are removed from it mostly by their configu
ration, we have far less reason to expect it in those which
of themselves have a rhomboidal form with different mea
surements of angles. We are at present acquainted with
five of these rhomboids*, one of which is much more ob
tuse than the nucleus, and the four others have summits al
ways more acute.      This gradation, all the terms of which
are referred to one and the same species of solid, would seem
at first sight to give some colour to the opinion that primi
tive forms are not constant relative to one and the same
mineral.     But I have ascertained that all these rhomboids
concur in exhibiting, by sections made in different direc
tions, a nucleus similar to that whose grand angle is
101° 32'; and thus the paradox which arises from the diver
sity of their angles is cleared up by the double employment
   * Beginning with that which is obtuse, we have the following values for
the plane angle of the summit i

   Mineralogists for a long period have only been acquainted with the first
and tlurd of these rhomboids. We see from Bergman's memoir, which 1 have
already quoted, that he confounded the rhomboid 114° 18' with the pri
mitive, in which the angle of the summits is 101° 32'.  On the other hand,
Rome' de l'lsle considered that of 75° 31' as a second primitive form of cal
careous spars, because he saw no method of referring  it,

of  the rhomboidal form which serves here to disguise itself,
and conceals fixed characters under variable outsides.
   Let us choose for instance, among these different rhom
boids, that in which the angle at the summit is 75° Si' 20",
and which is represented fig. 8, circumscribed to its nucleus.
Rome de l'Isle called it muriatic calcareous spar, and I
denominate it inverse carbonated lime.       In order to divide
this rhomboid mechanically, the secting planes must be di
rected parallel to the six extreme edges ; viz. s t, su, sny
on one hand, and sif, svt, sn', on the other, in such a
way that these planes are equally inclined upon the faces
               ///
which they cut into. The first sections will exhibit six pen
tagons r rr         (fig. 9), parallel to the faces of the nu
cleus ; and it is easy to conceive, that by continuing the di
vision always in the same direction, until the residues of the
faces of the rhomboid A A' (fig. 8) have disappeared,        we
shall have a new rhomboid, which will be the primitive
form.
    We may remark, that the faces of this last rhomboid are
inclined in the same quantity upon the common axis, with
the edges st,su,sn, &c, to which these faces are parallel.
Now the edges in question form with the axis larger angles
than the oblique diagonals drawn from 5 to n', from s to         t'f
from     to v! or, what comes to the same thing, than the
          s    ,
faces stn' u, snl' u, st         vn  ;whence we conclude that
in the rhomboid, extracted by mechanical division, the
angle of the summit should be sensibly more open than that
which corresponds with         in the divided rhomboid.
                               it                           From
what has been said above, this last angle        smaller than the
                                                    is

          a                     For instance,     cube of fluated
                                                    a
lime will give      regular octahedron, which you will succeed
in extracting      by a
                    dividing the cube upon its eight solid angles,
which will in the first place discover eight equilateral tri-
 angles, and       by
                   pursuing the division, always parallel to the
 first sections, until  nothing more remains of the faces of the
 cube, the nucleus of the crystals of sulphated barytes will
be straight prism with rhombous bases that of the crystals

we shall presently speak of, may lead to the determination
of their primitive forms, at least with a great probability of
accuracy.
    Having adopted the word primitive form, in order to de
signate the nucleus of crystals, we shall call secondary forms
Buch varieties as diff.r from the primitive form.
   In certain species, crystallization also produces this last form
immediately.       There exist, for example, calcareous crystals
-which differ in no respect from the rhomboid which we extract
from the regular hexahedral prism, and from the other varie
ties which we have mentioned. Besides, it frequently happens
also, that among the faces of a secondary crystal there are
some which are parallel to those of the primitive form. Thus
we find crystals of carbonated lime, which are similar to
that of fig. 3, and on which crystallization has left pentagonal
planes, suchasAEool, AEAAG, &c, situated like those
which we expose by dividing the hexahedral prism repre
sented in fig. 1. In such cases as these, the route is as it were
traced out before hand, previous to arriving at the nucleus.
    We may define the primitive form a solid of a constant
form, engaged symmetrically in all the crystals of one and the
same species, and the faces of which follow the directions of
the laminae which form these crystals.
    The primitive forms hitherto observed are reduced to six,
 viz. : the parallelopipedon, the octahedron, the tetrahedron,
the regular hexahedral prism, the dodecahedron with rhom-
bous planes, all equal and similar, and the dodecahedron with
triangular planes, composed of two straight pyramids joined
 base to base.
     Forms  of integrant Molecules. — The nucleus of      a  crystal
 is not  the last term of its mechanical division.      It may al
 ways be subdivided parallel to its different faces, and some
 times in other directions also. The whole of the surround
 ing substance is capable of being divided by strokes parallel
 to  those which take place with respect to the primitive form.
 Reasoning here as we have done with respect to the me
 chanical division of common salt, we conclude that the
 limit of the mechanical division which we may operate in
 any given crystal, ought to give the form of the integrant
 -molecule peculiar to the kind of mineral of which this cry
 stal is the primitive.
    If the nucleus be a parallelopipedon which cannot be sub
 divided except by blows parallel to its faces, like that which
 takes place with respect to carbonated lime, it is evident that
 the integrant molecule will be similar to this nucleus itself.
    But it may happen that the parallelopipedon admits of
                                                             furthar

further sections in other directions than the former.         Let us
conceive for example, that it is a rhomboid A A' KH (fig. 10),
directly divisible parallel to the six rhombuses which ter
minate       and with the help of planes, each of which passes
            it,
by  an  oblique diagonal A O,           the axis A' A, and
                                                by             by the
edge  A'  O,   comprehended      between   the  same    diagonal and
the axis. These sections will detach six tetrahedrons, which
have been figured separately around the rhomboid, in posi
tions analogous to those which they had when joined in one
single body,      insuch    way that we follow as
                             a                             were with

which they proceed. Now these tetrahedrons represent the in
tegrant molecules of the substance of which the rhomboid            is
the primitive form.      Such      the structure of the tourmaline.

In this case the molecule will be still different from the nu
cleus, although this last cannot be subdivided except
parallel with its faces,      e. with its two bases and its six
                                 i.
panes.    This subdivision will lead us to triangular prisms,
the assemblage of which composes the entire prism, as may
easily be perceived       inspecting fig. 40, PI. V; we there see
                            by
one of the bases of the prism divided into equilateral trian
gles, each .of* which       the base of
                             is              small triangular prism
                                                     a
which represents the integrant molecule.
   Now we shall presently find that we may reduce the forms
of the integrant molecules of all crystals to the three pre
ceding forms, which are the tetrahedron, or the simplest of
the pyramids      the triangular prism, or the simplest of all
                  :
the prisms; and the parallelopipedon, or the simplest among
the solids, which have their faces parallel two and two.
And since four planes at least are necessary for circum
scribing    aspace,    it  evident that the three forms in ques
                            is

plicity.     these forms,
            If                 repeat, are not those of the true in

                                      Nature, they deserve at least
to supply their place in our conceptions, the more especially
asit   iswith but very scanty materials that we succeed iu
establishing theory which embraces so many various results.
                  a
   Several naturalists have*thought that the integrant mole
cules of crystals were simple laminae, whose thickness was
incomparably less than their other dimensions, and not
small solids, the thickness of which was equal, or at least
in proportion to their breadth and length. In the Journal
des Mines, No. 28, p. 305,            have detailed the numerous
                                      I

and decisive proofs which confirm this last opinion, and                    I
have even demonstrated (hat the dimensions and angles of
these molecules were invariable in all primitive crystals of
one and the same substance.               J shall not stop here again to
obviate      the difficulties which opposed my progress, be
cause I have had the satisfaction of observing that the an
swers suggested themselves as if spontaneously to those who
are in posession of the theory, and because it appears to me
that this theory has been taken up by the only author who
studied it in the same points of view with myself*.
     But every form of the integrant molecule varies in its di
mensions, or in the measurement of its angles, according to
the species to which it belongsf. The parallelopipedon is some
times oblique-angled, and sometimes riaht-angled : some
times it presents the form of the rhomboid, and at other
times that of the cube, which is the most perfect among the
forms of this kind. In some cases the triangular prism is
merely isoscele ; in other cases it is equilateral ; and in this
last case, the relation between its height and the side of its
base varies in both species.               The tetrahedron undergoes
analogous diversities.
    There exist, however, forms of integrant molecules, as
well as primitive forms which are common to several sub
stances of diverse natures. For example, muriated soda and
sulphuretted iron both have the cube as their primitive form.
The regular octahedron is that of the ruby, and at the same
time that of native bismuth.              In this case the elementary
molecules, although different in all respects, are so arranged
 that there results the same external configuration nearly i as
in geometry, we may compose a square in several ways by
assortments of figures which will differ from each other in
the various squares.          Besides, if observation has proved that
mineral substances, distinct in their nature, sometimes ex
hibit secondary crystals of the same form, (for instance,
regular hexahedral prisms with a diversity of structure which
would suppose one in the forms of the molecules themselves)
ought we to be surprised also to find in different species inte
grant molecules, the forms of which, similar externally, are
owing to combinations of principles which cannot have any
 relation with each other ? But it is worthy of attention that
hitherto these forms common to several minerals were al
 ways those which have a remarkable character for simplicity

 reference of dimension*; theory, however, furnishes us with data for de-
 ferinining the latter,

  attains by different routes ; while, with respect to other
  forms quite different from those limits, it has a single di
  rection only which ends in any particular species of mineral.
      Laws to which the Structure is subjected. — After having
  determined the primitive forms, and those of the integrant
  molecules, it remains to inquire for the laws pursued by
  these molecules in their arrangement, in order to produce
  these regular kinds of envelopes, which disguise one and the
  same primitive form in so many different ways.
      Now observation shows that this surrounding matter is
  an assemblage of laminae, which, setting out from the pri
  mitive form, decrease in extent, both on all sides at once,
  and sometimes in certain particular parts only.      This decre
  ment is effected by regular subtractions of one or more
  rows of integrant molecules ; and the theory, in determining
  the number of these rows by means of calculation, succeeds
  in representing all the known results of crystallization, and
  even anticipates future discoveries indicating forms which,
  being still hypothetical only, may one day be presented to
   the inquiries of the naturalist.
      Some very simple examples will serve for giving an idea
  of the laws to which the decrements in question are sub-,
  jected.

            IV. Analytical    Experiments on Phosphorus.
  The      same analogies apply to phosphorus as to
                                                      sulphur, and
   I  have made a similar series of experiments on this inflam
  mable substance.
       Common electrical sparks, passed through
                                                       phosphorus,
   did not evolve from it any permanent gas ; but when it
   was acted upon by the Voltaic electricity of the battery of
   five hundred plates in the same manner as sulphur, gas was
v  produced in considerable quantities, and the phosphorus be

came or a deep red brown colour, like phosphorus that has
been inflamed and extinguished under water.                   The tras ex
amined proved to be phosphuretted hydrogen, and in one
experiment, continued for some hours, a quantity estimated
to be nearly equal to four times the volume of the phospho
rus employed was given off. The light of the Voltaic spark
in the phosphorus was at first a brilliant yellow, but as the
colour of the phosphorus changed, it appeared orange.
    I  heated three        grains of potassium in sixteen cubical
inches of phosphuretted hydrogen ; as soon as it was fused,
the retort became filled with white fumes, and a reddish
substance precipitated upon the sides and upper part of it.
The heat was applied for some minutes. No inflammation
took place*.          When the retort was cool, the absorption was
found to be less than a cubical inch. The potassium ex
ternally was of a deep brown colour, internally it was of
a dull lead colour.          The residual gas had lost its property of
spontaneous inflammation, but seemed still to contain a
small quantity of phosphorus in solution.
    The phosphuret acted upon over mercury by solution of
muriatic acid evolved only one cubical inch and three quar
ters of phosphuretted hydrogen.
    From this experiment, there is great reason to suppose
that phosphuretted hydrogen contains a minute proportion of
oxygen, and consequently that phosphorus likewise may
contain it ; but the action of potassium on phosphorus itself
furnishes perhaps more direct evidences of the circumstance.
    One grain of potassium and one grain of phosphorus were
fused together in a proper apparatus. They combined with
the production of the most yivid light and intense ignition.
During the process one-tenth of a cubical inch of phosphu
retted hydrogen was evolved.              The phosphuret formed, ex
posed to the action of diluted muriatic acid over mercury,
produced exactly three-tenths of a cubical inch of phosphu
retted hydrogen.
    In a second experiment, one grain of potassium was fused
with three grains of phosphorus ; in this case nearly a quar
ter of a cubical inch of phosphuretted hydrogen was gene
rated during the ignition.           But from the compound exposed
to muriatic acid, only one-tenth of a cubical inch could be
procured.                                               ^
    Now it is not easy to refer the deficiency of phosphuretted
   • It is stated, in the account before referred to of MM. Gay Lussac's and
Thenard's experiments, that potassium inflames in phosphuretted hydrogen.
My experiments upon this gas have been often repeated.      I have never per
ceived any luminous appearance ; but I have always operated in daylight.
                                                                 hydrogen

  matter.
      The phosphoric acid, formed by the combustion of phos

 The hydrogen evolved from phosphorus by electricity proves
 indeed that this must be the case ; and though the quantity
 of hydrogen and oxygen in phosphorus may be exceedingly
 small, yet they may be sufficient to give it peculiar cha
 racters ; and till the basis is obtained free, we shall have no
 knowledge of the properties of the pure phosphoric element,
 V. On     the States  of the  carbonaceous Principle inPlumbagOi
                     Charcoal,   and the Diamond.
     The  accurate   researches of Messrs. Allen and Pepys have
 distinctly proved, that plumbago, charcoal, and the diamond,
 produce very nearly the same quantities of carbonic acid,
 and absorb very nearly the same quantities of oxygen in
 combustion.
     Hence it is evident, that they must consist principally of
 the same kind of elementary matter; but minute researches
upon their chemical relations, when examined by new ana
 lytical methods, will, 1 am inclined to believe, show that the
 great difference in their physical properties does not merely
 depend upon the differences of the mechanical arrangement
of their parts, but likewise upon differences in their intimate
chemical nature.
     I endeavoured to discover, whether any clastic matter
could be obtained from plumbago very intensely ignited by
the Voltaic battery in a Torricellian' vacuum : but though
the highest power of the battery of five hundred was em
ployed, and though the heat was such, as in another expe
riment instantly melted platina wire of ^th of an inch in
diameter, yet no appearance of change took place upon the
plumbago.        Its characters remained wholly unaltered, and
no permanent elastic fluid was formed.
     I heated one grain of plumbago, with twice its weight of
potassium, in a plate glass tube connected with a proper ap
paratus, and I heated an equal quantity of potassium alone
in a tube of the same kind, for an equal length of time,
namely, eight minutes.          Both tubes were filled with hydro
gen : ho gas was evolved in either case. There was no igni

tion in the tube containing the plumbago, but             seemed    it
gradually to combine with the potassium.         The two results
were exposed to the action of water the result from the
                                                     ;
plumbago acted upon that fluid with as much energy as
the other result, and       the two volumes of elastic fluids
were 1*8 cubical inches and 1"Q cubical inches; and both
gave the same diminution                by
                                     detonation with oxygen, as
pure hydrogen.       Two  grains  of  potassium,              by
                                                     acting upon
water, would have produced two cubical inches and one-
eighth of hydrogen gas         ;the deficiency in the result, in
which potassium alone was used, must be ascribed to the
loss of   a small quantity of metal, which must have been
carried off in solution in the hydrogen, and perhaps, like
wise, to the action of the minute quantity of metallic oxides
in the plate glass. The difference in the quantity of hydro
gen given off in the two results,         however too slight to
                                                is
 ascribe  itto the existence of oxygen in the plumbago.
 I    repeated this experiment several times with like results,
 and in two or three instances examined the compound form
 ed.  It  was infusible at    red heat, had the lu3tre of plum
                               a
 bago.    It  inflamed spontaneously, when exposed to air,
 generated potash, and left        black powdery residuum.
                                       a                        It
 effervesced most violently in water, and produced            gas,        a
 which burnt like pure hydrogen.
    When small pieces of charcoal from the willow, that had
 been intensely ignited, were acted upon          Voltaic electri
                                                         by
 cityin   a Torricellian vacuum, every precaution being taken
 to exclude moisture from the mercury and the charcoal, the
 results were very different from those occurring in the case
of plumbago.
    When plumbago was used, after the first spark, which
 generally passed through        distance of about one-eighth of
                                   a
 an inch, there    was  no continuation of light, without         con     a
tact or an approach to the same distance; but from the
 charcoal     flame seemed to issue of
              a                                most brilliant purple,
                                                     a
 and formed, as        itwere,     conducting chain of light of
                                     a
 nearly  an  inch  in length,  at the   same time that elastic mat
 ter  was   rapidly formed,     some    of which was permanent.
 After many unsuccessful trials,             at length succeeded in
                                               I
 collecting   the quantity  of  elastic  fluid  given out        half    by         a
 grain  of  charcoal   ;the process    had   been   continued   nearly
 half an hour. The quantity of gas amounted to nearly an
 eighth of     acubical inch;     was inflammable
                                   it                          by
                                                           the electriG
 spark  with   oxygen gas,    and  four    measures   of      absorbed
                                                                   it
 three measures of oxygen, and produced one measure and                             a
 half of carbonic acid. The charcoal in this experiment had
                                                               become

  1 1$              On some new analytical Researches
   become harder at the point, and its lustre, where it had been
  heated to whiteness, approached to that of plumbago.
      I heated two graius of potassium together with two grain*
  of charcoal, for five minutes ; and to estimate the effects of
  the metallic oxides and potash in the green glass tube,                      I
  made a comparative experiment, as in the case of plumbago;
  but there was no proof of any oxygen being furnished to the
  potassium from the charcoal in the process^ for the com
  pound acted upon water with great energy, and produced a
  quantity of inflammable gas, only inferior by one- twelfth to
  that produced by the potassium, which had n6t been com
  bined with charcoal, and which gave the same diminution
  by detonation with oxygen ; and the slight difference may
  be well ascribed to the influence of foreign matters in the
 charcoal.      There was no ignition in the process, and no
 gas    was evolved.
     The compound produced in other experiments of this kind
  was examined. It is a conductor of electricity, is of a dense
 black, inflames spontaneously, and burns with a deep red
 light in the atmosphere*.
     The non-uonducting nature of the diamond, and its infusi-
 bility, rendered it impossible to act upon it by Voltaic elec
 tricity ; and the only new agents which seemed to offer any
 means of decomposing           were the metals of trie alkalies.

 parative trial with two grains of potassium heated in        simia

 by   its action upon water, one cubical inch and -^ths of in
 flammable air, and that which had been exposed to heat
 alone, all other circumstances being similar, evolved nearly
 one cubical inch and ^ths, both of which were pure hy
 drogen.
   • In the Bakerian Lecture for 807, have mentioned the
                                 1        I                  decomposition
of carbonic acid by potassium, which takes place with inflammation.   Ifthe

      In another experiment of a similar kind, in which frag
  ments of diamonds were used in the quantity of four grains,
  the potassium became extremely black from its action upon
  them during an exposure to heat for three hours, and the
  diamonds were covered with a grayish crust, and when acted
  upon by water and dried, were found to have lost about
  •iVg-ths of a gram in weight. The matter separated by wash
 ing, and examined, appeared as a fine powder of a dense
 black colour.       When a surface of platina wire was covered
 With   it, and made to touch another wire in the Voltaic cir
 cuit,  a  brilliant spark with combustion occurred.            burnt,
                                                                     It

                                                its combustion.
     These general results seem to show, that in plumbago the
 carbonaceous element exists merely in combination with iron,
 and   in   form which may be regarded as approaching to that
            a

     The experiments on the diamond render extremely likely

examined independently of hygrometrical tests, will not
differ perceptibly.

or the difference between the amalgam of ammonium, and
mercury,        inwhich the quantity of new matter          not more

oxides, some of which contain less than tVth of oxygen,
will not be disposed to question the principle, that minute
differences in chemical composition may produpe great diffe

VI.    Experiments on the Decomposition and Composition                    of
                       the Boracic Acid.
  In   the last Bakerian Lecture,          I   have   given an account of
Vol. 34.jNo.         136. August   ieoy.                H              «u

1   14          On some new analytical Researches
an experiment in which boracic acid appeared to be decom
posed by Voltaic electricity, a dark-coloured inflammable
substance separating from it on the negative surface.
   In the course of the spring and summer,       made many            I
attempts to collect quantities of this substance for minute
examination.         When boracic acid, moistened with water,
Was exposed   between two surfaces of platina, acted on by
the full power of the battery of five hundred, an olive-brown
matter immediately began to form on the negative surface,
which gradually increased in thickness, and at last appeared
almost black.    It was permanent in water, but soluble with
effervescence in warm nitrous acid. When heated to redness
upon the platina it burnt slowly, and gave off white fumes,
which slightly reddened moistened litmus paper, and it left
a black mass, which, when examined by the magnifier, ap
                        '
peared vitreous at the surface, and evidently contained a
fixed acid.
    These circumstances seemed distinctly to show the de
composition and recomposition of the boracic acid ; but as
the peculiar combustible substance was a non-conductor of
electricity, I was never able to obtain                 it,
                                                   except in very thin
films upon the platina.           was not possible to examine its
                                     It
properties minutely, or to determine its precise nature, or
whether   it  was the pure boracic basis;            consequently en
                                                          I
deavoured to apply other methods of decomposition, and to
find other more unequivocal evidences upon this important
chemical subject.
    I have already laid before the Society an account of an
experiment*, in which boracic acid, heated                  contact with
                                                                   in
 potassium in    a gold tube, was converted into borate of pot
 ash, at the same time that          dark-coloured matter, similar
                                          a
to that produced from the acid                  by
                                             electricity, was formed.
 About    two  months   after   this  experiment had been made,
 namely,    in  the  beginning     of  August, at       lime that
                                                               a     was          I
 repeating   the  process,  and   examining minutely the results,
I   was informed,       by  letter from Mr. Cadell at Paris, that
                             a
 M. Thenard was employed              the decomposition of the bo
                                          in
 racic acid    by  potassium,    and    that he had heated the two
 substances together in       copper tube, and had obtained bo
                                 a
 rate of potash, and       peculiar matter concerning the nature
                             a
 of which no details were given in the communication.
    That the same results must be obtained                      by
                                                          the same me
 thods of operating, there could be no doubt. The evidences
 for the decomposition of the boracic acid are easily gained,

 circumstances.
     1 found that when equal weights of potassium and boracic
 acid were heated together in a green glass tune, which had
 been exhausted after having been twice filled with hydrogen,
 there was a most intense ignition before the temperature was
 nearlv raised to the red heat; the potassium entered into
 vivid inflammation, where it was in contact with the boracic
 acid. When this acid had been heated to whiteness, before
 it was introduced into the tube, and powdtred and made
 use of whilst yet warm, the quantity of gas given out in the
 operation did not exceed twice the volume of the acid, and
 was hydrogen.
     I could only use twelve or fourteen grains of each of the
 two substances in this mode of conducting the experiment ;
 for when larger quantities were employed, the glass tube
 always ran into fusion, from the intensity of the heat pro
duced during the action.
     When the film of naphtha had not been carefully removed
 from the potassium, the mass appeared black throughout ;
 but when this had been the case, the colour was of a dark
olive-brown.
   In    several experiments, in which I used equal parts of
the    acid and metal, [- found that there was always a great
quantity of the former in the residuum; and by various trials,
I ascertained that twenty grains of potassium had their in
flammability entirely destroyed by about eight grains of bo
racic acid.
    For collecting considerable portions of the matters formed
in the process, I used metallic tubes furnished with stop
cocks, and exhausted after being filled with hydrogen.
   When tubes of brass or copper were employed, the heat
was only raised to a dull red ; but when iron tubes were
used, it was pushed to w hiteness. In all cases the acid was
decomposed, and the products were scarcely different.
    When the result was taken out of a tube of brass or cop
per, it appeared as an olive-coloured glass, having opaque,
dull olive-brown specks diffused through it.
    It gave a very slight effervescence with water, and par-
tiallv dissolved in hot water, a dark olive-coloured powder
separating from it.
   The results from the iron tube, which had been much
more strongly heated, were dark olive in some parts, and
almost black in others. They did not effervesce with warm
water, but were rapidly acted upon by    it, and the particles
                            H   2                    separated

separated by washing were of a shade          of olive,       so dark as
to appear almost black on white paper.
    The solutions obtained, when passed through a filter, had
a  faint olive tint, and contained sub-borate of potash, and
potash.      In cases when, instead of water, a weak solution
of muriatic acid was used for separating the saline matter
from the inflammable matter, the fluid came through the
filter colourless.
    In describing the properties of the new inflammable sub
stance separated by washing, I shall speak of that collected
from operations conducted in tubes of brass, in the manner
that has been just mentioned ; for 'it is in this way that I
have collected the largest quantities.
    It appears as a pulverulent mass of the darkest shades of
o]ive. It is perfectly opaque. It is very friable, and its
powder does not scratch glass.            It is a non-conductor of
electricity.
    When it has been dried only at 100 or 120°, it gives off*
moisture by increase of temperature, and if heated in the
atmosphere, takes fire at a temperature          below the boiling
point    of olive  oil, and   burns  with a  red light and scintilla
tions like charcoal.
    If it be excluded from air and heated to whiteness in a tube
of platina, exhausted after having been filled with hydrogen,
it is found very little altered after the process.      Its colour is
a little darker, and it is rather denser ; but no indications are
given of any part of it having undeTgone fusion, volatiliza
tion, or decomposition.          Before the process its specific gra
 vity is such that it docs not sink in sulphuric acid; but after,
 it rapidly falls to the bottom in this fluid.
    The phenomena of its combustion arc best witnessed in
 a retort filled with oxygen gas.       When the bottom of the
 retort is gently heated by a spirit lamp, it throws off most
 vivid scintillations like those from the combustion of the
 bark of charcoal, and the mass burns with a brilliant light.
 A sublimate rises from     it,   which
                                      is   boracic acid   ;and     be

 comes coated with      a  vitreous substance, which proves like
 wise to be boracic acid    ;   and after this has been washed off*,
 the residuum appears perfectly black, and requires            higher

     In oxymuriatic acid gas, the peculiar inflammable sub
 stance occasions some beautiful phaenomena.              When this
 gas   is brought in contact with    it   at common temperatures,
                                                                        it

  a  white substance coats the interior of the vessel in which
  the experiment is made, and the peculiar substance is found
  covered by a white film, which, by washing, affords boracic
  acid, and leaves a black matter, which is not spontaneously
  inflammable in a fresh portion of the gas; but which in
 flames in it by a gejntle heat, and produces boracic acid.
     The peculiar inflammable substance, when heated nearly
 to redness in hydrogen, or nitrogen, did not seem to dis
 solve in these gases, -or to act upon them ; it merely gained
 a darker shade of colour, and a little moisture rose from                              it,
 which condensed in the neck of the retort in which the ex
 periment was made.

the same    as that procured from it by electricity ; and the two
series of facts seem fully to establish the decomposition
 and recomposition of the acid.
    From the large quantily of potassium required to decom
pose a small quantity of the acid, it is evident that the
boracic acid must contain a considerable proportion ot oxy
 gen. 1 have endeavoured to determine the relative weights
of the peculiar inflammable matter and oxygen, which com
pose a given weight of boracic acid ; and to this end I made
several analytical and synthetical experiments ; I shall giv?
the results   of the two which    1 consider most accurate.
    Twenty grains of boracic     acid and thirty grains of potas
sium were made to act upon each other by heat in a tube
of brass ; the. result did not effervesce when washed with di
luted muriatic acid ; and there were obtained after the pro
 cess, by slight lixiviation in warm water, two grains and
about -rVths of the olive-coloured matter. Now thirty grains
of potassium would require about five grains of oxygen, to
form thirty-five of potash ; and according to this estima
tion, boracic acid must consist of about one of the peculiar
inflammable substance, to nearly two of oxygen.
    A grain of the inflammable substance in very fine powder,
and diffused over a large surface, was set fire to in a retort,
containing twelve cubical inches of oxvgcn ; three cubical
inches of gas were absorbed, and the black residuum col
lected after the boracic acid had been dissolved, was found
to equal five-eighths of a grain. This, by a second combus
tion, was almost entirely converted into boracic acid, with
the absorption of two cubical inches and one eighth more of
oxygen.      The thermometer in this experiment was at 58°
Fahrenheit, and the barometer at 30-2.
    According to this result, boracic acid would consist of
one of the inflammable matter, to about 1*8 of oxygen ;
and the dark residual substance, supposing it to be simply
the inflammable matter combined with less oxygen than is
sufficient to constitute boracic acid, would be an oxide,
consisting of about 4 7 of inflammable matter, to 1*55 of
oxygen.
    These estimations I do not however venture to give as
entirely correct.     In the analytical experiments, there are
probably   sources   of error, from the solution of a part of the
inflammable matter, and it possibly may retain alkali,. which
cannot be separated by the acid. In the synthetical process,
in which washing is employed, and so small a quantity of
matter used, the •lesults are still less to be depended upon ;
 they must be considered only as imperfect approximations.

   From   the general   tenour of the facts, it appears that the
combustible matter obtained from boracic acid bears the
same relation to that substance, as sulphur and phosphorus
do to the sulphuric and phosphoric acids.              But is it an ele
mentary inflammable body, the pure basis of the acid ? or is
it not like sulphur and phosphorus, compounded ?
    Without entering into any discussion concerning ultimate
elementary matter, there are many circumstances which fa
vour the idea, that the dark olive substance is not a simple
body ; its being non-conducting,            its change of colour by
being heated in hydrogen gas, and its power of combining
with the alkalies ; for* these properties in general belong to
primary compounds, that are known to contain oxygen.
    I heated the olive-coloured substance with potassium, there
was a combination, but without any luminous appearance,
and a gray metallic mass was formed ; but from the effect of
this upon water, I could not affirm that any oxygen had
been added to the metal, the gas given off had a peculiar
smell, and took up more oxygen by detonation than pure
hydrogen, from which it seems probable, that it held some
 of the combustible matter in solution.                 s
    It occurred to me, that if the pure inflammable basis
 were capable of being deoxygenated            by potassium, it would
probably possess        a stronger affinity  for  oxygen than hydro
 gen,    and   therefore  be  again brought    to  its former state by
 water*.     I made another experiment on the operation of po
 tassium, on the olive-coloured substance, and exposed the
 mixture to a small quantity of ether, hoping that this might
contain only water enough to oxygenate the potassium ; but
 the same result occurred as in the last case ; and a combina
 tion of potash and the olive-coloured substance was pro
 duced, insoluble in ether.
     I covered a small globule of potassium, with four or five
 times its weight of the olive- coloured matter, in a platina
 tube exhausted, after being filled with hydrogen; and heated
 the mixture to whiteness: no gas was evolved. When the
 tube was cooled, naphtha was poured into            it,  and the result
 examined under naphtha.             Its colour was of dense black.

 rated appeared dark olive, and the water became slightly
 alkaline.       Another portion examined, after being exposed
 to air for  a   few minutes, had lost its conducting power, was
 brown on the surface, and no longer produced an efferves
 cence  in    water.
                                 H  4                              Some

120               On some new analytical          Researches
     Some of the olive inflammable matter, with a little potas
sium, was heated to whiteness, covered with iron filings, a
dark metalline mass was formed, which conducted electri
city, and which produced a very slight effervescence in water,
and gave by solution in nitric acid, oxide of iron and bo-
racic acid.
    The 3ubstance which enters into alloy with potassium,
and with iron, I am inclined to consider as the true basis
of the boracic acid.
    In the olive-coloured matter, this basis Seems to exist in
union with a liitle oxygen ; and when the olive-coloured
substance is dried at common temperatures, it likewise con
tains water.
    In the black non-conducting matter, produced in the
combustion of the olive-coloured substance, the basis is evi
dently combined with much more oxygen, and in its full
state of oxygenation it constitutes boracic acid.
    From the colour of the oxides, their solubility in alkalies,
and from their general powers of combination, and from the
conducting nature and lustre of the matter produced by the
action of a small quantity of potassium upon the olive-co
loured substance, and from all analogy ; there is strong rea
son to consider the boraci'. basis as metallic in its nature, and
I venture to propose for it the name of boracium,
       VII.    Analytical Inquiries        respecting    Fluoric Acid.
    I have already laid before the Society the account of my
first experiments ou the action of potassium on fluoric acid
gas*.
     i stated, that the metal burns when heat^l in this elastic
fluid, and that there is a great absorption of the gas.
     Since the time that this communication was made, I have
parried on various processes, with the view of ascertaining,
accurately, the products of combustion, and I shall now de
 scribe their results.
     When fluoric acid gas, that has been procured in contact
 with glass, is introduced into a plate glass retort, exhausted
 after being filled with hydrogen gas, white fumes are imme
diately perceived.         The ruetal loses its splendour, and be-»
pomes covered with a grayish crust.
     When the bottom of the retort is gently heated, the fumes

 of potassium in fluoric acid I have since seen mentioned in the number of the
 Moniteur already so often quoted, as observed by MM. Gay Lussac and
 Thenard ; but no notice is taken of the results,
                                                                     become

  become more copious ; they continue for some time to be
  eawtted, but at last cease altogether.
      If the gas is examined at this time, its volume is found
  to be a little increaeed, by the addition of a email quantity
  of hydrogen.
      No new fumes are produced by a second application of a
  low heat; but when the temperature is raised nearly to the
  point of sublimation of potassium, the metal rises through,
  the crust, becomes first of a copper colour and then of a
  blueish black, and soon after inflames and burns with a most
  brilliant red light.
      After this combustioti. either the whole or a part of the
  fluoric acid, according as the quantity of potassium is great
  or small, is found to be desiroyed or absorbed.       A mass of
  a chocolate colour remains in the bottom of the retort ; and
  a sublimate, in some parts chocolate, and in others yellow,
  is found round the sides, and at the top of the retort.
      When the residual gas afforded by this operation is washed
  with water, and exposed to the action of an electrical spark
  mixed with oxygen gas, it detonates, and affords a diminu
  tion such as might be expected from hydrogen gas.
      The proportional quantity of this elastic fluid differs a
  little in different operations.   When the fluoric acid has not
  been artificially dried* it amounts to one-sixth or one-seventh
  of the volume of the acid gas used; but when the fluoric
  acid has been long exposed to calcined sulphate of soda, it
  seldom amounts to one-tenth.
      I have endeavoured to collect large quantities of the cho
  colate-coloured substance for minute examination ; but some
   difficulties occurred.
      When I used from eighteen to twenty grains of potassium,
  in a retort containing from twenty to thirty cubical inches of
  fluoric acid gas, the intensity of the heat was such, as to
   fuse the bottom of the retort, and destroy the results.
       In a very thick plate glass retort, containing about nine
   teen cubical inches of gas, I once succeeded in making a
   decisive experiment on ten grains and a half of potassium,
   and I found that about fourteen cubical inches of fluoric acid
   disappeared,    and about two and a quarter of hydrogen gas
•
   were evolved. The barometer stood at 30-3, and the ther
   mometer at 61° Fahrenheit ; the gas had not been artificially
   dried.     In this experiment there was very little sublimate;
   but the whole of the bottom of the retort was covered with
   a brown crust, and near the point of contact with the bot
   tom the substance was darker coloured, and approaching
   jn its tint to black.
                                                            When

1 2S           On some new analytical Researches
    When the product was examined by a magnifier, it evi
dently appeared consisting of different kinds of matter ; a
blackish substance, a white, apparently saline substance,
and a substance having different shades of brown and fawn
colour.
    The mass did not conduct electricity, and none of its
parts could be separated, so as to be examined as to this
property.
    When a portion of it was thrown into water, it effervesced
violently, and the gas evolved had some resemblance in smell
to phosphuretted hydrogen, and was inflammable.
    When a part of the mass was heated in contact with air,
it burnt slowly, lost its brown colour, and became a white
saline mass.
    When heated in oxygen gas, in a retort of plate glass, it
absorbed a portion of oxygen, but burnt with difficulty, and
required to be heated nearly to redness ; and the light given
out was similar to that produced by the combustion of liver
 of sulphur.
    The water which had acted upon a portion of it was exa
mined; a number of chocolate- coloured particles floated in
it. When the solid matter was separated by the filter, the
fluid was found to contain fluate of potash, and potash. The
 solid residuum was heated in a small glass retort in oxygen
 gas ; it burnt before it had attained a red heat, and became
 white.    In this process, oxygen was absorbed, and acid
 matter produced. The remainder possessed the properties of
 the substance formed from fluoric acid gas holding siliceous
 earth in solution, by the action of water.
    In experiments made upon the combustion of quantities
 of potassium equal to from six to eleven grains, the portion
 of matter separable from the water has amounted to a very
 small part of a grain only, and operating upon so minute a
 scale, I have not been able to gain fully decided evidence,
 that the inflammable part of it is the pure basis of the fluoric
 acid ; but with respect to the decomposition of this body by
 potassium, and the existence of its basis at least combined
 with a smaller proportion of oxygen in the solid product ge
 nerated, and the regeneration of the acid by the ignition of
 this product in oxygen gas, it is scarcely possible to enter
 tain a doubt.
     The decomposition of the fluoric acid by potassium,
  seems analogous to that of the acids of sulphur and phos
 phorus. In neither of these cases are the pure bases, or even
  the bases in their common form evolved ; but new com
 pounds result, and in one case sulphurets, and sulphites, and
                                                                in

in the other phosphurets,        and phosphites of potash, are
generated.
    As silex was always obtained during the combustion of the
chocolate- coloured substance obtained by iixiviation, it oc
curred to me that this matter mighi be a result of the ope
ration, and that the chocolate substance might be a com
pound of the siliceous and fluoric bases in a low state of oxy
genation, with potash ; and this idea is favoured by some          i
trials that I made to separate silex from the mass, by boiling
it in concentrated fluoric acid ; the substance did not seem
to be much altered by this process, and still gave silex by
combustion,
    I endeavoured to decompose fluoric acid gas in a perfectly
dry state, and which contained no siliceous earth ; and for
this purpose 1 made a mixture of one hundred grains of dry
boracic acid, and two hundred grains of fluor spar, and
placed them in the bottom of an iron tube, having a stop
cock and a tube of safety attached to it.
    The tube was insetted horizontally in a forge, and twenty
grains of potassium, in a proper iron tray, introduced into
that part of it where the heat was only suffered to rise to dull
redness. The bottom of the tube was heated to whiteness,
and the acid acted upon by the heated potassium, as it was
generated.     After the process was finished, the result in the
tray   was  examined.
    It was in some parts black, and in others of a dark brown.
It did not effervesce with water; and, when lixiviated, afforded
a dark brown combustible mass, which did not conduct
electricity, and which, when burnt in oxygen gas, afforded
boracic and fluoric acid.     It dissolved with violent efferves
cence in nitric acid; but did not inflame spontaneously in
oxymuriatic acid gas.
    I have not as yet examined any of the other properties of
 this substance ; but I am inclined to consider it as a com
 pound of the olive-coloured oxide of boracium, and an oxide
pf the fluoric basis.
    In examining the dry fluoric acid gas, procured in a pro
cess similar to that which has been just described, it gave
very evident marks of the presence of boracic acid.
    As the chocolate-coloured substance is permanent in wa
ter, it occurred to me that it might possibly be producible
 from concentrated liquid fluoric acid at the negative surface
 in the Voltaic circuit.
    I made the experiment with platina surfaces, from a bat
tery of two hundred and fifty plates of six inches, on fluoric
acid the densest that could be obtained by the distillation of
                                                             fluor

  1 24         Suggestion for establishing a Telegraphic
 fluor spar and concentrated sulphuric acid of commerce, irt
 vessels of lead.       Oxygen and hydrogen were evolved, and a
 dark brown matter separated at the deoxidating surface ; but
 the result of an operation conducted for many hours, merely
 enabled me to ascertain that it was combustible, and pro
 duced acid matter in combustion ; but I cannot venture to
 draw the conclusion that this ncid was fluoric acid, as it was
 not impossible that some sulphureous, or sulphuric acid
 might likewise exist in the solution.
     I heated the olive-coloured inflammable substance, ob
 tained from the boracic acid, in common fluoric acid gas in
 a plate glass retort ; the temperature was raised till the glass
began to fuse ; but no change, indicating a decomposition,
 took place.
     I heated six grains of potassium with four grains of pow
dered fluor spar in a green glass tube filled with hydrogen;
there was a slight ignition, a minute quantity of hydrogen
gas was evolved, and a dark gray mass was produced, which
acted upon water with much effervescence,             but left no solid
inflammable residuum,

XVI.      Suggestion    for   establishing a Telegraphic Intercourse
    between London        and Dublin.        By the Rev. Mr. James
    Hall.
                             To  Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,     As    it is the duty of every good subject to contribute
what     he can    to the service of his country, I have ventured
to    trouble    you with the following hints on the subject of
telegraphs.
    Previous      to my    setting out for Ireland,       (through  the
greater part of which I travelled lately,) I began to study the
physical geography of that country.              On turning my atten
tion to this matter, and conversing with Dr. Thomson of
Kensington Gravel Pits, and others, on the subject, the
Doctor drew my attention to the circumstance, that the old
maps of Ireland, particularly those of the fifteenth century,
and about the time of the Spanish armada, laid down the
northern parts of that kingdom much nearer the Mull of
Cantire, in Scotland, than the modern maps in general do.
The question then was, Whether the maps of Ireland of the
fifteenth, or those of the present century, are the more cor
rect?      On arriving at Torr Point, Fair Head, the nearest
point     of Ireland    to' Scotland,    I  hired a boat and sailed to
                                                               Cantire,

             Intercourse between London and Dublin.               1 25
Cantire.     But,  instead of finding the distance from 20 to
30 miles,    aslaid down in some of our modern maps, I found
ifonly eleven miles and a half.
    Having ascertained this fact, it occurred to me, that,
although no telegraphic communication can take place be
tween Dublin and Holyhead, in Wales, which is 63 miles ;
nor between Drogheda in Ireland, and Port Patrick in
Scotland, which is 25 miles; yet that information might be
easily communicated from Fair Head land, to the Mull of
Cantire, by a telegraph. One thing is certain, that it is
nearly as far between the points of communication, by tele
graph, at Putney, and the one next to       it,on the line from
London to Portsmouth, as between Torr Point, Fair Head,
Ireland, and the nearest point of land in Scotland      ;and that
at one place, on the same line of communication,               the
nearest communicating points,          by
                                       the telegraph, are nearly
thirteen miles distant.
     In erecting telegraph southward from Dublin to Cork,
                   a
 and northward to Fair Head, there seems no difficulty at
 all. At Fair Head, and the opposite point in Scotland,
 signals to draw attention might be addressed both to the eye
 and the ear; those to the ear being calculated to rouse at
 tention, and induce people to look out and apply to their
 glasses.    From Cantire, through the Isles of Arran, Bute,
 and other places, information might be sent           by
                                                       Glasgow,
 Edinburgh, &c. &c, direct to London, and back again to
 Dublin, Cork, &c. &c, in the course of few minutes.
                                                  a
     Speedy information to and from our fleets in the harbour
 of Cork, &c, in Ireland, as well as to and from those at
 Portsmouth, Plymouth, &c. &c, in England,              is
                                                         certainly
 an object of great importance    ; and, in my humble opinion,
 the only way to have little or no use for soldiers, sailors,
 ships of war, batteries, cannons, telegraphs, &c,        to have
                                                            is
 plenty   of them   in readiness.
                          I    remain, sir, yours truly,

                                                                 1809,

  126                       On Miner atogi/.
  1809, Dr. Mitchill commenced his academical duties as
 one of the professors of the new Institution at New York.
 Although he arranged the sub;ect allotted to him under the
 beads of geology, pholologij, pyrology, hydrology, aerology,
 mineralogy, botany, zoology, and uranology, it is not the
 intention of the writer of the present sketch to do any thing
 more than trace an outline of his mineralogy, and state the
new views the professor has taken of this department of
 science.
    He defined mineralogy to be the classification and detailed
history of the materials which constitute the solid body of the
earth. He explained the fourfold arrangement formerly made
by Bergman, and followed by Cronstedt, Werner, Kirwan, and
Jameson, distributing these great masses of material into four
classes,  i . Earths,    2. Metals,   3. Salts, and4.lNFLAM-
MA3LES. Herein the method differed from the one given in
bis Geology, which, pursuant to the plan of Werner, had
divided these same natural bodies into five sections: 1. ihv pri
maeval, 2. / amition, 3. ternary, 4. alluvial, and 5. volcanic
rocks, stones, and earths. He then gave the history of lime,
clay, baryteS; flint, magnesia, strontian, elucidated by speci
mens ; with notices of the minor earths. Next followed the
account of plaiina, gold, silver, mercury, copper, lead, iron,
zinc, and the inferior metals ; the history of potass, soda, and
ammoniac; their production, preparation, and manufacture,
with their chemical and oeconomical uses. Salts distributed
into orders, as 1. alkaline; 2. acid; 3. neutral ; 4. middle;
and 5. metallic.      Inflammable bodies considered : sulphur,
coal, bitumen, amber, petroleum, naphtha, pyrites, and
the other analogous articles.
    On reviewing this whole class of bodies, professor Mit
chill declared himself dissatisfied with the arrangement of
Bergman and his followers. He therefore, with much hesi
tation and diffidence, proposed another disposition of things
terrestrial thus :
    I. — Bodies possessing a strong attraction for phlogiston
(or hydrogen) and oxygen;
   These are, l . The alkaline metals, potass, soda, and am
moniac.       2. The "ascertained" earthy metals, magnesia,
barytes,   strontian,   and lime ; and the " probable" earthy
metals, flint, clay, zircone, and glucine. 3. The calciform
metals, platina, gold, silver, copper, iron, mercury, lead,
tin, cobalt, zinc, nickel, chrome, titanium, columbium,
molybdaena, arsenic, manganese, wolfram, uranium, tellu
rium, and the other articles of this form, whatever they
                                                           were.

                        On Mineralogy.
were. 4. Gaseous metal, azote. These, which constitute
the principal part of terrestrial beings, Dr. Mitchill con
sidered under four memorable points of view.          First, in.
connection with sulphur, forming ores ; secondly, with oxy
gen, making oxides and acids; thirdly, with phlogiston, or
hydrogen, constituting what are properly denominated me
tals ; and fourthly, combinations with each other, com
posing glass, porcelain, earthenware, the other prodigious
mass of alloys and amalgams, or metallic mixtures.
    II. — Bodies abounding in inflammable and phlogistic
matter.
    Under this section are placed as well the sulphuric, phos
 phoric, and carbonic, as the hydrogenous compounds. Ac
 cordingly sulphur, inflammable air, coal of many kinds, all
 the metals in their reduced, malleable, and ductile states,
 phosphoric and bituminous materials of every denomination,
 and generally those substances that burn with flame, belong
to this section.
    III. — Bodies abounding in oxygen.
    The substances remarkable for affording oxygen are the
 phosoxygen of the atmosphere, acids of every sort, espe
 cially those which readily undergo decomposition, water,
 and all the metals in oxided and acid state.
    He said, by way of explanation, that the modern cele
 brated experiment for decompounding potash by means of
 iron in a red-hot gun-barrel, was nothing more than a case
 of double elective attraction. A phlogistuie of iron and an
 oxide of potassium were brought within the sphere of each
 other's action, in a convenient heat ; in which the oxvgen
 quitted the potassium to unite with the iron, while the phlo
 giston, which had deserted the iron, associated itself with
 the potassium, and thereby a phlogisture of potassium and
 an oxide of iron were formed.      He believed such action of
 the metals upon each other was very common, and thought
 the true theory of the operation of metallic plates in the
 Galvanic     pile would be ultimately explicable is^on this
 principle.
    Professor Mitchill explained, upon the principle of this
 classification, the great and the small chemical changes
 which natural objects undergo, both in the workshops of the
 artists and in the laboratory of Nature.     The constitution
 of the numerous and extensive order of metals was de
 fined, in their state of oxide and acid, consisting of me
 tal and oxygen, and in their ductile and resplendent forms,
 composed of metal and phlogiston.       And some metals, he

                               On Mineralogy.
    said, were capable of existing in an intermediate condition*
    having lost their phlogiston without having acquired oxygen,
    such as massicot seemed to be among the preparations of
    lead, finery cinder among the productions of iron, and cer
    tain of the white sublimates among the modifications of
    zinc. He illustrated this idea by observing that carbon was
    an example of these several combinations;         for when united
   with phlogiston it is inflammable, or burns with bkze;
   when associated with oxygen it is incombustible ; and when
   connected with neither of them, it would indeed consume
   by a red heat, through the connection it formed with oxy
   gen ; but, inasmuch as no phlogiston is present, there is no
   appearance of flame.
       He expressed the probability of the metallic nature of car
   bon, phosphorus, and sulphur; all of which when com
   bined with metals might be considered as alloys, in the same
   manner that the articles of the first order are when mixed
   with each other.         By reason of the different attractions
   which    the  metallic  bases exert for oxygen and for phlogiston,
  at   different  degrees  between   the highest and lowest tempera
   tures, they are oxided or metallized ; and those processes
  in the more refractory, are aided by the chemical action
  of the more fusible metals, and of inflammables, cooperating
  with the requisite heat. And as both oxygen and phlogiston
  exist plentifully in the fire, the metallic basis, according to
  its constitution, combines either with one or the other, and
  thereby becomes either a phlogisture or an oxide ; or it re-
* mains unconnected with either in the middle state, in which
  some of the metals have been observed.
      In the course of his observations, professor Mitchill gave
  an account     of the experiments made, in the Royal Institution
  of London, on the earths and alkalies, and of the dispo
  sition of the inflammable agent to attach itself to the ttega-
  tive side of the Voltaic apparatus, while the oxygenous ad
  hered to the positive.       And finally, Dr. Mitchill, by a'n in-
  depende     .t and  different  survey of this interesting subject,
  has arrived     at a conclusion   substantially the same with that
  of professor Davy.

     Lead in     several    Diseases.     Communicated by Thomas
     Ewell, M.D., of Washington,               to  Dr.  Miller*.
 JLast     August I was requested to visit a cartman, John
 Steins, addicted to' drunkenness, and living near the navy
 yard, in an unhealthy situation.             In the night he had been
 seized with fever, which was followed by a profuse discharge
 of blood from his stomach and anus ; his wife said he had
 lost more than two gallons ; and I found him with no pulse,
 looking exactly as a man dying, from loss of blood.
     His alarming situation called for some powerful stimulus ;
 but it occurred to me that his liver had been affected, which
 preventing the passage of blood through the vena portae, was
 followed by that engorgement of the viscera, which had
 caused the rupture of the blood-vessels of his bowels; and
 consequently that a stimulus would only serve to increase the
 power of the vessels ,to discharge the remaining blood.                   I
 immediately, determined to give him the sugar of lead.                 On
 adverting to the urgency of the case, as well as the state of
 his stomach, which had been accustomed to the most pow
 erful incitants, I directed him to take seven grains of the
 medicine every two hours, until the discharge of blood
 ceased.     On swallowing the second dose, tie exclaimed,
 w Great God, at length my guts are healed !" The
                                                                discharge
 soon lessened, and no doubt the haemorrhage stopped; but as
 a little blood (which had not been evacuated from the bowels)
 continued to come off, he took thirty- five grains in less than
 twelve hours.       By degrees I gave him stimuli, and never
 did a man recover more rapidly : and this I considered as
affording a new proof of the efficacy of free bleeding in
curing fevers quickly. However, the man never could get
 over that particular pallid countenance, peculiar to those
bled too copiously.
    Shortly after the cure of Steins, I was called to David
Mead, a drummer of the marine corps. He too was a
drunkard, was fat, and indolent.             He had a high fever, for
which he was       ordered   bleeding,    and   a dose of calomel.      In
the night he was       taken  with  a purging of blood, and I, with
out seeing him, directed injections of cold water.                  In the
morning I found        him   almost   dead;    and   the  assistant   sur-
         Doctor Harrison, pronounced " he was about to die."
feon,
   ordered him to take five grains of sugar of lead every two
hours: the bleeding ceased after the third, yet he took a

130          Internal Exhibition of      the Acetate   of Lead.   '
fourth dose.        His pulse began to rise in the evening, and
next day I ordered him the bark : by the use of porter he
soon recovered strength, though he continues very pale.
He certainlv lost a great deal of blood, but I cannot state
the precise quantity.
       On mentioning these cases to the Hon. Doctor Bibb, of
 the House of Representatives, from Georgia — he stated that
 with- equal success he had given the sugar of lead to a young
 lady, who, during a paroxysm of fever, had an intestinal
 haemorrhage.         The doses, however, which he prescribed did
 not exceed two grains ; and the salvation of the life of his
 patient as certainly depended on the 9ngar of lead, as in the
  cases    I have related.
       My prejudice respecting       the poisonous qualities of lead
 being by      these  cases removed,     I readily gave it a trial in other
  instances.      In uterine haemorrhage I found it of essential
  service, like all who used it before me.
       Mrs. A. the wife of the D                 M       , of the marine
  corps, aged      about  forty-five years,    had  a constant   discharge
  of blood from her vagina, for four months ; within a few
  davs it became so profuse as to endanger her life ; when
   called to her, I directed the exhibition of three grains of su
   gar "of lead every two hours. The third dose relieved, and
   since I have heard of no further complaints. In cases of diar
   rhoea, I have met with the same success, from the use of
   lead, which Dr. Archer has stated in a former number of
   the Repository.        But the cases in which I used it were
   attended with high inflammation ; and one of my fellow
   practitioners told me, that the medicine uniformly failed,
   when the system was in a low state. Within the last month
   I   have used it in the following case :
        John Russel, a boy aged thirteen years, belonging to
    lieut. Harriden, of the navy, drank at once, one pint and
    three gills of strong apple brandy.           In a short time he had
    no pulse, quick respiration, and all around him thought he
    was dying.       About five hours after the spirit was drunk, I
    was called to him.       Such was his inirritable state, that no
    thing which was introduced into his throat could excite
    vomiting. I had to rely only on external remedies, and
     these I applied in full force.        It was only by severe general
     whippings, rubbing with mustard and vinegar, and finally
     by blisters caused by the blaze of fire, that I could excite any
     action in his system.       In fifteen hours 1 had to resort to in
     jections of ether, brandy, laudanum, and such stimulants,
     to keep him from sinking. These were discontinued by de
      grees, until the end of the third day.        On the fourth day he
                         v                                               had

            Internal Exhibition of the Acetate of Lead.         13 1
 had most excruciating pain in his abdomen, and serous dis
  charges from his bowels — His pulse became highly inflam
 matory.       Injections, purges, and prepared chalk did not
 relieve.     In this situation I ordered him to take two grains
 of the lead every two hours. The third dose seemed to re
 move entirely the inflammation : so that in two days the boy
 had no other complaint but his blisters, which soon healing,
 he was discharged for duty.            From this I conclude, *that
 the' lead is worthy of a trial in dysentery, at least after tha
evacuants are used.
    When     I  found the throat and oesophagus of Russel so in-
 irrilahle, I unsuccessfully endeavoured to procure a probang
 and flexible tube, to introduce into his stomach.        VVith the
 first I could have extracted some of the brandy in his sto
 mach, and with the last probably the whole: so that the
 danger, from that alcohol, which had not acted, would have
 been removed.         In all cases where poisons, such as spirits,
 opium, &c, are swallowed, and are followed by extreme
 inirritability of the throat, I have no hesitation in saying,
 that great relief might be afforded by introducing the end of
 some flexible tube into the 3tomach. - By this tube much
vapour would escape; the body could be so placed as to fa
vour the running off of any fluid, or, at least, it would be
practicable to evacuate considerably by suction : by dilution
with water, and repeated evacuations, the stomach might be
entirelv cleansed.        Indeed, my reflections on this subject
have impressed me with the belief, that the introduction of
such a tube into the stomach, for the evacuation of poisons^
and into the rectum, up to the sigmoid flexion of the colon,
for the escape of that flatus, causing colic, will prove of as
much service to mankind as the catheter has been in the
discharge of unne from the bladder. At least the practice I
propose in such cases is i'ar more reasonable than washing
the stomach for some disorders, by means of an instrument,
which, I observe, Heister says, was done by the elder sur
geons.
    The   last cases which embarrassed me, and in which lad-
ministered the sugar of lead, were those of salivation.          In
the navy hospital under my care, I find frequent occasion
for the use of mercurv : in many instances the salivation has
been excessive, and no mitigation of symptoms could be
effected by opium, sulphur, blisters, purgatives, or any me
dicine that has been recommended.           I have seen death arise
in one instance from the salivation, and have apprehended
it in many.
    This was leading      me to lessen the  frequency of mercury
                                    I 2                          in

13*                   On the Use      of Fumigations
in my prescriptions, until I found a remedy in the acetate of
lead. Two cases occurred in the hospital at the same time,
in which the salivation was alarming in degree as well as
duration.
  It had occurred to me that the saccharum saturni cured
haemorrhages  and inflammations, by exciting the action of
contraction in the vessels.  Now, as mercury produces a
contrary effect, (for it really enlarges the vessels, as shown
by the glands of the throat, &c.) it appeared to me that na
ture intended the action of one as much to counteract the
action of the other in animals, as she did an acid to coun
teract an alkali : but be the theory correct or not, I ad
ministered the lead in doses of two grains, four times a day.
On the second day one of the poor men asked me for more
of the medicine he took the day before. I gave it on the
second day, and it was discontinued on the third, for they
were both cured of the salivation.      To this, I will add, that
they  washed   their mouths with   lead-water ; and that the first
time I ever found a bad symptom produced by the lead was
in one of these cases. Violent belly-ache came on : this soon
went off : and although the symptom may oftener occur with
 others than it has with me, I conceive it to be no objection
to its use ; for, but few would prefer a month's salivation to
a pain in the abdomen for a few hours.
    You have now the whole account of my use of the sugar
of lead.    I hope others of your correspondents will expe
rience and communicate an account of its virtues. When
fair trials are made of      feel confident that there will be no

debted to you, excites your solicitude, and    have now the I

   It   sometimes difficult to prevail on mankind to adopt,

improvements which have for their object the preservation
of their health.   was more fortunate

ever, in our army hospitals in Poland than in Austria.
                   * From Annalts   de Chimie, tome   lxiv. p.   172.
                                                                          I      con-

                       in Army Hospitals.                   133   .
   I consider   low and remittent fevers produced by the mi
asmata   of  an hospital as obstinate epidemics, which with
slight attention may be avoided.          They originate from
negligence    or  from  the hospital being over-crowdedj evils
which a becoming firmness on the part of the medical officers
will of course prevent.
   During eight months that I performed the duties of the
great hospital at Posen, containing 400 beds, and subject to
great variations and changes with respect to the number of
the patients, no infection made its appearance in any per
ceptible manner : no person attached to the service con
tracted it ; and several young medical attendants, who had
been attacked with the contagion of other estabJishments,
were brought to the above hospital for the benefit of our su
perior salubrity,. and were restored to health.
    M. Desgenettes, the physician general to the army, gave
me the following instructions :       " I request that when the
hospitals are crowded, or when low fevers prevail, you may
use the fumigations with the hyper-oxygenated muriatic acid
gas, according to M. Morveau's process. This valuable pro
phylactic has been very improperly rejected, and has been
thought useful only when contagious diseases were com
pletely developed.      I request you to inform me if this pu
rifying remedy is put in practice."
    In consequence of this letter I constantly recommended
 these fumigations in the wards of the hospitals to which I
 was attached. The instructions for health, inserted in the last
 Pharmaceutical Formula, for the use of military hospitals,
 seem to make this measure subordinate to the removal of
the patients from the infected place, and successively chan
 ging their beds from room to room.       Circumstances, how
 ever,   may occur to prevent these measures from being
 adopted, and it is important to simplify the operation as
 much as possible. Without occasioning, therefore, any re
 moval of the patients, the hyper-oxygenated muriatic acid
 gas may be used morning and evening without inconve
 nience.    An attendant may carry backward and forward an
 earthen  vessel  containing some muriate of soda and manga
 nese and cold sulphuric acid, taking care to stir it frequently
 with a spatula.
    Neither the attendants nor patients have ever suffered any
 bad effects, in my presence, from the pungency of the fumi
 gation.    Some windows, however, may be opened to give
 vent to the fumigation, but if the weather be cold this may
 be dispensed with; and the influence of the fumigation
                                  I3                       partly

134                  On the Use   of Fumigations
partly depends upon its being some time confined within a
close place.
    However great may be the energy of the disinfecting pro
cess, I do not think that too nrticii ought to be expected
from it. A serious accident happened a month ago in an
hospital where perfect salubrity had previously reigned. A
church, which had been converted into a fine ward with 60
beds for chronic diseases, was infected with a fecal smell,
which exhaled from the soil on account of a vast burying vault
having been overflown by the bursting into it of a cesspool.
The sick and wounded were instantly removed : the vault
was cleaned and fumigated as well as possible, and the fu
migations were repeatedly made in the church itself with
closed doors.      In four or five days it was necessary to fill it
again    with patients, and the fumigations were continued for
a week : no contagion was perceived.
    In my opinion, the instructions in the Formula above
alluded to are not sufficiently explanatory with respect to the
preservative effect of hyper-oxygenated muriatic acid gas.          I
think it has also the property of killing vermin; and it ought
to be applied to the clothes of the sick soldiers which are
laid up on their coming into the hospital.            Besides flies,
which annoyed us much in Poland, we were also dreadfully
afflicted with fleas and bugs, and on applying the above fu-»
negations they were all found dead.
Letter from      M. Benoit Mojon, Chief           Physician to the
       Military   Hospital   at  Genoa,  on the same   Subject.
                                               Genoa, August 20, 1807.
    Two months       ago a contagibui dysentery made its appear
ance    in the military hospital at Genoa, and almost all the
patients under my care, amounting to about 200, were at
tacked.      As it is generally allowed that when, dysentery is
contagious it is owing to an indiscriminate use of the same
privy, I was anxious to try if fumigations of oxygenated
muriatic acid had the effect of destroying the contagious ex
halations which produce dysenterv in healthy as well as in
 diseased subjects.       With this view I fumigated the pri
 vies in  the hospital   twice  a day, and succeeded in destroying
 this contagion     in a  few  days.   Contagious dysenterv being
 of frequent recurrence in the hospitals of Genoa, it is likely
 that I shall have more frequent opportunities of witnessing
 the happy effects of similar precautions,
                                                                 Noti

   Note      by  M. Guyton,       subjoined    to the  two preceding
                            Coram unicat ions .
       When it occurred to me to transmit these letters to the
   Annates de Chimie, I asked myself if there were not abun
   dance of observations already published on the efficacy of
, these fumigations.       1 hope to be excused,      however, when
   I  inform the public that, in works professedly intended for
   supporting the practice, even in the Bibliotheque Medicate,
   some young physicians have inserted articles tending to
   weaken the public confidence in these operations, and to
   suspend their execution, notwithstanding the instructions of
   the councils of health and the orders of government. The
   old routine of perfumes has been recommended ; and fears
   have been started respecting the action of the oxygenated
   muriatic acid, by ascribing the same disinfecting virtue to
   fixed substances, which act upon those only in immediate
   contact.
       Is it not astonishing, for instance, to see it inserted in the
   German Journal of Hufeland, without any critical remark,
   that the contagious miasmata of the plague and of typhus
   are chiefly attached to metals, that they are rather acid than
   alkaline, that lime and the alkalis are useful for preserving
   from any contagion ? " Without, however, pretending to
   dispense with the fumigations of Guyton Morveau,               and
   Smith, equally efficacious, as is proved by experience ; but
   more difficult in their application, and more dangerous to
   respiration."                                          * .
       The author of this extract, in Nos. 47 and 49 of the same
   miscellany, carries still further his vague doubts and un
   warrantable conclusions.      He finds fumigations of sulphuric
   acid sanctioned by Homer, because mention is made in the
   Odyssey of the purification of a house by the combustion of
   sulphur: he calls by the name of nitro-sulphuric fumiga
   tions, those made by the powder of the physicians of Mos
   cow, in which there are only eight parts by weight of nitre,
   and six of sulphur to twenty-six of raspings of guaiacum,
   with the leaves and berries of juniper and myrrh : he sup
   poses that we may purify inhabited rooms by burning
   sulphur in them : he even gives reason to think that the
  ^efficaciousness of the powder of the Moscovite physicians
   was proved on seven criminals condemned to death, who were
   infected with the plague and recovered; whereas, as I have
   reported according to Dr. A. Wolff, it was only some in
  fected pellises that were exposed to a strong fumigation of
   subphur and saltpetre combined, and none of the criminals
                                    1 4                       obliged

 obliged to put them on took the plague ; and in his Consi
 derations sur I'Hisloire de la Peste de Wolhinie, in 1798,
 Dr. Hufeland points out the use of this powder in the disin
 fecting of clothes only *. If the author of these articles
 really thought that men might be with impunity exposed to
 sulphurous fumigations, Why did he not quote the authority
 of Propertius, who tells us that in order to purify him Cyn
 thia burned sulphur thrice upon his head t? Il »s neverthe
 less on the subject of these same sulphurous fumigations
 produced with the mixture of resinous woods, nitre and sul
 phur, that he declares,
                                    "   The physicians of Moscow may
fairly dispute      the   honour   of  this  discovery with Messrs. Guy-
                                         N
 ton    Morveau,       and   Smith."        Soon    afterwards he informs
 us   that   the  use  of   fumigations      is lost in the remotest anti
 quity,    the   Hebrew,      Arab,    and   Latin   writers mention it as
 well as the Greeks.
     Of what importance is the name of the inventor, and the
 date of his discovery, provided the truth of it be established,
 and humanity is benefited ? But when we read in the same
 page, — that the alkalis, lime, and the other absorbent earths
 have also something preservative in them — that Hippocrates
 preserved Greece from a plague brought from Ethiopia, by
 kindling fires in which various aromatic substances were
  burnt — it is certain that not only frankincense and myrrh,
 hit tlte other resinous gums also, and particularly camphor,
  the aromatic essences, juniper, and an infinity of odoriferous
 vegetables employed in perfume, or as vapours, have mani
fested very salubrious effects,"
                                          — have we not a right to de
 mand, What respect is due to the opinion of those who are
 not capable of distinguishing                subsiances which, by their
  spontaneous expansion, can attack deleterious miasmata in
  the air, from substances which do not alter what comes in
  contact with them : and those which burn by their chemical
  action, contagious viruses from those w hich cannot disguise
  their smell a single monunt ? Is there not reason to fear,
  that, determined by the facility of procuring some odorife
  rous plants, they prefer perfumes, the inefficacy of which
 is now ascertained and publicly declared in every book on
 epidemics ?    J     In this way opinions thrown out for the sake
                                                                              of

XX. An Inquiry           into the Terrestrial Phcenomena produced
    by the   Action of the Ocean.          By John Carr, Esq., of
    Manchester. — No. II.
                             To  Mr. Tillock.
Sir,    The      several facts and reasoning in my two last papers
have been chiefly directed to show, that the exterior of our
earth has been moulded into all its infinite variety of ine
quality by the sole action of moving water; and                      I am now
to inquire into those internal characters which are more
immediately the object of geological research, and which
have doubtless been effected by the same plastic and potent
agency.
    The two most inexplicable phaenomera in geology, and
which, beyond all others, have tempted the inquirer to wan
der out of the limits of natural operation into hypothetical
regions of invention and surmise, are the various inclina
tions of the strata from horizontal up to vertical, and the
elevation of the ocean up to those astonishing heights on our
mountains, which bear the most unequivocal testimony of
its former action.         To get over the latter and greater diffi
culty, Dr. Hutton, whose extensive personal researches and
discriminating powers merit the highest eulogy, has lighted
 up internal fires in the lowest regions of the earth, whose
expansive forces have elevated our continents from the lowest
beds of the sea up to their present heights, and, of course,
thrown the seas which covered them over the existing con
tinents which had become impoverished and worn out, and
which are to undergo a due season of renovated pickling in
the briny deep, when the instinctive fires are to withdraw
their support from us, shifting their buoyant powers to the
submerged lands ; and these, kicking the beam, are to deluge
our worn-out hills and valleys with the grand restorative
specific-dilute muriate of soda.              A glance at the map will
show how strangely capricious are the operations of these
internal ignitions, forcing up in some cases continents ex
tending from pole to pole ; and in other instances, in the
pitals, by M. Parmentier; the circular letters of the minister of the interior
to the prefects, of 80 Nivose and 15 Messidor, an. xiii. ; the reports made by

138        An Inquiry into   the Terrestrial   Phenomena
 midst of vast seas, popping up the bald point of a peaked
 rock, with scarcely surface enough of hatching room for
 one of mother Carey's chickens.
    Mr. Kirwan, whose various chemical and mineralogical
researches have added so extensively to the acquirement and
spread of natural science, reprobating these internal fires, as
chronologically heathenish and pagan, has let in upon them
an orthodox ocean, which has chained off our present seas
to fourteen thousand feet below their former depth, leaving
countless myriads of bivalved, univalved, and other marine
animals, gaping in helpless anguish for their briny beverage,
on the summits of our highest mountains. Whether there is
more of ingenuity in providing or in filling up such enormous
cavernous excavations in the profound bosom of our consoli
dated globe, I shall not stop to inquire.
   To account for the great elevation and other anomalous
irregularities in the strata, Mr. Farey, whose indefatigable
personal researches have already added, and are yet likely to
add, so much to our practical acquisitions, has announced
his intention of employing an extinct erratic satellite, whose
near approach to our globe is to reverse the direction of gravity,
and excite by its attractive force rebellious movements in
the upper strata, heaving them up in successive and doubt
ful movements, whither to continue attached to their parent
planet, or, yielding to the usual and dangerous seductions of
novelty, to fly off to the evanescent stranger. Nay, it should
even seem that some of the undutiful progeny have ac
tually made this most singular elopement, and that the de-
nudated tops of our eminences exhibit naked proofs of these
paternal derelictions.     As, however, the vertical strata and
other anomalies which this lunation lever1 is made to heave
up are disseminated in local patches all over the earth, the
movements of the heavenly visitant, unlike the even and
equable progression of all its aerial prototypes, must have
been strangely vagarious, and made in every latitudinary
direction,    byvoccasional dips and irregular snatches, like the
plunderous dash of     a   hungry hawk at       flight of passing
                                                   a
pigeons.
    Jtis in itself farcical to apply any serious argument to
such hypothetical reveries as these    ;  and this consideration,
I  trust, will apologize for departing altogether from the
decorous gravity of philosophical disquisition.
   As far as we have yet made any successful discoveries in
to the operations of Nature, we find them all the result of
permanent laws, which, acting with provident wisdom and
rotative perpetuity, give    a precision,  a stability, and du
                                                           a

ration, to every natural system, wherein no human calcula

mischievous irregularity, or accidental violence of action,
bave no place in the execution of these undeviating laws}
they are only the blind applications of our blind and partial
views of things.
     The prolonged preservation of the ephemeral species, whose
buzzing progeny commence and terminate their existence
on the same day, is, as far as we can san see and judge, as
effectually provided for and secured, as that of the solar
system. i
     And shall we look upon the stupendous and massive
effects which the exterior and interior survey of our globe
every where displays; and search for their causes amongst
temporary and extinct agents ? Shall so mighty an occur
 rence, in the scheme of terrestrial existence, as the stratified
conformation and transition arrangements of the vast mate
 rials of our earth, have no permanently established laws for
 their. regulation and governance, while the fluttering insect
 of an hour is provided with its peculiar rules of formation
 and perpetual     duration ? It was the impressive convic
 tion that all geological phaenomena have resulted from
 systematic and permanently operating laws, which are now
 in full activity, and the reprobation of all fortuitous hypo
 thesis in their investigation, that first induced me to offer
 my sentiments on a subject which had previously occupied
 my attention only in common with other branches of natu
 ral history : and I will now proceed with the sketch of that
 outline, which I offer with the utmost diffidence, as a remote
 approximation towards a theory of the geology of our earth.

 duration, and the formation of all their strata by marine
 action, are no longer questions in modern science ; but it is
 yet an unascertained, and perhaps the most important of all
 geological queries : —Whether the present conformation of
 the interior of our earth has been derived from one, or from
  many successive immersions of the same country ? and un
  til a specific and decisive answer can be given to this most
  interesting interrogatory, the multifarious phaenomena of ge
 ological discovery will continue to be, as they have hitherto
  been, the prey and the sport of ingenious sophism and de
  lusive hypothesis.                                           «
      There are, I conceive, several distinct circumstances,
  which will authorise a probable decision on this most im
  portant question of singular or plural immersion.            All
  stratified rock, not evidently the produce of marine shells
                                                                in

     140          An Inquiry into     the   Terrestrial Thamomena
    in their native beds,  has been formed from the consolidation
    of strata previously   derived from aqueous deposition.   The
    Vulcanists triumphantly assign the consolidation,      and in
    many cases maintain the actual fusion of the strata, to in
    ternal fires, alleging that a mere hardening by evaporation
    of the moisture, in the stony matter, would necessarily leave
    the rock in a state of porosity, which observation every
                                                        it is,
    where contradicts.     The truth however     that the assump
    tion of internal fires    as superfluous as
                                 is                visionary, andis
    the desiccation of solidifiable strata, under an incalculable
    pressure of the superincumbent strata, aided by the agglu
     tination of stony matter in solution, during         period of  a       in
     definite extent,      amply sufficient to account for the highly
                           is
     indurated and dense state in which we now find all strati
     fied rock.
        The absolute completion of the solidifying process seems
     however to require an emersion above the level of the ocean              ;
     forit   isdifficult to imagine how many of the species of rock
     with which we are acquainted, could have been both preci
     pitated and consolidated under one and the same immersion.
     If there any truth in this observation, would decide the
                  ;s                                    it

                                                    ;
     rous instances of rock which bear conclusive evidence of the
     attrition of marine action after their induration.       The rock
     of Table Mountain at the Cape of Good Hope may be given
     as one of these instances.           repugnant to all rational be
                                          It   is
     lief, to admit that the materials of that vast rock experienced
     an aqueous deposition,          subsequent consolidation, and
                                      a                                       a
     final destructive denudation to its present state, all under
     one and the same immersion.
        The numerous breaks and separations which traverse the
*    strata, designated      faults, throws, heaves, troubles, and
     other names expressive of their effects in mining, are also,            I
     think, evidence of distinct immersions.           Their frequent
     rectilinear direction, and their worn and abraded angular as
     perities, fully prove that they were formed after the consoli
     dation of the strata      which they occur, and also, conceive,
                                in                                       I
     establish them to have been originally chasms, gullies, ra
    pines, valleys, channels, and other land excavations, clefts
     and fissures, and to have been filled up in       subsequent im-
                                                                 a
     piersion.
         Mineral veins in extensive fissures which traverse stratified
     rock, can,       imagine, only be referred to the same origin,
                       1
     and therefore testify the same result. The minerals have
      assuredly obtained their present situation in an immersion
     entirely distinct from that in which the strata were formed.
                                                                             The

              produced by the Act'wn   of the Ocean.          141
The monstrous opinion that all minerals and their beds have
been forced up from below, and in their ascent have pro
duced the enormous dispartations of rock wherein we now
find them, is rapidly declining ; and the rational and far
more natural conclusion, that all minerals and their hetero
geneous matrices have arrived at their situations by a de
scending process, is daily establishing itself; and it can be
maintained on no other reasoning than that the separations
in the strata were originally land fissures, clefts, rocky val
leys, and other excavations, such as all countries now more
or less abound with ; and that they were filled up with di
versified materials in a subsequent       immersion.     In fact,
numbers of these fissures bear palpable indication of a stra
tified form in their contents; and those sparry and other in
crustations which are so usually found adhering, in many
distinct layers over each other, to the rocky sides of mines,
and which have been deemed certain proofs of actual fusion,
are, on the contrary, the most decisive evidence of an aque
ous process down the perpendicular side of the rock, the
 distinct layers of different materials concreting and passing
 over each other in regular succession.
    Perhaps the most irrefragable proofs of the distinct im
 mersions of the same country are to be found in those sin
 gular instances, sufficiently frequent, of the formation of
 secondary horizontal strata over vertical strata of primary
 granite and schistus.
    This rectangular formation of strata contains in itself a
 physical impossibility, as to its being the produce of a single
 immersion.
    Other proofs of separate submersions of the same country
 are to be found in the extensive beds of sand and pebbles,
 whose present situation can only be referred to former shores
 of the ocean. All granular sand and loose stone are de
 rived from the detritus of rock, the desiccated strata of
 former marine deposition ; and all pebbles have acquired
 their smooth and rounded forms from the attrition of agi
 tated water in the streams of rivers or on the shores of the
 sea.    Immense beds of such sand and pebbles are found in
 every varying situation, from the tops of the highest moun- i
 tains to the bottoms of the lowest valleys, either in loose
 masses, or in vast formations of pudding-stone and breccias,
 which are merely the indurated beds of sand and intermixed
 pebbles. Now if we trace these numerous and extensive
 beds from the first marine precipitation of the materials,
 through the subsequent desiccation of the strata, the after
                                                   disintegration

   disintegration of the rock, the period of aqueous attrition
  and rounding    of the pebbles, their subsequent consolidation
  into breccia, and the after disintegration from pudding-stone
  again into sand and gravel, as occurs in thousands of in
  stances, it will, I think, compel an acknowledgment that
  this wonderful history of material transformation includes a
  duration of time, in which we can perceive no commence
  ment, and a distinct diversity of marine submersions of the
  same country.
      Indeed, to pursue this most astonishing transition of mat
  ter from one state to another, without even approximating
  the limits of rational probability, it may be truly asserted,
  that there is not a cubic foot of material in any natural bed
 within the range of human inspection, that is not strictly
  derivative, having obtained its present form from its de
 structive dissolution in a former state ; and that all our
           continents have been constructed from the number-
   ess remnants and fragments of other more ancient countries,
 {iresent
 evincing altogether periods of duration, systems of trans
 ition, and alternations of land and ocean, to which we can
 assign neither commencement nor termination.
     What has been said, and much more that might be offer
 ed, afford, I think, as much of probable evidence as the         i
nature of the case might be expected to furnish, that the
 different portions of our globe have been subjected to an in
 definite number of marine immersions, and that it is in the
infinite diversity of alterative effects which such alternating
 changes of land and sea would operate on local portions of
the earth, that we are to look for the only natural illustra
tion of the principal phaenomena of geologv.       Strictly gui
ding our researches by the laws which we now find in action,
-we shall discover in Nature neither infancy nor old age, and
the operations of the past and of the future will be found to
human scrutiny equally illimitable.       Every waste will have
its compensation, and every decomposition its reconsolida-
tion, and an endless succession of decay and reproduc
tion will be found revolving through the whole in circular
perpetuity.
     The geologist who enters on his pursuit without these en
larged views, will be measuring the pyramid by the frag
ment of its apex. Every rock will be an obstaele, and every
chasm a barrier to his progress ; and calling hypothetical in
vention to his aid, he will fancy he is advancing, when, like
the dog in the wheel, he is only scrambling against a bank.

M     . Houvard has made a most useful addition to astronomy
 by his tables of Jupiter and Saturn.      It will be recollected
 that the inequalities of these two planets have long per
 plexed astronomers, and would have 3till continued to do so,
 if the analysis of M. La Place had not discovered equations
 of a long period, which, by being confounded with the mean
 motions, had apparently accelerated the motion of Jupiter,
 and proportionally retarded that of Saturn,       By the help of
.this theory, compared with the best observations made for
 more than one hundred years, M. Delambre succeeded in
 reducing to half a minute, under the most unfavourable cir
 cumstances, the errors of the tables, which formerly were
 from 15 to 20 times greater for Jupiter, and more than 40
 times for Saturn.    The errors would have been still less if
 modern observations were more numerous, and admitted of
 our rejecting every thing that preceded 1 745 : but the author
 had disposed his work in such a way as to be able to resume
 it,  either of himself, or       by
                                  means of another astronomer,

 more exact tables have been obtained for the two planets ;
 so that the greatest error does not at present exceed 1 3 de
 grees, and it even rises to this quantity on one occasion only,
 partly owing no doubt to an error in the observation.        The
 utility of this labour has been extended to the ecliptic tables
 of the satellites of Jupiter, entirely recomposed by M. De-

    Zoology. — Of all the phtenomena peculiar to certain
 animals, there are few so singular and so apparently con
trary to the laws of animal oeconomy as the lethargic sleep
 to which several vivpiarous quadrupeds are subject during
 winter.    The lethargy of reptiles and of insects during the
 same season astonishes us much less, because we are less
 disposed to compare these beings with ourselves; and be
 cause in this state they lose a smaller number of their ha
 bitual properties.
    In the lethargic mammiferae, not only does an absolute
 state of rest take place, a complete abstinence and an insen
 sibility to such a degree that we may sometimes bum or tear
 them in pieces without their perceiving                       it,
                                                  but their respi
 ration and circulation also gradually diminish, and they lose
the greatest part of their animal heat, one of the most marked
 characters of their class: in     word, their life seems totally
                                      a
arrested;    all the springs which retain or set in motion
the elements of organisation seem to have lost their activity,
and yet life still remains, nay, may be prolonged             that               by
lethargy beyond its natural limits: neither death nor decom
position has taken place and unless the cold or other acces
                               ;
saries of the lethargic state has ceased, the animal awakes
and resumes its usual functions.
    When the Class proposed, in 799» that naturalists should
                                          1
consider in detail the circumstances which produce, ac
company, and put an end to the lethargic state,          was not            it
expected that    a complete solution of the point would be ob
tained, but merely that the attention of naturalists, when
directed to so great an object, might throw some light on it.
    The most important memoirs on this subject have ap
peared in Spallanzani's posthumous Treatise on Respiration,
published in 1803, and         in

      Messrs. Herholdt and Rafn, of Copenhagen, M. Saissy,
   a   physician of Lyons, anl M. Pmnelle of Montpelier,
  have successively presented memoirs of great merit to the
   Institute, on the torpidity of animals; and we think it right
  to give here a detail of some of the phenomena, with some
  hasty conjectures respecting the cause.'
      Cold is the most necessary accessory to sleep ; but it is
  not the only one: there must also be an absence of irritating
  causes, such as noise, food, &c. Several of these animals,
  when domesticated, do not sleep, notwithstanding the cold.
  An atmosphere deficient in oxvgen is also favourable, and
  frequently necessary.         This is the reason that most animals
  roll themselves up before falling asleep.
      The degree of heat, although variable according to the
  kind of animal and accessary circumstances, is always a
  little higher than the freezing point : a too violent cold has
  the effect of awakening animals when they are suddenly ex
  posed to    it.
      Quadrupeds subject to lethargic sleep have not in general
  their blood colder than other animals in the ordinary state,
  nor do they consume less oxygen in respiration : it appears,
  however, that their heat decreases a little with that of the
  atmosphere, although it always remains sufficiently high
   while they are awake.
      When once asleep, their breathing and circulation be
  come slower : the consumption of oxygen decreases in the
  same proportion; they lose all feeling when the lethargy is
, at its height.      Irritability seems to be the function which is
  best preserved.
      Their animal heat decreases in the same interval to one
  or two degrees above o' (Reaumur), but it does not become
  lower ; and if we gradually expose the animal to a more vio*
  lent cold, and it becomes frozen, death ensues.
      Warmth is the most natural cause of the animal's awakingi
  there are other causes, however, and cold is one of them.
  When the animal awakes from any given cause, respiratioa
  and circulation recommence with the usual degree of heat.
  The profoundness of the sleep is different, according to the
  species.     Some animals awake several times in winter: the
  bear and the badger are sul-ject to a slight sleep only : the
  dormouse allows itself to be dissected without exhibiting any
  signs of pain.
      They   evacuate their bowels before going to sleep ; but they
  eat during      the short times in which They are awake : they
  transpire    but   very little.   The above are such facts as have
  been clearly ascertained.

    With respect to the predisposing causes, i. e. why s6tne
animals are subject to sleep in winter and others not ; and
with respect to the preserving causes, i. e. what renders them
susceptible of reviving, notwithstanding          the suspension of
functions which seem most necessary            to life, — nothing yet
has been advanced which offers a satisfactory solution of
these questions.
    M.  Geoffroy has presented       to  the  Institute   some frag
ments of a great work which he has undertaken upon Com-
           Osteology. He endeavours to push further than has
   cen hitherto done, the analogies between the corresponding
Earative
parts of various vertebral animals,
                                        — analogies which Aristotle
nad already recognised, and upon which he founded his
works of Natural History.
    M. Latreille,. already known by his great work upon In
sects in fourteen volumes, published as a supplement to
Buffon, has added to his other labours a work in Latin,
under the title of Genera Insectorum et Crustaceorum, three
volumes of which have already appeared, in which he has
 classed them with method and precision.
     M. Dumeril, professor of anatomy in the School of Me
 dicine, the editor of M. Cuvier's Comparative Anatomy,
 and author of several valuable works, has presented three
 Memoirs this year to the Institute.         In the first he treats of
 the mechanism of the respiration of fishes, which is nearly
 the same with that of deglutition in other animals, but it is'
 effected by more complex organs; he points out several in
 teresting singularities, and among others, the way in which
 lampreys, rays, and several squali take in water ; their
 mouth being fixed to the stones or the sand, cannot be used
 for this purpose, but it is effected by means of apertures,
 called vents, made in the upper part of their heads, and fur
 nished internally with a valve which admits of water entering
 when the cavity of the mouth is dilated, but which leaves
 no other outlet but the gills, when this cavity is shut.
     In his second Memoir, M. Dumeril treats of the senses of
  smelling and taste in fishes.      He thinks their tongue is in
  sensible to taste, on account of the dryness and hardness of its
  integuments, and the continual passage of water over them
  in respiration ; but their pituitary membrane not being suscep
  tible of smell like ours, since it is not affected by elastic va
  pours, may very probably be the seat of the organ of taste, by
  transmitting the impression of substances dissolved in water.         .
     The third Memoir is a comparative view of the various
  vital and animal functions, in the order of reptiles called
  BatracUe, whence it results that the division of this order
                                                                   into

                    French National Institute.                147
   into two families, proposed by M. Dumeril in his Analytical
   Zoology, is justified by striking differences in almost all the
   organical systems.
      The crocodile genus has been this year the subject of se
  veral Memoirs.     Hitherto no correct ideas have been formed
   even respecting the crocodile of the Nile, which has been
  the subject of so many wonderful stories ; far less were the
  destructive characters     of the various crocodiles known.
  M. Geoffroy Saint Hilarie has rendered an essential service
  to natural history by bringing a crocodile of the Nile from
  Egypt ; a circumstance which had the effect of introducing
  to the public the Saint Domingo crocodile, an animal al
  most entirely neglected by naturalists.      M. Descourtils has
  presented a complete history of it ; being the result of ob
  servations made in the West Indies, accompanied by draw
  ings. M. Cuvier, by comparing the information thus com
  municated with his own previous knowledge, has proved
  that there exist, in the warm countries of the old and new
  continent, at least twelve species of these voracious, reptiles,
  distinct from each, and easily recognized : he has exhibited
  the bodies or skeletons of most of them, and determined
  their characters.
      The same naturalist has directed his attention in an ana
 tomical point of view to some reptiles which truly merit
 the appellation of amphibious, because they breathe by the
 gills like fishes, and by the lungs also like common reptiles.
     One of these, the siren lacertina, resembles a kind of eel,
 with two small fore-feet, each having; four toes : its neck is
 adorned on each side with three small fringes.       This animal
 i9 found in the rivers of Carolina.
     The other, the proteus anguinus, is still more extraor
 dinary ; its colour is whitish ; its gills of a bright red : it
 has four feet, those in front have three toes, and those be
 hind only two.      The eyes are entirely concealed under the
skin, and in fact are of no use to       it,   for
                                                 it  only inhabits
some subterraneous waters in Carniola, from which           it   is
vomited forth in great inundations.           Itis  therefore ex
tremely rare even in that country, and has never been found
any where else.

     M. Cuvier's opinion, that the mammoth of Russia, and
indeed of the old continent, was different species from the

Indian elephant,   is   well known. This opinion has been

      Zoology has this year been "enriched by the labours of
   M. Biot, the celebrated geometrician. While occupied in
   the Balearic Islands in measuring an arc of the meridian, he
   thought     he observed that fishes, when suddenlv drawn out
   of  the sea by the line from a great depth, expelled a part of
  their intestines from their mouths : this phaenomenon he
   ascribed   to the air-bladder being compressed by the great
   column of water which it has to support, and which dilating
  suddenly as the fish rises, tears a part of the intestines, ana
   causes them to rise into the mouth.           M. Biot also examined
  the nature of the air contained in this bladder, and found
  that it varied from pure azote up to -rVotn of oxygen ;
  but there was no appearance of hydrogen.                 He was of opi
  nion that the oxygen was more abundant in proportion to
  the depth from which the fish came ; and fresh water fish,
  which frequently swim near the surface, afforded very little
  of this gas. This last observation has also been made by
  Messrs, Geoffroy and Vauquelin, and by M. Humboldt, and
  agrees with the opinion long ago advanced by M. Fourcroy,
  in a memoir upon the air in the bladder of carps, which he
  regarded as almost pure azote.
      M. Jurine, correspondent of the class at Geneva, has
  published a work on hymenopterous insects. He divides this
  extensive class according to the nerves of the wings, a cha
  racter which has the advantage of being extremely sensible,
  and is more natural than might be expected from the small
  degree of importance attributed to it* .
      M. Jurine is busied with a similar work on dipterce, or
  two-winged insects.
      Physiology-. — M. Dupuytren has presented the Institute
  some experiments on an important point in physiology,
  viz. : the concurrence of the nerves of the lungs in the act of
  respiration.     The attention of physiologists having been
  Jong   directed   to the chemical part of this animal function,
  they    had   too   much lost sight of its vital part ; and it was
  supposed     that,  provided the motion of the sides aa>d of the
  diaphragm brought the air into the cellular part of the lungs,
  the blood would be changed from venous to arterial. It had,
  notwithstanding,         been presumed, that the texture of the ar
  teries, and consequently of the nerves therein distributed,
  must still take an active part in this operation, as well as in
                • See                          vol. xxix. p. 141.

 all the other transformations of the fluids of the animated
 body.    This has been proved by M. Dupuytren, in direct
experiments.       Horses and dogs, in which he had cut from
both sides the nerves peculiar to the pulmonary texture, in
vain agitated their pectoral muscles and inspired the air ;
their blood constantlv remained black, and they died as if
from asphixia: and the same nerves, alternately tied with a
thread and freed from the ligature, when the texture had not
been altered, successively produced the phenomena of arterial
and venous colouring.
    Botany. — M. Labillardiere has finished his Flora
                                                                          of
New Holland. M. de Beauvois has published a new edition
of that of Oware and Benin, and has given the remainder
of his Memoir on the Algae.'
    M. de Jussieu continues his examination of certain fami
lies, the structure of which he analyses more exactly, and
rectifies the distribution, combining his observations with
those of Gaertner.        New divisions or unions of genera have
resulted from his inquiries; and on this head he has this,
year communicated a memoir, in which he separates from
the too numerous genus justicia, two genera, which he de
nominates dicliptera and Medium.
    Both differ from the ordinary justicia, from their capsule
being divided into forked valves ; and the partition between
the seed-boxes is but imperfect.           The Medium in particular
js distinguished by four stamina, and by the different struc
ture of its partition.
    M. Happel-La-Chesnay, of Guadaloupe, has communi
cated an interesting observation upon the air-vessels of the
Banana tree. These vessels are very abundant, and very tough
in the stalk of this vegetable ; and as the rest of its texture
is very tender, they are easily detached.                They resemble
carded cotton, but it does not appear that cloth can be made
with them.
    M. Dupetit-Thouars has continued to communicate his
inquiries upon the growth of vegetables.                 He still thinks
that the stalk of trees finds in the buds the principle of its
growth, and that the fibres, of which the annual layers of wood
are composed, are in some measure the roots of the buds,
while the small medullary thread which joins each of them,
performs the same functions with the cotyledons in the small
plant which is germinating*.
    To the motives for this opinion, which he had previously-
detailed, he has added others : he has endeavoured to answer
             * See Philosophical Magazine,  vol.xiviii. p. 370.

objections, and has intermixed several important facts con
nected with the physics of vegetables, and of an interest in
dependent of the principal object.            Of this number is the
germination     of the tree called  lecythis by Linnaeus : although
belonging    to  the  dicotyledons, the evolution of its seed is
not similar to any of the three modes hitherto adopted.          Its
cotyledon    is internal,   and  serves as  a basis to the marrow,
which, in the opinion of M. Dupetit Thouars, is a proof in
favour of his ideas.
    The origin of carbon in plants is one of the most impor
tant questions connected with vegetable oeconomy. The class
a few years ago made it the subject of a prize question with
out obtaining a satisfactory answer : but the excellent work
published since by De Saussure, added to preceding labours
of M. Sennebier, has begun to throw great light on this ob
scure subject. The decomposition of the carbonic acid is
displayed amid many complicated transformations, as the
chief and predominating act of vegetation, and as the pri
mitive source of vegetable carbon.
    M. de Crell, a celebrated chemist residing at Helmstadt,
has this year communicated to the class some experiments
which afford a most exalted idea of the power of vegetation :
he informs us that he has raised plants in pure sand, so as
 to bear fruit : they were watered with distilled water only,
and supplied with a determinate quantity of air, in which
 the carbonic acid must have been almost null, compared to
Ihe quantity of carbon produced. Vegetables must therefore
 have, according to M, Crell, the power of composing car
 bon, employing for this purpose- only water, atmospheric
 air, and light. This would be one of the greatest discoveries
 in chemistry; but unfortunately this respectable chemist has
 not taken the necessary precautions for demonstrating his
 assertion with the precision requisite on such an important
 occasion : even when he covered his plants with a bell-glass,
 it was out of his power to prevent the access of the external
 air through the sand on which the bell-glass rested ; and as
 the external air is continually in motion, it is very difficult to
 estimate the quantity of carbonic acid which it can furnish.
     Chemistry. — Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquclin continue
 with unabated ardour their Analyses of the Productions of
  organised Bodies, and their remarks on the transformations
  which these productions,are capable of undergoing: by these
  labours they have established relations of the utmost impor
  tance between chemistry and physiology, and have thrown
  a great deal of light on the latter.

     The juice of onions presented a sharp, volatile and odori
 ferous oil, sulphur, plenty of saccharine matter and of mu
 cilage, a vegeto-animal matter coagulable by heat, phos
 phoric and acetic acid, calcareous phosphate and citrate,
 which last had not been previously discovered in vegetables.
 It is this oil which gives onions their sharp taste previous to
their being dressed, and which irritates the eyes ; and it is
the sulphur they contain which blackens silver articles, and
contributes to the smell which onions give out when in a
jtate of putrefaction.
    The free phosphoric acid being capable of dissolving the
phosphate of lime, would perhaps be useful as a remedy
 against calculi of the bladder : and this has given rise to an
 opinion that onion juice is an excellent medicine for the stone.
 Calculi of uric acid and of oxalate of lime are unfortunately,
however, unattackable by it. The acetous fermentation of
 onion juice develops a kind of manna, differing from the
saccharine matter from which it is separated, in so far as
 the proportion of hydrogen and carbon is more considerable.
                                        presented  to  these   in-
 defatigable chemists an important fact, and one entirely new
 in the annals of science. The above substance contains native
 phosphorus, which is so intimately combined with it that it
 remains united to its carbon after a total decomposition,
 forming a true carburet of azoted phosphorus.           Human
 bones of the eleventh century, dug up from the old church~
 of St. Genevieve, and analysed by the same chemists, were
 found dyed of a fine purple colour and covered with an
 efflorescence of phosphoric acid and acid phosphate of lime.
 Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauquelin are of opinion, from this
 observation, that the exhibition of the phosphoric acid might
 rather be one of the methods employed by nature for de
 composing the bones and restoring them completely to the
 earth.
     [The report next details Mr. Davy's discoveries, which
 have been already submitted to our readers.]
    M. de Morveau has attempted to apply Galvanism to cer
 tain interesting and obscure phenomena in the mineral
kingdom ; and particularly to the transition of a sulphuret
 to the state of oxide, without any alteration of its primitive
form : some subterraneous production of electricity seemed
 to him to explain the facts ; and on subjecting some sulphu-
rets to the action of the pile, they exhibited the same meta
morphose.
    We know that of all the phaenomena of the mineral king-

 from the atmosphere     ; and every thing is so new on the sub
ject, that it ought not    to excite our astonishment that various
 explanations are still sought after.
    We alluded last year to the remark of M. Vauquelin, that
 several   metallic substances,     very similar to atmospheric
 stones, are evaporated from lofty furnaces.
    M. Seguin has endeavoured to collect all the analogous
 facts known in chemistry or medicine, such as the delete
 rious vapours of lead, mercury, the phaenomena of salts
 diffused in air, vapour, rain-water, &c. ; all the metallic or
 other   substances   which hydrogen gas can dissolve ; the
 quantity of odours, and of miasmata, not recognisable
 by our eudiometers.          From all these M. Seguin easily
 proves that the composition of the atmosphere is very little
 known to us, and that several of its vapours being very light
 may be accumulated in the upper regions ; but the difficulty
 of uniting a sufficient quantity before their falling down, in
 order to form aerolites of the size generally observed, re
 mains unsolved.
    M. Theodore de Saussure has presented a very interesting
 analysis of alcohol and sulphuric ether.           He operated by
 combustion, both with alcohol by itself and in the state
 of vapour: hy means of decomposition by simple heat, he
 determined the quantity of water and of carbonic acid pro
 duced, as w ell as the respective quantities of their elements
in oxygen, carbon, and water: finally, he has drawn a mean
result from all his operations, and concluded the composi
 tion of alcohol to be as follows :
                  Carbon         -     -      0-4565
                  Oxygen        -      -      0-3785

                       And    that of ether :
                  Carbon         -     -      0-583
                  Hydrogen       -     -      0-2214
                  Oxygen         -     -      0-1966
                                              1-0000
    Finally, he shows that these two analyses agree with the
quantity of ether furnished by a given quantity of alcohol,
and by the analysis of what remains after etherification.

   This memoir, more precious on account of       the new che
mical  methods   which  it has   suggested  than   by its direct
results, also contains several interesting remarks ; and
among others this particular one, that vapours are heavier
in proportion as the liquids they are produced from are
more volatile.
   The theory of sulphuric ether formerly given by Fourcory
and Vauquelin is therefore confirmed in this respect, that
the acid tonus no part of the composition of I his liquid.
   But this is not the case with respect to ethers formed by
the action of the volatile acids upon alcohol : the acid enters
into the combination, either completely formed, or by means
of its elements. M. Thenard had proved this last year, with
respect to the nitric ether.    He afterwards extended his in
quiries to the muriatic and acetic ethers, and showed that
acid is to be met with in them, either from the effects of
time or of combustion, although it is in these cases so welb
disguised, that neither the alkalis nor the other known re
agents do separate it from them at their first formation.
In these cases, Does it exist in an entire state, or decom
posed in its elements ? This question is of difficult solution,
notwithstanding its interesting nature, so far as the muriatic
acid is in question. M. Boulay, however, having succeeded
after an interval of time in absorbing the muriatic ether by
ammonia, and having distinctly and separately extracted al
cohol and muriate of ammonia, thinks that the acid and
the alcohol were simply combined together ; and he extends
this conclusion to the nitric and acetic ethers.
   M. Boulay has also succeeded in preparing phosphoric
ether, the theory of which brings us back to that of the
sulphuric ether.
   M. Vauquelin continues his important analysis of the
different kinds of iron, and his inquiries into the ingredients
which occasion the bad qualities of some of them.
   One kind of iron, which broke when hot in the hands of
some workmen, while in the hands of others it was passable,
only yielded one-six- hundredth part of phosphorus, and a
four-hundredth part of chrome. Another kind of iron which
crumbled under the hammer at a white heat, and which pre
sented a grain like that of steel, without its hardness, con
tained one three-hundredth part of arsenic and one hun
dredth part of phosphorus.
   M. Vauquelin is at present occupied with inquiring by
what means we may free iron from principles of which
sueh a small quantity alters the quality of the metal.
                                                       M. Gay-

                   French Nationab Institute.
   M.   Gay-Lussac has undertaken a laborious investigation,
with a view of appreciating the action of the fire upon ths
different sulphates and sutphurets, and in order to determine
the circumstances in which the sulphuric acid is found com
pletely formed or decomposed.          He found that this decom
position   is  effected  in   the metallic sulphates, in which the
acid is more tenaciously retained, and that there then pass
over sulphurous acid and oxygen ; hut this last phaenomenon
does not take place where the acid is feebly condensed.
    As to the sulphurets, they always give sulphurous acid at
a very high temperature; but at a low temperature they
give more sulphuric acid, as the oxide of their metal hag
more affinity for it. The earthy sulphates and that of am
monia always admit of their acid being decomposed ; but
those of the fixed alkalis only do so when their acid is in
excess.     The acid alone is very well decomposed by simple
heat.    From these inquiries results the analysis of the two
acids of sulphur; 100 parts of this combustible take 50*61
of oxygen before being converted into sulphurous acid, and
85-70 before becoming sulphuric acid.
    We have also, as one of the above results, an explanation of
several complex chemical phaenomena, and particularly those
which take place at the manufacture of sulphuric acid by the
combustion of sulphur in leaden chambers.            Sulphur alone
would give sulphurous acid only; but the nitre which we
burn with, and the atmospheric air admitted, furnish the su
perabundant oxygen. Water is a necessary intermedium for
uniting the oxygen of the air to sulphurous acid, as M. Four-
croy long ago announced.
    M. de Morveau has made some curious experiments upon
the time necessary for the inflammation of a given mass of
gunpowder, and the effects which result from it. Coarse
powder inflames more speedily than fine. The ordinary
working of a gun requires that the ball should run freely in
to the piece, anJ the space required for this purpose greatly
diminishes the strength of the powder.            But it is singular
that by diminishing this interval of room in a gunpowder
proof, and making the ball       fit  very accurately,a  still greater
loss takes place; probably becaue the explosion,          by momen
tarily compressing the globe in the longitudinal direction,
 dilatedit   in the transverse direction; and in this case there
 was too violent  a     friction of bronze against bronze.      Expe
 rience having shown that leaden bullets pressed into carbines
 have not this fault, M. de Morveau tried bullets made cy
 lindrical behind, and furnished with     a   leaden ring, which he
                                                               found.

     Count Rumford has communicated some curious experi
ments relative to the general action of affinities, and which
prove that two liquids may continue a long time superposed
without being completely mixed, although predisposed            by
nature.      A saturated solution of sea salt was covered with
distilled water : a drop of oil of rosemary heavier than fresh,
and lighter than salt water, kept between both, and served as
 an index for the progress of the mixture, ascending about
two or three lines per diem.

All persons who          possess ewes of pure Merino race, and
 are desirous   of increasing their stock, are requested to apply
 to Sir Joseph Banks, who has received the king's commands
 to distribute a considerable flock, newly imported from
  Spain, among such persons as are most likely to preserve
  them free from all admixture, and to improve their form by
 judiciously matching them in breeding       ; giving a due prefe *
  rence to those who have manifested their approbation of this
  kind of stock, by having already provided themselves with
  the breed, but who have not yet obtained a sufficient in
  crease to be able to supply the wants of their neighbours
  who wish to improve their British wools by the use of this
  valuable cross.
      Letters addressed to Sir Joseph Banks, Soho-Square,
  London, will be duly attended to. He requests to be cor
  rectly informed of the actual number of pure Merino ewes,
  ewe tegs, and ewe lambs, each applicant is now in posses
  sion ot, and of the source from whence the breed was ori
  ginally procured.
      Sir Joseph Banks will be thankful to gentlemen who will
  inform him what was the average weight of the pure Me
  rino fleeces of the clips of 1808 and 1809, and what price
  per pound they were sold for, with the name of the pur
  chaser.

 this by squeezing out part of the moisture from the moss,
and laying courses of it about three inches thick, interposed
with other courses of the trees, (previously shortened m
their branches and roots,) stratum super stratum, until the
box is filled, when the whole must be trodden down, and
the lid properly secured. The trees will need no care even
during a voyage of ten or twelve months ; the moss being
wonderfully retentive of moisture, and seeming to possess an
anti-septic property which totally prevents fermentation or
putrefaction from taking place; and, in fact, vegetation ac
tually proceeds during the time the trees remain so inclosed ;
shoots being formed both from their branches and roots,
which, however, arc blanched and tender, for want of light
and air ; and, in consequence, the trees, on being planted,
require to be gradually inured to the open air. This moss
is very common in most parts of Europe and America,
which renders this application of it more facile, and the dis
covery more important.

 1 8th of April last, tend to elucidate the state or the current
in the Atlantic Ocean, I inclose them to you, with a request
that you will be pleased to make the circumstance known to
the lords commissioners of the admiralty.
    " The bottle appears to have been thrown overboard by
the Princess Elizabeth packet, going to the Brazils, on the
6th of September 1808, in lat. 14.4.5, and long. 25, and it
must have been carried about 2020 miles in 224 days, which
gives nine miles per day on a west course.

    Without being profoundly skilled in subjects of this na
ture, we should apprehend that the rotatory motion of the
earth, from west to east, will, where local circumstances do
 rot operate, necessarilv produce a Waring of the fluid ele
ment in a contrary direction, and occasion the general ten
 dency of currents to be from east to west. To- this it may

            Hence the nearer the time of the moon's change, full
      and quarters, is to midnight, (that is within two hours before
      or after midnight) the more fair will the weather for that
      quarter be in summer— but the nearer to noon the less fair.
            "
            Also the moon's full, change, and quarters happening
      during six of the afternoon hours, viz. from 4 to 10, may be
      followed by fair weather, but this is mostly dependent on the
      Wind. The same changes during all the hours after midnight
      except the two first, are unfavourable to fair weather— -The

stone rock, easily excavated, and forming excellent cellars. The buildings are chiefly
of brick, and commonly three or four stories high. Tiie streets are, in general, nar
row. The neighbourhood produces an nmple supply of coal, which                the only fuel used is
in the town. The Trent, a fine navigable river, flows, from West to East, within a
mile of the town      ;   subiect to very sudden swells, which sometimes produce floods
                          it     is
that inundate the meadow ground between the river and the town, the atmosphera
must be, an some measure, influenced by the evaporation that follows, as well as by tha
dense hnze over the river in summer evenings, and the thick fogs of winter.
   The barometer, thermometer, and pluviameter(or rain-gauge), are new instrument*^
made by Jones, of Holborn. The thermometer, on Fahrenheit's scale,                   placed out              is
side a window, racing the West, in the centre of the town, but in a situation protected
from currents of air, or reflected heat. The observations were made daily, at A.M.                                 8
9  P.M. and  1
             1    P.M. and from them the averages are deduced. The barometer (of the
portable kind)      firmly fixed to a standard wall over a stair-case, on a level of 130 feet
                    is
above the sea. The observations were taken daily at              P.M. and from these the mean
                                                                                2

above the level of the sea, where                 it is
                                         cannot be affected by buildings, or gusts of wind.
The observations are taken at the end of each month. The observations on the wind
 were made at      A.M.

 XXIII.        Meteorological Observalions on a Thunder Storm ;
     with    some      Remarks on Medical Electricity.             By Mr.
     Cornelius Varley.
                                To  Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir,    J  take the liberty of sending you a description of a
 distant thunder storm*, the electrical phenomena of which
 were so distinctly visible as to leave no doubt on my mind
 of the exclusive agency of one electric fluid. (See Plate VI).
     Observing it to lighten one evening frequently without
 hearing thunder, I went into the fields, and, looking north
ward, saw the horizon lined with clouds, there being none
over head except a few very small ones proceeding in that
 direction.         These were upon a level with the lower cloud ;
 for they joined it afterward —a circumstance which serves to
 prove that a diminution was taking place in the volume of
 the atmosphere, for otherw ise they could not have overtaken
 the storm, being at first too far off to be affected by any
 electrical attraction. At the commencement of the storm it,
 lightened in various parts of the clouds, but more frequently
 in one place.          Soon after this the clouds seemed'united in
 one, and the place of the lightning became stationary,-
  (where in the drawing the light cloud rs placed,) and here
 commenced the effect which seemed distinctly to show in,
 what manner the electric fluid is conducted from the upper .
 regions to the earth.
   , At first a small round cloud (about an eighth part of that
 represented) appeared behind the long dark cloud, and partly
 seen above it.           In this cloud it frequently lightened ; and
just    after     the   light was extinguished, the electric sparks
struck     to   the   earth  from the under surface of the long black
cloud.      This     double   transmission was many times repeated,
till  at  length     the   lower  cloud ceased to give sparks to the_
earth    at the    spot immediately under the higher cloud, though
it   was   still  frequently receiving them from it. I then found,
by casting my eye along the lower cloud, that every charge
from the upper one travelled about four miles westward
along the lower cloud, and then darted to the earth.                         I
knew it travelled in this manner by frequently seeing it jump
over one and sometimes over two chasms in the lower cloud
in its passage to the western end. The time it took to travel
the length above mentioned, was while I could count 20 or
30 — but twice I counted 60 before it struck the earth.
    • This is commonly called summer lightning, i. t. there is fine weather
•ver head, and the lightning is so far off that the thunder cannot be heard.
     Vol. 34. No.        137. Sept.   1809.             L           During

162   Meteorological        Observations on a Thunder Storm.
  During the time of these observations, the higher cloud,
which supplied so much electricity, was not diminished in
the least. On the contrary, it continued to enlarge in its
dimensions, and chiefly towards the wind, as may be seen
by its overhanging in the sketch.
   Now the quantity of electricity supplied by this cloud
continually during an hour, was probably 50 times as much
as it could possibly contain. The question then is : Where
did it come from ? The increasing of the cloud furnishes
an answer to this question ; for it could not increase without
the addition of vapour, and that addition could come only
from the atmosphere. This was proved by the manner and
place of increase, which was at the top, and at the most
prominent parts facing the wind. That vapour, being trans
parent, had the highest charge of electricity.            The upper
cloud (though positive      to the  under)    was  minus to that va
pour, and silently attracting     from   it the superabundant elec
tricity, which   it gave   off visibly  to  the under cloud, which
was still less charged,     and   which    was  kept so by the earth
(which may      be   considered    as quite negative) immediately
drawing away that charge in sparks.
    Now it is evident by this progress of the electric fluid to
the earth, that the electrified vapour must have been con
densed to the smaller compass of the cloud, and have been
deposited on its surface, occasioning that very great increase
 of cloud. This seems to show that a storm of lightning
 will always occasion a current of wind from the external re
 gions towards itself; and hence a dead calm preceding a
 storm, and the fall of the barometer, as this is the focus of
 condensation.
    I have since repeatedly, in stormy weather, seen clouds,
 under this effect of increase, sometimes increasing at one
 end, and diminishing at the other by slow rain, when near
 a mountain ; but i have seldom seen the theoretic form           (if
I   may be allowed the expression) so evident (except among
 mountains, where          itunlimited, but the lightning rarely
                                is
 seen,)   asin the  case   Ihave  stated
                                       :     nor can this conforma
 tion ever be seen but when the barometer        is   low or falling.
    The lower cloud was three or four times as long, in pro
                     represented in the drawing,      in  which
                      is                                         it

 necessarily shortened for the convenience of exhibiting both
 of its ends.
    Before concluding,      I beg leave to add   a  few thoughts on
 the medical action of electricity.
     First, think that electricity entering the body
         I                                                 bya  good
  conductor in contact, and going out       by   .another in contact,
                                                            produces

                           On dividing Instruments.                              16$
produces the smallest effect of all, and does but little good
or harm.
   Secondly, If it enters the body by a conductor in contact,
and has to escape in the manner of perspiration, a strong
effect is produced ; and this may be confined to one place,
and of course be rendered more powerful by the attracting
points.
   Thirdly, An effect equally strong, but quite the reverse
of the last, will be produced by placing the patient insulated
in contact with the negative conductor, and in a damp at
mosphere*.      By this mode of operating the effect takes
place all over his body : but      instead of this, you bring
                                                  if,                             a
wet sponge, connected with the earth, near the part affected,
it will be confined to that place.
   In the former case the electricity acts       increasing the  by
natural perspirations, but in the latter, by strongly checking
it, or occasioning an absorption of moisture.
I    think the failures in medical electricity have been where
this last application was wanted for electricity alone, ap
                                                        ;

                                    a
which effect the last method enables you to reverse.

    Having now completed the two first sections of my me
thod of dividing ; namely, the first, which consists of
making 256 small round dots ; and the second, in finding
the errors of those dots, and forming them into a table; — I
come now to the third and last part, which consists in
using the erroneous dots in comparison with the tabulated
errors, so as ultimately to make from them the true di
visions.
    It will here be necessary to complete the description of
the remaining part of the apparatus.        And first, a little in
strument which I denominate a subdividing sector presents
itself to notice.   From all that has hitherto been said, it
must have been supposed that the roller itself will point out,
upon the limb of the instrument to he divided, spaces cor
responding towfhers previously divided upon itself, as was
done in setting off the 256 points : but, to obviate the diffi
culty of dividing the roller with sufficient exactness, re
course was had to this sector; which also serves the equally
important purpose of reducing the bisectional points to the
usual division of the circle.      This sector is represented in
half dimensions by Fig. 5: it is formed of thin brass, and
centred upon the axis at A, in contact with the upper sur
face of the roller; it is capable of being moved round by
hand ; but, by its friction upon the axis and its pressure
upon the roller, it is sufficiently prevented from being dis
turbed by accident.     An internal frame BB, to which the
arc CC is attached, moves freely in the outer one, and by
 a spring D is pushed outwards, while the screw E, whose
point touches the frame B, confines the arc to its proper
radius. The arc of this sector is of about four times greater
                                                                    '
 radius than the roller, and upon it are divided the spaces
 which must be transferred to the instrument, as represented
 on a magnified scale by Fig. 4. Now, the angle of one
 of the spaces of the circle will be measured by sixteen times
 its angular value upon the sectorial arc, or 22° 30'; but
 this does not represent any number of equ'al parts upon the
 instrument, whose, subdivisions are to be -5' each; for.
 lc24'22"5
            is exactly 1 6-J-ths, therefore so many divisions are
 •xactly equal to a mean space between the dots whose er
 rors have been tabulated. Let, therefore, the arc of the
 sector be divided into 1 6 spaces of 1° 2f/ each, and let a
 similar space at each end be subdivided into eight parts of
  lo' each, as in Fig. 4; we shall then have a scale which
 furnishes the means for making the true divisions, and an
 immediate examination at every bisectional point.
                                                             I have

                        On dividing Instruments.                         1 65
   I  have always divided the sector from the engine, because
that is the readiest method, and inferior to none in point of
accuracy, where the radius is very short ; but, as it is more
liable than any other to centrical error, the adjustment of
the arc by the screw E becomes necessary : by that adjust
ment, also, any undue run in the action of the roller may
be reduced to an insensible quantity *.
    When the utmost degree of accuracy is required, I give
the preference to dividing by lines, because they are made
with a less forcible effort than dots are ; and also because,
if any small defect in rrre"*contexture of the metal causes the
cutter to deviate, it will, after passing the defective part,
proceed again in its proper course, and a partial crooked
ness in the line will be the only consequence ; whereas a
dot, under similar circumstances, would be altogether dis
placed. But, on the other hand, where accuracy has been
out of the question, and only neatness required, I have used
dots ; and I have done so, because I know that when a dot
and the wire which is to bisect it are in due proportion to
each other, (the wire covering about two-thirds of the dot,)
the nicest comparison possible may be obtained.            It may
be further observed, that division by lines is complete in
itself; whereas that by dots requires lines to distinguish
their value.
    Oh the upper side of Fig. l . is represented the apparatus
 for cutting the divisions.    It consists of three pieces           JKL,
jointed together so as   to give to the cutter an easy motion
 for drawing lines directly radiating from the centre, but in
flexible with respect to lateral pressure ; dd are its handles.
The cutting point is hidden below the microscope H ; it is
 of a conical form, and were it used as a dotting point, it
 would make a puncture of ah elliptical shape, whose longer
 diameter would point towards the centre. This beautiful
 contrivance, now well known, we owe to the ingenuity of
 the late Mr. Hindley of York ; it was borrowed by Mr.
 Ramsden       and applied with the best effect to his dividing
                  j-j
 engine.
  It   might have been mentioned sooner, that in the instance
 which  f  have selected as an example of my dividing,         the
 operation  took  place when    the season  of  the year,  and the
 smoke of London, had reduced the day to scarcely six hours
 of effective light; and rather than confine my labours

 within such narrow limits, I determined to 'shut out tha
day-light altogether. Fig. 7. shows the construction of the
 lanterns which I used.            A very small wick gave sufficient
light, when kept from diverging by a convex lens ; while
the inclining nossel was directed down exactly upon the part
looked at, and the light, having also passed through a thin
 slice of ivory, was divested of all glare. I enter into this
 description, because, I think, I never saw my work better,
nor entirely to so much advantage as in this instance;
owing, perhaps, to the surrounding darkness allowing the
pupil of the eye to keep itself more expanded, than when
indirect rays are suffered to enter it. The heat from a pair
of   these lanterns was very inconsiderable,               and chiefly con
ducted along       with    the   smoke    up the  reclining chimney.
     Previous to cutting the divisions, the parts now described
must be adjusted. The cutting apparatus must be placed
with the dividing point exactly at the place where the first
line is intended to be drawn, and clamped, so that the ad
justing screw may be able to run it through a whole inter-
 val. The microscope H must be firmly fixed by its two
pillars bb to the main frame, with its micrometer head at
 zero; and with its only wire in the line of the radius, bi
 secting the first of the 256 dots. And it should be observed,
 that the cutting frame and this must not vary respecting
 each other, during the time that the divisions are cut ; for
 any motion that took place in either would go undiminished
 to the account of error.            The microscope I is also fastened
 to the main frame; but it is only required to keep its posi
 tion unvaried, while the divisions of the sector pass once
 under its notice ; for it must have its wire adjusted afresh
 to these divisions at every distinct course. The microscope
  I has two wires, crossing each other at an angle of about
 40°; and these are to be placed so as to make equal angles
 with the divisions of the sector, which are not dots, Dut
 lines.     The sectorial arc must also be adjusted to its proper
 radius by the screw E, Fig. 5 ; i. e. while the main frame
 has been carried along the circle through a mean interval
 shown by H, the sector must have moved through exactly
  I6|ths of its divisions, as indicated by I*.
                                                                       Things
    • For the sake of simplicity, the account of the
                                                      process is carried on as if
 the roller measured the mean interval without error : But it was said
 (page 84) that the roller, in a continued motion quite round the circle, would
 in some part of its course err by SO" or more; therefore, when that is the
 case, an extreme run of the roller cannot agree with a mean interval of the
                    30"

    Things being in this position ; after having given the
parts time to settle, and having also sufficiently proved the
permanence of the micrometer H and the cutting frame
with respect to each other, the first division may be made;
then, by means of the screw for slow motion, carry the
apparatus forward, until the next line upon the sector comes
to the cross wires of I ; you then cut another division, and
thus proceed until the 16th division is cut, = 1° 2f/ : Nov
the apparatus wants to be carried further, to the amount of
{-ths of a division, before an interval is complete ; but at
this last point no division is to be made ; we are here only
to compare the division on the sector with the correspond
ing dot upon the instrument.               This interval, however,
upon the circle will not be exactly measured by the corre
sponding line of the sector, which has been adjusted to the
mean interval, for the situation of the dot l°-4 is too far
back, as appears by the table of real errors, by — 4*8 divi
sions of the micrometer head.            The range of the screw for
slow motion must now be restored, the cross wires of H
set back to — 4-8 divisions, and the sector moved back by
hand, but not to the division O where it began before ; for,
as it left off in the first interval at £ths of a division, it has
to go forwards j-th more before it will arrive at the spot
 where the 1 7th division of the instrument 1° 25' is to be
 made, so that in this second course it must begin at -fth
 short of 0. Go through this interval as before, making a
 division upon the circle at every one of the 16 great divi
 sions of the sector ; and H should now reach the third dot,
 allowing for a tabular error of — 10*2 when the division -f ths
of the sector reaches the cross wires of I. It would be te
dious to lead the reader through all the variety of the sector,
which consists of eight courses ; and it may be sufficient to
observe, that at the commencement of every course, it must
be put back to the same fraction of a division which ter
minated its former one ; and that the wire of the micro
meter H must always be set to the tabular error belonging
 to every dot. when we end one interval and begin another.
The eight courses of the sector will have carried us through
•ilyd part of the circle, 11° 15', and during this time, the
roller will have proceeded through half a revolution ; for
its close contact with the limb of the circle does noj allow
•n some intervals amount to double that quantity.      It therefore become*
 matter of prudent precaution to examine every interval previous to making
 rhe divisions; and, where necessary, to adjust the sector, so that its arc
 may exactly measure the corresponding interval as corrected by the tabu
lated errors.
                                     L*                                   it

it to return with the sector when the latter is set back at
every course.    Having in this manner proceeded, from one
interval to another, through the whole circle, the micro
meter at last will be found with its wire, at zero, on the
dot from which it set out ; and the sector, with its I6th
division, coinciding with the wires of its microscope.
   Having now given a faithful detail of every part of the
process of dividing this circle, I wish to remind the reader
that, by verification and correction at every interval, any
erroneous action of the' roller is prevented from extending
its influence to any distant interval.  It will be further ob
served, that the subdividing sector magnifies the work ; that
by means of its adjustable arc, it makes the run of the roller
measure its corresponding intervals' upon the circle ; and,
without foreign aid, furnishes the means of reducing the
bisectional intervals to the usual division of the circle.
Furthermore, the motion of the wire of the micrometer H,
according to the divisions of. its head and corresponding
table of errors, furnishes the means of prosecuting the work
with nearly the same certainty of success, as could have
happened, had the 256 points been (which in practice is
quite impossible) in their true places.
   Now, the whole of my method of dividing being per
formed by taking short measures with instruments -which
cannot themselves err in any sensible degree, and, inas
                           are taken, not by the hand, but by
much^ those measures
vision, and the whole performed by only looking at the
work, the eye must be charged with all the errors that are
committed until we come to cut the divisions ; and, as in
this last' operation the hand has no more to do than to guide
an apparatus so perfect in itself, that it cannot be easily
made to deviate from' its proper course, I would wish to
distinguish it from the other methods by denominating                          it,
dividing       by
              the eye*.

     I    must here remark,   that Smeaton has represented the greatest   degree

works, he rendered sensible to the ^Jjjth part of an inch.     Were materials
infinitely hard, no bounds could be set to the precision of contact; but
taking things as they are, the different degrees of hardness in matter, may
be considered as kind of magnifying power to the touch, which may not

centesimal division of the quadrant, as now recommended
and used in France, we shall have no difficulty.      The 100°
ef the quadrant may be conveniently subdivided into 10
each, making 4000 divisions in the whole round. The 256
bisectional intervals, the two tables of errors, and the man
ner of proceeding and acting upon them, will be exactly the
same as before, until we come to cut the divisions      and for
                                                              ;

and just so many will be equivalent to one of the intervals
of the circle. The value of one of the great divisions of the
sector will be lp 26' 24", and that of the £th parts, which
are to be annexed to the right and left as before, will be
10/ 48", therefore divisible        by
                                     the engine.     Should any

for the sake of adjustment. The roller may be divided into
                                                         32 parts,

                   On dividing Instruments.               17 1
32 parts, each of which when transferred to the bar will
give intervals of 0-4 of an inch each : the angle of the sub
dividing sector should of course be 11° 15', and subdivided'
into four parts, which will divide the inch into tenths:
the surface may also receive other lines, with subdivisions
suited to the different purposes for which it may be wanted.
The revolutions of the roller and its -fa parts must be
dotted upon the bar; taking care, by sizing the roller, to
come as near the true standard measure as possible : when
this is done, compare the extent of the greater bisectional
number that is contained in the length ; i. e. 1 28 intervals
of 51*2 inches, with the standard measure; noting the dif
ference as indicated by the micrometer heads : the ex
amination and construction of the table of errors may then
be conducted just as was done for the circle.
     Being now ready for the performance of its work, the
 6cale to be divided must be laid alongside of the bar, and
 the true divisions must be cut upon it by an appeal, as be
 fore, to the erroneous dots on the bar, corrected by a cor
 responding table of errors. The apparatus, remaining en
 tire in the possession of the workman, with its primitive
 dots, the table of errors, &c, is ready for dividing another
 standard, which will be precisely similar to others that have
 been, or may be, divided from it. It may be considered,
 indeed, as a kind of engine ; and, as it is not vitiated by
 the coarse operation of racking with a screw, but perform
 ed by only looking at the work, the method will com
 mand about three times the accuracy that can be derived
 from the usual straight-line dividing engine.     Should it be
  asked, if an engine thus appointed would succeed for di
  viding circles ? I answer, Yes ; but I would not recom
 mend it; because, beyond a certain extent of radius, it is
  not necessary ; for the errors, which would be introduced
  into the work by the violence of racking a large wheel, are
 sufficiently reduced by the comparative shortness of the
  radius of such instruments as we divide by that method :
  and, what is still more to the purpose, the dividing engine
  is four times more expeditious, and bears rough usage bet
  ter.   I cannot quit the subject of dividing straight lines
  without observing, that I never had my apparatus complete.
  The standard which I made for sir George Sbuckburg Eve
   lyn in 1 796, was done by a mere make-shift contrivance,
  upon the principle of dividing by the eye ; how I succeed
   ed may be seen in Sir George's papers on Weights and
   Measures (Philosophical Transactions for 1 798).     I made
   a second, some years after, for professor Pictet of Geneva,
                                                         which

 which    became    the subject of comparison with the new
 measure    of France, before   the National Institute ; and their
 report, drawn up by Mr. Pictet, has been ably re-stated
 and corrected by Dr. Young, as published in the Journals
 of the Royal Institution. I made a third for the magis
 trates of Aberdeen.      I notice the two latter, principally to
give myself an opportunity of saying that, if those three
 scales were to be compared together, notwithstanding they
were divided at distant periods of time, and at different
 seasons of the year, they would be found to agree with
each other, as nearly as the different parts of the same scale
agree.
     I hope  I may here be allowed to allude to an inadver
tency which has been committed in the paper mentioned
above ; and which sir George intended to have corrected,
had he lived to conclude his useful endeavours to harmonize
the discordant weights and measures of this country.          The
instruments which he has brought into comparison are, his
own five-feet standard measure and equatorial; general
Roy's forty-two inch scale ; the standard of Mr. Aubert ;
and that of the Royal Society.           The inadvertency is this :
in his equatorial, and the standard of the Royal Society,
he has charged the error of the most erroneous extent,
when compared with the mean extent, alike to both divi
sions; i. e. he has supposed one of the divisions, which bound
the erroneous extent, to be too much to the right, and the
othef too much to the left, and that by equal quantities.
This is certainly a good-natured way of stating the errors
of work ; and perhaps not unjustly so, where the worst
part has been selected ; but in the other three instances,
namely, in general Roy's, Mr. Aubert's, and his own
standard, he has charged the whole error of the most er
roneous extent to one of the bounding lines.
    I was well confirmed in my high opinion of the general
accuracy of Bird's dividing, when, last winter*,           I mea
sured the chords of many arcs of the Greenwich quadrant :
that instrument has indeed suffered both from a change in
its figure, and from the wearing of its centre; but the
graduation, considering the time when it was done, I found
to be very good.       Sir George in his paper upon the Equa
torial (Philosophical Transactions for 1793), after some
compliments paid to the divider of his instrument, says,
"   The late Mr. John Bird seems to have admitted a proba
ble discrepancy in the divisions of his eight-feet quadrant
                 * This paper was written in June 1808.
                                                        amounting

                      On dividing Instruments.                         173
amounting to 3";" and he refers to Bird on the construc
tion of the Greenwich quadrant. This quantity being three
times as great as any errors that I met with, I was lately
induced to inquire how the matter stood. Bird, in the
paper referred to, says,
                                "  In dividing this instrument I
never met with an inequality that exceeded one second.                    I
will suppose that in the 90 arch this error lay towards the
left hand, and in the 96 arch that it lay towards the right,
it will cause a difference between the two arches of two
seconds; and if an error of one second be allowed to the
observer in reading off his observation, the whole amount
is no more than three seconds, which is agreeable to what
I  have heard, &c."         Sir George's examination of his own
equatorial     furnishes  me  with the means of a direct com
parison   :  in  his account   of the declination circle, we find
an error -f- 2"*35, and another — l"'5 ; to these add an
error of half a second in each, for reading off, which sir
George also admits ; we shall then have a discrepancy of
4"'85 ; but as the errors of reading off are not errors of
division, let them be discharged from both, and the errors
will then stand, — for the quadrant 2", and for the circle
3"' 85. As the radius of the former, however, is four times
greater than that of the latter, it will appear, by this mode
of trial, that the equatorial is rather more than twice as ac
curately divided as the quadrant.           In doing justice to Bird
in this instance, I have only done as I would be done bv ;
for, should any future writer set me back a century on the
chronological scale of progressive improvement, I hope
 some one will be found to restore me to my proper niche,
I  now subjoin a re- statement of the greatest error of each
 of the instruments that are brought into comparison by sir
 George, after having reduced them all by one rule ; viz.
allowing each of the two points which bound the most er
roneous extent to divide the apparent error equally between
them.       They are expressed in parts of an inch, and follow
each other in the order of their accuracy.

 on the result of each respective examination, as here pre*
 sen ted.  there could have been more than one opinion, it
 would not have appeared here.       I am further prompted to
 add, that the above comparative view presents one circum
 stance to our notice, which cannot do less than gratify
 every individual who is at all conversant in there matters ;
 I mean, the high rank which general Roy's scale takes in
 the list ; that scale having been made the agent in mea
suring the base line of our national trigonometrical survey.
    To return, finally, to the dividing of circles ; I must
state, as matter of precaution, that great care should be
taken during the turning of the outer edge, to have the
circle of the same temperature ; for one part may be ex
 panded by heat, or contracted by cold, so much more than
another, as to cause the numbers in the tables of errors to
be inconveniently large. A night is not more than suffi
cient for allowing the whole to take the same temperature,
after having been handled by the workmen; and the finish
ing touch should be given within a short space of time.
But, if the effects of temperature are to be regarded in
turning a circle, it is of tenfold more importance to attend
to this circumstance, while the examination of the larger
arcs of the instrument is carried on ; for it is absolutely
necessary    that, during this time, the whole circle should
be of the same heat exactly. Few workmen are sufficiently
aware of this : they generally suppose the expansion of
metals to be a trifle which need not be regarded in practice ;
and wonder how the parts of a circle can be differently
heated without taking pains to make it so.      One degree of
Fahrenheit's thermometer indicates so small a portion of
heat that, in such places as workmen are usually obliged
to do their business in, it is not very easy to have three
thermometers attached to different parts of a large instru
ment, showing an equality of temperature within that
quantity : yet so necessary is correctness in this respect,
that if a circle has the vertex one degree warmer than its
opposite, and if this difference of temperature be regularly
distributed from top to bottom, the uper semi-circle will
actually exceed the lower by 2": and, if such should hap
pen to be the case while the examination of the first dot of
the third quadrant is made, the regularity of the whole
operation would thereby be destroyed.
    It may not be improper to remark, that dividing by the
eye does not require a more expensive apparatus than the
operation of dividing by hand ; and, indeed, less so when
the scale of inches is deemed necessary. The method by
                                                   adjustment

                 On dividing Instruments.                175
adjustment is still more expensive, requiring whatever tools
Bird's method requires, and, in addition    to these, a frame
and microscopes, somewhat similar to those for dividing
by the eye.
    It is somewhat more difficult to give a comparative esti
mate of the time which the different methods of dividing
require.  I    know that thirteen days of eight hours each are
well employed in dividing such a circle by my method ;
about fifty-two days would be consumed in doing the same
thing by Bird's method ; and I think I cannot err much
when I state the method by adjustment, supposing every
dot to be tried, and that two-thirds of them want adjusting,
to require about one hundred and fifty of such days.
    The oeconomy of time (setting aside the decided means
of accuracy) which the above estimate of its application
offers to view, will, I think, be considered of no little
moment. By the rising artist who may aspire at excellence,
it will at least, and I should hope, with gratitude, be felt
in the abbreviation of his labours. To me, indeed, the
means of effecting this became indispensable; and it has not
 been without a sufficient sense of its necessity, that I have
 been urged to the progressive improvement and completion
 of these means, as now described. It it but little that a
 man can perform with his own hands alone ; nor is it on
 all occasions, even in frames of firmer texture than my
 own, that he can decisively command their adequate, un
 erring, use. And I must confess that I never could recon
 cile it to what I hold as due to myself, as well as to a soli
 citous regard for the most accurate cultivation of the science
 of astronomy, to commit to others an operation requiring
 such various and delicate attentions, as the division of my
 instruments.
     That my attentions on this head have not failed to pro
 cure for me the notice and patronage of men whose appro
 bation makes, with me, no inconsiderable part of my re
 ward, I have to reflect on with gratitude and pleasure : and
 as I look with confidence to the continuance of that pa
 tronage so long as the powers of execution shall give me
 the inclination to solicit  it,   Tcannot entertaina    motive
  which might go to extinguish the more liberal wish of
  pointing out to future ingenuity shorter road to eminence

  sufficiently gratified   the idea of having, in the present
  communication, contributed to facilitate the operations,
  and to aid the progress of art (as far as the limited power*

XXV. Report made to the Institute on two Memoirs of*
   M. Gratien Lepere, Engineer of the Imperial Roads
   and Bridges,     on natural       and artificial Puzzolano.        By
   M. Chaptal*.
Every      person is acquainted with the purposes to which
puzzolano is applied in buildings under water.                 The pro
perty possessed by this volcanic substance of speedily be
coming hard when mixed with sour lime, in the compo
sition of cements for hydraulic purposes, has rendered it a
most important article; but the difficulty of procuring it
from Italy while the navigation of the seas is interrupted,
has made it extremely scarce and dear.                    Attempts have
therefore frequently been         made     to  procure   a substitute for
puzzolano, in substances          which    are  to  be procured in ajl
countries and at     a low   price.
    It seems, therefore, an interesting subject to collect the
various processes which have been employed for adapting;
different mineral substances to the uses of puzzolano, ana
with this view I have drawn up the present extract of
M.Lepere's' two memoirs, without binding myself to follow
his order.
    A substitute for puzzolano may be procured in three
ways. 1st, By employing the remains of the extinguished
volcanoes which almost all countries produce.                  2dly, By
substituting some other volcanic products for puzzolano.
3dly, By giving to certain mineral substances, by calcina
tion, all the properties of these volcanic productions.
    Messrs. Desmarets and Faujas St. Fpnd long ago made
known some strata of good puzzolano in the volcanoes of
Auvergne and Vivarai§.            I also pointed out this substance
in the volcanoes which separate Lodeve from Bedarieux, in
the depart ment of the Herault, and it has been employed
with success in the construction of bridges ancl other hy
draulic buildings.
    We may also find a substitute for puzzolano in other
volcanic products, such as basalt, pumice stones carefully
pounded, &c.
    In 1787 M. Guyton de Morveau sent to M. de Cessart,
at Cherbourg, some calcined basalts from the extinguished
volcano of Drevin, in the department of the Var and,
Loire. The latter proved by conclusive experiments, that
they might be employed with great advantage in buildings
mider w ater.
   The Dutch terrass is a kind of pumice stone brought
               * From   Annates  de Chimie, tome lxiv. p. 273.
                                                                    from

                    On natural and artificial Puzzolano.                       179
from Bonn and Andernach. At Dordrecht, al the mouths of
the Rhine anci Meuse, the operation of pounding iseffected.
   But these resources are local ; and as the manufacture of
puzzolano may become general, we proceed to describe the
best means of attaining it.
   It would be difficult to assign the period at which pounded
b'icks and the earthy residue from the distillation of aqua
fortis were substituted for volcanic puzzolano.        Their use,
however, has become general, particularly where there are
no sea- ports in the vicinity at which real puzzolano can
be furnished : even in the South of France they prefer the
earihy residue of the distillation of aquafortis to the best
puzzolanos for coating the inside of the wine tubs, which
are almost all of mason work, and for the cements used by
individuals in hydraulic works. The earth employed in the
South of France for the decomposition of saltpetre, by ex
tracting the aquafortis from             it,
                                      an ochrey earth very much
                                               is
charged  with  iron,  and  more  or  less reddened -by the oxide
of this metal. When              wanted for cement,
                                   it   is                   only   it   is
necessary to beat     up with lime and
                          it                  proper quantity of
                                                      a
water.    M. Lepere relates some experiments made al Paris
by  the engineers of roads and bridges, from which            ap          it
pears that an immersion of eight days was sufficient for
aquafortis cements to acquire       hardness fit to resist
                                             a              billet       a
of wood when forced aeainst         with the whole strength of

          ;

               attained
    In general the quality   of the earth  better    proportion
                                                      is       in
as  it   is
         charged  with   iron.
   This last observation        equally applicable to pounded
                                   is
bricks    :    in
             general   they  do not make good cement unless
                                                      a
they are well burnt, and made of very ferruginous earth.
   Twenty years ago        suggested the above substitutes for
                               I
puzzolano; and the result of my comparative trials made in
the port of Cette, under the inspection of the engineers of
the province of Languedoc, was published in 1787, in                            a
memoir printed     Didot, by            by
                               order of the states-general of
the province.
   The means which      suggested for making this artificial
                               I
puzzolano ate simple, and may be put in practice almost
everywhere.     Balls should be' made of the ochrey earth,"
and burned in      lime or •potter's kiln.
                        a                   In order to form
these balls, the earth must be moistened with       sufficient      a
quantity of water; and when the balls are made, they should
On burned, until they pass from    red to  black colour, and
                                                  a        a

180           On natural and artificial Puzzolano.
the angles of the scales formed when they are broken ex-,
hibit sharp and shining edges.
    In the same work I proposed to substitute the blackish
schists which are decomposed        in the air for puzzolanos.
Those which are in cakes are best ; but in all cases they
must be strongly calcined, in order to give them the re
quisite properties.
    M. Lepere relates that M. Vitalis, professor of chemistry
and secretary, to the Rouen Academy, and M. Lamassen,
phief engineer of the department of the Lower Seine, have
i^iade most excellent puzzolano by the calcination of some
ochrey earths in the environs of Rouen: this was effected
by burning the earth in a common furnace with alternate
to some trials on a    large scale,  and it was composed in the
follpwing manner :
    One part and a half of yellow calcined ochrey earth.
    One part and three-fourths of well washed siliceous
 sand.
    One part and a,n eighth of sour lime,
    Two parts of chips from calcareous stone and silex.
    From these and several other experiments (the propor
 tions of which were varied) it results, that the artificial
 puzzolano constantly exhibited the samp effects as the best
 puzzolano of Italy. M. Lepere was an eye-witnessof all
 these comparative experiments.
    There can be no doubt, therefore, that wherever there
 are ophrey earths, artificial puzzolano may be made with
     What is called Dutch terrass is in many respects similar
 tp the artificial puzzolano in question.
     The ashes, or rather scoriae, left when coals are burnt,
 may also be applied to the same purpose. M. Guyton
 caused a trial to be made at Cherbourg, and it succeeded
 well,
     M. Gratien Lepere, having been intrusted in 1604 with
 constructing the foundation of the new arsenal at Cher
 bourg, began to turn his attention to the best method of
 supplying the puzzolano of Italy. He knew that the Swedes
 had already used a very h,ard black slate with this view,
 after being twice stronglyicalcined in a lime-kiln.
     M. Lepere thought he perceived a great analogy between,
 the Swedish stone and the rocks of Cherbourg, particularly
 {hose oi port £unaparte, which, when dug into, exhibited
 a black schistus, hard, ferruginous, and tailing off in scales

              On some new analytical Researches.                l8l
ef various thickness      :  subsequent experiments, however^
proved that the slaty schistus of Route, in the environs of
Cherbourg^     is preferable^ and that good mortar may be
made with the ferruginous schist of Haineville, which is
inferior, however, to the two former.
   After having multiplied and varied his experiments in
?uch a manner as to present positive results, M. Lepere,
in conjunction with the committee of engineers appointed
to examine his experiments, draws the following conclu
sions :
    1st; That the schist of Cherbourg^           when strongly cal
cined and pulverised, forms an excellent mortar when!
mixed with sour lime.
   2dly. That in order to give precisely the same properties
to schist which are possessed by puzzolano and terra3s,thei
former must be calcined in a reverberating; instead of a
lime, furnace.

       VIII.  Analytical Experiments        on  Muriatic Acid.
   have made a greater number of experiments upon this
 substance,   than upon any of the other subjects of research
 that have been mentioned ; it will be impossible to give any
 more than a general view of them within the limits of the
Bakerian lecture;
    Researches    carried on some years ago, and which are'
 detailed in the Journals of the Royal Institution, showed
 that there were little hopes of decomposing muriatic acid,
 in its common form, by Voltaic electricity. When aqueous
 solution of muriatic acid is acted upon, the water alone is
 decomposed ; and the Voltaic electrization of. the gas affords
 no indications of its decomposition ; and merely seems to
 show, that this elastic fluid contains much more water than
 has been usually suspected.
    I have already laid before the Society, an account of some
 experiments made on the action of potassium on muriatic
                                   M 3                         acid.

             have since carried
scale, but with precisely similar results.
   When potassium is introduced into muriatic acid gas,
procured from muriate of ammonia and concentrated sul
phuric acid, and freed from as much moisture as muriate
of lime is capable of attracting from               it,

comes covered with        white crust,
                          a                heats spontaneously,
                                               it
ape!     the assistance of
        by                    lamp, acquires
                               a                   some parts the
                                                           in
temperature   of  ignition,  but does  not inflame.    When the
potassium   and  the  gas are in proper proportions, they both
entirely disappear;       white
                          a      salt   formed, and
                                              is          quantity       a
of pure hydrogen gas evolved, which equals about one-
third of the original volume of the gas.
   By eight grains of potassium employed              this way,     in            I
effected the absorption of nearly twenty-two cubical inches
of muriatic acid gas; and the quantity of hydrogen "gas
produced was equal to more than eight cubical inches.
   The correspondence between the quantity of hydrogen
generated in cases of this kind, and                by
                                             the action of potas
sium upon water, combined with the effects of ignited char
coal upon muriatic acid gas,          which
                                         by      quantity of in
                                                          a
flammable gas       produced equal to more than one-third of
                    is
its volume, seemed to show, that the phaenomena merely
depended upon moisture combined with the muriatic acid
gas*.
   To determine this point with more certainty however,
and to ascertain whether or no the appearance of the                              hy
drogen was wholly unconnected with the decomposition of
the acid,     Imade two comparative experiments on the
quantity of muriate of silver, furnished                  by
                                              two equal quan
tities of muriatic acid, one of which had been converted
into muriate of potash        by
                            the action of potassium, and the
other of which had been absorbed               by
                                        water every care was   ;
taken to avoid sources of error; and      was found that there
                                                   it
was no notable difference      the weight of the results.
                                    in
    There was no proof then, that the muriatic acid had been
decompounded in these experiments; and there was every
reason to consider     as containing in its common aeriform
                         it
state, at least one-third of its weight of water; and this
   * When the Voltaic
                        spark  istaken continuously, by means of pomts of
charcoal in muriatic acid gas over mercury, muriate of mercury        rapidlyis
formed,  a volume of inflammable gas, equal to one-third Of the original
volume of the muriatic acid gas, appears. The acid gas enters into combina
tion with the oxide of mercury, so that water enough       present in the ex
                                                               is
periment to form oxide sufficient to absorb the whole of the acid.

conclusion we shall find warranted by facts, which are im
mediately to follow.
    I now made a number of experiments, with the hopes'
of obtaining the muriatic acid free from water.
    I first heated to whiteness, in a well luted porcelain re
tort, a mixture of dry sulphate of iron, and muriate of lime
which had been previously ignited ; but a few cubic inches
of gas only were obtained, thouu;b the mixture was in the
quantity of several ounces ; and this gas contained sulphu
reous acid. I heated dry muriate of lime, mixed both with
phosphoric glass and dry boracic acid, in tubes of porce
lain, and ot iron, and employed the blast of an excellent
forge ; but by neither of these methods was any gas ob
tained, though when a little moisture was added to the
mixtures, muriatic acid was developed in such quantities,
as almost to produce explosions.
    The fuming muriate of tin, the liqvor of Lihavius, is
known to contain dry muriatic acid.          1 attempted   to sepa
rate the acid from this substance,      by distilling it with sul
phur and with phosphorus; but without success.                I ob
tained only triple compounds, in physical characters^ some*
thing like the solutions of phosphorus, and sulphur in oil,
which were non-conductors of electricity, which did not
redden dry litmus paper, and which evolved muriatic acid
gas with great violence, heat, and ebullition on the contact
of   water.
    I distilled mixtures of corrosive sublimate      and sulphur,
and   of calomel  and sulphur ; when these were used in their
common states, muriatic acid gas was evolved ; but when
they were dried by a gentle heat, the quantity was exceed
ingly diminished, and the littte gas that was generated gave
hydrogen by the action of potassium.          During the distilla
tion of corrosive sublimate and sulphur, a very small quan
tity of a limpid fluid passed over. When examined by
 transmitted light, it appeared yellowish green. It emitted
fumes of muriatic acid, did not redden dry litmus paper,
and deposited sulphur by the action of water.             I am in
clined to consider it   as a modification   of  the substance   dis
 covered by Dr.    Thomson,    in his experiments    on  the action
 of oxymuriatic acid on sulphur.
    MM. Gay LnsSac and Thenard* have mentioned, that
 they endeavoured to procure dry muriatic acid by distilling,
 a mixture of calomel and phosphorus, and that they ob
 tained a fluid which they consider as a compound of mu-
                    * The Moniteur before quoted.

184            On some new analytical Researches
riatic acid, phosphorus, and oxygen. In distilling corrosive
sublimate with phosphorus, I had a similar result, and           I
obtained the substance in much larger quantities, than by
the distillation of phosphorus with calomel.
    As oxymuriatic acid is slightly soluble in water, there
was reason to suppose,         reciprocally that water must be
slightly  soluble  in this gas ; I endeavoured therefore to pro
cure dry     muriatic   acid,  by absorbing the oxygen from
oxymuriatic     acid  gas by substances,      which when oxy
genated produce compounds possessing a strong affinity for
water.     Phosphorus, it is well known, burns in oxymu
riatic acid gas ; though the results of this combustion, 1
believe, have never been minutely examined.             With the
hopes   of  procuring  muriatic   acid gas, free from  moisture, I
made the experiment.         I introduced phosphorus into a re
ceiver having a stop-cock, which had been exhausted, and
admitted oxymuriatic acid gas.         As soon as the retort was
full, the phosphorus entered into combustion, throwing
forth pale white flames. A white sublimate collected in the
top of the retort, and a fluid as limpid as water, trickled
down the sides of the neck. The gas seemed to be entirely
absorbed, for when the stop-cock was opened, a fresh
quantity of oxymuriatic acid, nearly as much as would have
filled the retort, entered.
    The same phenomenon of inflammation again took place,
with similar results. Oxymuriatic acid gas was admitted till
the whole of the phosphorus was consumed.
    Minute experiments proved, that no gaseous muriatic
acid had been evolved in thiy operation, and the muriatic
acid was consequently to be looked for either in the white
sublimate, or in the fluid which had formed in the neck of
the retort.
    The sublimate was in large portions, the fluid only in the
quantity of a few drops. I collected by different processes,
sufficient of both for examination.
    The sublimate emitted fumes of muriatic acid when ex
posed to air.     When brought in contact with water, it
evolved muriatic acid gas, and left phosphoric acid, and
muriatic acid, dissolved in the water. It was a non-con
ductor of electricity, and did not burn when heated ; but
sublimed when its temperature was about that of boiling
water, leaving not the slightest residuum.          1 am inclined
to regard it as a combination of phosphoric and muriatic
acid in their dry states.
    The fluid was of a pale greenish yellow tint, and very
limpid ; when exposed to air, it rapidly disappeared, emit
                                                              ting

ting dense white fumes which had a strong smell differing
a lit tie from that of muriatic acid.
   It reddened litmus paper. in its common state, but had no
effect upon litmus paper which had been well dried, and
which was immediately dipped into it. It was a non-con
ductor of electricity.        It heated when mixed with water,
and evolved muriatic acid gas.            I consider it as a com
pound of phosphorous acid, and muriatic acid, both free
from water*.
    Having failed in obtaining uncombined muriatic acid in
this way, I performed a similar process with sulphur, but
I was unable to cause it to inflame in oxymuriatic acid gas.
When it was heated in                  it,
                                     produced an orange-coloured

liquid,   and  yellow  fumes    passed into the neck of the retort,
which condensed into           greenish-yellow fluid.

                                                       I                  a

                                                  it     compound
of dry sulphuric and muriatic acid, holding in solution                              a
very little sulphur.       When      was heated in contact with
sulphur,     itrapidly  dissolved            it, it
                                      and then became of bright           a
red colour, and when saturated with sulphur, of                 pale          a
golden colourf. No permanent aeriform fluid was evolved
in any of these operations, and no muriatic gas appeared,
unless moisture was introduced.
    As there seemed little chance of procuring uncombined
muriatic acid,       itwas desirable to ascertain what would be
the effects of potassium upon              in these singular com
                                                      it
pounds.
   When potassium was introduced into the fluid, generated
it bythe action of phosphorus on corrosive sublimate, at first
   slightly effervesced, from the action of the liquid on the
moist crust of pdtash surrounding                but the metal soon
                                                           it

appeared perfectly splendid, and swimming on the surface,
I  attempted to fuse          it   by
                                 heating the fluid, but     entered      it
into ebullition at temperature below that of the fusion of
                          a
the potassium       indeed the mere heat of the hand was suffi
                    ;
cient for the effect. On examining the potassium,             found      I
       attempted to obtain dry muriatic acid likewise from the phosplmret-
  *     I
ted muriatic acid  of MM. Gay Lussac and Thenard, by distilling         in re it
torts containing oxygen gas, and ovymuriatic acid gas. In the firu case, the
retort was shattered by the combustion of the phosphorus, with         violenta
explosion.    In the second, compounds, similar to those described above,
were formed.
    + All these substances seem to be of.the same nature as the singular com
pound, the sulphuretted muriatic nciil, discovered by Dr. Thomson, noticed
kefure.             ,
                                                                                   that

 isti          On soma hew analytical Risearckei
that it was combined at the surface with phosphorus, and
gave phosphuretted hydrogen by its operation upon water.
    I endeavoured, by repeatedly distilling the fluid from po
tassium" in a close vessel, to free it from phosphorus, and
in this way I succeeded in depriving it of a considerable
quantity of this substance.
    I introduced ten or twelve drops of the liquid, which had
been thus treated,- into a small plate glass retort, contain
ing six grains of potassium ; the retort was exhausted sifter
having been twice filled with hydrogen, the liquid was: made
to boi\i and the retort kept warm till the whole had dis
appeared as elastic vapour. The potassium was then heated
by the point of a spirit lamp; it had scarcely melted, when
it burst into a most brilliant flame, as splendid as that of
phosphorus in oxygen gas, and the retort was destroyed by
the rapidity of combustion.
    In other trials made upon smaller quantities after various
failures, I was at last able to obtain the results ; there was
no proof of the evolution of any permanent elastic fluid
during the operation. A solid mass remained of a greenish
colour at the surface, but dark gray in the interior. It was
extremely inflammable,       and often burnt spontaneously
when exposed to air ; when thrown upon water, it produced
a violent explosion, with a smell like that of phosphuretted
hydrogen.     In the residuum of its combustion there was
found muriate of potash, and phosphate of potash.
    I endeavoured to perform this experiment in an iron tube,
hoping that if the muriatic acid was decomposed in the
process, its inflammable element, potassium and phospho
rus, might be separated from each other by a high degree
of heat ; but in the first part of the operation the action'
was so intense, as to produce a destruction of the apparatus,
and the stop-cock was separated from the tube with a loud
detonation.
    I heated potassium in the vapour of the compound of
muriatic and phosphoric acid ; but in this case the in
flammation was still more intense, and in all the experi
ments that I have hitherto tried, the glass vessels have been
either fused or broken ; the solid residuum has however ap
peared to be of the same kind as that I have just described.
    The results of the operation of the sulphuretted com
pounds containing muriatic acid free from water upon po
tassium, are still more extraordinary than those of the phos
phuretted compounds.
    When a piece of potassium is introduced into the sub
 stance that distils over during the action of heated sulphur
                                                          upon

                 on i/ie   Nature of certain Bodies.            187
upon oxymuriatip acid, it at first produces a slight efferves
cence, and if the volume of' the potassium considerably ex
ceeds that of the liquid, it soon explodes with a violent re
port, and a most intense light.
    I have endeavoured to collect the results of this opera
tion, by causing the explosion to take place in large ex
hausted plate glass retorts ; but, except in a case in which I
used only about a quarter of a grain, I never succeeded.
Generally the retort, though connected with the air pump
at the time, was broken into atoms; and the explosion
produced by a grain of potassium, and an equal quantity of
the fluid, has appeared to me considerably louder than that
of' a musket.
    In the case in which I succeeded in exploding a quarter
of a grain, it was not possible for me to ascertain if any
gaseous matter was evolved; but a solid compound was
                                                                      •
formed of a very deep gray tint, which burnt, throwing off
bright scintillations, when gently heated, which inflamed
when touched with water, and gave most brilliant sparks,
like those thrown off by iron in oxygen gas.
    Its properties certainly differed from those of any com
pound of sulphur and potassium that I have seen : whether
it contains the muriatic basis must however be still a mat
ter of inquiry.                                ,
    There  is,  however, much reason for supposing, that in
the singular phaenomena of inflammation and detonation
that have been described, the muriatic acid cannot be en
tirely passive   :and    does not seem unfair to infer, that
                           it
 the transfer of its oxygen and the production of        anovel
 substance, are connected with such effects, and that the
 highly inflammable nature of the new compounds, partly
 depends upon this circumstance.          am still pursuing the
                                          I
 inquiry,  and   I shall  not fail immediately   to communicate
 to the Society, such results as may appear to me worthy of
their attention.
    IX.   Some general Observations,        with Experiments.             i
  An experiment has been lately published, which appeared
so immediately connected with the discussion entered into
in the second section of this Paper, that repeated
                                                I    with  it
much earnestness.
   In Mr. Nicholson's Journal for December, Dr. Wood-
house has given an account of    process, in which the ac
                                      a
tion of water caused the inflammation of    mixture of four
                                                 a
parts of charcoal and one of the pearlash that had been
                                                   strongly

                On some new analytical Researches
 strongly ignited together, and the emission of ammonia
 from them.      I thought it possible, that in this case a sub
 stance might be formed similar to the residuum described
 in page 487 (Philosophical Magazine, vol. xxxiii.); but by
 cooling the mixture out of the contact of nitrogen, I found
 that no ammonia was formed; and this substance evi-»
 dently owed its existence to the absorption of atmospherical
 air by the charcoal *.
    The experiments that I have detailed oti the acids, offer
 some new views with respect to the nature of acidity. That
 a compound of muriatic acid with oxide of tin or phospho
 rus should redden vegetable blues, might be ascribed to a
 species of neutralization, by the oxide or inflammable body;
 but the same reasoning will not apply to the dry compounds
 which contain acid matter only, and which are precisely
 similar as to this quality.   Let a piece of dry and warm
 litmus paper be moistened with the compound of muriatic
 and phosphorous acid, it perfectly retains its colour. Let it
 then be placed upon a piece of moistened litmus paper, it
 instantly becomes of a bright red, heats and develops mu
 riatic acid gas.
    AH the fluid acids that contain water are excellent con
 ductors of electricity, in the class called that of imperfect
 conductors; but. the compounds to which I have just al
 luded, are non-conductors in the same degree as oils, with
 which they are perfectly miscible.     When I first examined
 muriatic acid, in its combinations free from moisture,                     I
 had great hopes of decomposing them by electricity ; but
 there was no action without contact of the wires, and the
 spark seemed to separate no one of their constituents, but
.only to render them gaseous.        The circumstance likewise
 applies to the boracic acid, which is a good conductor as
 long as it contains water; but which, when freed from
 water and made fluid by heat, is then a non-conductor.
   * Potash or pearlash is easily decomposed by the combined attractions of
charcoal and iron; but it is not decomposable by charcoal, or, when per
fectly dry, by iron alone. Two combustible bodies seem to be required by
their combined affinities for the effect i thus in the experiment with the gun
barrel, iron and hydrogen are concerned.          I consider Homberg's pyro-
phorus as a triple compound of potassium, sulphur, and charcoal; and iif
this ancient process, the potash is probably decomposed by two affinities.
The substance is perfectly imitated by heating together ten parts of char
coal, two of potassium, and one of sulphur.
   When I first showed the production of potassium to Dr. Wollaston in Oc
tober 1807, he stated, that this new fact induced him to conceive that the'
action of potash upon platina, was owing to the formation of potassium, and
proposed  it, asa  matter of research, whether the alkali might not be de
composed by the joint action of platina and charcoal.
                                                                        Th"

                  on the Nature      of certain Bodies.                      189
  The alkalies      and the earthy compounds,    and the oxides,
as dry    as we can  obtain  them,  though non-conductors    when
solid, are, on the contrary, all conductors when rendered
fluid by heat.
     When muriatic acid, existing in combination with phos
phorus or phosphoric acid, is rendered gaseous by the ac
tion of water, the quantity of this fluid that disappears, at
lea3t equals from one-third to two-fifths of the weight of
the acid gas produced ; a circumstance that agrees with thq
indications given by the action of potassium.
      1 attempted   to procure a compound of dry muriatic and
 cart'onic acids, hoping that it might be gaseous, and that
 the two acids might be decomposable at the. same time by
 potassium.        The process that I employed was by passing
 corrosive sublimate in vapour through charcoal ignited to
 whiteness | but 1 obtained a very small quantity of gas,
 which seemed to be a mixture of common muriatic acid gas
 and carbonic acid gas ; a very minute portion of running
 mer ury only was obtained, by a long continuation of the
 process ; and the slight decomposition that did take place,
 I am inclined to attribute to the production of water, by
 the action of the hydrogen of the charcoal upon the oxygen
 of the oxide of mercury *.
      In mixing muriatic acid gas with carbonic acid, or oxy
 gen, or hydrogen, the gases being in their common states,
 as to moisture, there was always a cloudiness produced ;
 doubtless ow ing to the attraction of their water to form
 liquid muriatic acid.
       On fluoric acid gas no such effect was occasioned. This
 fact, at first view, might be supposed to show, that the
  hydrogen evolved bv the action of potassium upon fluoric
  acid gas, is owing to water in actual combination with                       it,
  like that in muriatic acid gas, and which may be essential
  to its elastic state    but      more probable, from the small-
                                  it
                                  is
                          ;
  i;ess of the quantity, and from the difference of the quan
  tity  in  different cases, that the moisture     merely is    that    in
  state of diffusion or solution in which       exists in gases in
                                                      it
  general, though from the disposition of water to be depo
   sited in this acid gas in the form of an acid solution,
it     must be either less in quantity, or in   less free state, so
                                                       a
        These facts and the other facts of the same kind, explain the difficulty
  *
 of   the decomposition  of the metallic muriates in common processes of metal
 lurgy.    They likewise explain other phenomena in the agencies of muriatic
 salts.   In all case» when muriatic salt
                              a            is  decomposed by an acid, and mu
 riatic acid gas set free, there appears to be a.double affinity, that of the acid
  for the basis, and of the muriatic acid for water pure muriatic acid does

                                                                               as

 as to require for its exhibition much more delicate hygro-
 metrical tests.
    The tacts advanced in this lecture, afford no new argu
ments in favour of an idea to which I referred in my last
communication to the Society, that of hydrogen being a
common principle in all inflammable .bodies ;. and except in
instances which are still under investigation, and concern
ing which no precise conclusions can as yet be drawn, the
generalization of Lavoisier happily applies to the explana
tion of all the new phenomena.
   In proportion as progress is made towards the knowledge
of pure combustible bases, so in proportion is the number
of metallic substances increased ; and it is probable that
sulphur and phosphorus-, could they be perfectly deprived
of oxygen, would belong to this class of bodies.        Possibly
their pure elementary matter may be procured by distilla
tion, at a high heat, from metallic alloys, in which they
have been acted upon by sodium or potassium. I hope soon
to be able to try this experiment.
   As our inquiries at present stand, the great general di

XXVII.          On tlie Causes which have operated in the Produc

Sir,   It was not my intention to have intruded again into
your very respectable journal, wherein, indeed, first inci       I
dentally appeared, solely with   view of showing, in oppo
                                             a
sition to some hypothetical notions, that moving water has
been, and yet coutinues to be, the great and general agent

                 in the Production  of Valleys.              191
of mobility of all the loose materials of our earth ; and that
instead   of wandering out of Nature after hypothetical
enigmas, to explain the mighty changes which the exterior
and interior of our globe have every where undergone, we
have only to appreciate, justly, the incessant, varied, and
powerful action of that fluid, in order to obtain the most
rational, simple, and natural elucidation of all the general
and principal phaenomena in geology.        That branch of the
subject, however, which relates to the action of fresh water
streams flowing over unequal andinclined surfaces having
experienced direct and decided opposition, 1 must again so
licit the use of a few pages in your valuable repository.
    The objections, indeed, to which I allude, are hardly
entitled to any reply; for they in no respect invalidate, and
scarcely at all advert to, the general question on its own
broad basis, or meet the vast chain of general and harmo
nizing facts, upon which the whole merits of the casehinge.
    These were expressly stated to be : — the elevated situation
of the sources and springheads of all streams, which gives
them an easy and natural flow over the countries out of
which all vallevs have been excavated, — the most important
and material fact in the whole question ; — the present slopes
 at the lower ends of most valleys, where the streams must
originally have had a fall corresponding with the pre
sent depths of the valleys; — the mechanically abrading
forces of the streams at these falls, and which are amply
sufficient, with the occasional aid of flooded torrents, to
 have effected the excavation of the valleys ; — the obvious
Certainty that, were the valleys again filled up, the streams
would still continue to flow in nearly their present direc
tions, forming in that case a succession of lakes and water
falls, similar to what must have existed before the valleys
were excavated ; — that at the falls, produced by the filling
up of the valleys, the streams would immediately com*
mence the excavation of other valleys, in all respects similar
to those of our present ones ; and, in fine, that the streams
themselves are the only agents in nature that can possibly
have accomplished such a system of uniform effects as ex
cavated valleys display throughout every country.
    It was added, that all the existing phaenomena, in the
present courses of streams, strictly correspond with the fore
going order of things: — namely, the present direction of
valleys; which every where so regularly falls in with the na
tural descent of the country, precisely as the streams must
originally have done before the valleys were excavated, and
would do again were they again filled up ; — the unbroken
                                                           chain

   1 92          On the Causes which have operated
  chain of alluvia which, maugre Mr. Farey's denial, does now
  actually accompany the course of every stream from its
  source to its termination, and which constantly corresponds
  with the strata traversed by the streams ; — the innumerable
 intersections of valleys at the confluence of streams, in
 angles governed strictly by the general fall of the countrv,
 and the uniform levels on which these frequent intersections
 of valleys and streams meet; — evincing with all the preci
 sion of mathematical demonstration, that such a multi
 tudinous unison of effects over the whole surface of the
 globe cannot possibly be referred to any other natural cause
 than the simple, obvious, and necessary operation of the
 streams themselves.
      These were the clear, precise, and definite data on which
 I   rested the proof of the streams having every where exca
 vated their own valleys.     The references and the reasoning
 were necessarily general, because the question itself is one
 of the most general that can be agitated, including the ex
 cavated vales in the course of every stream throughout every
 country ; and yet this widely extended case, Mr. Farey
 would have to be determined by the datum of a solitary
 valley, or a local spot : and by frittering the natural magni
 tude of the question down to the subordinate and puny
 case of what has become of the excavated materials. Now
 admitting, in its fullest extent, all that Mr. Farey has ad
 vanced on this latter head, what would the whole infer,
but either that the valleys have never been excavated at all,
or that the materials carried off have been removed to situa
tions and distances where we can no lunger trace them ? Sa
strongly incongruous and unphilosophical arc many of his
notions of valleys, that, probably enough, he may deny the
excavations altogether, although there does not exist a
quarry or gravel pit in the kingdom, that bears more un
equivocal indications of excavation than do our numerous
ranges of valleys.     But, on the other hand, if Mr. Farey
admits of the excavation of valleys, in that admission
he fully accedes to the removal of the missing materials :
and by what practical or even possible direction will he
contrive to carry them off, other than downwards in,
the same direction with the streams, where, however, he
so obdurately denies they have ever travelled ? His avowal
that he is proud to repeat his belief in the probability, that
valleys have been purposely and specially formed for the
streams which now flow through them, and that it is en
gaging much of his attention, really surprises me. That
the channel of a canal has been purposely and specially
                                                         formed.

                                    -
                  in the Production   of Valleys.              Ig3
formed for the water afterwards let into it we well know,
and we also   know by what means the work has been ac
complished ; but what are the wonderful and never-yet-
imagined means by which Mr. Farcy will contrive to effect
the excavation of thousands, I had almost said millions, of
uniform valleys, expressly for, and previous to, the streams
being let into them ? That he never can discover and apply
any natural agency equal and applicable, in the remotest
degree, to so extensive and uniform a task, is unquestionable,
ana if supernatural agency be in his contemplation, I must
decline following him into such a region.         But what is the-
cogent reason which Mr. Farey thinks is sufficient to justify
his broaching so strange a hypothesis?        He has discovered
a few excavated vales, on heights where no streams now
flow : and their existence he deems sufficient to throw into
utter obscurity the origin of all other excavated valleys.
Now, though these few elevated vales are out of the reach
of either present or former streams, does it thence follow
that they are also out of the reach of rain, torrents, or even
of those water-spouts which Mr. Farey pours down on an
other occasion, when their aid was quite unnecessary ?
Has Mr. Farey never heard of the vast and profound chasms
in the mountainous tracts of the torrid zone, and which are
nothing but excavations produced by the temporary torrents
during the rainy season ? And has he not seen innume
rable excavations, though on a far less scale, in the hilly
districts of our own country, also evidently the produce of
occasional rainy torrents ? For what other purpose then
can a few such paltry instances be held out, but to darken
and obscure the true state of the general question of exca
vation ?
    But to return to the subject of the missing materials.
Mr. Farey is daily in the habit of treading on travelled
 matter without knowing from whence it has been brought,
 and of observing other spots from which immense masses
 of matter are missing, without being able to form a con
jecture as to where they have been carried ; and these facts
 of finding and missing removed matter, without any trace
 from whence, or to whither, it has bei-n transported, are
 amongst the most familiar of geological phaenomena, nor
 is there any practical or probable agent in Nature for all this
 universal tossing and shitting but water: yet because Mr.
 Farey cannot satisfy himself as to the precise identity and
 present situation of the comparatively trivial portion of
 matter carried away from excavated vales, he thinks that
 circumstance alone sufficient to justify an unlimited denial
     Vol. 34. No. 137. Sept. 1809.               N            that

194          On the Causes which have operated
that the streams, the only visible and conceivable agents
 for such a work, can have had any share in the excavation
 arid transportation of the missing materials. He has, how
 ever, in his first paper, somewhat ungroundedly admitted,
 that he had discovered a little of the alluvia carried down
by streams and brooks, adding, indeed, as a suitable quali
 fication, that thev are found so near to the currents as to
be naturally enough referred to torrents which hurry through
the valleys in ordinary rains.     It is very unusual to find
Mr. Farey treading on such natural ground as this ; and
 accordingly, as if uneasy in his new situation, he instantly
couples with these natural torrents, imaginary waterspouts,
to assist in carrying down the few basketful* of alluvial ma
terials which, so unluckily for his own system, he had
stumbled upon.
    Even allowing Mr. Farey his own way, in calling this
quantity which he has discovered only the thousandth part
of the whole, I should still imagine that rain and torrents
were quite as efficacious in their powers of transportation at
the time the valleys were excavating, as now ; and indeed,
they certainly were much more so ; as the numerous falls
which must then have existed, would add greatly to the
abrading forces of the currents; and I also think, that
where we now find a portion, though it were only a thou
sandth part, actually lodged where it must have been brought
down by the stream, it will be to every one but Mr. Farey
himself, a rational conclusion, that the rest, however con
siderable, has travelled off in the same direction ; and that
the portion left for our inspection is satisfactory evidence of
the other portion having also passed downwards, but be
yond the limits of our further tracing, into the great recep
tacle of all — the ocean.
    But all this cavilling about what has become of the ex
cavated materials, is mere quibbling on a subordinate fact,
which, however it may be disposed of, will still leave the
great and general question of excavation and its agents un
determined ; and even this fact, to any impartial and com
petent person, who will take the trouble of verifying        it,
will be found most substantially as before represented it.
                                    I
I  have never yet inspected a  flat traversedby   the serpentine
windings of  a    stream, without finding every part of the
channel cut,  in   many instances to   a    considerable depth,
through alluvia corresponding with the strata higher up the
stream :   and not only the whole of the flat, but also up to
certain heights on the surrounding eminences, abounded
with the same transported matters. In truth, the universal
                                                   dissemination

                  in the Production   of Valleys.            1 94
 dissemination of alluvia along the channels and vicinities of
 streams is as evident and palpable as the streams themselves.
The immense beds which form the actuaries, and still more
 the deltas of large rivers, at their entrances into the ocean,
 are all formations from matter that has travelled down the
 respective streams, and yet in all probability these enormous
 quantities bear no proportion to those which have passed
on into the sea.
    At the mouths of the Rhine and Scheldt, where the public
attention is at this time so interestingly engaged, whole
and very extensive countries have been formed, from the
alluvia brought down by these rivers ; and every other river
on the globe affords the most unequivocal evidence of the
 vast masses of earthy and stony matter which have travel
 led down its waters.     Every brook swoln with rain, and
every stream occasionally flooded with ten times its usual
 proportion of water, surcharged to such an excess, with
muddy materials, as frequently to smother multitudes of
fish in their natural element, are all facts which are con
 tinually presenting themselves to our senses ; and yet, if
Mr. Farey is to be our guide, all these are palpable decep
tions: the carrying power of streams is all absurdity, and
all the endless niasses of alluvia which every where accom
 pany flowing water, have dropt from the moon, or travelled
 up the streams from the sea, but can never have found
their way by so easy and natural a course as down them.
    Mr. Farey cannot discover any where in the course of the
streams, the bottoms of ancient lakes, as described in my
former paper ; but that I consider as a mere play on the
word lake, for he does not assert that the flats which he
has inspected do not abound with alluvia, but only that
they have not, in his opinion, been the site of former lakes.
If Mr. Farey will deny that the flats traversed by streams
do abound with alluvial matters, our veracities will then be
at issue, not on a matter of opinion, but of fact.      I gave a
very simple   rule  for  ascertaining  where  lakes formerly ex
isted, and had it contained any fallacy," its refutation would
have been easy. It was to suppose the present valleys filled
up, the streams still continuing to flow, and then to ob
serve where the water would accumulate into a lake, and
on that spot alluvia and every other indication of a former
lake would now be formed.
    Mr. Farey also speaks of having looked for the bed3 of,
former lakes in the valleys, where no one would imagine
they ever could have existed,      ft was on the flats and in
                                N2                           the

1Q8             On the Causes which    heme operated
the hollow immediately above a valley, where I expressly
 limited their former existence. Mr. Farey also thinks the
 Cumberland and Westmoreland lakes, not having givea
 way and become valleys (an absurdity I never imagined,—
 flats, and not valleys, are what I have supposed former lakes
 to have left,) afford strong presumption, that my notions on
 the subject are erroneous ; but he ought to have known
that there are two distinct natural processes by which lakes
may become exhausted.          The one is where the stream,
leaving the lake, has a sufficient fall over yielding strata to
effect the excavation of a valley back into the lake.       The
Other is where the stream flowing into the lake brings
down alluvia sufficient in time to fill it up. In general both
of these operations are in action at the same time, and that
was strictlv the case with the lakes which I described as
having existed in the course of streams.          There are also
two distinct circumstances which may prolong the existence
of lakes. The one is where the fall in the stream leaving
the lake is too inconsiderable either to give the necessary
force to the descending power of the stream, or to admit
of its cutting a channel backwards sufficiently deep for the
discharge of the lake. The other is where, with a suffi
ciency of fall, the stream is crossed by a stratum of indu
rated rock, so durable as effectually to resist the abrading
forces of the stream. The former is the case with several
of the principal Scotch lakes, which are situated near to,
and but little above, the level of the sea. The latter is the
cast- with almost all the numerous lakes in Canada, where
the many magnificent falls, on the same streams, and al
ways below the lakes, incontrovertiby point out the cause
which has preserved the lakes.
    Mr. Farey asserts, that     " it is by no means a general
truth, that, if the matters removed from the strata to form
valleys were replaced, there would still be a sufficient falb
in the country for the streams to flow the same way." J.
certainly never meant, nor could any one understand me
to mean, that the streams would How over precisely the
identical channels which they now do, but in nearly the
same way or direction ; and I conceive, that when a very
great majority of the instances in a case are similar, that
similarity constitutes a general truth. Now out of the many
hundred streams which Mr. Farey has seen, he points out
two solitary instances only, as differing from my descrip
tion ; adding, indeed, that other instances are very nume
rous, and that I shall be forced to admit that excavated
                                                           vales

vales do not always follow the lowest ground ; that       the                is,
natural fall ot the country.   This looks like mere quibble      a
on the word always. My expression was,          that we may      "
always be assured that the course which the stream has
taken   the lowest descent of the country in that direction,"
       is
nor do conceive
       I              possible to state
                              it          more correct, or
                                                    a                               a
 more widely extended general truth. The general direction
of   excavated valleys and their streams is, indeed, univer
 sally along with the common fall of the country           and                      it
                                                                                 il

                                                                     by it

 lustrates and confirms the excavation of the vales        streams;
 seeing that the excavation has continually proceeded in the
 same direction with the natural fall of the country, and,
 consequentlv, with the original course of the streams. In*
 deed, so substantially true        the proposition which
                                            is                   ad          f
 vanced, and which Mr. Farey finds           so necessary to his
                                                    it
 purpose to deny, that there        an absolute physical impos*
                                            is
 sibility of streams, when left to themselves, flowing           any         in
 other direction than the lowest fall of the country ovet
 which they have to flow.         To suppose otherwise, would
 require them either to ascend, or instinctively to avoid de
 scending,       some parts of their course.
                in
    Mr. Farey also asserts, " neither          true that, in every
                                                   is   it
 instance, the angle of intersection of valleys and stream*
is  acute above and obtuse below, or that two streams inva
 riably meet on precisely the same level." Here, again,                            if
 the denials have any meaning at all,             mere quibbling
                                                     it     is
 on the words in italics.    Has Mr. Farey ever seen an in*
 stance where the intersections spoken of occurred with
 angles acute below and obtuse above          that is, where the
                                                        :
 streams coalesced             by
                          meeting   each other?     Or where has
 he seen, at the confluence of two streams, the one falling
 from    height into the other    And yet,      he has seen both,

and that very frequently too, what must think of his con*
oealing some of the most material general truths                 the         in
question    ? He may, indeed, have seen, and suppose they        I
are what he alludes to,          few instances of
                                     a                   trivial rilla
trickling over      bank, at right angles into
                     a                               stream      but
                                                                 a           ;
would he balance such instances against those to which                             I
referred, and which are as numerously disseminated over
this and everv other country as are the streams themselves                         i
The truth assuredly is, that these objections were con
venient for putting aside     string of general -facts and rea
                                    a
soning, which the most ingenious and artful hypothesis^
who denies the action of the streams, dares not either di
rectly oppose or venture to illustrate,               by
                                              fairly meeting the

198             On the Causes which have operated
practical facts in the general question.              And, notwith
standing all Mr. Farey's denial, for he has yet offered no
thing in the way of argument, it is a general truth diffused
over the whole surface of the globe, that excavated valleys
and their streams do coincide in their direction with the
natural fall of the country, and do intersect at angles also
corresponding with that fall, and at corresponding levels ;
and while this vast unison of effects absolutely demonstrates
the action of the streams as its natural cause, it is utterly
and altogether inexplicable by any other natural process or
operation.
    Hence it    is, that Mr. Farey has never yet ventured to
hint   at what   he  deems the natural cause of the excavation
of vales; and with larger portion of that confidence which
                       a
he condemns, and which, without having truth on its side,
would, indeed, be the extreme of absurdity,          I     venture to
pronounce      his entire  incapacity   to  afford any probable solu
tion of those extensive general truths — the elevated situa
tion of the spring-heads — the common direction of the
vales and streams with the fall of the country — and their
uniform intersections and levels. He committed himself
in the first instance by denying the action of the streams,
and in doing so he has completely shut himself out from
the question, and      is now utterly unable to advance    a   single
step towards its elucidation.
   Hitherto Mr. Farey has only tried to extinguish the lights
held up, and endeavoured to throw the general question
into utter darkness,        by balancing petty and puny excep
tions against    a  more extensive chain of general and har
monizing facts than are to be met with in any other portion
of geology and
            ;
                       it
                       is   this spirit of altercation working only
to conceal and obscure, instead of entering with fair views
into the just merits of the general case, that has constrained
me to speak so strongly as           I have done.I      was, and am
still, disposed to think very highly of Mr. Farey, as an
exceedingly acute, intelligent, and industrious observer;
but every thing he- has yet said on the subject of valleys
proves how justly      I appreciated his talents as an investigator
of natural causes.
   The only obscurity,      I   am well convinced, which hangs
over the natural excavation of valleys, arises from not duly
estimating the mechanical action of water when rapidly
descending   a   declivity over the ordinary materials of bur
earth. There      is  not, perhaps,      a mountain on the globe,
which  a   stream of water will not cut in two, allowing          it
only sufficient fall, and
      a                          a  sufficiency of time: two cir

                  in   the Production   of Valleys*              19f
 cumstances which have universally existed in the excavation
  of vales.  In the mountainous districts of the tropical re
 gions, gullies and ravines are frequently cut, to a vast
 depth, through the hardest rock, merely by the temporary
 torrents which descend during the rainy season; and similar
 effects; but of far less magnitude, may be every where seen
 in the hilly districts of our own country.        And even the
 bursting of a canal through its banks, or the overflowing
 of a flooded river into a new tract, will often, in a few
 hours, effect astonishing excavations, and carry away
 amazing portions of matter.         Extensive meadows in this
 neighbourhood have been covered several feet in depth,
 with sand and other alluvia brought down by the Mersey
 in a single night. But ii is really painful to be compelled
 to refer to such ordinary occurrences in support of so ob
 vious a fact, as that a stream of water, falling over a decli
 vity, will there effect an excavation proportional to the
 height of the fall, and the yielding nature of the strata.
    Now if we consider that the sources and spring-heads of
 all streams, without perhaps an exception of one instance
 in -a thousand, and that admitting of an easy and natural
 explanation, are situated above the level of the country out
 ot which the valleys have been excavated, and previous to
 the excavation must have flowed over         it,
                                               and that the pre
 sent depths of the valleys satisfactorily prove that the streams,
 must have had falls equal to these depths, we shall surely
 find, in the natural progress and descending forces of the
 streams, all the means necessary to have effected the exca
 vations and when
         ;               addition to all this we actually find so
                        in
 many of the phaenomena of streams and valleys precisely cor
 responding with such an action of the waters, we surely pos
 sess quantum of harmonizing evidence, which will support
     a
 the most confident conclusion and
                                 ;       itwould but ill comport
with the liberal spirit of philosophical research to turn away
from such    a mass of evidence, and substitute for such ob
vious and natural agency, some baseless phantom of hypo
thetical enigma.
 I    cannot but lament that Mr. Farey should voluntarily
nave made himself an habitual alien to that beautiful sim
plicity which pervades and governs all the operative works
of Nature, and which constantly rises in dignified unity
with the magnitude of the occasion.           The falling of an
apple   from a treeis  said to  have  suggested to Newton the
first idea which led him to the development pf his great
scheme of universal gravitation      :  nor do    consider water

the planetary system ; for it assuredly is the great and sim
ple instrument for moving and moulding all the exterior
and interior parts of our earth. Hence alone we can discover
the obvious reason why it bears so large a proportion on the
surface of the globe.        Its present quantity and extent are
indispensable to effect that gigantic transportation of pon
derable matter, which all the strata of the earth testify,
which the principles of renovation in such a material system
require, and which no data we now possess can authorise
us to doubt is now in as full force and action as at any
former period.        Nor have we any reason to despair that
human sagacity and science, at present so active in the in
vestigation of Nature, will in due time be enabled to de
velop those laws by which alternations of sea and land have
been, and doubtless yet continue to be effected, with as
much precision as planetary bodies are wheeled in their se
veral orbits.      For puny and unphilosophical indeed must
his views of nature be, who can imagine that the whole
portion of the earth, on which the very existence of all its
organized beings is dependent, has hitherto been moulded
and fashioned by fluctuating and fortuitous laws, and is yet
to be the sport of accidental violence, or that its continual
propensity to disintegration and waste has no restorative
balance.
    These extended views of geology, Mr. Farey will find it
easy to call rhapsodical ; but he will do wiser to give them
a serious and just consideration, as an antidote against his
fondness for the ignis faluus of hypothesis.         It is only by
such new impressions that his mind can be weaned from
rambling after and bringing down other worlds, to patch
up and eke out our own.          His geological surveys merit the
highest praise. Such pursuits, indeed, are of great national
 interest, and I can truly assure him that he has no friend
 who more sincerely wishes him every support and success
 than myself; but if he continues in his singular and obdu
rate prejudices against the efficacious and important action
of moving water, as the general operator of geological phe
nomena, as well on the surface, as. in the stratified regions
of the interior of the earth ; he may, indeed, be the col
lector of a numerous assemblage of valuable facts, but it
will be left to others to employ them, successfully, in the
investigation of that common cause which has disseminated
such a diversity of effects in and over every part of the
globe.        I am, sir, your most obedient humble servant,

Sib, Since the period at which I sent you some remark*
on a thunder storm * seen at a distance, I have been nearly
under a similar storm, and have remarked two additional
effects, which appear to me to throw some light upon this
subject.
    Toward the close of a fine day the air grew thick with
vapour, but exhibited no visible form of clouds.          This va
pour afterwards condensed into thicker masses, with faint
flashes of lightning about them.           The condensation then
went on very rapid, so that w hat was only a thick mist be
fore, became, in an hour, a large general mass of clouds;,
and I could now see clear sky in different parts, though at
the commencement the whole sky was covered with a faint
mist. There was now a great deal of lightning between the
upper and lower clouds, the effect of which was seen
through the under clouds in broad, misty, zig-zag flashes]
and nearer the horizon were seen large sparks running along
between the clouds to a great distance.          The passage of the
light was visible all the way, but the spark seen distinctly
at all the openings.
    During the time this lightning continued there was only
now and then a little thunder, which I think is clearly ac
counted for by an accompanying effect — namely, the con
densation of a very rare cloud into one more dense, but yet
quite elastic. The condensation may be conceived to take
place by the closing together of an immense number of
small parcels of clouds, as if the parts of a sponge were
made to approach by pressure, and therefore with a very
soft and gentle vibration.
    But when a spark strikes from the lowest cloud to the
earth the condensation must be into rain, (for there is no
intermediate slate between that cloud which is already at
its lowest density and rain,) therefore the atmosphere has
to collapse upon solid inelastic particles of rain, which must
produce a sharp clap ; and this every person knows to be
the effect, when lightning strikes down from over our
heads.
    The wind during all   the day had been south-west, but
when the storm commenced the wind ceased on the north*

                                  BOOK THIRD.
The     author having in his first volume established the laws
according to which the centres of gravity of the celestial
bodies move, proceeds in the second to consider the phaeno-
mena occasioned         the figure of these bodies, and the cir
                        by
cumstances peculiar to each.           However great the extent
and importance of the inquiry contained in the first vo
lume may be, the second          still more remarkable, on ac
                                    is
count of the difficulty of the subject, the elegance of the
analysis, and the great ingenuity with which             applied.
                                                              it   is
   The author proceeds to treat of the figure of the celestial
bodies.    This figure depends on the law of gravity at their
surface, and this gravity, the result of the attractions of all
the molecules which compose them, depends on their figure.
The connection between these two unknown quantities
renders their determination very difficult.        The author re
solves this problem          by
                           supposing the celestial bodies to be
covered
            by
            a  fluid   the method employed

                                                    him to obtain

                                        simple differentiations to
the most extensive results.
   Considering,       the first place, the spheroids as being
                       in
homogeneous, he forms the expression of their attractions
upon  a  point given with respect to three rectangular axes.
The expression depends on triple integral, which
                                     a                        sus       is
ceptible of   aconvenient transformation.       The author then
develops the general principle, applying these results to
spheroids terminated        finite surfaces of the second order;
                              by
and supposing, in the first place, the point attracted to be
within the spheroid, he thence deduces that point placed  a

in the interior of    an elliptic stratum, whose internal and ex
ternal surfaces are alike, and similarly situated, is equally
attracted by all parts.
    He, afterwards obtains the attractions of the spheroid
with respect to the three rectangular axes, by means of a
 tingle definite integral ; but this integral only being pos
sible in itself, when the spheroid is one of revolution, the
author makes an application of it to surfaces of this kind,
and determines in finite terms the value of their attractivt
force on a point placed in their interior.
    He afterwards considers the attraction of the same sphe
roids on an external point.           This inquiry presents more
difficulties than the preceding, but it may however be re
ferred to it.     With this view the author calls to recollec
tion that the attractions of the spheroid', parallel to the three
axes, are given by the partial differences of the function
 which expresses the sum of the molecules of the spheroid
 divided by their respective distances from the points at
 tracted. He obtains the value of this function, when the
 point attracted is at a very great distance, and he gives an
 equation of the second order of partial differences which
 determine it generally.        He afterwards shows, by the help
 of series, that this function is the product of two factors,
 one of which is the mass of the spheroid, and the other ia
 merely the function of its eccentricities, and of the co
 ordinates of the point attracted ; whence it follows, that
 the attractions of two elliptic spheroids which have the
 same centre, the same position of the axes, and the same
 eccentricities on the same external point, are to each other
 as the masses of these spheroids.         It also follows from this
 property,   that  in  order  to obtain  the  attraction of the pro
 posed spheroid      on   the   point attracted,   it is sufficient to
 know the attraction on the same point of a spheroid, whose
 eccentricity and position of the axes are the same, and the
 surface of which would pass by this point.               The author
 shows that there is but one spheroid which satisfies this
 condition.     The research after the attraction of these sphe
 roids in points which are exterior to them is thus referred
 to the case where the attracted point is on their surface.
 Hence results the expression of this attraction in finite
 terms, when the spheroid is an ellipsoid of revolution,
 which completes the theory of the attraction of elliptic
 spheroids. The author gives the method of extending these
 results to the case where the attracting spheroid is composed
 of variable elliptic.layers, of density, position, and eccen
 tricities, according to any given law.          He afterwards con
                                                                 sider*

aiders in a general manner the attractions of any spheroids J
he recollects in the first place that this attraction is given
by an equation of the second order of partial differences.
The whole theory of the attraction of spheroids flows from
 this fundamental equation. The author, after making it
 undergo various transformations, undertakes to deduce from
 it,   by means of series, the value of the function required;
 he then shows that with respect to spheroids which differ
 very little from the sphere, we may attain them without
 the aid of integration,              by
                                  means of very remarkable equa
                                                a
 tion which takes place on their surface.                sufficient for
                                                        It   is
 this purpose, to develop their radius in         series of functions
                                                    a
 of particular kind, given by the nature of the question.
   a
 The author proves that this development can take place in
 one way only, and gives shortly afterwards               very simple
                                                             a
 method of forming it.            He afterwards establishes        very
                                                                   a
 elegant theorem relative to the definite integration of double
 differentials which are the products of two of these func
 tions, and he deduces from them, that we may get rid of
 the first two terms of the development of the radius of the
 spheroid,         fixing the origin of the co-ordinates at its
                      by
 centre of gravity, and taking for the sphere, which differs
 very little from          that which
                                it,      equal to
                                           is         in volume. By
                                                        it
 the help of these considerations, the author obtains, in the
 simplest manner, the attractions of homogeneous spheroids
 differing little from the sphere on the points which are
either interior or exterior to them; and he extends these
results to the case in which the spheroids are heterogeneous,
whatever in other respects may be the law according to
which the figure and density of their layers vary. Passing
afterwards to the inquiry respecting the attractions of any
given spheroids, which depend equally on the function ex
pressing the sum of their molecules divided                  by
                                                         their respec
tive distances from the point attracted, the author shows
that this function may be easily determined, when we have
its expression         series, for the two cases where the point
                           in
attracted       situated on the prolongation of the axis of the
                 is
pole, or in the plane of the equator.          This consideration,
which simplifies considerably the inquiry               in
                                                    question, being
applied to the ellipsoid, furnishes          new demonstration of
                                                a
the theorem mentioned above, and which consists in this,
that the function which determines the attraction of these
bodies      the product of two factors, one of which
            is                                                      the

mass itself of the ellipsoid, and the other only depends on
the eccentricities and position of the axes.
    The author afterwards considers the figure which sphe
                                                                 roids,

Voids, supposed to be fluids, would assume in consequence
of  the mutual attraction of all their parts, and of the other
forces which act upon them.         For this purpose he seeks
the figure which satisfies the equilibrium of a homogeneous
fluid mass, endowed with an uniform rotatorv motion about
a fixed axis.     He supposes this figure to be that of an el
lipsoid of revolution, whose rotatory axis is the axis of re
volution itself.    He determines the attractive and centri
fugal forces which flow from this hypothesis; and., substi
tuting them in the equation of the equilibrium of fluids, he
thence obtains an equation independent of the co-ordinates
of the surface, which establishes the relation that must
exist between the eccentricity of the spheroid and the polar
axis, in order that the equation of equilibrium may be satis
fied. Hence it follows, that the elliptic figure satisfies the
conditions of equilibrium, at least when the ratio of the
eccentricity to the polar axis is properly determined in the
function of the centrifugal force, and of the density of the
body.     On this supposition, the gravity at the pole, is to
the gravity at the equator, as the diameter of the equa
tor is to the polar axis, and we deduce from it tfce general
relation of the latitude to the gravitation.      These results
also make known the ratio of the ecceniricity to the polar
axis, and that of the centrifugal force to the density of the
body, by means of the length of the seconds pendulum,
and the length of the degree of the meridian, both being
observed in the same point of latitude.      The author applies
these formulae to the earth, supposed to be an ellipsoid of
revolution and homogeneous; and fixes on this hypothesis
the ratio of the polar axis to the diameter of the equator^
   The author afterwards examines whether the equation
which gives the ratio of the eccentricity to the polar axis
be susceptible of several real roots.     He shows that with
respect  to the  same  motion  of rotation, the number of these
real roots is reduced to two, whence it results, that to the
same angular motion of rotation two different figures of
equilibrium answer ; but the rapidity of this motion is li
mited, for equilibrium could not take place with an elliptic
figure when the duration of rotation does not surpass the
product of one hour and 90 seconds, into the square root
of the ratio of the mean density of the earth to that of the
fluid mass.     The time is here reckoned according to the
new division.      The observed rotations of Jupiter and of the
sun are within the limits of this duration.
   One would suppose that this limit is the one at which the
                                                           fluid

     206    Analysis of the Micanique    Celeste of M. La Place.
     fluid would begin to be dissipated in consequence of a very
     rapid rotatory motion.      The author shows that this is not
    the case, since at this limit the gravity at the equator still
    surpasses the third of the gravity at the pole ; whence it
    follows, that if the equilibrium ceases to be possible, it is
«.  because with a more rapid motion we could not give to the
    fluid mass an elliptic figure, so as to make the result of its
    attraction and of the centrifugal force perpendicular to the
    surface.
        The author afterwards examines if equilibrium can sub
    sist with a figure elongated towards the poles, and proves
    that this could not take place.      What has been said as to
    the possibility of two states of equilibrium relative to the
    same angular motion of rotation, does not carry with it
    this possibility relative to one and the same primitive force:
    in order to know w hat ought to be concluded in this re
    spect, the author considers a fluid mass primitively agitated
    by any given forces, and then abandoned to itself and to
    the mutual attraction of all its parts : by the centre of gra
    vity of this mass supposed to be immoveable, he conceives
    a plane oik- which the sum of the areas, described by the
   projections of the radii vectores of each molecule, and mul
    tiplied by the respective masses of these molecules, to be
   at the commencement of the motion a maximum.               This
    plane will constantly maintain this property; also, when
   after a great number of oscillations the fluid mass shall
   assume an uniform rotatory motion about a fixed axis,
   this axis will be perpendicular to the plane just mentioned,
   which will consequently become that of the equator, and
   the rotatory motion will be such that the sum of the areas
   on this plane will remain the same as at the origin of the
   motion.     This consideration determines the motion of ro
   tation and the figure of the body ; whence it follows, that
   with respect to the same primitive impulse, there is only one
   elliptic figure which can satisfy the equilibrium.     The au
   thor observes, that the axis about which the rotatory motion
   is established, being, from the origin of the motion, per
   pendicular to the plane of the maximum of the areas, was
   also at this period the axis of the greatest moments, and
   we find that it still preserves this property during the mo
   tion.    This constancy in the initial properties forms a re
   markable and hitherto unnoticed analogy between the axis
   of the greatest moments and the place of the maximum of
   the areas.
       The author, in what precedes, has shown that the elliptic
                                                            figure

   Analysis of the Mfcanique Cileste of M.La Place.                  207
 figure satisfies the equilibrium of a homogeneous fluid mass,
.endowed with an uniform rotatory motion about a fixed
 axis; but in order to resolve this problem completely, we
 must determine a priori all the possible figures of equili
 brium, or ascertain that the elliptic figure is the only one
 which fulfils these conditions.          We perceive besides, that
 in    the inquiry into   the figure  of the planets we ought not
 to confine ourselves to the case of homogeneity ; but then,
 this inquiry, considered in a general point of view, becomes
 extremely difficult.       Fortunately it is simplified relatively
  to the planets and satellites, on account of the small diffe
  rence which exists between the figure of these bodies and
  that of the sphere, which admits of our neglecting the
  square of this difference and the quantities which depend
  on it.     In order to treat this problem in the most general
  manner, the author considers the equilibrium of a fluid
  mass covering a body formed of layers of variable densities,
  endowed with a rotatory motion about a fixed axis, and
  solicited by the action of foreign bodies ; and he establishes
  the general equation of this equilibrium, when the covered
  spheroid differs very little from a sphere.          This spheroid
  may besides be entirely fluid ; and it may be formed ol a
   solid nucleus covered by a fluid : in these two cases, which
   are reduced to one only, if the spheroid be homogeheous,
   the preceding equation determines its figure, that of the
   fluid strata which cover   it,   and also gives,  by  simple diffe
   rentiation, the variation of the gravity at its surface. When
   there are no foreign bodies, in which case the spheroid, sup
   posed to be homogeneous and of the same density as the
   fluid,
        is   only solicited by   the attraction of its molecules and
   the centrifugal force of its rotatory motion     ;   its figure be
   comes that of an ellipsoid of revolution, on which the in
   creases of gravity and the diminutions of radii are propor
   tional to the squares of the sines of the latitudes      ;  from all
   which the author concludes that the elliptic figure          is then
   the only one which satisfies the equilibrium.         This demon
    stration rests entirely on the sole hypothesis, that the figure
    of the spheroid differs very little from the sphere but
                                                                       a it

    requires the development of the radius of this spheroid in
    series of functions ofa     particular kind, which the author
    has demonstrated above to be always possible        :  hut in order
    to avoid all the difficulties which this development might

    sucha    way as to render it   linear with respect to the radius
                                                                  vector

20B    Analysis of the Mecanique     Celeste  of M. La Place.
vector of the spheroid.    Supposing afterwards the action of
foreign   powers  to be nothing,   we deduce from this equa
tion, and by differentiations only, that if the spheroid
sought be one of revolution, it can only be an ellipsoid
which is reduced to a sphere, when there is no rotatory
motion ; so that the sphere is the only surface of revolution
which satisfies the equilibrium of an immoveable homo
geneous fluid mass.       Hence it is afterwards concluded ge
nerally, that if the fluid mass be solicited by any very small
forces whatever, there is only one possible figure of equili
brium v for, by supposing that there are several, there would
of course be several different radii, which being substituted
in the equation of equilibrium, would verify it; and as this
equation is linear with respect to these radii, the sum of any
two of them would still satisfy equally as well as their dif
ference. Hence the author ingeniously deduces, that this
difference must be nothing ; from which he concludes,
that the spheroid can be in equilibrium in one way only.
   Afterwards comes the consideration of the equilibrium
of a homogeneous fluid mass which covers a spheroid of a
different density.    On this head he observes, that we may
regard this sphere as being of the same density with the
fluid, and place in its centre a force reciprocally as the
square of the distances.     By means of this consideration,
we easily obtain the equation of equilibrium for this sphe
roid; and it results that there are generally in this case, and
when the spheroid is one of revolution, two figures of equili
brium. When there is no rotatory motion, and when we
consider the foreign forces as nothing that mutually attract
the molecules of the body, one of these two figures is sphe
rical, and both are so if the spheroid be homogeneous ;
which confirms the preceding results.
 . After having thus obtained the figures of revolution which
satisfvthe equilibrium of a homogeneous fluid mass which
COPersra sphere, the author gives the method of deducing
from it those which are not of revolution.       With this view
he transfers to any given point the origin of the angles
which determine the position of the radius vector in space,
angles which were previously taken into account, reckoning
from the extremity of the axis of revolution.       By this me
thod all these angles enter into the expression of the radius
vector ; and as, in consequence of what precedes, this ra
dius satisfies the equation of equilibrium, whatever may be
the position of this new origin, it will still satisfy it when
we vary this origin in any way whatever.          This variation
only  influences  the excess  of the radius  vector of the sphe*

foid above that of the radius of the sphere, from which it
differs very little ; and as the equation of equilibrium                     is.
linear with respect to the radius of the spheroid,                will it
still be satisfied   ifwe add any number of these excesses to'
the constant part which enters into the expression of the
radius vector. The spheroid to which this radius belongs
is   no longer of revolution       ;    formed
                                       it
                                       is            the sphere from

which the spheroid differs but little, augmented                  any  by
number of layers similar to the excess of tbe primitive sphe
roid of revolution above this sphere; these layers besides
being laid arbitrarily above each other.          The author shows
that these results may also be deduced from the reduction
 into  a   series of the attractions of the spheroids          which
                                                                  ;
 proves that the results obtained bv this method have all                          i
 possible generality, and that then.-          no fear of any figure
                                                is
 of equilibrium escaping them. This result confirms what
 has been previously seen, that the form given to the radius
 of the spheroids       not arbitrary, and flows from the very
                         is
 nature of their attractions.
     The author afterwards takes up the general equation of
  the equilibrium of spheroids differing little from spheres,
 and covered with fluid layers of variable densities. He
  deduces from      itthe equation for the figure of these layers.
  Examining particularly the case in which the spheroid sup
  posed to be entirely fluid      not solicited
                                   is                     by
                                                      any foreign ac
  tion, he shows that       can then only be an ellipsoid of re

  volution whose ellipticities increase and densities diminish
  from the centre to the surface           he obtains the equation
                                            ;
  which determines the ratio of these quantities to each other,
  and he deduces the limits of the oblatenessof the spheroid;

  to that in which gravity would be directed towards            single

   point. Such must have been the figure of the earth,            sup  if
  posed to have been primitively fluid.           In the case now in
   question, the directions of gravity from the surface to the
   centre no longer form       right line, but curve, the equa

D ECREMENTS        ON THE EDGES.          Let S s' (fig.  II,   PI. II.)
be a dodecahedron with rhombic planes. This solid, which
is one of the six primitive forms of crystals,' also presents
itself occasionally as a secondary form, and in this case it
has as a nucleus, sometimes a cube and sometimes an oc
tahedron.     Supposing the nucleus to be a cube :
    In order to extract this nucleus, it is sufficient succes
sively to remove the six solid angles composed of four
planes, such as s, r, t, &c, by sections adapted to the di
rection of the small diagonals.        These sections will display
as many squares    AEOl, EOO'E'.IO                O' I' (fig. 1 2)  &c,
which will be the faces of the cube.
   Let us- conceive that each of these faces is subjected to a
series of decreasing laminae solely composed of cubic mole
cules, and that every one of these laminae exceeds the suc
ceeding one towards its four edges, by a quantity equal to
one course of these same molecules.             Afterwards we shall
designate the decreasing laminae which envelop the nucleus
by the name of luminee of superposition. Now it is easy to
conceive that •the different series will produce six quadran
gular pyramids similar in some respects to the quandran-
gular steps of a column, which will rest on the faces of the
tube.    Three of these pyramids are represented in fig. 13,
and have their summits in s, t,       r.
   Now as there are six quadrangular pyramids, we shall
therefore have twenty-four triangles, such as O S I, O 1 1, &c.
But because the decrement Is uniform from s to t, and so
on with the rest, the triangles taken two and two are on
a level, and form a rhomb       sOt\.     The surface of the solid
will therefore be composed of twelve equal and similar
rhombs, i. e. this solid will have the same form with that
which is the subject of the problem. This structure takes
place, although imperfectly with respect to the crystals
called boracic spars, and the effect of the decrement on
which it depends attains its limits in a substance the nature
of which is not yet well determined, and which we shall
more particularly explain hereafter.
   The dodecahedron now under consideration is repre
sented by fig. 13, in such a way that the progress of the
decrement may be perceived by the eye. On examining the
figure attentively, we shall find that it has- been traced on

(he supposition that the cuhic        nucleus has on each of its
          17 ridges of molecules ; whence it tollows, that each,
  ed^es
 of lis faces is composed of 28Q facets of molecules, and
 that the whole solid is equal to 49 3 molecules.       On this
 hypothesis, there are eight laminae of superposition, the
 last of which is reduced to a simple cuhe, whose edges de
 termine the numbers of molecules which form the series
 i3, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3", 1, the difference being 2, because
 there is one course subtracted from each extremity.
     Now if instead of thi» coarse kind of masonrv,' which
 has the advantage of speaking to the eye, we substitute in
 our imagination the infinitely delicate architecture of na
 ture, we* must conceive the nucleus as being composed of
 an incomparably greater number of imperceptible cubes. In
 this case the number of laminae of superposition will also
'be beyond comparison greater than on the preceding hypo
 thesis. By a necessary consequence, the furrows which
 form these laminae by the alternate projecting and re-en
 tering of their edges will not be cognizable by our senses ;
 and this is what takes place in the polvhedra which crystal
 lization has produced at ease, without being disturbed in
 its progress.
     We may remark that instead of twenty-four decrements,
 which act two and two from one side to the other of each
  fidge, we may limit ourselves to admit only tweive, by
 considering each of the twelve others as being the continua
 tion of the former.        For instance, we may Suppose that
 decrements act directly towards the four edges of the basis"
 AEOI, (fig. 1 2) and towards those of the inferior basis,
 in order to produce the two pyramids which have their sum
 mits in s and in   /,     and that with respect to the other
 faces of the cube, they act solely towards the two edges 1   1',
  OO', and towards the opposite edges behind the cube, to
 produce secondary faces situated like       t
                                             I   V,Or O'. On
 this hypothesis, if  we conceive that the effects of the decre
 ments are prolonged from the other side of the edges which
 have served them as parting lines in such       a manner that
                                                              a by
 these prolongations, combining with the faces produced
 the immediate action of the decrements, circumscribe
 space, we shall evidently have the same dodecahedron.
 We shall afterwards see the utility of this remark.
     If the laminae applird on the cube decreased on all sides
 by two or more courses, then the pyramids being .more      el
 liptical, and their adjacent faces being no longer two and
 two on the same plane, the secondary crystal would be
 terminated  by    24 distinct triangles.

     We calldecrements in breadth those in which, as well                          it
in the preceding, each lamina has only the height of z
molecule ; so that their whole effect by one, two, three, &x.,
courses, is in the way of breadth. Decrements in height afe
those in which each lamina, exceeding only ihe following
one by a single course in the direction of the breadth, may
have a height double, triple, quadruple, &c, to that of a
molecule : this is expressed by saying that the decrement
takes place by two courses, three courses, &c. in height.
   The two kinds of decrement which we have mentioned
are combined together in the following example taken from
sulphuretted iron (Ferruginous pyrites J with twelve penta
gonal faces (fig. 14).
    This variety has also for its nucleus a cube, the position
of which with regard to the dodecahedron is sensible by
the bare inspection of fig. 15.      We there see that the por
tions superadded to the nucleus, instead of being pyramids,
asin the preceding case, are species of wedges which have
for their external faces two trapeziums, suchasOIpg,
AEp q, and two isoscele triangles Ep o, A q I.
    Let us conceive that the decrements are here made by two
ranges in breadth, between the edges O I and AE.               and        It
OO', EO and E'0', and in a similar manner and at the same
time on the opposite squares they are made by two ranges
in height between the edges EOandAI, O I and O'                                    I',
O   O' and E   E',  bywhich we see that these decrements take
place on the different faces of the cube, according to three
directions which cross each other at right angles. Then
the decrement       two ranks in breadth, tending to produce
                   by
a   more inclined face than that which results from the de
 crement by two ranks in height, each pile of decreasing
 laminae will no longer end           point, but

 be easy to see that these three edges are perpendicular to
 each other in consequence of the traverse directions which
 the decrements take.
     Besides, each trapezium, such as Op            (figs. 15 and

       Here an important consideration for the verification of
    the theory presents itself.      If we suppose that the. different
    pentagons    which   compose    the  surface of the dodecahedron
    all uniformly depend on the different edges of the cube as
    on so many hinges, so that, for example, the two pentagons
i   tltl/I',     ntOsO', are raised or lowered by the trape
    ziums 1 1 fib', O t n O', while they will be raised or lowered
    in a contrary direction by the triangles                 OsC/, we  l/Y,
    shall have an infinity of different dodecahedrons, the faces
    of which will be so many equal and similar pentagons.
    Among these dodecahedrons, a part of them will he possi
    ble in virtue of some law of decrement, and others cannot
    be produced by any law, and will be purely geometrical
    solids.    In each dodecahedron, the incidence of the pen
    tagon n 1 1   / I' on the pentagon n t O s O', at the place of
    the edge nt, which determines of itself all the other angles,
    will have a particular measure ; and calculation proves that,
    in the case of decrement now mentioned, this incidence
    ought to     b,e
                   126° 52' 8".    Now                   by
                                                measuring that which
    corresponds with         on the dodecahedron of sulphuretted
                                   it
    iron, we find       nearly 127°: thus the existence of the law
                       is it
    of decrement        confirmed       the agreement of calculation
                                                by
,   with observation.
      What we have now described also takes place with respect
    to all the other results of the theory compared with those
    of observation whence we ought to conclude, that the
                        ;
                                                  the true limits of the
                                        by by
    measurement given            calculation                  is
    approximation     found      means    of  the goniometer; so that
    the more carefully this instrument          constructed, the more
                                                          is
    distinctly   isthe crystal defined, the observer becomes more
    expert, and the nearer also do the results on both hands
    approach to perfect coincidence.
       The observation already made with respect to the dode
    cahedron with rhombic planes applies as of itself to the
    present case; that       to say, instead of 24 decrements, viz.
                                   is
    twelve of two courses        breadth, and the twelve others of
                                        in
    two courses in height, we can confine ourselves to the consi
    deration of the former twelve, only supposing their effects
    to extend from the edges of the other side, which serves
    them for parting lines.
       We shall give new example borrowed from metastatic
                               a
    carbonated lime (fig.       PI.     6,       1)^.
                                           We have seen, when ex
    amining the position of the nucleus, that the edges EO,
    01, IK, 8ec, were confounded with the lower borders*
       *

of this nucleus (fig. 7) ; whence it follows, that these same
borders or edges are parliug lines of the decrements, which,
in this case take place only with respect to them, without
any relation to the upper edges.
    Now it is easy to conceive, that the edges of the lamina
of superposition form altogether as many triangles, EsO,
             /
 I s' O, E O, &c, resting on those parting lines ; and as
these lines are six ip number, there will be twelve triangles,
six in the upper part and as many in the lower; and all
these triangles will be scalene, on account of the obliquity
of the parting lines.
    With respect to the upper edges of the laminae of super
position, they not only undergo no decrement, but it is
 even necessary that they should be prolonged, remaining
 always contiguous to the axis of the crystal, in order that
the nucleus may continue to be enveloped towards its two
 summits, as in a state in which it might increase without
changing its form.
    It is also to calculation combined with observation that
 it belongs to determine the law of decrement on which the
 dodecahedron depends.       Now if we suppose that this law
acts by one range, we prove that in this case the two faces
 produced on both sides of the same edge would be on the
 same plane, and, besides, that they would be parallel to the
 axis; which could not agree with the present case. There
 fore the simplest hypothesis which occurs is that of a de
 crement by two courses in breadth. Now/in this case cal
 culation demonstrates, that the dodecahedron arising from
 this law ought to have two remarkable properties ; the one
 is, that the obtuse angle SEO of any one of its faces has
 precisely the same measure with the obtuse angle of the
 nucleus, i.e. it is 101° 32' 13"; the pther consists in the
 respective inclinations of the faces of the dodecahedron at
 the meeting of ihe most salient edges; for instance, the in
 clination of slO on s] K is equal to that of two adjacent
 faces towards the same summit of the nucleus, i. e. it is
  104° 28' 40".    Now the mechanical measurement of the
 angles equally leads to the same degrees, and shows that
 the supposed law is in truth the law of nature.      It is this
 kind of translation or metastasis of the angles of the primi
 tive form on the secondary crystal, which has suggested the
 name of metastatic given to the variety in question.
    Fig. 17 (PI. Ill) will fully illustrate the explanation
which we have just given. It represents only the kind of
upper pyramid added to the nucleus, which being thus
partly uncovered, enables us to comprehend more easily the
                                                       progress

progress and effects of decrement by two courses. Each
edge of this nucleus has been divided into ten ; whence it
follows that every face is an assemblage of a hundred small
rhombs, which are the external facets of as many molecules.
This construction requires but eight laminae of superposi
tion for each of the same faces ; and these laminae being
united together three and three in the places which corre
spond to the upper edges of the nucleus, form kinds of de
creasing envelopes which are successively generated, and the
last of which is composed of eight small rhomboids. If we
consider the position of the line E s which represents one
of the terminating edges, composed of all the solid angles
which are contiguous to           it,
                               we shall remark that the geo
metrical summit      of the dodecahedron         situated
                                                       is     little

sidered as nothing, on account of its extreme minuteness.
  What we have said as to increments assumed by the laminae
of superposition towards their upper edges, in continuing to
envelop the crystal on th'13 same side,         consequence of
                                                   is   a
this general principle, namely, that the portions of laminae,
situated out of the reach of the decrements, extend,           mu    by
tually retrieving themselves,     such  manner as to avoid the
                                        in    a
re-entering angles which seem excluded                  by
                                                the crystalliza
tion, at least in solitary crystals *. But we may abstract
these simply auxiliary variations, as the effect of decre
ments only determines the form of the secondary crystal.
It even sufficient to take the decrements at their origin,
   is
in order to have as many planes; and these again being
afterwards extended in idea until they meet, lead to the
complete form of the polyhedron which they tend to pro
duce.    Hence     it thus that we confine ourselves to the
                        is
consideration of the initial effect of decrements, in calcula
tion of which the progress      always much more simple and
                                    is
expeditious than that of reasoning.
   It    useful, however, to be also able to give

account of all the details relative to the structure of cry          a

around   agiven nucleus, and thus produce an artificial imi

    The variety in question    is a rhomboid much more obtuse
than the nucleus,     and  the  great angle of which is 1 1 43 1 8^
$0'. Fig. 18 represents     it confined to its nucleus. In order
to extract the   latter at once,   it is necessary to have planes
trajecting by   the  oblique diagonals of the different faces of
the secondary     rhomboid.      One of these sections, for in
stance, that which passes by the diagonals drawn from a to
 t, and from a to u, and which intercepts the solid angle z,
 coincides with the face a b     df   of the nucleus. Now there
 are six solid angles situated laterally, viz. z, c, y, on one
 hand, and /, m, u, on the other. We shall therefore have
 six sections arranged three and three towards each summit ;
 and as the upper solid angles alternate with the lower, the
 Sections which intercept them preserving between them
 selves the same alternative, will cross so as to form six
 rhombs, which will give the surface of the nucleus.
     In order to conceive the structure of the secondary rhom
 boid, let us resume the dodecahedron with rhombic planes,
 which, as we have seen, is produced by virtue of a decre
 ment of one range of small cubes on the twelve edges of a
 cubical nucleus. The effect of this decrement in general is
 to produce on both sides of every edge, like 0 0', (fig. 12)
 two triangular faces O r O', O t O', which being on a level
 form a rhomb O r O' t, the small diagonal of which is the
 edge O O', which has served for the parting line.
     Let us now imagine that the nucleus is the primitive
                   J'
 rhomboid aba' (fig. 18) of carbonated lime. Let us conr
 ceive besides that the laminae of superposition decrease by
  one range of small rhomboids similar to this nucleus,
 but solely on the three edges, ab, ajf, an, which join
  around the summit a, and on those which correspond with
  them in the lower part.      Then, instead of twelve rhombs,
  no more than six will be formed, the small diagonals of
 which will be confounded, as in the other case, with the
  edges a b, af, a n, &c.
     The other parts of the laminae of superposition, i. e. those
  which are situated towards the lower edges b d,          df,fx,
  &c, as they do not participate in the decrements, will also
  undergo some variations, but which will tend merely to
  prolong the faces produced by these decrements, so as to
 make them intersect each other.             Hence it follows, that
  the laminae, instead of preserving the figure of the rhomb,
  as would happen if the decrement took place at once on all
  the edges, will pass successively in proportion as they shall
 become more remote from the nucleus, through the figure
 of the pentagon, and that of the triangle.           The developr

                     OnCrystallogruphy.                      21   J
Bient of the structure will assist us in forming a clear idea
of these variations.
    Let abdf (fig. 1 9 A) be the same rhomb with fig. 1 8,
what we have to say with respect to this rhomhus may be
easily applied to the five others.    Suppose it to be divided,
as represented    in fig. 19, into 81 partial rhombs, which
may be considered as the external facets of so many mole
cules : hence we have 729 molecules for the entire nucleus.
    The first lamina of superposition which must be applied
on the rhomb a b df, will be that which we see in fig. 16 B,
in which U I Z df represents the grand external face, and
CUlk', XZ/A', the two small superior faces. We shall
arrange this lamina with respect to the face a b   df  (fig. 19 A)
so that the point h' may be blended with the point k, the
point A' with the point A, and the point B' with the point
B. We at first see by this arrangement that the two su
perior ranges of the face abdf (fig. 19 A), both of them
continued betwen the lines a b, A h, on one hand, and
af, B h, on the other, remain exposed ; which puts in ex
ecution the law of decrement by one range of molecules.
    The lamina in question is a pentagon resulting from the
retrenchment of the three small rhomboids destined to com1-
plete it towards the base.     This retrenchment is necessary,
 that the lamina may, by its figure, be accommodated to the
 effect of the decrement, as we shall presently explain.
    The two ranges of rhomboids situated one by one on
both sides of the lines Ddf, Ed', (fig. B) are added, in or
 der that the nucleus may be enveloped, and continue te
 increase towards the edges Id, J'd, (fig. 19 A) which cor
 respond with these lines.      These two ranges being suffi
 cient for filling up the vacuum, we perceive that it is not
necessary to add similar ones towards the adjacent edges of
 the laminae of superposition applied on the adjoining faces.
 The operation will indicate of itself what is to be done re
 lative to this kind of additions.
     Fig. 19 C represents the second lamina of superposition,
 which ought to be applied on the preceding one in such a
 way that the points   i', D', E',     may be confounded with
                                      d,
 those which are marked      by the same letters (fig. 19 B). As
 the crystal ought to assume      anew increment towards the
 edges   which  correspond  with  Fdf,  Gdf, we conceive that
 instead of one range added on both sides of the lines Ddf,
    df, (fig. 19          necessary to add two (fig. 19 C) on
E                B)
                 it
                 is
 the two sides of the lines Yd', Gcf.
     We shall place successively      in
                                      the same way the two    la

minae represented by figures l 9 D and 1 9 E, observing that
the letters marked with an accent, in each figure, ought to
coincide with the same letters not accented in the preceding
figure.
    Beyond the term which answers to fig. 19 E, the laminae
of superposition cease to envelop the inferior edges of the
crystal, by their borders {bords) analogous to these edges
 {aretes), and are reduced to simple triangles.      This will be
easily conceived by considering the laminae represented by
figures 19 F, 19 G, 19 H, the positions of which are de
termined according to the same conditions with the above.
    The number of rhomboids which compose the different
laminae being always diminishing, the last lamina is reduced
to a simple rhomboid d' (fig. 19 I), which will attach itself
to that denoted by the same letter (fig. 19 H), and will
form the summit of one of the lateral solid angles of the
secondary rhomboid.
    We now see the reason why the laminae of superposition
assume figures successively pentagonal and triangular in
issuing from the nucleus.         For example, every lamina de
tached   from   the crvstal (fig. 18) by a section which passes
between    the  angle z and the middle of the lines zt,zu, is
necessarily triangular, and has the same structure with
F   /' R' (fig. J 9 G), i. e. it is really embattled (creneUe) at
its basis in such a way, that the imperceptible furrows, which
exist on the crystal produced by Nature at the basis of these
kind of laminae, are on the prolongation of those which pro
ceed from the decrement towards the edges.              There are
even crystals the surface of which, from the effect of a less
finished crystallization, exhibits similar furrows, which run
over the whole extent of the faces in directions parallel to
 the small diagonals.
    Decrements on the Angles. — The decrements which have
 ridges {aretes) for parting lines, and which we call decre
 ments on the borders (bords), would not be sufficient to ex
 plain all the diversities of form presented by secondary
 crystals.   Observation and calculation prove that we must
 also admit of decrements which have angles for points of
 separation, and the action of which is applied parallel to
 the diagonals. We shall call them decrements on the angles.
    In order to enable students to comprehend the method
 which I have followed in my inquiry into these new de
 crements, I shall remark, that the same substances which
 present the dodecahedron with pentagonal planes, origi
 nating from the cube, and which might in the same way
                                                           assume

assume the form of the dodecahedron with rhombic planes,
will also he met with under that of the regular octahedron.
Now it appears, on the first general view, that it is possible
to refer the structure of this octahedron to a decrement on
the edges of a cube ; fur, if we confine ourselves to decreas
ing the laminae of superposition, merely fin the edges of
two opposite faces of this cube, for example, on those of
the superior base       AEOI           (fig. 2o), and of the inferior
A' E' 0' V, we shall have in general two pyramids placed
on these same bases ; and if we suppose besides that the
faces of each pyramid are prolonged until they meet those
of the other pyramid, which does nothing more than con
tinue the effect of the law of decrements in the space situ
ated between the bases of the cube, we shall arrive at an
octahedron, the angles of which will vary according as the
law shall determine a more or les6 considerable number of
subtracted rows.            But theory demonstrates, that there is
no law, however complex we may suppose                 it,    which      ca
                                                                          is
pable of giving equilateral triangles for the faces of this oc
tahedron.
     On the other hand,      if      we divide   a    regular octahedron
originating from the cube, we perceive that the cubical nu
cleus  is  situated in this octahedron,         in  such away that each
of the six solid angles of the first answers to the centre of
 one of the faces of the second, which could not take place
 in the hypothesis of decrement on the edges. Fig. 20 re
                         a
 presents this arrangement      ;      and we may conceive from                a
 simple inspection, that in order to obtain the nucleus, we
 must successively lay down the six solid angles of the oc
 tahedron    by   perpendicular sections on the axes that pass                 by
 these same angles, which would necessarily be parallel to the
 faces of the cube.
 I     have concluded from the statement of the position just
 mentioned, added to the impossibility of here applying
  theoretical calculation, that the law of decrements has
  attained its object in these cases,       by   a   route different from
 that which      leads  to   the  forms   previously described    ; and the
  inquiries   relative  to   this   object have developed    a   new order
  of facts greatly contributing to the fecundity of crystalliza
  tion, and at the same time to that of the theory.
     Let0   1   V  O' (fig. 21) be one of the faces of the cubical
  nucleus,     subdivided       intoa     multitude of small squares,
  which shall     be  the   bases   of as  many molecules.         We may
  consider   rows    or  files  of   molecules   in  two   different  direc
  tions, namery, in the direction of the edges, like the row
  designated    by  the letters a, n, q,  r',        &c, or  in   the direc

   420                  On Crystallography.
  tion of the diagonals, like the rows one of which is de
  signated by a, u, c, d, e,f, &c; the other by n, t, /, m,
 p, o, r, s; a third by q, v, k, u, x, y, z, &c. See fig. 22,
  which represents separately one of these ranges or rows.
     The molecules of the ranges parallel to the edges touch
 by one of their faces, and the ranges themselves are simply
 in juxta-position. The molecules of the ranges parallel to
  the diagonals touch by one ridge only, and the rows are as
 if dovetailed into each other. Now it seems to be well as
 certained that the laminoe piled up on the faces of a cubical
 or other nucleus, also decrease successively in several cases
 by subtraction of these ranges parallel to the diagonals.
     Here the faces produced in virtue of the decrement are
 no longer simply striated, as in decrements on the edges,
 but are full of points, which being all on a level, and es
 caping the eye from their minuteness, present only the
 aspect of a plain surface.
                                             which are placed
 over each other, issuing from the faces of a cube, decrease
 by a single row on all the angles of these same faces, this
 decrement will produce the regular octahedron, the mecha
 nical division of which we have explained.
     In order the better to comprehend this result, we shall
 here again adopt the synthetical method, and run over the
 series of laminae of superposition, by indicating the auxiliary
 variations, which they undergo, and which assist the effect
,of the decrement, to which every thing may be referred.
     Let AEO1 (fig. 23 A, PI. IV) be the superior base of
 the nucleus subdivided into 81 small squares, or facets of
 molecules.     What we are about to say relative to this base
 piay equally be applied to the five other faces of the cube.
     Fig. 23 B represents the first lamina of superposition,
 which should be placed above A EO I (fig. 23 A), in such
 a manner that the point i/ answers to the point e, the point
 (£ to the point a, the point o' to the point o, and the point
 i' to the point i. We see in the first place by this arrange
 ment, that the squares Ee, A a, Oo, Ii, (fig. A) remain
 empty ; which is the initial effect of the law of decrement
 alluded to. We see moreover that the edges QV, PN,
 LC, FG, (fig. B) exceed by one row the edges EA, EO,
 O I, T A, (fig. A) as this is necessary that the nucleus may
 he enveloped towards the same edges, and that the solid
 may increase as usual in the parts to which the decrement
 does not extend.
     The superior face of the second lamina will be similar
     B K H D, (fig, 23 C) and it will be necessary to place
                                                             this

    It  follows from what has been said, that the laminae of
 superposition, when applied on the base EAIO, (fig. A)
 produce,          by
                 the assemblage of their decreasing edges, four
 faces, which, issuing from the points               A,          E,

that the faces produced                 by

  triangles joined base lo base, or a quadrilater.        We see
  (fig. 24)   one   of  these quadrilaters, and in which   the in
 ferior angle o is blended with the angle O of the nucleus"
  (fig. 20) and ihe diagonal t x represents the edge H K
  (fig. 23 C) of the lamina BKHD, which is the most ex
 tensive in the direction of this same edge.         As the num
 ber of the laminae of superposition producing the tri
 angle t ox (fig. 24) is less than that of the laminae con
 stituting the triangle tax, and as there is here only a single
 lamina which precedes the lamina BKHD,                   (fig. C)
 while there are six which follow it as far as the cube z
 (fig. I) inclusively, the triangle t s x, (fig. 24) composed of
 (he aggregate of the borders of these last laminae,       will be
 much higher than the inferior triangle t ox, as expressed
 by the figure.
     The surface of the secondary solid will therefore be
 formed of 24 quadrilaters, disposed three and three around
 each solid angle of the nucleus : but as, in decrements by a
 Simple range on all the edges, the faces produced on both
 sides of each edge are on the same plane; so in decrements'
 by a range on all the angles, the faces which originate in
 the three sides of each solid angle, such as 0 (fig. 20), are
 on a level so as to form but one face : and since the cube
 has eight solid angles, each composed of three plain angles,
 the secondary crystals will have eight faces, which, on ac
 count of the regularity of the nucleus, will be equilateral
triangles, i. e. the secondary crystal will be a regular octa
hedron.       One of these triangles is represented at fig. 26,
so    as to enable   us to judge, at a single glance, of the ar
rangement      of  the  cubes which concur in forming it.
     This level of faces produced by subtractions of a range
from both sides of the same edge, or around the same
solid angle, is a general result of the crystallization whicht
takes place for any primitive form whatever.
     The circumstance just considered, and which occurs in
muriated soda, sulphuretted iron, sulphuretted lead, &c.y
affords a new example of a form which, although primitive
in certain species, performs in others the function of *
secondary one. Theory thus traces the limit that separates
objects which the eye would be tempted to confound.
     If decrements had not their complete effect, that is to'
say, if they stopped short of the limit where the faces they
produce incline to unite in a point, some faces parallel to
those of the nucleus would remain on the secondary crystal.-
The first would then have fourteen faces, namely, six ar
ranged like those of a cube, and eight situated like those of
                                                         a regular

of sulphuretted iron than this modification,                       to   which   we
give the name of cubo-octahedral subphuretted iron.
   Here the remark again occurs which we made
                                                    with re
spect to decrements on the edges.   If we confine our con
sideration to the immediate effects of decrements on
                                                         the
angles of two opposite faces, for example, on those of                          the
bases     A E O I, A' E' &          V, (fig. 20) and if       we
                                                       subsequently
imagine the          eight faces to which these decrements give ex
istence, are         prolonged between the bases to the point of
intersecting         each other, the result will always be a

limit.
   If the law of these decrements followed a more

                                            angle, would no
longer be on a single plane; they would incline
                                                       towards
each other, and the secondary solid would have

faces which would also be trapezoids, but with
                                                    angles of a
different measure.
   The trapezoidal analcime* has a structure of this

angles of the primitive cube. The form which results
                                                               is
completely similar to that of the trapezoidal garnet ;

the dodecahedron with rhombic planes.
   Let us now choose for a primitive form the
                                                     rhomboid
represented by figure 27, which differs from the cube

to the summits A, O', and that this decrement takes
                                                          place
by two ranges ; then, instead of twenty-four faces no

                                                     prolonged
until they meet, they will compose the surface of a

    The decrements which take place on the angle, whether
superior or inferior, are susceptible of several variations, on
which it is proper to give some details. I shall attempt to
represent these variations by the aid of a graphic method^
which will facilitate its comprehension.
    Let Gg (fig. 29) be any given rhomboid which has its'
summits in Sands, letSg"sG" (fig. 30) be a quadrilater
taken on the oblique diagonals S^", G's, of two opposite
faces, and on the edges S G", sg", comprised between these
diagonals. This quadrilater, which [ call the principal Sec
tion of the rhomboid, is here subdivided into a multitude
of similar small quadrilaters, which represent the principal
sections of so many molecules : lastly, letSGg''Gv (fig.
31) be the same face as figure 29, subdivided into facets
of molecules. If we suppose that the angle g" undergoes a
decrement by a simple course, the small rhomboid which
answers to n og" z, on the first lamina of superposition, will
be subtracted ; whence it follows, that the edge of this la
mina will have the direction ox, and the distance between
the angle g", which is the parting line of decrement, and
the same edge, will be measured by an oblique demi-diago-
nal g' r of the molecule.
    If the decrement takes place by two courses, in which
case the edge of the first lamina of superposition will cor
respond with cd, the distance in question will be measured
by an entire oblique diagonal g" n of the molecule. Thence
we shall conclude, that in general, in decrements on thfc
angles, the distance between one lamina and the succeed
ing, which is the same with that between the point of de
parture and the edge of the first lamina, is equivalent to
 as many demi-diagonals of this molecule as there are courses
 subtracted ; whereas, in the decrements on the edges, the
 distance between two consecutive laminae contains a num
 ber of entire breadths of the molecule equal to the number
of courses subtracted.
    This being done, let us conceive a decrement by two
 courses on the angle g". In this case the quadrilater rie ap,
 (fig. 30) being a segment made on the first lamina of su-

 perposition*, the decreasing edge of this lamina will coin
 cide with the small edge e n, since g n is the same diagonal
 as fig. 31 . Thus if we draw the straight line g" e h, it will
 be found to rest on the face produced by the decrement.
 Now in this case g h is parallel to the axis S s, as demon
 strated by the help of geometry ; whence it follows, that
 the secondary faces are arranged like the panes of a prism.
      If
       the decrement followed a more rapid progress, as if it
  took place by four courses, in which case the edge of the
 first lamina of superposition would coincide with the line
 y q, then the line       g''
                          q   S' would indicate the position of
 the faces produced by the decrement              whence we see that
                                                  ;
 they    would  rise   above   those   of  the  nucleus, and would
 compose     the   surface   of    arhomboid    more acute than this
 nucleus.
     If, on the contrary, the decrement look place in height,
 then the line ug"         which we suppose to indicate the po
 sition of the faces produced, would be thrown towards the
 inferior part of the axis     : hence we conclude, that in this
 case the faces of the secondary crystal, which would always
 be   a rhomboid, would be found situated in direction con
                                                       a
 trary to those of the nucleus,         i.e. they would be turned
 towards the edges of the latter.
    The hypothesis of decrement

                                               two courses in height
 here gives us        remarkable result, which consists in the
                      a
secondary rhomboid being absolutely similar to the nucleus.
We shall see, when speaking of certain varieties of quartz
and of tourmaline, that            confining ourselves to the con

sideration of certain facets taken among those which limit
them, and         supposing these facets prolonged until they
                 by
intersect each other, we should have one of those imita
tions of the primitive form given            by law of decrement.

face produced, which will be perpendicular to the axis.

 by   two courses in breadth, would give faces inclined like

  the line S a it i. e. the secondary crystal would be a rhom
  boid turned like the nucleus, and more obtuse. This case
  is that of the binary oligiste iron mentioned above.
     Lastly, Can decrement take place in height ? In this
  case the faces produced, one of which is regarded as cor
  responding to the line K S m, will be rejected from the
  other side of the axis ; whence it is easy to see that they
  will incline towards the edges of the nucleus, in such a
  manner that the secondary rhomboid will have a position
  reversed with respect to that of this nucleus.
     Crystallization presents some examples of these different
  results. Those which relate to the two limits given by parallel
  positions, or perpendicular to the axis, are constant, L e.
  they take place with respect to all possible primitive rhom
  boids.    In the other cases the inclination of the faces pro
  duced by the same decrement varies according to the angles
  of the primitive rhomboid.
     The striae and striges on the faces of secondary crystals,
  when the operations of nature have not attained the per
  fection of which they are capable, frequently indicate, by
  their directions, those which follow the edges of the lamina?
  of superposition ; and these accidents, which confirm the
  theory in bodies capable of mechanical division, may also
t show the progress of crystallization, and the direction of
  the component laminae in those which are incapable of
  mechanical division, and assist us in catching by analogy
  the form and position of the nucleus, which otherwise
  might escape observation. We should, however, use with
  caution the indications furnished by these accidents, since
  it sometimes happens that the surface of the nucleus itself
  is striated. This singularity seems to be the effect of an
  imperfect decrement, which experiences such great inter
  ruptions, that the faces resulting from it sensibly coincide
  with the primitive faces.         In like manner, it is not im
  possible  that  the faces  of a secondary    crystal may have striae
  in a direction different from that which ought -to result
  from the progress of the decrements.           But there are cases,
  such as those of certain garnets with 24 trapezoids, in which
  the striae are so palpable as to show plainly the mechanism
  of the structure.

   PROCEEDINGS OF THE FRENCH NATIONAL INSTITUTE
                      FOR THE YEAR 180S.
The      Institute held its anniversary on the 2d of January
1809 ; the following being the order of their proceedings.
    1st. Proclamation of the questions proposed, and prizes
adjudged by the class. 2d. Historical eulogy on M. Lassus,
by M. Cuvier, perpetual secretary.        3d. Memoir on the
navigation of the ancients, by M. fiuache. 4th. Historical
eulogy on M. Berthoud, by M. Delambre, perpetual se
cretary. 5th. Memoir on the levelling of plains by means
of the barorrleter, by M. Ramond. 6th. Historical eulo-
gitim on M. Ventenat, by M. Cuvier, perpetual secretary.
7th. Memoir on the means of facilitating the victualling of
fleets in Brest roads by navigable canals, by M. Rochon.
    The Class of Sciences had proposed as the subject of a
prize, to be awarded on the present occasion, " The theory
of the perturbations of the planet Pallas," discovered by
M. Others, or in general the theory of the planets, the ec
centricity and inclination of which are too considerable to
admit or our calculating the perturbations with sufficient
exactness by the methods at present known.            In order to
confine ourselves on so difficult a subject to what is in
dispensable, analytical formulae only are requisite, but ar
ranged in such a manner that an intelligent calculator may
apply them with certainly, either to the planet Pallas, or
to any other subsequent discovery. — The class has received
no memoir ; and if we reflect on the difficulty of the pro
blem, it will not appear astonishing.       But as the question
proposed is of the greatest interest with respect to the gene
ral theory of planetary perturbations, and as it is to be pre
sumed that leisure more than good will is wanting to ge
ometricians capable of treating this question, the class has
thought proper to renew the subject for the prize to be de
cided in January 181 1. The prize has been doubled ; being
 a medal of the value of 6000 francs.         The papers on the
 subject will not be received after the 1st of October 1810.
    The natural history of auimals has lately received from
 comparative anatomy some valuable additional lights, which
 have wonderfully improved the science of zoology, parti
 cularly from the description of the principal organs in se
 veral families, the oeconomy of which was almost entirelv
 unknown in the middle of the last century. The Institute

thinks to perform a service to ihe cause of science by point
ing oat to anatomists the orders or genera respecting which
it is important to be in possession of further information,
and with this view has chosen the following as the prize
question : " Ascertain if there exists a circulation in the
animals known by the name of asterice, or sea stars; echini,
or sea hedgehogs ; and holothurice, or sea priapi : and in
the event of a circulation existing, describe its progress and
the organs connected with it."
    This description will probably be accompanied with ob
servations made on living animals, and take a view of the
vessels of the organs of respiration, if there are peculiar
organs of this description, as well as those of the great cir
 culation. It would also be proper lo examine the chemical
 effect of respiration on air and wa'er.      This is not an in
 dispensable requisite, however. The examination of one
 species only in each of the three families is expected ; but
it is requisite that it should be profound, and accompanied
by intelligible drawings.     The prize offered is 3000 francs,
 and the competitors must give in their memoirs on or be
 fore the 1st of October 1810.      The prize will be publicly
 awarded on the first Monday     in January.
    A prize had been last year offered for an investigation of
 the causes of the various kinds of phosphorescence ; but so
many memoirs were transmitted on the subject, and they
 were so full of experiments, that the committee appointed
 to decide on their merits have postponed delivering their
 opinion.
    M. de Lalande, on offering a medal to the author of the
 newest and most curious observation, was well aware that
 it could not be awarded every year to discoveries so brilliant
 as those of the planets perceived by Messrs. Piazzi, Olbers,
 and Harding : he has therefore desired, that when there
 were no observations of so much interest, the medal should
 be given to the author of the best memoir on any astrono
 mical subject ; and if there should be no such memoir, he
 expressed a wish that the recompense in question should be
 granted to any pupil who has demonstrated zeal, constancy,
 and perseverance,    in the study of astronomy.
    The Institute, to whose lot it has not fallen this year to
 commemorate a newly-discovered planet, or to reward a
 memoir of any interest, has profited by bestowing the me
 dal as an encouragement.
     MM. Arago and Mathieu were the two astronomers who
 were considered as having the best claims to this gratuity.
     The former had been long employed as assistant to
                                                     M. Bouvard

                    French National Institute.
M. Bouvard in the Imperial Observatory,         and   was  sent
with   M.  Biot to Spain, where, by himself and in conjunc
tion with that gentleman, he measured the altitude of the
pole, the azimuth, the length oH the pendulum, some
grand triangles, and executed successfully the most delicate
operations of astronomy.       *
   M. Arago, having been made prisoner in the course of
his travels, escaped from Majorca, and took refuge in Al
giers, but was again taken in a Spanish vessel, when re
turning to France in an Algerine sloop, and carried pri
soner to Palamos, near Rosas, from which place we hope
he will be relieved by the victorious French arms.
   M. Mathieu, who supplied M. Arago's place in the
Observatory when the latter went to Spain, and who after
wards, when sent to Bourdeaux, Figeac, and Clermont,
measured at these three stations, in company with M. Biot,
the length of the pendulum, is now occupied at Dunkirk
in similar operations.
    In deciding on the claims of these two gentlemen, the
Institute reflected that M. Arago had recently received a
more lasting recompense for his services in being appointed
to the Board of Longitude.        The medal has therefore been
adjudged to M. Mathieu, as an encouragement to proceed
with his scientific labours.
Analysis of the Labours of the Class of Mathematical        and
            Physical Sciences. By M. Delambrk.
   The history of    the Class of Mathematical    Sciences this
year  affords  a remarkable  circumstance, —  one  of the most
difficult and important points of the mundane system treated
with the same success, although by very different methods,
by two geometricians of the first rank, who arrive by va
rious routes at the same conclusion, — a circumstance not
less worthy^of attention : the idea of this labour occurred
to them on the occasion of a memoir not less interesting,
read   to the class by a young geometrician, who, in the
first steps of his career, has proved himself a fit associate
for his superiors in years.
   These mutual succours afforded by men of science to
each other, which produce others not less fortunate and
frequently easier, are advantages peculiar to the mathemati
cal sciences ,over general literature.   In the former branch
of literature a new truth, an elegant theorem, is like a light
house, which exhibits its lustre at a distance, and renders
practicable, routes which were thought impervious,

    In order to give an idea of the three memoirs which we
are about to mention, it is necessary to recur to a remote
iera in the history of science.
    Astronomers had remarked a sensible acceleration in the
course of the moon : the other planets and the earth might
consequently have a similar although less rapid acceleration
in their motions. This question may perhaps appear indiffe
rent to those w ho are not aware of its consequences.     If the
earth be accelerated, it must be owing to its closer approach
to the centre of motion ; and if so, will it not end by being
precipitated on the sun ? This danger to be sure is far di
stant. If this acceleration existed, it would be prodigiously
slow, and it would not be until after an almost infinite num
ber of centuries that the catastrophe could happen, suppos
ing it to be possible ; for it is proved by the example of the
moon, that the acceleration only lasts a certain time, and af
terwards becomes slower: but although future generations,
have nothing to fear from this event, and if the planet, after
coming closer to the sun, afterwards removes from it, it
must nevertheless be confessed that the question is not less
important : it peculiarly interests those astronomers who
suppose, in all their calculations, an invariability of the
ellipses described by the planets.
    M. La Place was the first who examined this question.
By a learned but simply approximative calculation he attained
f his result, ascertaining that the axes and mean movements
are in reality invariable, at least when we consider them as
the first powers of the masses only, and the second of the
eccentricities and inclinations ; which is already sufficient
for tranquillizing astronomers with regard to the fate of out
planet, or rather wirh regard to their tables.
    M. Lagrange, struck with this conclusion, endeavoured
to extend it ; and by a curious theorem he proved the pro
position to be correct, even on considering all the succes
sive powers of the eccentricities ; but, in common with
M. La Place, he had only considered in the masses the
terms of a single dimension.
    Could the terms of the two dimensions produce an ac
celeration ? It would, indeed, be much slower: but the
question deserved examination, and this was undertaken by
M. Poisson. The calculation was uninviting on account
of its length ; it required all the resources of analysis, and
the knowledge of all the laws of the celestial motions: it
required a peculiar degree of attention, and a penetrating
eye, which at the first glance should be able lo perceive
all the forms that could be assumed by a complex expres

                    French National Institute.               231
sion, and a mind capable of devising a shorter and more
certain road.
   Such are the qualifications which M. Poisson has dis
played.     By these means he has attained the interesting
theorem, that the products of the two dimensions of the
masses do not furnish, in the successive integrations, any
term which gives a secular equation or an acceleration in
motion.     This is enough even for astronomers ; it is de
monstrated that, if this acceleration exists, it can only de
pend on terms of 4, 6, and 8, i. e. absolutely insensible
dimensions; which assures us of the stability of the plane
tary system.     The question at present therefore offers no
real interest, if there be not an analytical difficulty to over
come, which is still sufficient to excite the emulation of
geometricians.
   M. Poisson, in order to obtain his theorem, had only
pushed the approximation to the terms affected of the
squares, or of the products of the masses : having regard
to the variation of the elements which M. Lagrange had
regarded as constant, he knew hqw to give to the terms
which form the second approximation, a disposition which
admitted of demonstrating that none of these terms can
give to the grand axis a term proportional to the time. The
terms which ought to proceed from the variations of the
elements of the perturbing planets escaped this analysis ;
but, by ingenious methods founded on a method of M. La
Place, M. Poisson has proved that these kinds of terms
cannot produce in the grand axis any variation which in
creases as the time does.
   In geometry in particular, the route by which we attain
for the first time a difficult discovery is rarely the shortest
and most direct. There are propositions the truth of which
is apparent without our being able to demonstrate it : men
of science dread to involve themselves in immense calcula
tions, the success of which is problematical, and sometimes
give up an inquiry which presents too many difficulties.
But if the truth has been ascertained, as success is from
that moment certain, we take courage, and demonstrations
are simplified and multiplied: this is precisely what has
happened. The instant M. Poisson had demonstrated his
theorem, Messrs. Lagrange and La Place perceived that it
flowed out of principles and methods which had been for
merly explained.      M. Poisson attained his discovery by a
calculation in which he made use of the known formulae of
the elliptic motion ; M. Lagrange thought  "    that it ought to
                                P4                          have

 232               French National Institute.
 have been attained by the power of analysis, even without
 knowing the peculiar expressions of the quantities relative
 to the elliptic orbit.
    In this manner he demonstrates, in its whole possible
 generality, and whatever may be the inclination of the pri
 mitive orbit, that the variation of the great axis cannot con
 tain any term not periodical, either in I lie first or the second
 approxiynution, at least while regard is had in the latter
 only to the variations of the elements of the disturbed orbit.
This prevents the same analysis from being also extended
to the terms proceeding from the elements of the per
 turbing planets : it is because in this case the function is not
symmetrical with respect to the co-ordinates of all the
planets.
    But by carrying the planets, not to the centre of the sun,
but to the centre of gravity of the sun, and of the pianets
around which the motion is more regular than around the
sun, M. Lagrange obtains a symmetrical function, which
is the same with respect to all the planets: the calculation
then becomes uniform, and is not subject to any exception;
and we demonstrate by one and the same analysis, that the
great axis of each of the orbits cannot have, in the two first
approximations, any inequality increasing with the time.
    It is afterwards easy to pass from the motion around the
common centre of gravity to the motion around the sun ;
and we at length succeed in demonstrating the generab pro
position of the non-existence of the inequalities propor
tional to the time in the great axes of the planets referred
to the sun.
   To return to the memoir of M. Lagrange: we there find
his new formulae for the variations of the elements of the
planets, as well as their application to the variations of the
grand axes.      His analysis is worthy of the attention of
geometricians from its uniformity, generality, and elegance,
and because it is independent of the elliptic figure of the
orbits, and may be applied with the same success to every
other hypothesis of gravitation, in which the orbits would,
no longer be conic sections.
   The whole of thi3 analysis is preceded by a historical de
tail of this great problem, drawn up with ail possible clear
ness, in such a manner as to interest even those who should
not have all the knowledge necessary for following the au
thor into the whole details of his theory.
   In this memoir, read to the class on the 22d of August,
the generality of the analysis permitted M. Lagrange to
                                                          express

                      French National Institute.
express certain values by the symbols of functions : it was
useless for him to give developments which rendered the
demonstration less clear and more difficult: but in order to
apply his formulae to the numerical calculation of the plane
tary perturbations, these developments became indispensa
ble. In a supplement read to the class on the 2d of Septem
ber, M. Lagrange gave these calculations; but he knew
admirably well how to abridge them by the consideration
of the eccentric anomaly ; and in order to demonstrate the
exactitude of this new process, he showed that it led to the
same formulae which he had obtained by another way.
These substitutions, which should seem to have been very
complicated, admit of astonishing simplifications, by means
of several equations of condition which M. Lagrange has
 drawn from his theory.
     Before reading this memoir to the Class of Sciences,
M.Lagrange had communicated it to the Board of Longitude
on the same day on which M-La Place detailed the method
 by which he attained the same results.
     The object of M. La Place in this work, which he has
 printed separately, was the perfection of the methods he
 had given in the MScanique Celeste.          On endeavouring to
 give   to the  expressions of  the  elements  of the orbits, the
 simplest    form   of  which they are  susceptible, he succeeded
 in making      them   depend only on  partial differentials of one
 and the same function ; and what is remarkable, the coef
 ficients of these differences are only the function of the ele
 ments themselves ; an advantage also enjoyed by the for
 mulae of M. Lagrange, who had long ago given the example
 in the expression which he had found for the great axis,— an
 expression which had led him to demonstrate, in a very for
 tunate manner, the invariability of the mean motions, when
  we have regard only to the first power of the perturbing
 masses. M. La Place has subsequently given the same form
  to the differential expressions of the eccentricity of the orbit,
  the inclination and the longitude of the node.          It still re
  mained to transform in the same way the differential ex-
               of the longitudes of the epoch and of the perihe-
    ion. This is what M. La Place executes in the supplement
  firessions
  of which we now give an account ; and thereby the finite
  variations of the differentials flow from the development of
  a very simple function, which performs an important part
  ;n the Mecaniqice Celeste. These new expressions lead very
  naturally to the elegant theorem of M. Poisson on the in

elements    of the planetary orbits ; they give with the same
facility  the two inequalities of the lunar motion in longi
tude and latitude, which depend on the flattening of The
earth, formerly determined by M. La Place.
   The results are therefore perfectly identical with those
found by M. Lagrange by a totally different way.         They
would be mutually confirmed if occasion required, and if
the two methods did not carry their demonstration along
with them. The most remarkable difference consists in
M. La Place having adroitly avoided a very great analytical
difficulty, and capable of impeding the progress of a less
eminent geometrician ; while on the other hand M. La
grange has'overcome the difficulty; and by giving, like
M. La Place, the theorem, so important to astronomers, of
the invariability of motions, he has furnished analysts at
the same time with formulae remarkable for their elegance.
But it is not less curious to observe with what facility, by
a simple transformation, M. La Place has elicited these new
truths from the formulae in which they were contained.
   The secretary of the Institute then proceeded to give a
detailed account of the works composed during the year
1808 by members of the class.
   Physics. — At the commencement of the year the class
had the honour to present to the emperor the History of
the Sciences since the year 1789, which his majesty ordered
to he printed.     The editors of this work, in profiting by
the materials furnished by members of the class, and by
foreigners, have endeavoured to trace, with truth and sim
plicity, the immense progress which the human mind has
niade in the knowledge of nature during these twenty years,
when war, intestine dissensions, and extravagant passions,
which alternately visited all states and empires, seemed to
have interrupted all useful inquiries and discoveries.
   This historical sketch will now serve as our point of
departure, and our annual reports in future will be so many
continuations.
   We ought, it is true, in our analyses, to treat only of
the subjects which have been discussed at our meetings :
but in the active relations in which we find ourselves with
the majority ot those who cultivate the sciences, it is very
unlikely that any important discovery will be made through
out Europe, which will not speedily be heard of within the
walls of the Institute, and excite its members to similar
pursuits.
   Chemistry, in the decomposition of the alkalis, has this
year presented a striking example of the emulation which
                                                     animates

                     FVcwcA    National Institute.                235
animates the learned of various countries. Scarcely had we
been apprized in France of the discovery of Davy, on the
changes which potash and soda undergo by the action of
the Voltaic pile, when two of our young chemists, M.Gay
Lussac, member of the class, and M. Thenard, professor
in the college of France, endeavoured to produce the same
effect by the common affinities, and succeeded by means of
apparatus most ingeniously contrived*.
   The public journals having announced that laminated
zinc had been applied to several useful purposes in England,
it is but justice in us to reclaim this application of lami
nated zinc as a French improvement.                  M. Macquer and
M- Sage long ago performed this process by heating the
metal : but we have to notice another recent improvement
on this subject in France, namely, the art of converting,
by simple sublimation, calamine or oxide of zinc into me
tal sufficiently pure to undergo lamination.             Messrs. Donq
and Poncellet have, in the department of the Ourthe, lately
succeeded in this operation, and the ore furnished them
with one-third of its weight in metal. This laminated zinc
may be employed on almost all occasions, instead of sheet
lead, and it will be found much cheaper.
   Another application of chemistry, not less interesting to
society, is the art of preparing with wood an acetic acid
/equally pure with radical vinegar.           This was suggested by
Messrs. Fourcroy and Vauqueltn, who discovered that the
acid which goes by the name of pyro-ligneous, and is pro
duced by the distillation of wood, is only the acetic acid
mixed with some foreign substances. On freeing it from
these, M. Mollerat has procured an acid which may be
used as a substitute for common vinegar; but it is more
acrid than the latter.
   The interruption of our colonial intercourse has repeat
edly suggested the employment of some substitute for sugar,
and M. Parmentier has recently published some popular
instructions on the art of extracting from the must orjuice
of the grape, a syrup, in order to supply the place of sugar:
he has presented some excellent specimens of this syrup to
the Institute, and great quantities of it are now manufac
tured in our southern provinces : the interruption to the
 exportation of our wines is an additional encouragement to
this manufacture. The grapes of the south of France, being
naturally sweeter, give proportionally more sugar; and care

must be taken to free the must from a more or less consi
derable quantity of tanar or other acids, which is effected
by means of lixiviated ashes.        This operation constitutes
the essence of M-. Parmentler's discovery.
    To return to chemistry in general : it will be recollected
that some time ago M. Morveau endeavoured to find an
instrument for measuring the highest degrees of heat, and
of which we have from time to time given an account. Ia
the present year M. Morveau read to the class a complete
history of the attempts previously made by chemists and
manufacturers on this subject; he has appreciated the me
thods resorted to bv Newton, Muschenbroeck, Mortimer,
and particularly Wedgwood, to whom he does more jus
tice than has hitherto been done in France.       He has even
given an account of the experiments on the dilatability of
the metals, made by watch-makers and others with a view
of constructing compensation pendulums: lastly, he has
described an instrument of his own invention, sufficiently
delicate for showing the minutest changes in length of a
small metallic bar.     In short, it is only such a bar, par
ticularly when made of platina, that can be at once suffi
ciently dilatable and unalterable in the fire to be used as a
pyrometer; but the greatest difficulty is to place it on a
scale which does not dilate, — otherwise we could never as
 certain the variations. This is is what M. Morveau expects
to attain, and to which he continues to direct his attention.
    M. Gay Lussac has recently developed an elegant law of
general chemistry, on the proportion of metal which enters
into each metallic salt, and on that of the oxygen necessary
for its oxidation. He has proved that the metal which precipi
 tates another metal from an acid solution, finds in the preci
 pitated metal all the oxygen necessary for being oxidated, and
 dissolved in such a quantity that the solution is neutralized
 to the same degree. The quantity of oxygen remains there
fore constant, whatever be the quantity necessary of each
 metal : the acid is therefore in each salt in proportion to
 the oxygen of the oxide, and there must be so much the
 more of each metal for saturating, the less occasion this me
 tal has for oxygen in order to be oxidated. This law gives
 a very simple method of determining the composition of
 all the metallic salts ; for it is sufficient to be acquainted
 with the proportion of the acid in a salt of any kind, in
 order to know it in them all, and a single analysis dis
 penses with all the rest.     It is always pleasing to find an
 increase of simple methods for attaining precision in

     M. Darcet jun., has applied these rigorous methods to
the analysis of the alkalis, and has proved that potash and
soda, when prepared with alcohol, and heated until they
begin to evaporate, still return nearly one-third of their
weight in water.

                              DR. HERSCHEL.
 In    our last Number, page 158, we inserted a table of rules
 for predicting the weather, and which had been for some
 time circulating in MS. as the production of Dr. Herschel.
That gentleman having publicly disclaimed the table al
 luded to, we consider it as a duty due to him and to our
 readers to insert the following disavowal :
 Notice to the Public from William Herschel, LL.D.,
                        of Slough, near Windsor.
     Many or the public papers, for a length of time past,
 have occasionally ascribed certain predictions of the state
 of the weather to me ; and several of them have lately gone
 so far as actually to prefix my name to what they have
 called a Weather Table, in which, according to certain
 hours of the changes of the moon, wind, rain, snow, frost,
  &c. &c, are prognosticated. Such a table, by some mistake,
 has even been very lately inserted into a very respectable
  Philosophical Magazine.             In justice to myself, therefore,
  I think it highly necessary that the public should be unde
  ceived by my declaring that the table pretended to be of my
  construction, as well as every prognostication of the state
 of the weather that has appeared in the Newspapers as
  ascribed to me, are all gross impositions.

XXXIti.      On the Date of the application of Telescopes to
    astronomic Instruments ; tlie Time when Astronomers first
   observed the Stars and Planeti in the Day time by means
    of these Telescopes ; and on tlie Author of these Dis
   coveries. Translated from the French oJ'M. De Fouch v *.
The      two discoveries which form the object of this memoir
are among iliose that have contributed most to bring astio-
nomy to its present degree of perfection. It is very singular
that the gratitude of astronomers has not preserved to pos
terity the person's name who made them •, and that the
Academy has now, at the end of a century, this omission to
repair ; — happily it is never too late to render justice: honour
and gratitude do not admit of prescription.
    It was required last year t.i point out the author of the ap
plication of tele^copt-s instead of sights to instruments; to
determine the dafe of this invention; and the time when
astronomers first observed the planets and largest stars by
means of them during the dav-time.              Thf greater part of
astronomers attributed one of these two useful inventions to
M. Auzout, and the other to M. Picard. As I remembered
to have seen these two points very well established some
where in a book I had formerly read, T merely observed,
that I supposed the time might be obtained very nearly ;
and the Academy requested me to endeavour to lind what I
could on this subject : — The following is the result of my re
search.
    The late M. de la Hiref gave in 171" a memoir entitled
Inquiries respecting the Dales of the Invention of the Mi
 crometer, of Pendulum Clocks, and of common Telescopes.
As I knew that he had spoken in this memoir of some other
astronomic inventions, I wished to see if he had not men
tioned this. I found that he could neither discover the
exact time nor the name of the author of this invention ;
that he spoke of it to M. Picard, who merely tokl him that
M. Auzout had some concern in it; which agrees very well
 with what Picard said himself at the beginning of his
Treatise on the Measure of the Earth, — that the idea of ap
plying telescopes instead of sights to instruments, had been
 thought   of for  some time. M. de la Hire adds also, that he
 had searched the Philosophical Transactions without having
 found any thing relating to the purpose.               I therefore took

the      (rouble to trace back my steps.             I endeavoured to re
member where I had seen these points discussed, and 1 re
 collected at length, that it was in Monn's Science des Lon
gitudes.
      In the celebrated conference which he had on this sub
ject, the 30th of March 1634, with tht commissioners named
 by cardinal Richlieu, Morin (when answering to the objec
 tion against the size of the instruments, which did not per
 mit them to be used at sea,) among a number of methods
 which he used to preserve their accuracy whilst diminishing
 their radius, mentioned the application of telescopes to the
 index, instead of sights. These are his words : — " The third
 method is the application which I have found means of
 making of a telescope to the index instead of sights, to
 measure more readily and more exactly the distance of
 the moon from the stars*."               For in the method he used
 of deriving the longitude from the observed distance of the
 moon from the stars, Morin had found that he could not
 expect sufficient truth in the collimation,               for a star to tra
 verse (he sights ; and he therefore             thought of using tele
 scopes,      which    had not then been invented more than about
 25 years.
      He had for this purpose placed a telescope on the index
 of his instruments : he then saw the stars, with the greatest
 clearness ; but it became necessary to determine the point
 in the field of view of the telescope, on which to place the
 star, so that the line passing through the optic centre of
 the object-glass might then he paralKl to the fiducial line
 of the index. Morin had but one step further to proceed
 in order to derive all possible utility from his invention, by
 applying cross wires in the common focus of the two
 lenses     f:  but I know not by what fatality it happens, that
 the most simple means are commonly the last to present
 themselves. He took another, less accurate method, which
 brought with it an inconvenience: he (hough( of covering
  the eye glass with a thin disc of copper or iron, pierced in
 its middle with a small hole.             By this means he obtained
  indeed a part of what he desired : for it is certain, that the
  star once seen in the. centre of the small hole was very
  nearly in a constant line, which might be made parallel to
  the fiducial line of the index. We say nearly; for, however

 small we suppose the hole at the centre of the plate to be,
 we should always be troubled to ascertain                  with certainty
 whether the star occupied the centre precisely ; and how
 ever little the eye might be moved, the stir would . appear
also to change its place; which could not but diminish the
accuracy of the operation.               But there was a much greater
inconvenience: it became very difficult to find the star ;
and frequently the instant of time in which the observation
was to have been made was passed before it could be found
in   the    telescope.     Morin       remedied     it  in  the    following
manner
    He had put on the object-end of his telescope*, a sight
cut in the middle with a slit sufficiently wide answering to
the diameter of the field of the telescope: when he wished
to observe a star, he placed it above this slit, and conducted
it just over the lube; he^was certain then of finding it in
the telescope, and of being able to place it in the middle of
the small hole of the plate.
    Such was the meihod which Morin pursued in his re
searches : it therefore follows that he is the first who adapt
ed telescopes to instruments instead of sights : but that the
kind ot eve-hole wi;h which he covfcred the eye-glass was
neither so convenient nor So exact as the cross wires put in
the commrin focus of the two glasses -by M. Auzout about
the vear 1667; and Morin did tint doubt that his inven
tion would afterwards be improved.                Let us hear him do
justice   to  himself   in  this  respect.
    He savst, " I do not doubt btit they may add to what
I  have invented some ingenious means which will render
its use more exact and more easy.                I even desire it very
sineerelv ; and am readv to give those iihn shall effect it
the just praises which they will merit; contenting myself
with having opetied to minds more subtle than mine, roads
which were hitherto unexplored."                An author who speaks
with s.) much modesty of -his own work deserves to be fa
vourably heai d.

  the objects in the west.        I was so overjoyed that      I thought
  of reversing    the telescope and the instrument : but this first
  emotion being appeased, 1 continued my operation more
  than half an hour after the sun had risen : the light then
  increasing, the star gradually diminished, and at length
  disappeared.
      "  The following day Venus being in Aquarius, and rising
  before the sun, I brought her in the field of view of my
-telescope; and although she wss then in her increase, and
  consequently less luminous, T preserved her there more
  easily than Arcturus for an hour and more after the sun
  had risen.      I have made the same observations with all the
  other planets and the larger stars." All this appears to have
  lasted onlv about four or five days, and must be referred to
  the end of March 1635.
      Such is the account which Morin gives of this discovery,
  with which he was affected to a degree of enthusiasm.                If
  he had used a longer telescope, he would have been able to
  observe the planets and large stars not only by day-light,
  but even at noon-day.         However, I do not believe that we
  can dispute with him the honour of having first observed
  the planets and principal stars during the sun's presence,—
  an immense advtmtag* to astronomy, and which gives him
  an undoubted and well-earned right to the gratitude of
  Astronomers.
      After what we have said, can it be believed, that in
   1669, more than 33 years after the publication of Morin's
   work, the Abbe Picard should assert himself to be the
   author of thi&_ discovery ? The following is the passage
   from the History of the Academy*, by M. de Fontenelle :
      The 3d of May of this year (1660), M. Picard was much
   surprised to be able to observe the meridian altitude of Re-
  guhis near 13 minutes before the setting of the sun: astro
   nomers have hitherto not only been unable to observe the.
   fixed stars in the day - time, but, it is believed, not even during
   twilight. M. Picard went further; on the 13th of July he
   observed the meridian altitude of Arcturus, the sun being
   then elevated nearly 1 7 degrees." We find nearly the same
   }n Du Hamel's Latin History, page 54.
       How did it happen that Picard was ignorant that to
   wards the end of March 1(535, more than 34 years before
   his observation, Morin had made this fine discovery; and
   that he had published it in 1635, in his Science oj Longi-
   \y.des ? f   I should be extremely sorry if this article, which.

 the cause of truth alone obliges me to relate in this memoir,
 should cast the least suspicion or' plagiarism on the memory
 of M. l'Abbe Picard. whatever we have of his shyws iiim
 to be very much above this meanness : but he had most
 probably never read Morin's book ; and this event may
 teach all those who give themselves up to the study of the
 sciences, that they never should neglect to read all that has
 the least relation to the object of their inquiry.      It is only
 by reading a book that we can acquire the right to neglect
it i and that of Morin surely did not deserve this contempt.
    In finishing this memoir, let me be permitted to say a
few words more respecting Morin, to whom it appears that
justice has never been done in several respects.            He had
given himself up to reveries in judiciary astrology, which
-was certainlv an obstacle to his reputation : but as an astro
nomer he was very far from being without merit. To ap-
pretiaie him with justice, it is not with the astronomers of
the present age that we must compare him.                 It is well
known how much the sciences, and above all astronomy,
have been improved during the last hundred and fifty ' ears i
but if we compare him with his contemporaries, we shall see
that he was a man of some consideration, and corresponded
with the most illustrious men of his time. He could not
pf course be acquainted with those sublime theories which
only became known a long time alter him ; but he pos
sessed all that then constituted the great merit of an astro
nomer.      We find by the letters which Gassendi, Longor
montanus, and many others, wrote to him, that they con
sidered him as one of the best mathematicians of his age.
He was professor of mathematics at the Royal College ; he
published, in 1633, A treatise of plane and spheric trigono
metry, accompanied by tables of logarithms, sines, tan
gents, &c. He was the first who collected, completed,
and demonstrated, what had been said before him on the
science of the longitude, and laid the foundation of all that
has since been done on that subject.         He certainly has not
carried it,   nor could he carry   it, to the degree of perfection
which  it   has attained in our time, since many things were
then wanting: and notwithstanding the very serious injury
which many of the commissioners suffered on his account,
they had reason to decide, that he had not completely re
solved the problem of the longitude: but this did not hin
der his book on the science of the longitude from being                 a
yery good one   ;   andif   in the present day   it  only read by

  the altercations which he had with his commissioners, and
  with others ; which now renders the reading of it very te
  dious. . Nevertheless, had he only given this work, and
  the two inventions we have just mentioned, he would have
  deserved to be reckoned among those who by their works
  have contributed to the advancement of the sciences, and
  consequentlv to the cause of humanity.                If it is not very
  interesting for the public to kt ow who is the author of a
  discovery, of which they enjoy the benefit, it is of great
  importance that discoveries should be maae ; and the most
  certain means of increasing them, is to render full and en
  tire justice to the authors. The reception given to their
  works is the most flattering part of their recompense ; and
- it
     \3 to be wanting in gratitude to deprive them of it.
  XXXIV. A Description of anew Anemometer. By Richard
      Kirwan, Esq., LL.D. P.R.I.A. F.R.S. &c. &tc*
  That rain,     on the presence or absenceof which at the diffe
  rent seasons of the year, vegetation, and the success of agri
  culture, in great measure depend, and also the temperature of
  the atmosphere, to whose influence both animals and vege
  tables are subject, arises from, or at least is strictly con
  nected with, the various directions and velocities of winds,
  is well known. Nor has it escaped observation, that the
  primary cause of the direction of the wind from a given
  quarter, as well as of the velocity of its progress, is the rare
  faction of the atmosphere in that tract towards which it
  blows.     The reason why air does not rush in from all sides
  towards the rarefied tracts, seems to me to be the inequality
  of its density in the surrounding tracts ; for from that quar
  ter, in which the mercury in the barometer stands highest,
  the air must preferably proceed.          If the density be equal on
  all sides, as in some confined tracts, a hurricane happens :
  hence the advantage of ascertaining and comparing the de
  grees of its velocity ; for, those being known, its cause and
  degrees of rarefaction may with great probability be infer
  red. Two causes of rarefaction are already known, — solar
  heat, and some internal chemical action, by which a quan
  tity of air is converted into water, and sometimes even into
   a stony substance ; this last being the most sudden                   and
  complete,    the   rarefaction    of  the  neighbouring      air arising

from it is by far the most violent, but commonly of a,
much shorter duration and extent. An accurate measure
of the velocity of wind has long been sought by meteoro
logists : several have been devised on the Continent, but
only two, that f know of, in England.             That which                         I
now lay before the Academy seems to me to be the sim
plest and best adapted to the purpose.
   1. The force of wind, to which the degrees of its velocity
are proportional, is measured by that of gravity indicated m
pounds and parts of a pound avoirdupois ; the calculation is
grounded on the observations of Mr. Smeaton, in the
Philosophical Transactions, vol. li. p. 165.
   2. Mr. Smeaton indeed observes, that the evidence of the
velocity is not so great where this exceeds 50 miles, as when
50 or under; yet, from its agreement with other observa
tions, I am inclined to think it fully sufficient.
   3. A velocity of 123 feet per second was observed at
Petersburgh, an. 1741, 3 Much. 468, that           at the rate of
                                                               is,
83-8 miles per hour.
   4. According to Lalandc,         his Treatise on Navigation,
                                             in
42 lloz. Jour. 221, the course of the trade winds              be               is
tween    6and     miles an hour.

   5. Mr. Brice, Philosophical Transactions,        756, p. 226,1
observed     storm whose velocity was 63 miles per hour.

                                        is
2O feet per second, or 13'C3 miles per hour. Ibid.
   7. Bouguer found the velocity of winter storms to be
about 34 miles per hour, and in summer nearly 43. Ibid.
   The distance from Holyhead to the Pigeon-house               70              is
miles   ;then supposing the wind to be direct, and its velo
city 30 miles per     uir, and

to assume 0*4 of the velocity of the wind,          will arrive at

   Let W denote the velocity of wind in the open air, of
              meeting no opposition                ;

   Again 0-4 W. being 12, and the hours, 5-8, being given,
the distance 70 miles, we have 5-8 x 12 = 69 6. by the se*
cond formula.
   And lastlv, the number of hours = 5-8, and space in
miles = 70 being given, we have 0-4 of the velocity of the
wind =       = 12; and dividing this by 0-4 we have the
rate per hour of its course in the lower atmosphere.

The      author also considers the general case in which the
spheroid, supposed to be always fluid at its surface, may
contain a solid nucleus of anv given figure not differ
ing much from the sphere.            The radius drawn from the
centre of gravity of the spheroid to the Surface, and the law
of gravity at this surface, have certain general properties,
which the author has found out, and which are the more
important as being independent of all hypothesis. . The
first consists in this, that in the state of equilibrium, the
fluid part of the spheroid must always be arranged in such
a way that the centre of gravity of the external surface may
coincide with that of the spheroid.            The permanent state
of equilibrium in which the celestial bodies are, also brings
to light some properties of their radii; for this state requires
that these bodies should turn, if not exactlv, at least very
nearly so, round one of their three principal axes.         Hence
result certain conditions which their radii must satisfy, arid
these are explained by the author in a very simple manner.
    He afterwards obtains, by the differencialion of the gene
ral equation of the equilibrium of spheroids, the law of
gravity at their surfaces ; and he deduces from it the length
of the seconds pendulum, which is proportional tothisgra^
vity. Finally, the developed expression of the radius of the
spheroid 'rives him the osculating ratlins, and consequently
the degree of the meridian. These formulae possess the valu
able advantage of being absolutely independent of the interior
constitution of the spheroid ; i. e. of the figure and density
of its layers. They depend solely on the expression of its
radius, with which they are connected by very simple rela
tions. On comparing these relations with each other, we find
that the parts of the radius which enter under a finite form
into the expression of gravity and length of the pendulum,
undergo two successive ihfTerencialions, in order to pass into
the expression of the degree of the meridian, and would
consequently undergo three in the Variation of two conse
cutive degrees ; and as the differential of a quantity raised
to any given power is always multi1ilied by the index O+nhis
power, it results, that terms scarcely sensible in themselves
in the expression of the length of the pendulum might, if
 elevated to high powers, become considerable in the varia
tion of the degrees ; which explains in a very simple "man-

ner, how it is possible that the observed lengths of the se
conds pendulum increase from the equator to the pole, nearly
in proportion to the square of the sine of the latitude, whilst
the variations of the observed degrees of the meridian differ
perceptibly from this law.      For the same reason, the aber
ration of the elliptic figure will be less sensible in the value
of the horizontal parallax of the moon, which is propor-.
tioned to the terrestrial radius, than in the expression of the
length of the pendulum which is given bv the dtfTerencia-
tion of the equation of equilibrium into which the radius of
the spheroid enters under a finite form. The preceding for
mulae mav also serve to verify the hypotheses necessary for
representing the measured degrees of the meridian.           The
author ha.< made an application to that which Bouguer pro
posed, namely, to*suppose the increments of the degrees
from the equator to the pole proportional to the fourth
power of the sine of the latitude ; and he proves that this
law is inadmissible.
    The author applies- these general results to the casein
which the spheroid not being solicited by foreign im
 pulses is formed of elliptic layers, all of them having their
centres at the centre of gravity of the fluid. We have seen
that this case is that of the earth supposed to be primitively
fluid ; and the author proves that it would still agree with
it in the hypothesis of the figures of its layers being simi
lar. He deduces from    it,  that then the radii diminish, and
the degrees increase from the equator to the pole propor
tionally to the square of the sine of the latitude. He proves
also by   the help of the same formulae, that on the most pro
bable suppositions, suppositions which become necessary,
if  the spheroid has been originally fluid, its oblateness must:
be less than in the case of homogeneity.       Finally, he esta
blishes between the eliipticity of the earth, and the variation
 of the pendulum from the equator to the pole, this remark
 able relation
             :   tutting unity for lit length of the pendulum

at the equator as much as the eliipticity    of  the earth sur
passes that which would take place in the case      of   homoge
neity, in the same proportion    is   the total incease of the
pendulum from the equator to the pole exceeded              that

which would take place in the same case; and recipiocaily,
 so that the sum of this increase of the eliipticity forms a
 constant quantity.

 hypothesis which takes place wrth. respect to the earth, and
which  it   seems natural to extend to. the other bodies of the

 system    of  the world.    He afterwards gives an extremely
 simple expression       for  the law of gravity at the surface of
 homogeneous        spheroids   in equilibrium, whatever mav be?
 the index of the power to which the attraction is propor
 tional : for this purpose he makes Use ot the equation
which takes place at the surface of spheroids differing very
 little from the sphere; and he deduces that in general, if
 the spheroid be a homogeneous fluid and endowed with a
 rotatory motion, the gravity varies from the equator to the
 pole proportionally to the square of the sine of the latitude;
and what is singularly remarkable, this variation vanishes
when the attraction is proportional to the cube of the di
stance ; so that in this case the gravity at the surface of ho
mogeneous spheroids is every where the same, whatever
may be their rotatory motion.
     In the preceding inquiries the author has supposed the:
effect of the centrifugal force and of the foreign attrac
tions to be very small, with respect to the attraction of
the spheroid, which has admitted of his neglecting the
square and the oilier powers 6f these forces, as well as
quantities of the same order : but he shows that it is easy
to extend the same analysis to a case in which it may be
necessary to preserve them.         At last he arrives at this im
portant conclusion, — that the equilibrium is rigorously pos
sible, although it is only by successive approximations that
we can assign the figure which satisfies it. Such is the re
sult of M. La Place's labours on the attractions ,of sphe
roids.     The uniform and direct manner in which this the
ory $ so abstract and difficult, is derived by simple differenci-
ations from a single fundamental equation, is doubtless oneof
the most remarkable things that analysis has ever effected.
    In order to compare the preceding results with observa
tions, it is necessary to know the curve of the terrestrial
meridians, and that which we trace by a course of geodesic
operations.      If by the axis of rotation of the earth, and by
the   zenith   of  a place on its surface, we imagine a plane
prolonged     to the  heavens, this plane will there trace the
circumference of a great circle, which will be the meridian
of the place ; and all the points on the surface of the earth, .
which will have their zenith in this circumference, will
be under the same celestial         meridian.   These points are
therefore such that the normals, drawn through them to
the surface of the earth, are all parallel to one and the
same plane. According to this condition the author deter
mines the curve which they form on the surface. This
curve, which is the terrestrial meridian, is plane if the
                                                          spheroid

    Analysis of the MScanique Ctlesle of      M. La   Place.   055
spheroid be one of revolution, but in the general case it has
a double curvature.
    The geodesic line is a curve whose first side is a tangent
in any given direction to the surface of the earth. Its se
cond side is the prolongation of this tangent bent according
to a vertical, and so on. According to this condition, the
author determines the equation of this curve, which is the
shortest that can be drawn between two points given on the
surface of the earth.
    The geodesic line is very proper for enabling us to be
come acquainted with the true figure of the earth. In fact,
we may conceive at every point of the surface of the earth
a tangent ellipsoid, and on which the geodesic measure
ments,' the longitudes, and latitudes, reckoning from the
 points of contact, would be in a small extent the same as
 at this surface.    If the earth were an ellipsoid, it would
 coincide with the tangent ellipsoid, which would be every
 where the same ; but if this circumstance did not take place,
 the tangent ellipsoid would vary from one country to an
 other; and these variations, which it is interesting to know,
 could only be determined by geodesic admeasurements made
 in different directions and in different countries.
     The surface of the earth being supposed to differ a little
 from the sphere, the author gives the equation of the geo
 desic line; and considering in the first place the case in which
 the first side of this line is parallel to the corresponding
 plane of the celestial meridian, he deduces from it the
 length of the arc comprised between two given latitudes.
 If the terrestrial spheroid be one of revolution, this arc and
 the whole curve are in one and the same plane, which is
  that of the celestial meridian.      It varies from it when the
  parallels are not circles ; so  that the  observation of this va
  riation may throw some light on this important point of the
  figure of the earth. The author by a very delicate analysis
  shows, that if the first side of the geodesic line be parallel
  to the corresponding plane of the celestial meridian, the dif
  ference of longitude of the two extremities of the measured
  arc is equal to the azimuthal angle of the extremity of the
  arc divided by the sine of the latitude.       This very simple
  r,esult  is independent   of  the  interior  constitution of the
   earth, and of the knowledge of its figure. It is of very
  great importance in this theory ; since, if the azimuthal angle
  observed is such that we cannot ascribe it to errors in the
   observations, we mieht conclude with certainty that the
   earth is not a spheroid of revolution.       The author after
   wards considers the case in which the first side of the geo
                                                               desic

 desic line is perpendicular to the corresponding plane of the
 terrestrial meridian, and he obtains an equation which de
 termines the difference of latitude of the two extremities of
 the arc. It is very remarkable that the function which
 gives this difference is equal to the azimuthal angle observed
at the extremity of the same arc, measured in the direction,
of   the meridian and divided by the tangent of the latitude
at the first point of this arc.    This function may therefore
be determined two ways; and we might judge if the values
found, whether of the difference of the latitudes or of the
azimuthal angle, are owing to the errors of observations or
to the eccentricity of the terrestrial parallels. The author
afterwards calculates the difference in longitude of the two
extremities of the arc measured in the direction of the pa
rallels, as well as the azimuthal angle formed by the ex
tremity of this arc with the corresponding plane of the ce
lestial meridian.     Finally, he determines the osculating;
radii of the geodesic lines, whether drawn in the direction
of the meridian or in the direction of the parallels, and he
deduces from it that of the geodesic line, which forms with
the meridian any given angle.           Considering afterwards
the osculating ellipsoid, the author teaches us how to de
termine it from the measurements of the earth.
    We have previously seen that the elliptic figure must
be that of the earth and the planets, supposing them to
have been originally fluids, if in other respects, by becom
ing hard, they have preserved their primitive figure: it was
therefore natural to compare with this figure the measured
degrees of the meridian ; but this comparison bas given for
the figure of the terrestrial meridians different ellipses, and
which are too far removed from the observations to be
admitted ; whence it follows that the figure of the earth i*
more complex than had been at first supposed.         Neverthe
less, before abandoning the elliptic figure entirely, it is im
portant to determine that in which the error is smaller than
in any other of the same nature. The author gives two
different methods for attaining this object; the first is gene
rallv applicable at all times, when we have a certain number
of observations, which we suppose to be represented by a
function whose form is given; it is requisite to determine
this function in such a manner that the errors of observa
tion, may be less than in any other of the same form.
Having, for instance, any given number of observations of
a comet, we may by their means determine the parabolic
orbit in which the greatest error is (abstracting from the
sign of the error) less than iu any other of the same natures

     Analysis of the Mccanique    Celeste of M. La Place.      257
but this method requiring very tedious calculations, when
the number of observations is considerable, the author
  jives one more expeditious, and applicable to the observed
Sengths of the pendulum and of the degrees of the meridian.
The ellipsis determined by this method, serves to ascertain
whether the elliptic figure is within the limits of the errors
of the observations : but even by this it is not that which
the measured degrees indicate with most probability.         This
last in the author's opinion ought to possess the two follow
ing properties:       1st, That the sum of the errors com
mitted in the measurements          of the whole measured arcs
should be nothing.        2d, That the sum of these errors, all
of them being taken positive, should be a minimum. He
gives a method for determining it according to the fore-
         conditions ; and this method, which employs the whole
{joing
  engths of the measured arcs, has the advantage of giving,
as it ought to do, so much more influence to each of these
arcs, as it is more considerable in length.
     The author applies these methods to the degrees measured
at Peru, the Cape of Good Hope, Pennsylvania,               Italy,
France, Austria, and Lapland.          The result is, that in the
elliptic hypothesis we cannot avoid an error of 109 metres
on some of these degrees ; which is by far too considerable.
The ellipticity corresponding to this minimum of error is
 equal to-——t the polar axis being taken as unity.      The most
            277
 probable ellipse gives this ellipticity  =  — —, and it supposes
 an error   of 336 metres in the degree    measured  in Pennsyl
 vania; which appears inadmissible.         This result confirms
 what was said before, that the earth differs sensibly from an
 elliptic figure. But there remains no longer any doubt re
 specting this, when the author, applying the same analysis
 to the operations lately made with so much care by De-
 lambre and Mechain, deduces from them          rj-for the earth's
                                                150

 cannot subsist either with the phenomena of gravity, or
 with those of precession and nutation ; for these phaeno-
 mena do not permit us to suppose the earth to possess an
 oblateness greater than in the case of homogeneity, or above

 tions by the able astronomers just named do not admit of
 our ascribing the variation to the errors of the observations.

the terrestrial meridian from the arc comprised and observed
between Dunkirk and Mont-Jouy,             it is necessary to adopt
an hypothesis for the figure of the earth ; and by means of
the irregularities .which it presents, the most simple is that
 of an ellipsoid of revolution. Assuming this supposition,
 and comparing the arc measured in France with that mea
sured at the equator, we deduce the quarter of the meridian,
and the length of the metre, which is the ten millionth part           '
of it. This comparison       gives     for the earth's ellipticity.
    The author    then shows, that, whatever may be the figure
of  the earth, the observed diminution of the degrees of the
meridian from the pole to the equator requires a corre
sponding augmentation in the terrestrial radii, and conse
quently an oblateness in the direction of the poles. He
then passes to the comparison of the elliptic hypothesis
with the observed lengths of the seconds pendulum. Taking
for this purpose fifteen selected observations, he shows that *
all may be reconciled to an elliptic figure, by only admitting
an error equal to the eighteen hundred thousandth of the
observed length.       The ellipticity corresponding to this mi
nimum of error is —          and that given by the most probable
ellipsis is — — .    By this we perceive that the aberrations       of
the elliptic figure irre less sensible in the variations of the
length of the pendulum than in that of the degrees of the
meridian.      The theory of the attractions of spheroids gives,
as the author has before observed,          a very simple explana
tion of this circumstance.
   The author applies the        same methods to Jupiter, whose
oblateness    has    been   determined with accuracy.        He first
supposes    this  planet  to be homogeneous,      and  compares the
oblateness computed on this hypothesis with the observa
tions.    The result being found too great, the author con
cludes that Jupiter is lefs oblate than he would be if he
were homogeneous, and that his density increases like the
earth from the surface to the centre.            In this case theory
establishes limits between w hich must be comprised the ra
tio of the two axes ; here these limits are very nearly ap
proached, and the author shows that the observed axes of
Jupiter are contained within them, so that gravity is yet on
the point of agreeing perfectly with observations. '
   The author then employs himself with Saturn's ring : he
supposes that an infinitely thin fluid layer spread into this
surface would be in equilibrium inconsequence of the forces
                                                              which*

  which animate it; and it is according to the condition of
  this equilibrium that he determines the figure of the rings.
  To obtain  it,   he conceives each ring as engendered             the          by
  revolution of closed figure, such as the ellipse moved per
                a
  pendicularly to its plane about the centre of Saturn placed
  on the prolongation of the axis of this figure. Introducing
  these circumstances         the equation of the second order of
                                  in
  partial differences relative to the attraction of spheroids,
  and supposing the dimensions of the ring to be very small
  with regard to its distance from Saturn's centre, there arises
 an integral equation, which           the same as
                                            is            the annular
                                                                   if
  surface were a    cylinder of an infinite length and in fact      :
  we see that this case        very nearly that of the ring w hen
                                  is
  the attracting point       near its surface. But, as this first ap
                              is
  proximation is not in general sufficient, the author gives the
 means of obtaining others more and more exact                  and he       ;
  shows, that to obtain them            suffices to know the attrac

 cular the case where this figure           an ellipsis, he gives the

                    ;   which exactly conforms with the obser
 vations.      He then shows that the preceding theory would
 still subsist
             if    the generating ellipse varied its magnitude
 and position throughout the whole extent of the circum
 ference of the ring, which might thus be supposed of an
 unequal size in its different parts, as appears to take place
 in nature. Lastly, he demonstrates that these inequalities
 are necessary to maintain the ring in equilibrium round
 Saturn :    to prove       it,
                           he supposes the ring to be          circular  a
 line whose plane passes           the centre of Saturn, but with
                                       by
 out the two centres coinciding: and he shows that then the
 centre of Saturn will always repel the centre of the ring; so
 that,                     be the motion of this second centre
         whatever may

more and more until its circumference re -united itself t
the surface of the planet.       From this the author deduces*     \&
that in general, if the ring were similar in all its parts, its
centre would be always repelled by Saturn's centre, if it
ceased ever so little to coincide with it ; so that the slightest
cause affecting this coincidence, the attraction of a cornet
or of a satellite, would precipitate the ring down to Saturn,
where it would be united for ever.          It is therefore neces
sary, in order that the equilibrium might be firm, that the
rings of Saturn be irregular solids of unequal width in the
different points of their circumference, and such that their
centre of figure should not coincide with their centre of
gravity.   The author then treats on the figure of the at
mospheres of the celestial bodies.
   A rare, transparent and compressible fluid, sustained by a
body which it environs, and on which it hangs, is what
we call its atmosphere. In proportion as the fluid rises from
the body it becomes more rare in consequence of its spring :
but if its exterior surface be elastic it extends without end,
and terminates by being dissipated in space.           The author
concludes from these considerations, that there exists a state
of rarity in which this fluid is witbout spring, and that it
must be found in this state at the surface of the atmosphere.
The figure of this surface must then be such, that the result
of the. centrifugal force and of the attractive force of the
body must be perpendicular to it; which gives the equation
of this figure. Considering particularly the case where the
covered spheroid differs little from the sphere, the author
deduces the equation for the layers of the same density of
the atmosphere.      Observing then that the limit of the at
mosphere    must  be  such that the centrifugal force of it be
equal  to the  gravity, he demonstrates that the atmosphere
has only one possible figure of equilibrium, in which the
ratio of the least to the greatest axis, which is that of the
equator, cannot be less than      , .   By applying these results
                                 •3                |
to the solar atmosphere, we find that it can only extend to
the orbit of a planet which would circulate in a period of
time equal to that of the rotation of this body, that is to
say, in twenty-five days and a half. It is therefore very far
from reaching the orbits of Mercury and Venus.             The zo
diacal light extends far beyond these orbits, and appears in
the form of a very oblate lens. The author concludes with
 certainty, that it is not the sun's atmosphere.

XXXVI.       Cosmogony     of the Iroquois, or Five Indian Nations
                              of Canada *.
The following sketch          of the theological notions heretofore
entertained by the aboriginal people whose descendants still
inhahit the western parts of New- York and the southern
region of Upper Canada, was communicated to Dr. Mit-
chill at Fort Schuyler, in the year 1788, by the late reve
rend Sampson Occom, the famous Mohegan preacher and
missionary, during the negotiation between the commis
sioners of New York and the sachems and warriors of the
Six Nations, which terminated in the treaty with the Onei-
das, Onondagas, Senecas, and Cayugas or that year.                   Mr.
Clinton then administered the government of the state, and
met the Indians, in person, accompanied by Messrs. Jones,
L'Hommedieu, Benson, Varick, and Gangevoort, as agents
on the part of the Commonwealth.                 v
    Their tradition concerning the origin of the world and of
man, though wild and eccentric, has still the merit of being
as credible a6 most others extant.           An account of it was
transmitted many years ago to Dr. Robertson, the celebrated
historian of America, by a person eminently skilled in In
dian researches.      And it would probably have been noticed
by him, had he finished the history of the British settle
ments in North America.             But that writer having left only
two chapters of this work, the one on the colonization of
Virginia, and the other on that of New England, no men
tion is made of the character and peculiarities of these peo
 ple, apart from the general survey he had taken of the abo
 rigines in his former volumes.
    Lieut. -governor Colden, the professed historian of the
Iroquois, writes, " that, as to what religious notions the
 five nations of Canada have, it is difficult to judge of them ;
because the Indians that speak any English, and live near us,
 have learned many things of us ; and it is not easy to distin
guish the notions they had originally among themselves, from
 those they have learned of the Christians. It is certain they
 have no kind of public worship; and I am told they have
 no radical word to express ' God,' but use a compound
 word, signifying the preserver, sustainer, or master of the
 universe : neither could I learn what sentiments they have
 of a future existence." This extract is taken from his Ac~
count of the Five Indian Nations which are dependent on

  the difficulties which beset every inquiry concerning the re-!
 ligious rites and tenets of rude nations, as stated by Dr.
 Robertson in his History of America, b. iv, § 7, the pro-?
  fessor has thought it worth the while to preserve this rem
 nant of antiquity, and to state it to his audience, rather
 than suffer it to perish on the lips of a declining and eva
 nescent people.      He offers it as a singular tradition", and,
 worthy of being contained in the Theogonia of Hesiod.
     "  Originally," the tradition runs, " the self-existing
 world consisted of mud and water, and was inhabited solely
                                                             ' •
 by aquatic animals and birds.
     " At this time there was an universal language among
 the creatures, which they all used and could understand.
     "  They lived together in a most happy society, and per-;
 formed for each other various and numberless offices of
friendship.
     "  But while the beings of the nether world were enjoy
 ing themselves in these ways, a scene of great and general
 concern was exhibited in the world of spirits above.
        A distinguished young warrior in those upper regions
 laboured under an exhausting and dangerous disease, which
 rendered his restoration to health extremely doubtful.
     " He was the favourite and the hope of the celestials,
 who-, anxious for the recovery of their beloved hero, strove
 by every possible means to comfort and cure him. And
 they proffered their services in every way that in their judge
 ment might relieve or delight him.         They were unsparing
 of any gratification, to which the whimsies of his sickly
 brain seemed to be inclined.
     " One day, as they were assembled and condoling by the
Joss they should sustain through the obstinate and increas
ing violence of the malady, a messenger arrived from the
 patient, who, in a hasty and panting voice, told them,
 that something was importunately required of them by their
 dying friend.     The languid youth, he said, wished the na
 tion to make an exertion of its whole strength. There was
 a tree of uncommon size and of great note in the village.
 It was his earnest desire that this tree should be pulled up
 by the roots. Instantly the work was undertaken; Scaffolds
 were built around.       Cords were twisted, and tied to the
 trunk and branches. And after tugging a long time, the
 united effort of the whole world of spirits raised the tree
 from the earth, and held it suspended in the air.
     (( A vast and terrible                             The bot
                            cavity was left beneath.

                or Flue Indian Nations     of Canada.           263
 torn of this, by reason of its crookedness and depth, could
 not be traced by the eye.
       On being told that the tree had been eradicated ac
cording to his request, the feeble youth begged that he migru;
be conveyed to the side      of the  chasm and seated there.      It
was believed the odour      of the  fresh earth might tend to re
vive him.      This being done, he turned his languid eyes
toward the thronging people, and, espying a beautiful young
female spirit standing near him, signified his desire that
she might also be brought to the brink of the precipice and
be seated beside him.
    "   This having been immediately performed, and the
                                                                %
girl placed by the warrior on the margin of the hole, he
watched a favourable opportunity, and suddenly pushed her
into it headlong.       She rapidly descended, and in a few
seconds disappeared from their view.
    "  She continued rolling and tumbling dawn the perfora
tion until she fell through into this lower world.
    " The young man then told them that he had been de
sperately sick of love ; that he had been intolerably tor
mented by jealousy ; and that the damsel whom he had
precipitated into the pit, had been the object of his most
ardent passion. He informed them she had slighted his
fondest overtures, and given a preference to another.           But
having    now  plunged   her  to perdition  in revenge for her neg
lect and scorn, he should soon recover his wonted health.
    " The attentive spirits at first felt much concern and
shuddering at the accident. But finding their favourite's
recovery was insured at a price so inconsiderable as the I0S5
of the girl, their sadness was immediately converted to joy.
And thus quiet was restored to the nation of spirits.
       She continued to fall for several successive days, and
at length drew near to the confines of this lower world.
Her nearer approach was descried by a bald eagle, who was
soaring very high upon the wing. Struck with the novelty
of the appearance, he immediately gave the alarm to all
the fowls of the air and inhabitant* of the water.            They
quickly assembled, and held a consultation what was to be
done.
    " It was unanimously concluded in the meeting, that
the falling body, be it what it might, should not be suffer
ed to plunge into the abyss and perish by drowning; but
that some one of their number should immediately prepare
himself to receive and sustain it on his back.
    i( First the
                  eagle offered his services to huoy up the ob-

264                 Cosmogony    of the Iroquois,
ject; but the prevailing opinion       was against him, under a
persuasion   that  the air was  not   solid  enough to allow him
to attempt it with success.      Then, the wood-ducks offered
 their aid ; but it was objected that their backs were too nar
 row, and their strength too inconsiderable; it would be impos
 sible for them to keep afloat, and they must infallibly die
 by submersion. The beaver next signified his willingness
 to perform the service; and a sentiment of approbation was
 on the point of being expressed, when a large tortoise made
 his appearance, and raised his knobbed head and spreading
 shell above the surface.
     " There was an instant decision that the tortoise was the
 fittest of all the creatures for the purpose, and was en
 couraged to fix and balance himself to receive the approach
 ing phenomenon.                           ,
     " The outcast from the upper world by this time drew
 very near. For the tortoise had no sooner made himself as
 buoyant as he could, and brought his body to a poize, than
 she alighted upon his back.                        *
     " Luckily she catched upon her feet. The tortoise bore
 the shock perfectly well. After the female visitant had re
 covered a little from reeling and staggering, she found her
 self in a short time almost overpowered by giddiness and
 faintness.    In this condition, she sat herself down cross-
 legged upon the tortoise's back, and, leaning forward with
 her head toward her knees, fell into a profound and re
 freshing sleep.    It may be noted that, in commemoration
 of this event, the Indian women to this day accustom them
 selves to sit cross-legged.
     " On awaking, she was surprised to find, instead of the
 bare tortoise shell, a small circuit of earth, and sponta
 neously and miraculously outspread, and covered with
 bushes, vines, and fruits. She extended her hands, and
 gathered some of the blackberries, mandrakes, and grapes.
 After eating her fill and drinking some water, she lay down
 and slept again ; for now there was room enough for her to
 stretch out her limbs at full length.
     " When she next awoke, she could see no water whatever.
 The land, by a continuation of the miracle, had already
 extended itself further than her sight could reach.        Vege
 tables of every kind abounded on it ; as also did four-footed
 animals. After a while she arose, walked about, and prepared
 for subsisting as comfortably as she could in her new and
 solitary abode.
     " But, before she passed many moons in her terrestrial
                                                           abode,

              or Five Indian Nations    of Canada.            265
abode, pregnancy forced itself upon her notice.         This was
the consequence of an amour in which she had been en
gaged in the upper world.         And it was on account of the
preference she showed to the young spirit of her heart, that
she became the object of that jealous temper in his rival,
which thrust her from the high place of her birth.
     " In due time she was delivered of a female child, who
grew thriftily, and until the age of puberty acted as the
companion and assistant of her mother.            During the in
fancy of thi6 daughter,     there  was  a great intimacy between
her and some of the land animals.             They were constant
play-fellows ; and,     as she   grew up    to a more interesting
size and figure, were engaging in their manners and more
assiduous to please her. They frisked around her, played
 their prettiest tricks to entertain her, and in short employed
 in her presence all the arts of gallantry and courtship that
 lhey knew.
     " After some years were passed in this manner, the like
 accident befel the daughter which her frolicsome mother
 had experienced. She proved with child ; and at the period
 of her gestation, twins, two male children, were born of
 her.    It was always a matter of uncertainty with her, who
 was the father of the boys.       It was certain, however, that
 the sire was either the bear or the tortoise. Accordingly,
 jn tracing the genealogies of the tribes and families, it is
 an unsettled point at this time, whether that which derives
 its origin from the bear or the tortoise is the more honour
 able and dignified.
     " These children, so ushered into the world, were the
  good spirit and the evil spirit. The difference of their
 tempers and dispositions manifested itself before they were
 born.     Whije yet encircled in the womb, the former was
 content to lie still and be quiet, while the latter was un
 ceasingly restless, and by kicking and scratching strove to
 give his mother all the torment he could.          He finally de
  clared to his brother, in one of their conversations, that he
  never would befoul and disgrace himself by coming forth
  through the natural passage; but that he would find some
  preferable and more decent outlet to day-light.
      " By the persuasion of his well-disposed brother, how
  ever, he was induced to moderate his restlessness until his
  mother's labour came on.       It was the lot of the good spirit
  then to be born first. Whereupon his perverse and impa
  tient brother took a resolution not to follow him along the
  dirty road through which he came, but to take an opposite
  course. With a violent exertion he therefore tore his way
                                                         suddenly

260                Cosmogony    of the Iroquois,
suddenly through the womb, and, passing through the belly
obliquely upwards, forced himself out at the armpit.
   " The mother immediately expired under this compli
cated injury; but both the children survived, and were
brought up by their grandmother.         The old dame was at
the same time so enraged at the conduct of her grandson
the evil spirit, as respected his mother, that she determined
to make all the amends in her power for the outrage done
her sex.     She accordingly divided the dead body of her
daughter into two parts at the waist. With a strong whirl,
she threw the lower limbs, together with the insulted or
gans, into the sun, where, hid in intolerable brightness,
no person, however curious or audacious, can bear to look
at them.     The head, trunk, and upper limbs, she slung to
the other luminary, where they are still visible in the form
of the woman in the moon,
   " The boys manifested, as they grew, very different
dispositions.    As they progressed in age and increased in
stature, the younger was no less remarkabble for his ma
lignity and depravity, than, the other for his virtue and ex
cellence. But he was under some control from his grand
mother, and was withheld from the commission of the worst
kind of crimes during her life.
   " After her death, being left to themselves, the brothers
agreed to possess the earth together in an amicable manner,
as their joint inheritance.    Yet, even after this agreement,
the propensity   of  the younger to mischief and vice was so
irresistible that nothing could withhold him.         Though se
veral wrangles and scuffles had taken place between them,
the good spirit became convinced that nothing but force
could reduce his depraved brother to a sense of decency and
order. Foreseeing that a necessity for another contest be
tween them would shortly arrive, he resolved to exert all
his courage and strength, and give his brother a sound and
sufficient Deating, once for all.
    " An opportunity, as he had predicted, soon presented
itself. Owing to some misunderstanding, a battle happened
between them near the falls of Chamblee, not very far from
the junction of the Sorell with the St. Laurence".       The evil
spirit was worsted in the combat ; but, at length escaping
from his brother's hands, sought safety in flight. To elude
his antagonist's blows, he directed his course across the
country towards the south, and, stepping with wide and
hasty strides from mountain to mountain, reached the lower
falls of Delaware before he was overtaken.          Here his ex
asperated   brother,  who  had  all  the  while  pursued close at

            or Five Indian Nations      of Canada.               267
his beds, clenched him again. The conflict was renewed,
and, after a hard and obstinate resistance, the evil spirit was
overcome, and constrained to cry for mercy. Having bound
himself' by a solemn promise to behave better in future, he
was dismissed, and permitted to go at large.
  "   But he was no sooner -at liberty than his wicked appe
tites returned.   His engagements for good behaviour were
broken.     And he employed himself with an industry
worthy    of  a better cause, in creating gnats, musquitoes,
hornets, and rattle-snakes, and in producing briers, nettles,
thorns, and poisonous plants, to the full extent of his abi
lity, for the purpose of disfiguring the earth, and of annoy-
ing to the uttermost of his power the human creatures,
whom he foresaw would be brought into existence, and be
.devoted to the good spirit's will.
    " For, now, another important event took place, which
gave origin to the human race.      On a sudden, many of the
animals who had lived on the land and in the water, un
derwent a strange transmutation.      They laid aside their ac
customed figure and disposition, and were transformed,
the males to men, and the females to women.           And ac
cording to the brutal species whence the human individual?
are reported to have sprung, do the Indians denominate
their families and tribes.    And thus the descendants of the
tear, {he deer, the tortoise, the wolf, and of many others,
distinguish themselves very carefully by the name of their
       bus was the world produced," in the opinion of the
Jroquois;
            " thus the rulin           introduced into     it,
                                                            and
thus the race of man brought into existence.
   " As to the earth itself, it rests upon the back of the im
mense tortoise, who, in the beginning, received the female
visitor from beyond the clouds. He supports        it,
                                                   balances       it,
and carries it with him wherever he swims on the vast ex
panse  of waters.     And     the old   persons   relate that some
of their warriors   and hunters have travelled so far to the
westward, that they have actually seen his enormous leg
project from his body, beneath the shell, where the waves
of the ocean roll against him in vain. They have also re
marked, when he feels uneasy and changes his posture, the
motion communicated to the land occasions earthquakes;
and when he inclines     little to one side or the other, he

An Account of a Method of Breeding Fish            to Advantage*.
                           To the Editor.
Sir,    As   you have desired me to give you my opinion
in what manner salmon, trout, and other fresh river fish,
of which    roes or spawns are to he obtained, can be bred to
advantage,     I was anxious to oblige you ; and for that pur
pose    I went to a place in the county of Lippe, to visit Mr.
Jacobi, who has brought this kind of breeding of fish to
great perfection ; and who not only showed me his ma
chines, but likewise told me his method, and produced a
   regnant egg in the latest stage, in which the trout could

about twelve feet tang, and fixed in a place where there
was a water-fall from a spring,             which was conveyed
through a small gutter into the trough, so as to cause
a great water-fall.       Upon this trough was a cover like
the lid of a box, with several holes in it of six inches
square, which were filled up with a wire grating, not only
to admit air, but so close as to prevent the water-mice pass
ing through, which follow close to the fish at spawning-
time, ana are very fond of the spawn. At the lower end
of this trough, about five inches above the bottom, was
a hole filled up with the same kind of wire grating, and of
the same size as that at the top; through which the water
runs into a fish-pond or canal, by which means there is
always in the trough five inches deep.          In this trough was
a kind of coarse gravel, such as is commonly met with in
gravelly ponds, laid about two inches thick, enough to
cover the whole bottom.         December is the spawning- time
for trout or salmon. You may at that time take a female
 fish, and press and rub its belly gently, and it will part very

and it will do just as well as if both fishes were alive. Carry
then this bason with the mixed spawn to the trough, before
the water is let in ; sprinkle it very thin upon the coarse
gravel ; then convey the water from the spring into the
trough through the holes in the covering ; and nothing is
further to be observed at this time, than that the water may
have its constant current through the wires, and that these
wires may be kept clean from tilth : the third or fourth day
after, open the trough to inspect whether the spawn is not
covered with slime or nastiness ; in which case move with
a flat hand the upper part of the water horizontally, and
tolerably briskly ; which motion will clean the spawn from
slime, and at the same time turn the eggs.
     In this manner does this ingenious gentleman breed
annually vast quantities of trout ; and he has observed, that
 as soon as the fish is out of its egg, it has on its belly a
 bladder, from which it receives its first nourishment, and
 which becomes every day less, till it vanishes at last ; and so
 long as this bladder appears, he suffers the young ones to
 remain in the trough ; afterwards he lets them out into the
 pond to seek for food for themselves.         He has proceeded
 in the same manner with salmon, and with the same good
 success.

 An Answer to a Question in No. 48 of the Hanover Maga
        zine, 1764, concerning the Spawning of Fish.
     To answer part of the question, I shall impart my obser
 vations, which I have made for a long time past, and such
  as I have lately made.     I shall confine myself only to such
 fish as are found in ponds and rivulets in this country.
  After many years experience, I have found that the spawn
  ing of fishes differs every year ; partly owing to the influence
  of the weather, or to the beds in which they spawn ; some
  require hard and stony, others soft and slimy, others bushy
                                              The trouts will not
 spawn but in a stony and gravelly bottom, although others
  frequently creep under roots of trees, and in hollows near

    the shore, where they are sometimes so entangled thst
    they may be caught with the hand ; they avoid spawning
    there, but will return again to fiud a place where the water
    has a fall and runs briskly, and where there is a gravelly
    bottom.      After they have chosen a place, they will beat
   violently    into    the gravel or coarse sand till they make a
   deep   hole,   and    so deep that it is frequently to be seen the
   next dav, notwithstanding the current stream. This shows
   what difficulty the trouts have to part with their spawn, as
   they, of all small fishes, have the largest eggs ; they are
   longer about their spawning, and they frequently begin in
   November and continue till February.                The fishermen are
   well acquainted with the spawning- places, and know how
   to make their advantage of            it,   by
                                             placing baskets near them,

 the year; the first part with their spawn in the two first
 months of' the year, and are called February pikes ; and if
 the water is even covered with ice, they approach the shore
 under the ice, till they find a little grass, on w,hich they
hang their spawn. The second sort spawns in March ;
 their fry thrives generally best on account of the waters
 being then high, and the weather milder at this season.
Therefore they will get into meadows overflown with water,
 and do not seem to care if their backs are even out of the
water. They generally travel by pairs, and part with their
 spawn by continually rubbing against each other with great
noise, and many times the larger devours the smaller in
 this business. When it happens that the weather is proper
for them, and that the waters do not fall suddenly, but ra
 ther rise, and that the sunshine causes the air to be mild,
they breed in great abundance ; and these pikes, which are
called grass-pikes, are afterwards to be met with in great
plenty ; which is looked upon in general as an omen that
it will be a bad corn year; and it is commonly correct, not
that it has any connection therewith, but that the soil in
our climate (Germany) will not bear much wet for the
growth of corn.       The third part spawn in May, and are
called May pikes.
    Carps and carouches      spawn but once a year, which
is in the summer; they part with their spawn without
much trouble, and in all places ; but the spawn does
not thrive every where ; and we hear frequent complaints,
that ponds which have had plenty have no young fry;
but when ponds come to be inspected, it is found that'those
places which are proper for spawning are full of weeds
or filth, for they require a clay bottom : a small spot in «
pond is sufficient to breed vast numbers, and the spawning-
ponds are full of weeds, and require to be annually cleaned,
and the number of the young ones to be lessened : without

their scales a glutinous substance, which is called grief';

stony carps, or stony carouches.      A good ceconomist will
never suffer any of these sorts to remain in his ponds longer,
than three years ; and in a middling pond seldom above
twelve female and three or four male carps or carouches.
When the store carps are put into the spawning-ponds,
some tenches are put in along with them ; and when the
sperm of the male tench is mixed with the female spawn
of the carp, it produces what we call spiegal carps. It is
believed that a fish is produced from the mixture of carps

XXXVIII.         On the Generation   and other obscure Facts In
           the   Natural History of the   Common       Eel.
                         To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,  In   your 133d Number for May last, page 410, it is
stated as a curious fact in the natural history of the com
mon eel, that a number, consisting of old and young, had
been discovered in a subterranean pool at the bottom of an
old quarry, which had been filled up and its surface ploughed
and cropped more than twelve years.      The information was
evidently intended to convey an opinion that the young
eels, found in the pool, had actually been bred therein ; and
could that circumstance have been unequivocally established,
it would have been a new and interesting fact in the natural
history of the animal.        I
                              however imagine, that a strict
investigation of all the circumstances of the case, made on
the spot, would have shown that the young eels had re
cently found their way into the pool, in the same manner
as the old ones had formerly done ; that              is,
                                                     some a-by
queous communication, however temporary or trivial, with
any the most insignificant adjoining brook or rill.              It   is
certainly difficult to conceive how even  subterranean pool
                                             a
can preserve its water for more than     dozen years, per

cation, however temporary, and however minute, had ex
isted, the circumstance of finding the old and young eels
together would be only an ordinary occurrence.      Indeed        I

          in the Natural History  of the common    Eel.      273
find no difficulty in pronouncing, that the case spoken of
furnishes no satisfactory evidence of the fact it was intended
to establish.
   I believe there is no animal, if we except man himself,
that is so universally disseminated over every climate and
country in the globe as the common eel.        In almost every
instance where fresh water either flows, or is permanently
stationary, the eel is an inhabitant ; and throughout every
part of our own country, not only every river and brook,
but also every piece of stationary water, from the largest
lakes down to many of our common wells, are found, in
the proper season, to abound with eels ; and yet both the
place and the manner of their propagation still remain a
question in zoology.     There are also many other facts in
their history that are very obscure, and it would be an in
teresting addition to the researches or' the British zoologist
to have the whole satisfactorily cleared up.     In furtherance
of this object, and to narrow the field of inquiry, 1 here
offer, Mr. Editor, such facts as have fallen within my own
observation, of the natural habitudes of the eel.      They are
chiefly intended to induce some of your intelligent readers,
whose situation furnishes them with better sources of in
formation, to communicate what they can learn on the
subject.
   In all inland waters eels abound without number in
summer, but disappear in winter.       This disappearance has
been variously accounted for, and it has been very generally
imagined that a large proportion hibernate by bedding them
selves in mud ; a notion which, I believe, is quite as vi
sionary as the hibernation of swallows under water. Were
eels ever in the habit of penetrating into mud, they would
naturallv enough shelter themselves therein when exposed
to imminent danger, and no other mode of escape presented
itself; but I have seen very many instances of muddy pools,
purposely and speedily drained off, where multitudes of
eels crawled over the light surface of the mud in all direc
tions to escape, and without ever attempting to conceal
themselves by penetrating into it. The full and clear eye of
the eel also furnishes evidence that Nature never intended
the animal to be buried under mud.
   The disappearance of eels in rivers and brooks may be
well accounted for by their emigration to the sea. This
emigration is called their running.      It commences in au
tumn, when immense quantities pass down the streams.
Great numbers take the advantage of descending with
floods, but a large proportion pass downwards in the night,

    274       On the Generation and other obscure Facts
    and    only  in the darkest    and  most tempestuous nights.
    Moonshine wholly      suspends  their progress; and even a tem
    porary gleam    or light,  when  the  night is otherwise favour
    able, immediately interrupt* vth?ir journey.        This prove9
    that their emigration is not a casual but a premeditated
    system in their existence : and itaiso displays their instinc
    tive cunning; for, being an easy prey, when discovered, to
    otters, herons, and other nocturnal enemies, it is only in
    the darkest nights that they can travel in salety. During
    the period of their run, vast quantities are caught in bagr
    nets set across the streams. There is reason to suspect that
    all the eels in rivers do not run for the sea, as very early
    in the spring large eels abound in rivers at such a distance
    in- land, as renders it highly improbable that they can have
    ascended so far at so early a period; and indeed it is yet an
    unascertained fact, whether, of the vast multitude which
    unquestionably do pass downwards to the sea, any of them
    do again return and ascend to anv distance up the streams.
    If, indeed, this retrograde emigration really existed to any
    extent, there are thousands of situations on our streams
    where it must ha/e been every season perceived ; and yet it
    has not only not been discovered, but the instances are fre
    quent, where the obstacles on many of our streams render it
    impracticable, and where, nevertheless, larpe eels are found
/   above these obstacles as early and as abundantly as below
    them. The probability therefore is, that few or none of the
    vast numbers which descend the streams ever again return ;
    and then, as they are never discovered in the sea itself, the
    question of what ultimately becomes of them, is just as
    obscure as that of their generation,
  i     There are many lakes, and multitudes of pools, abound
    ing with eels, and from which they cannot run on account
    of the insufficiency of the outlets; and in these situations
    the eels most certainly continue during the period of their
    existence.     There, however, they regularly disappear in
    winter, and the manner of their hibernating is entirely un
    known ; but as no species of animal with which we are ac
    quainted ever docs breed during the time of its hiberna
    tion, (the thing indeed seeming physically impossible,) and
     as eels in these confined situations are taken at all other
    times, without any vestige of propagation being dis
    covered amongst them, the inference seems conclusive,
    that eels never do, under any circumstance, breed in fresh
    water.     Were it indeed practicable in a single instance, it
    would be equally so in thousands of others w here the cir
    cumstances are so similar ; and it would be passing strange

            in the Natural History    of the  common    EeL        1 73
  If a solitary quarry-pit, which had been excluded for a
  dozen years even from day-light, were to discover to us an
  Occurrence which is never displayed in our multitudinous
  open pools, where the same animals are equally restricted
  from escape.
     In contradistinction to the vast emigration of old eels
  down the streams in autumn, an immensely greater mi
  gration of young ones commences up the streams in spring
 and summer.       Their size varies between the smallest and
 the largest darning needle.        They are called elvers, and
 abound in some of our large rivers to an inconceivable ex
 tent.    In some places bushels of them arc taken with bas
 kets fixed on to the ends of poles, and drawn swiftly through
 the water.     Their progress is always along the banks, and
 numerous portions pass up into all the lateral streams. The
 smallest brook and the minutest rill that can run receive
 their proportion; and it is solely in this way that every piece
 of water, however or wherever it may be situated, receives
the eels that are found in it. The smallest possible trick-
line; of water from any pool to the nearest brook, is suffi
cient to enable these little indefatigable animals to wind
 their way up to the source. The instinct, indeed, which
 impels them upwards against all moving water seems
 incessant and irresistible; it surmounts every difficulty,
and perseveres successfully against every obstacle how
ever imperious. During the low; state of streams in the
early part of summer, they may be found at weirs, mill-
dams, cascades, and other .elevations across the streams,
ascending by the margin of the water perpendicular walls
many feet in height, where the least crevice in the stone,
or patch of moss, affords them a hold ; and they will even
find their way over vertical dry boards, by adroitly em
ploying their glutinous exterior.         I have taken      them in
handfuis from patches     of wet  moss  against  erect  walls, com
pletelv out of the   water,  and  where   the  height  and  distance
to be surmounted would require the persevering             efforts of
many days.       In  very   small  pellucid   brooks,   adjacent    to
rivers where they     abound,   they may     be seen   wriggling up
the little streams in endless succession for weeks together.
Great numbers doubtless perish by ascending the temporary
rills produced from rain, and by reaching spring- heads,
and situations where the water is insufficient for their
growth and support ; but in this, as in every other instance,
provident nature has guarded against all such casual ex
penditure by the superabundance of the production.

276      On the Natural History     of the common  Eel.
   In the larger rivers communicating with the sea, althongh
the elvers appear to advance in vast bodies, I do not ima
gine their migration, either in its commencement or pro
gress, is made in concerted shoals ; it seeming more pro
bable that the number found together is accidental, and arisis-
from the continual supply sent off from the quarter where
they originate.      This is confirmed in the small streams,
where each individual is seen making its way by its own
solitary efforts.
   In summer all the large eels in rivers and brooks conceal
themselves during the day under large stones and roots of
trees, and in the crevices of rocks and walls, and even in
earth-holes of the banks ; and in these situations they ob
tain a large proportion of their food, being always mi the
watch to seize small fish, or other prey that the stream or
accident throws into their concealment; and I think it is
much more probable that the eels which do not find their
way down to the sea, pass the winter in similar situations,
rather than bedded in mud, or in any other of the fanciful
modes which have been assigned them.
   Such are a few of the principal facts in the natural his
tory of the common eel, a creature which every where su.-
rounds us in the greatest abundance, and yet its origin and
final disposal are equally unknown.         That it never does
breed in fresh water seems to be a fact well established ;
and the periodical descent of the old ones to the sea, and
ascent of the young: ones from thence, strongly evince
that the scene of their propagation is in the sea itself, or
very near to the mouths of rivers, and that it is there that
inquiries on the subject should be prosecuted.
   The growth of the eel, like that of most other fish of
prey, does not appear limited to any determinate natural
bulk, but to be governed only by the age and abundance
of food. In this country they are indiscriminately of every
size, up to eight or nine pounds weight. They have gene
rally been supposed viviparous : but the immense abun
dance of the young certainly bespeaks an oviparous pro
geny; and this is supported by analogy in the lampTey eel,
which breeds commonly enough in most of our estuaries.
   The tenacious vitality of the eel is well known, and is
yery extraordinary;      for after decapitation, skinning, and
 embowelling,     the separated portions of the body will still
 exhibit strong movement.        This is a property seemingly
 common to all similarly lengthened animals, and obviously
 results from the comparatively small proportion of nerves
                                                         which

XXXIX.         Experiments on the Production of Sounds in
    Vapours. By M. BroT. — Head at the Institute, October
    12, 1807*.
Numberless            experiments have been made by natural
philosophers      on  the  production and propagation of sound
 in different mediums : they have demonstrated that it nei
 ther is produced nor propagated in vacuum; they have ex
amined its transmission through liquid and solid bodies :
but no one, to my knowledge, has repeated those experi
ments in vapours, and yet this research is well adapted to
excite curiosity ; for in discriminating between the facts
 which experience has disclosed relative to the constitution
of vapours which fill a space, and in applying to them
mathematical principles, the foundations of the established
 laws of the mmute vibrations of elastic fluids, it is evident,
that absolutely no sound should be produced in them.
    In fact, it is proved bv t tie experiments of Deluc, Sius-
sure, and Dalton,       that the quantity of the vapours of water,
or of any oiher liquid formed in vacuum, depends alone on
 the dimensions of the s| ace and on the temperature : in
 short, if thi< vapou has an elastic force, capable of sus
tainmg the manometer at a certam height, and it it be
slowlv compressed, so that it mav occupy less space, the
elastic force will not increase bv this compression, as would
 happen to a permanent gas; but purt of the vapour will
 assume the liquid state, without which the manometer va
ries, and it becomes stat'onarv only as it agrees ui'h the
new limits to which the space i* reducid. But the contrary
 will happen if the space is mcrease*! mstead of bung dimi
 nished : alresh quantity of van ur will arise to fill it, with
out producmg anv change either m ti e elasiic force or in
the manometer.          Thesr resul-s are perf-ec lv es>ablished by
philosophers, whom I shall here fter q-lote, and we may
with great ease be convmced of their accuracy.                  For the

purpose it is sufficient to introduce into a barometer a smalj
quantity of any liquid, and to measure the height at which
the mercury stops after being depressed by the elastic force
of the vapour that is formed. 1f then the external surface
of the mercury is either elevated 01 depressed, the interior
column will rise or fall in the tube precisely in the same
proportion ; and according as the space which remains in,
the top of the tube is diminished or increased, a part of the
vapour will precipitate itself or rise afresh ; but the tempe
rature remaining the same, no variation will appear in the
elastic force.
   Now, supposing a sonorous body vibrates in a simi
lar medium, each of its oscillations will diminish, in
one sense, the space, and will augment it in the other.
Thus on one side there will he a small quantity of vapour
which will pass into the liquid state ; and on the contrary,
a small quantity of liquid that will assume the state of va
pour.     These condensations and expansions will take place
very  near   the sonorous body, in the immediate vicinity of
the vibrations ; but they will not be further extended. Thus
the impulse will not be exerted on the remaining fluid mass,
and consequently the sound will not be transmitted.         Now
let us suppose that the sonorous body, compressing the
vapour by its rapid vibrations, mechanically disengages
from it a certain quantity of heat. This supposition is not at
all improbable, for it is well known that much heat is emit
ted during the condensation of vapour.         For instance, the
vapour    of  water, according   to the  experiments    of Watt,
sets at liberty, whilst passing from the aeriform to the fluid
state, heat sufficient to raise the mass of water thus formed
to 525 of the thermometer centesimal. Paying attention to
this circumstance, the effects of a sonorous body on vapour
are not the same; the compressed         portions maintain the
state of an elastic fluid in spite of the diminution of space,
on account of the liberated heat, which gives them a mo
mentary increase of power.        On the contrary, in the ex
panded portion, the decrtase of temperature prevents a new
formation of vapour, and occasions a diminution of elasti
city.   The phenomena which are produced near the sono'-
rous body, are, then, of the same nature as if the vapour be
came a permanent gas.        They consist of increments and
diminution of elasticity successively and momentarily pro
duced, spreading their effects from strata to strata through
the whole fluid mass, so as to permit the production and
propagation of sound.
   Experiments, therefore, on the production of sound in
                                                          vapour

 vapour are verv proper to decide the question, whether heat
 is really disengaged by the effect ot the vibrations of sono
 rous bodies in an aeriform medium, as we see generally takes
 place on all rapid compressions.           To this test. and it is a
 decisive test, may the ingenious idea of M. La Place be sub
 mitted, by which he has round means to reconcile the ma
 thematical theorv of the propagation of sound in air with
 experimental results, in which the disengaged heat was
 dulv attended to; for, if the effect which he infers does not
 really take place, the vibrations of sonorous bodies in va
 pours ought absolutelv to produce no sound ; and if any
 is produced, it can be considered only as the sole effect of
 the liberated heat.
     Influenced bv this motive, T made on the subject some
 experiments which were attended with evident success ; and
 I have since repeated .hem in a more complete manner at
 Arcueil with mv friend Amcdee BcrthoMet. M. Berthollet
 and M. La Place were present at those experiments, and
 fully satisfied themselves of the truth ot the facts which I
 proceed     to relate.
     We    used a glass balloon of the capacity of 36 litres ; its
 orifice was closed by a perfectly tight stop-cock, so that an
 exhaustion might be made, and preserved good.               To this
 another might be connected, that, bv pouring a liquid into
 the intermediate hollow and closing both cocks, this por
 tion of liquid might be introduced into the interior of the
 balloon without any danger of admitting the least external
air. Lastly, the sonorous body was a small bell suspended
 within bv a very fine coid tied to the lower stop -cock.
    First, a vacuum was formed in the interior of the appa
ratus with the greatest care, and even the largest part of
the hygrometric water of the balloon, which was always
very drv, was abstracted.         Then holding 'he balloon by the
stop-cock, the bell was set in motion, satisfying ourselves
that the blows fell with force on the nie:a! ; and whatever
attention was paid, or however near we were to the balloon
itself, it was absolutelv impossible to distinguish any per
ceptible sound : therefore sound is not sensible in the va
cuum     ;  a fact  constantlv in harmony with tne experiments
of Hawksbee,         and of all other natural philosophers.
    Then proceeding as I have described, a small quantity of
water was introduced, part of which rose in vapour,             im
mediatelv the sound became perceptible; vet the density of
this vapour was very little, the temperature being no more
than 10 of the thermometer centesimal : to increase it an
excess of water was added, and the balloon was carried into
                                    S 4                    a gieeu

280       On the Production   of Sounds in Vapours,
a  green-house {une Stuve), the temperature of which was
4 6°: then the sound became very sensible ; it was heard by
us, without inclining ourselves to the balloon, and even,
through the door without the green-house: — there yet re
mained in the balloon water in the liquid slate : tiius there
is no doubt of the production and propagation of sound in
watery vapour.
    When the balloon was taken out of the green-house its.
temperature quickly fell : of course the principal part of
the vapour raised by the means of temperature         was pre
cipitated ; the sound likewise appeared very sensibly dimi
nished. Without making any change in the apparatus, the
same quantity of alcohol as water was introduced.        Water
considered as 1J, the specific gravity of this alcohol was
0"823.    The vapour formed of this mixture was necessarily
of greater density and elasticity than that of water at the
same temperature; the sound too was much more sensible,
it was heard from the extremities of the rooms forming the
Museum of Natural History. Thus is sound also produced
and propagated in the vapour of alcohol.
    For our conclusive experiment we made trial of the va
pour of ether : it was peculiarly interesting to us on account
of its great density and elastic force, which are known tp
be very considerable ; two circumstances which should in
crease the intensity of the sound.     The balloon was first
dried, as humidity diminishes the tension of the ether;
then the atmospheric air was freely allowed to enter until
an equilibrium    was produced with the external pressure,
which was 0-76l3 ; the balloon was taken into a long alley
in the garden, and the sound of the bell was found to be
 sensible even to the distance of 145m ; beyond this it be
came so weak that the sensation was not sufficiently distinct.
The temperature was 17-75. Having measured by this ex
periment the intensity of sound produced in atmospheric
air, a vacuum was again made in the balloon, and more
sulphuric ether was introduced than the temperature could
raise in vapour.     The specific gravity of this ether was
0*759; the clastic force of its vapour, measured by being
introduced under a barometer purged of air, was Om 35*49
at the temperature of 17-56.     The balloon being thus filled
with vapour was removed to the place where the preceding
experiment had been made, and the sound was ascertained
 to be sensible at the distance of 131m-5, a convincing proof
 that sound is produced and propagated in vapour as well as in
permanent gas.      But we have proved that this can only be
effected by the instantaneous variations of temperature de
                                                      termined.

termined by the vibrations.   Hence it is evident that this
cause is the true one ; and according to the beautiful re
mark of M. La Place, there is an absolute necessity to pay
attention to it in the mathematical theory of the propaga
tion of sound, although it cannot be verified by means of
the thermometer, as it is an instrument not to be affected
by successive and momentary variations of heat, similar
to the barometer, which does not show the instantaneous
changes of the elastic force, the cause of sound, and yet
the reality of those changes is acknowledged by the whole
world.
XL.     Observations  on the remarkable Efficacy of Carrots,
     under a new Mode of application, in the Cure of Ulcers
     and Sores.    By Mr. Richard Walker*.
The    carrot poultice is an application which has been long
in use to correct, the disposition and improve the discharge
pf the putrid or scorbutic ulcer.
  The manner in which it is usually applied, is by grating,
or scraping the carrots fine, and laying them on raw.
   I have latelv had reason to believe, that the effects of it
may be considerably increased, by varying the mode of ap
plication.
   Several cases occurred in the RadclifTe infirmary,         dirring
the summer and beginning of the winter last year,             of    the
true, malignant, scorbutic ulcer.
   All the common methods of treatment were adopted, and
of course the carrot poultice was not omitted.
   The inefScacy of it however was loo evident.
   In consequence therefore of the        ill
                                       success attending this
practice, several of the cases terminating fatally, and as
fresh instances were continually occurring, the following
change was at length tried,      the use of this remedy.
                                   in
   The carrots being previously cleaned               by
                                                  scraping and
washing, were split and boiled til] quite tender, in      small
                                                              a
quantity of water "the liquor was then strained, or poured
                    ;
off, and the carrots beaten in     mortar, to the consistence
                                     a
of anfuniform soft moist pulp.
   The ulcers were first washed clean with the liquor rather
warm, in which the carrots had been boiled, sometimes
fomented with     it,and the carrot poultice being previously
spread ready,   that the sore might be as little exposed to the
air as possible, applied cold.
   This was repeated night and morning, and oftener when
                   *    Communicated by the Author.
                                                                    the

  862             On the remarkable Efficacy           of Carrots
  the quantity of discharge, or other circumstances, made it
 necessary ; but this was seldom required, when the mode
 above mentioned was adopted sufficiently early; that is,
 before the sore hid made much progress in its scorbutic
 state.
      It scarce need be observed, that this disposition was
 known to have taken place, when the ulcer, from being
 firm, florid, and discharging good pus, became sponsty,
            and discharged a considerable quantity of a thin,
 Eallid,
   loody, or gleety kind of matter,
      The superior effects of this treatment were apparent in a
 very short time ; in a few days the sores (several of which,
 before, were spreading rapidly, threatening the lives of the
 patients) were obviously improved ; and in short, without
 any interruption to their progress in amendment, they were
 all of them gradually restored to a healthy appearance;
 and the cure tinished, either by a continuance of this, or
 the methods ordinarily used to sores in a healthful healing
 state.
      In all  the cases above alluded to, bark, opium, &c, were
 as usual    administered.
      Nothing, however, has been particularly stated with re
 spect to the exhibition of such remedies ; as the object of
the present paper is merely to direcythe attention of prac
 titioners to the use of the carrot poultice, and to recom
mend, under the sanction of many successful cases, the mode
of applying it above described*.
    Oxford, November 2, 1795.
                                                          November fi0, 1803.
     Since the above was written, a very considerable number
 of similar     cases have at different times occurred, in which
 the efficacy of the carrot poultice, applied as above, has
been abundantly confirmed ; viz. verv large sores chiefly on
 the leg, extending in some instances from the knee to the
ancle, originating from accidental injury, habitual ulcers
likewise, surfaces of stumps, and other sores atter opera
                                                                                   '

    • The antiseptic power of the carrot
                                           poultice has been ascribed, I believe,
to the carbonic acid gas which the ^ore is supposed to imbibe from it during
its application ; hence it might be inferred that the carrot was fittest tor use
in its raw slate.
    I am however rather inclined to impute the efficacy of the carrot to its mild,
anti-putresceut quality, depending chieflv on the pulpy saccharine matter it
contains, in common with other vegetables, but in greater abundance ; me
lioraved and softened into the fittest consistence by boiling and pounding for
application to the tender, irritable surface of ulcers, sores, inflamed skin, &c.
                                                                        tioned.

tioned.      In every one of these cases the carrot poultice has
been the immediate and constant resource, and with the
completest success*.
     As the efficacy of carrot poultice in different sores, and
the fittest mode of its application, have, occasionally, ever
since its adoption, engaged my particular attention, viz.
for a period of nearly ten years, 1 am now enabled to speak
more confidently, and with greater precision on the subject,
and shall therefore give a more particular detail of every
circumstance relative to it ; premising in addition to what
I have before said respecting that morbid disposition of a
sore which requires this remedy, that it is commonly pre
ceded by a more than usual disposition in the sore to bleed
 on the slightest touch or motion, and very quickly after
 this appearance the diseased state alluded to follows.
     The carrots are now cut in thin transverse slices (instead
 of being split) for boiling, and the poultice when ready,
 observing to have it as moist as it will admit of without the
 inconvenience of its running about, instead of being spread
 on the cloth, is applied wherever the situation of the part
                                                                                '
 will allow, by laying it on in portions with the hand, fill-
 jng up first the cavities lightly, and then laying a coating
 of it about the thicknes or rather more than that of an or
 dinarv poultice, over the whole surface of the sore, and
 considerably beyond th? edges of the sore ; pressing it elose,
 smooth, and of an uniform thickness, quite to the edge of
 the poultice ; otherwise it will become dry at the edge, and
 occasion some inconvenience in removing, by its adhesion.
      The cloth or tine linen is then to be applied and pinned
 tight over it ; and a short roller may be used in order to
 keep the poultice uniformly close, and prevent it from being
 displaced t-
      The more recently the carrot poultice has been boiled
  and prepared the fitter it is for use, therefore it is best when
  prepaied immediately before using.                 But as the process of
  boiling    the   carrots  sufficiently    requires  some time, enough
  may    be  made    at once   for  two   or   three  days consumption,
  but not longer, particularly in hot weather, when indeed
  it should be prepared daily ; and when it is necessary to
      * Large wmmds and ulcers not (infrequently acquire an ill-conditioned
  state, notwithstanding the most skiliul application of adhesive plaster, re
  quiring a suspension of that mode of praciice foi a time.
     .f The method here described of applying the poultice was found con
  venient in very large sores wiih irregular surface; but in general it mav be
  applied in the usual way spread on cloth, observing that the freah pou'ltieff
  be ready to be applied immediately on the removal of the old one.
                                                                        warm

884               On the remarkable Efficacy           of Carrots
warm it for application, this is best effected by placing a
bason containing it in a vessel of water over the fire.
    It is particularly requisite that the carrot poultice be ap
plied as moist as. can be, in order that it may not become
too dry by the next lime of application.
    As many of the cases in which it is applied are those in
which the.temperature of the body and the sore are consi
derably above, or hotter than the healthy temperature, par
ticular care should be taken that in such cases the poultice
be applied so as to produce in the patient a sensation of
coolness ; but in ordinary cases, a sensation of warmth.
    Most cases require it to be applied twice in the day, viz.
every morning and evening ; and very few indeed require it
oftener.
    If the sore should require from its foulness to be washed
at the time of dressing, it is best done by squeezing a
sponge full of the liquor out of a bason containing it over
the sore repeatedly             (catching the foul liquor in a bowl)
till cleansed ; the outside should then be wiped dry to the
edge ; the sore itself, however, should on no account be
touched with the sponge, but be cleansed with lint if ne»
cessary     *.
    The liquor may          be that in which the carrots have been
boiled, or in defect of that, milk and water or pure water,
observing that its temperature be not hotter than the sore
can bear with the most perfect ease to the patient. The
washing may be omitted unless when the sore is very foul f«
    The effect of the carrot poultice thus applied is to correct
the foetor or stench of ill-conditioned sores, and to reduce
them to a perfectly healthy or good -conditioned state;
moreover to thicken and diminish the discharge as well as
correct it ; hence it follows that it is particularly indicated
in large sores with too thin or too copious a discharge.
    When the sore is found to be sufficiently restored by the
use of the carrot poultice, it should be dressed by applying
first a single stratum of loosely made lint. not of the close
compact kind which is made by an instrument ; then a
pledget of any common simple cerate, spread fresh and
rather thick on fine cloth if the sore be very large, other
wise upon fine lint, sufficient to cover the edges of the sore
   * This precaution is particularly. necessary in putrid cases, to avoid the
danger of keeping up or renewing the contagion in the sore.
   f It is essential that the sore be as little exposed to the air as possible ;
hence it is better not to be very solicitous in cleansing the sore, the repeti
tion of the poultice effecting this sufficiently.

       In the cases before mentioned where the carrot poultice!
    is improper from pent-up matter, if the surface of the sore
    has acquired the scorbutic taint, a thin stratum of the car
    rot poultice may be applied over that surface, and the

a      short time, and then renewing the former, the sore will

   Carrots may be procured fit for use all the year round,
and though fittest when they have but just arrived at matu
rity, are nevertheless sufficiently efficacious at all reasons.
Or they may be collected at the proper season, and pre
served in sand, tdl the next return of them to a perfect
state.
    In defect of a pestle and mortar to pound the carrots, a
wooden wash-hand bowl, with an appropriately-formed
pestle of wood, having its base largely convex, in order to
bruise the carrots more readily, may be used in their stead.
    Of late years bark and Port wine have been much more
sparingly used in cases of scorbutic ulcers, &c., the carrot
poultice, with an ordinary restorative diet, having been
found to answer best.
    In large sores that require a great quantity of the carrot
poultice, the outer part of the poultice may be rather
coarse, but that which applies to the sore should in all
cases be a perfect pulp.
   The only objectionable circumstance, that I know of,
respecting the carrot poultice as an application, is its dis
position to become dry, particularly when used in small
quantities, as in small sores, or when the carrots are not in
their most succulent, pulpy state: this circumstance, how
ever, is completely obviated, by applying a stratum or por
tion of the prepared carrot upon the part affected, and lay
ing a poultice over it of linseed flour, or bread and milk, as
the nature of the case may seem to require.
   I have been induced to offer these observations to the at
tention of the public, from a conviction of the utility that
mav ensue from the knowledge of the efficacy of the carrot
poultice, thus prepared, being made general ; which has
hitherto, I have good reason to think, been chiefly con
fined to this vicinity ; where this poultice is used as well
in private practice as in the Infirmary, and with the most
eminent advantage.
                          POSTSCRIPT.
   At the time this mode was originally tried here, the
usual, and I suppose 1 may say, the constant practice in
surgery was, lo apply the carrots raw as before mentioned ;
this manner of using them being directed in all books of
surgery, and the practice of it confined chiefly to the pur
pose of removing the     smell or foetor of sores.

  trid and offensive, as to contaminate, as was supposed, the
  ward : several of the patients soon after, having sores,
  some even of a trifling description, which quickly assumed
  the putrid, scorbutic disposition above described, and se
 veral others in succession.
     This affair became so serious, that it was thought ad
 visable to have a consultation of the faculty, which accord
 ingly took place*
     The result of this was, all medical and chirurgical skill
 having been exhausted to no purpose, that all the wards
 should be fresh white-washed, and fumigated;             but still
 the evil continued with unabating fury*
     At this jucture, having observed the effects of the carrot
 poultice used then raw, to exceed, in some degree, the rest
 of the various remedies employed, consisting, among others,
 of the fermenting poultice, so highly esteemed in cases of
 this nature ; I proposed using a poultice made of the carrots
boiled, hoping their efficacy might be increased thereby,
 attending particularly to the process and application myself;
the result of which was, as before stated.
     The good effects indeed of this treatment were so decided,
that, although of sixteen cases which occurred in the course
of the' year 1 794, ten terminated fatally, notwithstanding
the most skilful application of the means then in use; there
was not one, out of at least the same number of cases,
equally dangerous, which presented themselves the year
after, but what ended well under this new method.
     Since that time this mode alone of applying the carrot
poultice has been in use in the Radcliffe Infirmary, not
only for the scorbutic or putrid kind of ulcer whenever it
occurred, but for all untoward or foul sores of every de
scription. -
     That the efficacy of the carrot poultice thus modified,
is not generally known, even at this time, I can assert
with some degree of confidence, having been repeatedly
assured by a professional          gentleman, that the carrot
poultice, prepared     in  the old  way, is still in general use,
and    without  attributing any efficacy toit,beyond that which
was originally allowed to that remedy.            Ithas, however,
lately found its way into some publications, but in         avery
vague and indeterminate manner.

 following      is the case alluded to :     "A    man about 50 years
 of  age,   and    who  had  lived  irregularly,   had been for several
 years    afflicted   with   ulcers  on  both  legs.   They at last ex
 tended from the knee to the ankle downwards, the dis
 charge being greater and the sores worse-conditioned along
 the shin-bone in front of the leg.                When the writer of
 this article fi>3t saw the man in question he was confined
 to bed, and had been unable to walk across the room for
 several weeks : he had been successively attended by all
 the medical gentlemen of the town in which he lived, and
 had undergone several courses of medicine with a view
 to purify the system, but without effect : his sores were
 dressed with the usual ointments.            The application of tur
 nip poultices was suggested to him by a country woman
 who came into the town on market-days. Her instructions
 were, that he should night and 'morning apply poultices of
 white turnips to the sores, previously bathing them with
 the liquor, squeezed out when the roots were boiled into
 pulp.     The poultices were directed to be applied hot. The
 above directions were faithfully attended to by the patient
 under the inspection of the writer of this article : within
 the first twenty-four hours the ulcers had assumed a diffe
 rent appearance, and in about a week from the first appli
 cation of the turnips, the ulcers were so far healed that the
 man was able to walk out.              In a few days afterwards the
 sores entirely disappeared,        and the skin soon resumed its
 usual appearance.         During this period no medicine was
 taken by the patient ; the state of his bowels not even re
 quiring   a dose of salts."

M ixed         Decrements. — Decrements are so called in
which the numbers of ranges subtracted in breadth and
height give ratios, the two terms of which exceed unity.
Such are the decrements which take place by two ranges in
breadth and by three ranges in height, or by three ranges
in breadth and two in height, &c. We see that their the
ory may be easily referred to that of decrements in which
there is only a single range subtracted in one of the two di
rections.
    Intermediate Decrements. —We have seen that in
the case of a decrement by one -range round one and the

same solid angle       0 (fig. 20), the three faces produced were
always on a level, and that in this case we might confine
ourselves to the consideration of the effect of the decre
 ments with respect to one of the plane angles, which con
 curred to the formation of the solid angle, by supposing
 this effect to be prolonged above the adjacent faces.                     In
 this case the decrements which- take place on these latter
 faces are reckoned as intervening in a subsidiary manner,
 in order to favour the action of the principal decrement.
     In general, whenever a solid angle of the primitive
 form undergoes decrements which tend to give rise to
 a facet in its place, whatever be the law of that to which
 we refer the production of this facet, there are always auxi
 liary decrements, the concurrence of which is necessary in
 order that the facet in question may be properly prolonged.
    Now, when this decrement, which we consider in pre
 ference, takes place by two or more ranges, the auxiliary
decrements which form a continuity with it follow a law
entirely peculiar, the consideration of which is the object
of this article.
    Let A A' (fig. 32) be any given parallelopipedon which
undergoes a decrement by two ranges on the angle EO I,
of its base A EO I. It is evident that the edges of trte
laminae of superposition- will have directions be, rs,*
parallel to the diagonal which goes from £ to I, and situated
in such a manner that there will be on the edges O E, 01,
two ridges (aretes) of molecules comprised either between
the term of departure Oand b c, or between be and rs. But,
as we have said, the laminae applied on the adjacent faces
IOA'K, EOA'H, also undergo variations or auxiliary
decrements, which continue the effect of the decrement on
the angle E O I. Now, such are the variations in this case,
that the edges of the laminae piled up on the face I O A'K,
have directions c g, s t, and that those of the laminae which
rise on the face EOA'H are lineally disposed like bg, r t.
For, since the lower edge of the first lamina applied on
A E O I coincides with b c, and as the height of this
lamina answers to a ridge of a molecule, we may, with a
little attention, conceive that the plane beg, which, in
one part also coincides with b c, and in another is re-
   * We must conceive that the subtractions which are here represented on
the quadrilater A £ O I take place successively on the different Iaminx of
superposition.   The distances betweon cacii of these Iaminx and the suc
ceeding one beimr the same with that which exists between the lines b c, ri,
and all the rest similarly situated, we may, for the sake of greater conve
nience, refer the whole, as we do in the present instance, to the quadrilater
A E O I, as a kind of scale which gives the measurements of the subtraction!
operated by the decrement on the corresponding Uminse.
                                                                     moved

produced by the decrement.       It is the same with the plane
rts;    from which it follows, that if we suppress the part
situated above rts, we shall have a solid on which the
facet rts will represent the effect of the decrement under
consideration.
    We may now observe that the directions c g,s t (fig. 32)
of the laminae applied to the face 10 A'K (and the same
may be said of the face EOA'H) in virtue of the auxiliary
decrement, are no longer parallel either to the ridge or to
the diagonal, but comprehended between both.         A fortiori
the defect of parallelism will take place, if we suppose that
the decrement on the angle EO 1 of the base proceeds by
three, four, or more ranges.       Decrements of this kind are
called intermediate ; and we conceive that they may be re
ferred to an infinity of different directions, according as
they are more or less removed from the one or other of
their limits, which are the parallelism with the ridges and
the parallelism with the diagonals.
    In cases similar to fig. 32, we avoid the kind of com
plication which would flow from the immediate considera
tion of those intermediate decrements, by supposing them
contained in the principal decrement. But certain crystals
exist, in which the three decrements considered round one
and the same solid angle are all intermediate.     In this case
we choose the simplest for the principal, regarding the two
others as auxiliary.
   Fig. 33 represents a case of this kind: cn, which is the
edge of the first of the laminae applied on AEO I, is situ
ated in such a manner that on the side 01 there are three
edges of molecules subtracted, and on the side O E there is
only one: n p, which is the edge of the first of the laminae
            I
applied on O A' K, indicates three ridges of molecules sub
tracted from O' I lengthways, and two from OA' length
ways : cp, which is the edge of the first of the laminae
piled up on E O A' H, determines a subtraction of two ridges
on O A', and of a single one on O E.
   Now it is easy to see that things go on, relatively to the
different faces situated around the angle O, as if the mole
cules which compose the laminae of superposition, being
invariably tied together in clusters, formed other molecules
of a higher order, and as if the subtractions were effected
by ranges of these last molecules. Thus there would be on
the base A E O I a decrement of triple molecules by two
ranges in height ; since on one hand the quadrilater c O n Z,
                        C      T 2                       which

292                    On Crystallography.
which represents the base of a compound molecule, is equi
valent to three bases of simple molecules, and as the line
Op, which corresponds to the height of a lamina of super
position, contains two ridges of simple molecules.           Wc
shall even conceive that the decrement relative to the face
EO A' H is produced by three ranges in height of double
molecules, because c Op a? contains two bases of simple
molecules, and as O n is equal to three ridges of simple
molecules.      Finally, in the decrement which acts on
I O A' K, there is a subtraction of a single range of triple
molecules in one sense and double ones in another.
    Between these three decrements, that which it would
seem most^natural to adopt as the principal is the second,
which takes place on the face EOA'H, because it is the
one whose direction is least removed from that of the dia
gonal which runs from A' to E'; or, if we please, because
it is formed by double molecules, and consequently less
compounded than those which are subtracted in virtue of
the two other decrements.        It is true that its measurement
 in the direction of the height is greater than that of the
 other decrements. But less regard ought to be paid to this
 element, which is common to it with the ordinary decre
 ments, than to the differences which separate them.
    We shall now give some examples of intermediate de
 crements.     Let 01 I' O' (fig. 34) be one of the faces of a
 cubical nucleus.     Let us conceive a decrement which takes
 place on all the angles by subtractions of double molecules.
 In this case the edges of the laminae of superposition will
 be directed like the lines dri, km, ab, eh, &c, on the
 hypothesis of their being a single range subtracted.
    Let E 1' (fig. 35) be the cubical nucleus. Let us sup
pose that the decrements are made parallel to the lines kin,
 lm, kr, Ir, always by subtractions of double molecules,
 but in such a manner that there are three ranges subtracted
 in the direction of the breadth, and two in that of the
 height, in which case the decrements will be at once inter
 mediate and mixed. Let us moreover suppose that the edges
 of the laminae of superposition, considered on the three
 faces situated round one and the same solid angle O, have
 transverse directions ; in such a manner that, with respect
 to the face Oil'  O', the greater number of ridges of molecules
 are subtracted on the side O1; that with respect to the
 faceEOO'E', it will be so on the side 0 0'; and with
 respect to the face E A I O, it will be so on the side EO.
    The effect of these various decrements will be to produce
 round each solid angle three faces, which will be situated
                                                               as

as the bevel with respect to those of the nucleus ; and be
cause the cube has eight solid angles, the secondary crystal
will have twenty-four faces, which will tend to unite in
fours in the form of a pyramidal summit above each face of
the nucleus. But if we suppose that the decrement does
not attain its limit, there will remain six faces parallel to
those of the nucleus, and we shall have the polyhedron
with thirty     faces, or the triacontahedron represented           in
fig. 36.
    By comparing this figure with the 35th, we shall easily
conceive that the faces km'       Ir  , k' m' I' /,  k" m" I' r" (fig.
36), which answer to those of the nucleus, should be
rhombs ; and because the number of ridges of molecules
subtracted lengthways from E O (fig. 35) is double of that
of the ridges subtracted lengthways from O I, and so with
the other sides ; the great diagonal of the rhombus will be
the double of the small diagonal, and the obtuse angle will
be 126° 52' 8", which is the measurement of the incidence
of the faces of the dodecahedron with twelve pentagons
 (fig. 14) at the places of the ridges tn, p q, &c.
    With respect to the faces m Tf r o, or* k" r', &c, (fig.
36) produced by the decrement, they will be all equal and
similar trapezoids ; and if we take for an example the tra
pezoid ml'    /  o, we shall have the angle m of 57° </ 50", the
angle O of 1 16= 6' 13", the angle /'of 11 1° 50' 44", and
the angle   /  of 75° 2' 13".
    This form is that of one of the varieties of sulphuretted
iron. Geometry has also its triacontahedron, all the faces
of which are equal and similar rhombs. This solid has se
veral interesting properties, which will be demonstrated in
the part assigned to geometrical calculation.
    L,et us now suppose intermediate decrements towards the
two lateral angles G, G' (fig. 31) of the faces of a rhomboid,
and always by ranges of double molecules, i. e. parallel to
the lines urn, xy, u'm', x y',            It is obvious that these
decrements will produce above each primitive rhombus,
such as S Gg" G', two faces, which, setting out from the
angles G, G , will converge       towards each other, and will
proceed to unite on a common ridge situated above the
diagonal S g", but inclined to this diagonal.             We shall
therefore have, as the complete result           of the  decrement,
twelve faces arranged by sixes towards each summit.
    Fig. 37 represents one of these solids, which results from
a decrement by a simple range of double molecules, in
such a manner that the edges of the laminae of superposi-
                                 T  3                            tion

tion preserve the same distances between them as on fig. 31,
This solid is circumscribed to its nucleus, whicli is that of
carbonated lime; aba' (fig. 37) indicates the direction of
a section which would be parallel to the face SGg"G',
and which is indicated by the same letters ?fig. 31), and we
easily conceive that the edges of this section should be
lineally disposed like those of the same lamina of superpo
sition. The paradoxical carbonated lime discovered by M.
Tonnellier is similar to this dodecahedron, abstraction,
being made of some additional facets.
   We find here that the nucleus touches the secondary
crystal by its lateral angles only, which are situated in the
ridges B S', D/,        C/, &c, whereas in metastatic carbon
ated lime,  which    is a dodecahedron of the same kind, i. e.
with scalene triangular faces, the lateral ridges of the nu
cleus are confounded with those which correspond with
B C, C D, D E, &c.
   This leads us to an hypothesis which will prove a remark
able property hi the paradoxical dodecahedron.          If
                                                     we ima
gine six trenchant  planes, one of which passes by the point?
C, D, F; a second by the points B, C, D ; a third by the
points G, B, h, &c, whfch is a way of dividing the crystal
analogous to that employed to extract the nucleus from the
metastatic, we shall also obtain a rhomboid, but which will
exist in imagination only, since the crystal does not subT
mit   to this kind of division.     Now it is demonstrated by
calculation that this rhomboid is similar to that of inverse
carbonated lime, the angle of which at the summit                       is,
75° 31' 20'.
   Besides,  if  sve consider this rhomboid as     afictitious nu
cleus, we find that the dodecahedron might be, so far as                it
   concerned,

                 by a
                    three ranges on the inferior edges.
  decrement
   Let us resume the true nucleus, and conceive that the
intermediate decrement, instead of being produced                  by
                                                                 one
range of double molecules, as      inthe paradoxical solid, takes
place  by  five ranges in breadth and four in height.          Then
the secondary crystal becomes similar to the metastatic
itself; and'if this result    isnever to be met with in nature,
the eye would be the more easily deceived              by    it,
                                                              as the
hypothetical nucleus would         be  presented under the ap
pearance of      real nucleus.
   We see    by a these details, to which  I   could give     much

 number of cases, produce forms equally simple with those
 which originate from the ordinary laws, and that their the
 ory even leads to results which would deserve to be followed
 and developed as a simple object of curiosity.
   . Secondary compound Forms. — We call simple secon
 dary forms, those which proceed from a single law of de
 crement, the effect of which masks the nucleus, which
 touches their surface only on certain points or certain
 ridges; and compound secondary forms, those which proceed
 from several simultaneous laws of decrement, or from a
 single law which has not attained its limit; so that there
 remain faces, parallel to those of the nucleus, and which
 concur with the faces produced by the decrement in modi
 fying the form of the secondary crystal.
     Let us suppose, for example, that the law which gives
 the octahedron originating from the cube (fig. 20, PI. Ill),
 is combined with that from which results the dodecahedron
 with pentagonal faces (fig. 15, PI. II). The first will give
 rise to eight faces, which will have as centres the solid angles
 of the nucleus ; and it is easy to see that each of these
 faces, for instance that whose centre coincides with the
 solid angle O (figs. 14 and 15), will be parallel to the equi
 lateral triangle whose sides would pass by the points p, s, t.
 In the same way the face whose centre will be confounded
 with the angle O' will be parallel to the equilateral triangle,
 whose sides would pass by the points s, n, p'; but the se
 cond law produces faces situated like pentagons cut by the
 sides of the triangles p s t, snp'.        Now the sections of
 these triangles on the pentagon tO sO'n reduce the latter
 into an isoscele triangle, which has for its base the line t n,
 and whose two other sides pass, the one by the points t, s,
 the other by the points n, s.     It is the same with the other
             ; whence it follows that the secondary solid will
 Eentagons
   e an icosahedron terminated by eight equilateral triangles
 and twelve isoscele triangles.
     Fig 38, PI. V, represents this icosahedron marked by
letters whose correspondence with those of figs. 14 and 15
 renders perceptible to the eye the relation between the two
solids; but this icosahedron has much greater dimensions
than those of the icosahedron which we obtain artificially
by making sections on the eight solid ancles of the dode
cahedron of fig. 14, which are confounded with those of
the nucleus.      This increase of dimensions was necessary
for preserving to the nucleus a constant volume. We shall
illustrate this by a more ample development.
     If we wished to obtain the nucleus of" the icosahedron
                               T4                              of

    of fig. 38, it  is evident that we must direct the trenchant
    planes parallel to the ridges rs, tn,pq, &c., (figs. 14 and
    38), in such    a manner that they hecome equally inclined
    on the faces   with  which they form a junction. These planes
    would pass      at  the   same time on the equilateral triangles
    pst, snp',       &c,    and  we should have the nucleus, when
    the whole would meet at the places of the centres of the
    equilateral triangles.
        Hence it follows that the nucleus of which the ridges
    OI, QE, &c, (fig. 15), were displayed on the dodeca
    hedron, is on the contrary entirely engaged in the icosa-
    hedron (fig. 38), excepting by its solid angles, which are
    points only, and are confounded, as we have said, with the
    centres of the equilateral triangles. This being granted, in
    order to form a precise idea of the structure of the icosa-
    hedron, we must conceive that the laminae, which at first
    adhere on the nucleus to a certain term, decrease solely by
    their angles, as if the secondary solid should be sim
    ply an octahedron.        Beyond this term the decrement on
    the angles always continuing, a new one takes place which
    is combined with      it,  and which being relative to the dode
    cahedron produces the twelve isoscele triangles.            In this
    way we may conceive how the nucleus            is   completely in
    closed in the dodecahedron, with the reserve of solid angles,
    because the first laminae of superposition, which decrease
    on their angles only, would continue to* envelop this nu
    cleus  by  the portions of their edges to which the decrement
    did not extend.       It    sometimes necessary thus to suppose
                               is
    different epochs at different decrements, which concur       in  the
    production of compound secondary form, when we wish to
                     a
    give  a  detailed account of the mechanism of the structure.
        According to this detail, the distance between the centres
     of two adjacent equilateral triangles, such as       p t   s,
                                                                q t   /,
     (fig. 38), ought to be equal to the corresponding ridge          O
     of the nucleus (fig. 15), which         is plainly to he seen    by I

     simple inspection of the two figures.
        The result which we have developed takes place with
    respect to one variety of sulphuretted iron.         Naturalists, at
    a   period when the laws of structure were little understood,
     were led to make          a kind of geometry of crystallization
     which operated in our manner, confounding its icosahedron
     and dodecahedron with those which are called regular, and
     the firs! of which    is   terminated   by twenty equilateral tri
     angles, and the other          by

     their sides equal.      But theory proves that neither the one

     simplest laws of decrements, in such a manner that her dode
     cahedron and icosahedron are really the most perfect and
     most regular of all the principles of geometry.
        We snail cite a new example drawn from the regular
     hexahedral prism of carbonated lime.      From what we have
     said (page 10/) on the method of mechanically dividing
     this polyhedron, it is easy to conceive that its rhomboidal
     nucleus A A' (fig.   !i)has its solid lateral angles E, O,                      I,

    one and the same solid angle              Obut in applying here

    the observation made with respect to the dodecahedron
    with pentagonal faces (page 213), and more particularly
    with respect to the regular octahedron (page 223), we can
    confine ourselves to the consideration of the decrement re
    lative to one only of the three angles in question,           sup          by
    posing that the face which results from             prolonged on
                                                           it   is
    the two rhombs adjacent to that to which this angle be
    longs.
       This being granted, let us refer the whole to the six
    angles  EOI,      EHG, IKG, HGK, OIK, HEO, the
    first three of  which   look towards the summit A, and the
    three  others  towards  the summit A'.      If we suppose de                a
    crement   by  two  ranges  of rhomboidal    molecules on these
    different angles,  it  will give rise to six laces which will be
    parallel to the axis, as we have already shown.
        The laminae of superposition,- at the same time that they
     will decrease towards their inferior angles, will be extended
     on the contrary by their upper parts, so as to remain                           al
     ways contiguous to the axis, the length of which will of
    itself go on increasing. Besides, the facets produced           the         by
    decrement will gradually increase       and at the term where

 since it is as it were the common point round which the
 three decrements have acted.
    In proportion as new laminae are afterwards applied tp
the former, the points o, o are elevated, and point O is
lowered ; so that at a certain period we shall have the solid
represented in fig. 3, in which the faces produced by the
decrement have become pentagons, such as ooi O e.
    Things being in this state, let us suppose a second de
crement which concurs with the former, and which is pro
duced by a simple range on the upper angle                    EAI,      or
HA'K. The effect of this decrement will be to produce
two fact s perpendicular to the axis ; and when it shall have
attained the point where these same faces shall intersect the
six faces parallel to the axis, which have the first decre
ment for the generator, the secondary solid will be termi
nated, and will be presented under the form of the regular
hexahedral prism (rigs, l and 2)*.
    We have already said that this result was general, what
ever was the measurement of the angles of the primitive
rhomboid.
    We now see wherefore, in the mechanical division of the
prism, the section ppoo (fig. 2) has its sides pp, oo pa
rallel to each other, and at the same time to the horizon
tal diagonal which goes from E to I (fig. 5), since the two
decrements taking place, one of them on the angle EOI,
the other on the angle        EAI,       the lamina? of superposition
should have their edges turned towards this same diagonal.
    In the case under consideration, and it is the most usual
one, the axis of the secondary crystal is longer than that of
the nucleus ; so that this nucleus having its lateral angles
contiguous to the panes of the prism, its summits are en
gaged in the interior at a certain distance below the centres
of the bases. If we supposed that the two decrements had
the same epoch, then, the axis of the prism being equal to
that of the nucleus, the lateral angles and the summits of
the latter would be tangent, the former to the panes, and
the other to the bases of the prism.            Finally, if the decre
ments on the upper angles of the nucleus had an epoch an
terior to that of the other, which is the inverse of the first
case, the summits of the nucleus would still be contiguous
to the bases of the prism, while its lateral angles would be
   • We do not
                pretend here to detail the manner in which the crystal has
been formed, but solely the manner in which it is compounded.    We shall
afterwards see how we may conceive that the process of crystallization is
combined with the order of the structure.
                                                                  placed

placed    in the interior between the panes and the axis. This
is what takes place in certain crystals, the prism of which
is very short, and resembles a hexagonal lamina.
     We shall conclude by an example drawn from analogical
carbonated lime, represented in fig. 39, PI. V. This va
riety has its surface composed of twenty-four trapezoids, six
of which are vertical, such &s dab c, da? b' </, &c, twelve
others, such as c" p ad, <f p a" V, &c, arranged by sixes on
both sides of the preceding, and six terminal, such asp aj/ s,
arranged by threes round each summit.
     The former trapezoids result from the same law which
 gives the six panes o\ the regular hexahedral prism (fig. 1) ;
 the second are owing to the law which gives the carbonated
 jtietastatic lime (figs. 0, 7, and 17). By comparing fig. 39
 with fig. 6, we see that the vertical faces cut those or the
 metastatic crystal in such a manner that they intercept the
 solid lateral angles E, O, I, K, &c, (figs. 6 and 7). Finally,
 the terminal faces proceed from a decrement similar to that
 which produces the equiaxis carbonated lime (fig. 18).
     We cannot help being agreeably surprised, when we sub
 mit to calculation the form of this polyhedron, to see the
 relations of its different parts successively presented, either
 between each other, or with those of several other crystals.
      1. In each vertical trapezoid abed (fig. 39 A), the up
 per triangle bad'is equilateral, and its height an is double
 the height cn of the inferior triangle.
     2. In each terminal trapezoid p sp"a" (fig. 39 B), the
  upper triangle p sp' is similar to the half of one of the
 faces of the equiaxis rhomboid, by a consequence of the
 law of decrements; and the inferior pa p" is similar to
  the half of one of the faces of the inverse rhomboid, which
  arises from the manner in which the plane of the trapezoid
  is cut by the planes of the adjacent faces.     It results that
  the heights a!' r, sr of the triangles which subdivide this
  trapezoid, are also to each other in the ratio of two to one,
  as in the trapezoid abed (fig. 39 A).
     3. In each intermediate trapezoid dpad (fig. 39 C),
  the triangle pa d is equal and similar to the fourth part
  PAD       (tig. 39 D) of the primitive rhombus      D|MTF;
  so that the angle a (fig. 39 C) is straight, the an?le dp a

supplement of 50° 46' 6", which is the half of the primitive
angle DPiy (fig. 39 D).
   6. Finally, the polyhedron shares with the metastatic va
riety the property in virtue of which the mutual incidence
of the faces which correspond in this variety with the tra
pezoids c' p a d, <f p a" V', are equal to those of the rhombs
of the primitive form. These are the different ratios which
have    suggested the name of analogical given to the poly
hedron in question.
    We now see to what all the different metamorphoses be
long under which the primitive form is presented in secon
dary crystals, whether simple or compound.           Sometimes
the decrements are performed at once on all the edges, as
in the dodecahedron with rhombic planes, cited above, or
on all the angles, as in the octahedron originating from
the cube. At times they take place only on certain edges
or certain angles. At others there is an uniformity be
tween them, so that there is only a single law by one, two,
three, &c, ranges, and which acts on different edges or on
different angles, as it is also still observed in the solids, of
which we shall speak presently. Occasionally the law varies
from one edge to the other, or from one angle to the other ;
and this is what happens in particular when the nucleus has
not a symmetrical form, as when it is a parallelopipedon,
the faces of which differ by their respective inclinations, or
by the measurements of their angles. In certain cases the
decrements     on the edges concur with the decrements on
the angles to produce the same crystalline form,          it also
happens sometimes, that the same edge, or the same
angle, undergoes several laws of decrement which succeed
 each other.     Finally, there is a multitude of cases in
which the secondary crystal preserves faces parallel to those
©f the primitive form, and which are combined with the
faces produced by the decrements, in order to modify the
 figure of this crystal.
    If amidst this diversity of laws, sometimes solitary, and,
 sometimes marching as it were by groups round the
same primitive form, the number of ranges subtracted
was in itself very variable ;  if, for example, there were de
crements    by   twenty, thirty, forty, or more ranges, as
may be imagined, the multitude of forms which might ex
ist   ineach species of mineral would befit to overwhelm the
imagination, and the study of crystallography would present
an immense labyrinth, which, in spite of the clue furnished
 by  theory, .could with difficulty be unravelled.      But the
power which produces the subtractions seems to have            a
                                                             very

very limited action. These subtractions are most frequently
formed by one or two ranges of molecules.         I have found
none which went beyond six ranges*; but such is the fer
tility which is united with this simplicity, that, by confining
ourselves to decrements by one, two, three, and four
dred and four varieties of crystallization.   Without doubt,
among the circumstances which can determine all these
varieties, there are many which are not met with in nature.
But there is reason to think that discoveries of this kind
will continue to be multiplied for some time to come, in
proportion as a taste for mineralogy continues to be diffused,
since we have hardly as yet observed 48 distinct varieties in
the species of carbonated lime, which is the richest of all
in crystalline forms, at least if we may judge from the pre
sent state of our knowledge.
    Tn order to have a still more accurate idea of the power of
crystallization, we must add to this facility of producing so
many different forms, in commencing with a single figure,
that of attaining one and the same form by different struc
tures. The rhomboidal dodecahedron, for instance, which
we obtained by combining cubical molecules, exists in,
 the garnet, with a structure composed of small tetrahe
 drons with triangular isoscele faces, as we shall find under
 the head of this mineral substance ; and I have found it in
 a species of fluated lime, where it is also an assemblage
 of tetrahedrons, but regular, and the faces of which
 are equilateral triangles.  But besides all this, it is possible
 that similar molecules, subjected to a variation of laws,
 present identically the same result. Thus the regular hexa-
 hedral prism, which in carbonated lime generally exists in
 virtue of a decrement on the inferior angle, sometimes pro-
    * We meet, although very rarely, with mixed decrements, which take
 place according to ratios such as 4 is to 9, or 3 to 8, one of the two terms
 designating the number of ranges subtracted in breadth, and the other the
 number of ranges subtracted in height; and such are hitherto the ratios of
 this description, that it is sufficient to increase or diminish by a unit one of
 the two terms, that the decrement may enter into the most common cases.
 For example, if in the first of the ratios which has been quoted we retrench
 a unit from 9, and if we add one to three in the second, each ratio will be
 come | or i. It results that the absolute measurement of the decrements in
 question docs not exceed that of the ordinary decrements. For instance,
 i and ^ are both of them less than J, which expresses a simple decrement.
 Now it seems to me that a decrement ought to be estimated according to
 the absolute value of the ratio which represents    it,  and not according to the
 terms of this ratio considered independently of each other.
                                                                           ceeds

ceeds from a decrement on the edges adjacent to this angle.
We have seen the primitive form copied as it were by a law
of decrement. A nucleus even, although fictitious, substi
tuted in imagination for the true one, would give a dodeca
hedron completely similar to that of paradoxical carbonated
lime, by the help of a law still more simple than that which
really takes place *.  In the species particularly in which
the primitive form has a certain character of symmetry, as
when it is a rhomboid, the analogies and properties present
themselves on all hands.    It should seem as if geometry
could not touch any term of the innumerable series of pos
sible terms, without leaving on it the impression of some
interesting verity.

No   person is ignorant how widely Messrs. Fourcroy and
Vauquelin have extended the dominion of animal che
mistry.
  The present year has presented us with two additional
memoirs in this department of science one of them treat
ing of animal mucus, and the other of uree.
   The animal mucus transudes from all the membranes
which issue from those of the cavities of the body com
municating with the exterior ; such as the nostrils, the
trachea, the intestines, and the bladder. It differs from al
bumen, which forms the basis of the white of eggs, because
the acids coagulate instead of dissolving

on indigo, and those of M. Thenard concerning the action
of the vegetable acids on alcohol, as also the analysis of an
animal substance found in a grotto by M. Laugicr; but as
these complex and troublesome labours do not yet lead to
any general principle proper for being inserted in a report

   Among the subjects connected with anatomy which have
occupied the attention of the class, the most interesting has
been a memoir on the structure of the brain and of the
nervous system, presented by Messrs. Gall and Spurzheim,
physicians of Vienna-: these anatomists consider the cerebral
organ in a very different, and in many respects in a clearer
and more intelligible light than hitherto adopted. Accord
ing, to them the cortical is the organ from which the ner
vous fibres issue, which constitute the white or medullary
substance. Wherever this exists it arises from these fibres.
The spinal marrow is no longer a fasciculus of nerves de
scending from the brain ; on the contrary, the nerves called
cerebral may be traced to the medulla elongata. The cere
brum and cerebellum themselves         are only developments
of the fasciculi, coming from the medulla elongata in the
same way as the nerves come from it : the brain in parti
cular derives its origin from fasciculi called pyramidal emi
nences, which cross each other, issuing from the medulla
elongata, each of them proceeding towards the side oppo
site to that from which it issues ; they swell for the first time
when crossing the pons varolii, a second time when pass
ing over the tubercles called optical layers, and a third time
in those called corpora cavernosa, always by medullary
fibres furnished by the grayish matter in these three parts,
adding to those which the fasciculi originally possessed,
and which there unite by acute angles, and thus ascend.
The cerebellum issues from fasciculi denominated processus
cerebelli admedullam, which are reinforced, but once only,
by fibres furnished to them by the gray matter of what is
                                                           called

 30*              French Rational Institute.
 called the corpus ciliare. These two pairs of fasciculi, after
 being strengthened and enlarged, and after having conse
 quently taken a divergent direction, finish by each of them
 spreading out into two great expansions, covered over ex
 ternally with a gray substance, which, on this occasion,
only deserves the name of cortical ; and these expansions
folded in various manners form what are called the hemi
spheres of the brain, the lobes and the vermiform process of
the cerebellum.     From their whole extent other medullary
fibres issue, which, from the two sides of the cerebrum and
of the cerebellum, converge towards the middle line, where
the fibres of the side join those of the other, forming what
are called commissures.     The corpora callosa, the fornix,
and their appurtenances, form the largest of the commis
sures of the brain.     What is called the anterior commissure
is that in particular which joins the middle lobes. The
commissure of the cerebellum is composed of transverse
layers from the pons (varolii). Each pair of fasciculi form
ing the nerves, also has commissures which serve to unite
the two parts. When we remove or tear the convergent fibres
which proceed to the corpus callosum, and which serve as
roofs to the lateral ventricles, nothing remains under the
gray substance except a medullary part composed of the
origins of these convergent fibres, and of the extremities of
the divergent fibres which come from the meduila elongata;
and so far from the aggregate of all these fibres forming a
solid mass, as formerly supposed, there is always in the
middle of each circumvolution of the cerebrum and cere
bellum a solution of continuity ; and with some care we
may unfold this portion of the white or medullary sub
stance.
   The committee appointed by the class, after having ex
amined with the greatest care, in the dead subject, the the
ories of Messrs. Gall and Spurzheim, gave their assent to
almost all of them which are dependent on anatomical in
spection : they have even shown that several of these ob
servations had already been made by old authors, but the
generality of anatomists had not bestowed sufficient atten
tion on the subject : the only thing in point of fact which
they have disputed is, the possibility of unfolding the brain
without tearing or rupturing any thing.      In their opinion,
there was at the most only a more trifling cohesion in the
middle of each circumvolution ; but they were unable to
find an absolute solution of continuity.
   After having bestowed on the two anatomists of Vienna

   the justice which was due to them for their anatomical dis
   coveries, the committee thought it their duty also to cau
   tion the public that there is no direct connection, no neces
   sary relation, between these discoveries and the doctrine
   taught by Mt Gall, on the functions peculiar to the diffe
   rent compartments of the brain, or with the possibility of
   conjecturing from the size of these divisions the intellec
   tual and moral dispositions of individuals.     " Every thing
   that we have examined respecting the structure of the brain
   {they say, in concluding their report,) may be equally true
   or false, without the possibility of any conclusion being
   drawn either for or against this doctrine, which can only
  be estimated by very different means."
      M. Dumeril, professor of medicine at Paris, has pre
  sented an anatomical memoir to the public, in which he
  considers under new points of view the bones and muscles
  of the human and animal trunk.
      After having compared the vertebrae with each other in
  the different regions of the spine, and in the different classes
  of animals, he endeavours to show that the head, so far as
  its movements are concerned, mav he regarded as a verte
  bra extensively dcvelopped : not that he means to say that
  the head is a vertebra, which would be absurd, but merely
  that the facets by which the head is articulated have a re
  semblance with the articulating apophyses of the vertebrae;
 that the projecting parts which afford a hold to the muscles
 of the head, have a resemblance with the spinal and trans
 verse apophyses of the vertebrae, and that the muscles which
 proceed from certain parts of the spine to the head are
 analogous with those which proceed from one part of the
 spine to another. After having shown these resemblances
 in the human species, M. Dumeril traces them into the
 lower animals, and shows that at all times, when there are
variations in the connection of the parts of the spine with
 each other, there are corresponding variations in those of
the spine with the head.
     Passing to the examination of the muscles which act in
the sides, M. Dumeril shows that, whatever are the varia
tions in the sides of various animals, there is always nearly
the same muscles which, only when there are no sides into
which they can be inserted, are attached to the transverse
apophyses of the vertebrae, which are then generally larger.
From all this the author infers, that between the sides and
the transverse apophyses there is a resemblance of connec
tions and of functions of the same order with that which
he established between the head and the vertebrae.

                   French National Institute.
    He makes a reflection on this subject, the truth of which
is demonstrated by every animal organization with which
we are acquainted.
                            "
    " Nature," he says, is ever fertile in her resources :
she never passes to a secondary combination until her pri
 mitive type and its modifications become insufficient, and
 never adds an organ until new circumstances require greater
 efforts and more powerful means."
    It is this principle which forms the basis of comparative
 anatomy : it is this principle which has given birth, not
 only to the branch of this science which compares with
 each other the different species, but also to another more
 novel and not less curious branch, which compares with
 each other the different organs of one and the same species.
 Vicq-d'Azyr had already given an example of this second
 branch in his Memoire sur les Rapports des Membres an-
 terieurs et posterieurs. M. Dumeril on the present occa
 sion has given another example, which may be regarded as
 following up the former.
     M. Villars, correspondent of the class at Strasburgh, has
 presented two memoirs on the structure of the nerves. He
 thinks he has discovered, by the help of the microscope,
 that the envelop of the nerve is itself composed of nervous
 fibres : but our committee has not yet been convinced of
 the truth of this assertion from ocular demonstration.
     yegetable anatomy has for several years been much in
  debted to M. Mirbel : — the Royal Society of Gottingen
  made this the subject of au annual prize, which occasioned
  the publication of several dissertations, the chief of which
  were those of Messrs. Link, Treviranus, and Rudolpbi,
  all of them professors in different German universities. These
  learned naturalists agree in the conclusions of M. Mirbel,
  adding some observations to his, but contradict him on
  some points. This opposition induced him to publish in
  his turn a defence of his theory, in which he determines
  it with more precision by reducing it into aphorisms, and
  in which he endeavours to show that the most of the ob
  jections made against him, either proceeded from his mean
  ing being misunderstood, or from his observations having
  been repeated with too little care.
      The same botanist has this year presented to the class a
   particular memoir on the germination of the grasses, and
   another on the distinguishing characters of the monocotyle-
      ...
   dontal and dicotylcdontal plants.                      ^
      In the former he has shown that the stigmata of wheat

of the embryo,     and which serves as a conductor to the fe
cundation : that the cotyledon, as M. Jussieu supposed, is
a pulpy substance, in which the radicle and the plumula
are insensibly developped, and which is opened accord
ing to its length, in order to allow them to pass in such
a way that by itself it performs the function of a sheathing
leaf.
    In general the cotyledons have the greatest analogy with
the leaves; like the latter, they are irritable in the sensitive
plant, bear hairs in the borage plant, a gland at the end in
plaintains, and coloured points in the herb burnet, &c; in
 short, there are real leaves in the seed.    If the cotyledons,
when there are two of them, are always opposite, even when
 the leaves of the plant are alternate, it is because the stalk
 cannot be developped in the seed, and the interval between
the two cotyledons cannot be marked.         From these multi
 plied connections of form and nature between the cotyle
dons and the leaves, M. Mirbel concludes that the number
of these same cotyledons should also have its cause in some
 circumstance relative to the leaves, and he thinks that the
 monocotyledontal plants are always those whose leaves are
sheathed- within each other: this is evident with respect to
 the grasses and the liliacece, particularly if we reflect that
 the bulb is formed of the sheathing of the bases of all
 the leaves ; and also with respect to several other plants of
this branch of the vegetable kingdom.
    Passing to the formation of the wood, M. Mirbel shows
that it is always composed of fibres dispersed here and there
in a cellular texture similar to the sap of the dycotyledonta,
but which is formed in several monocotyledonta of these
fibres at the circumference as well as at the centre : these last
have consequently two vegetations ; one around the outside,
which increases the diameter of their trunk, and the other
at the centre, which increases their density.       He considers
each of the fibres of the trunk of the monocotyledonta as if
it answered to an entire trunk of a dvcotyledon, and shows
that there takes place a series of operations equally com
plete as in these trunks.
    M. Mirbel has been rewarded for these ingenious" labours
 by being elected a member of the Institute, in the room of
 the late M. Ventenat.
    M. Decandolle has .this year conferred additional favours
on the science of botany.      He has drawn up a memoir on
 plants  with compound    flowers,   in which he forms a sepa
 rate family of those whose flowerets have two inequal labia,
                                (J 2                         and

and     in which he distributes those denominated cynaro-
cephali, according to the lateral or terminal insertion of the

grain.
      In general the present year has shown that botany is cul
 tivated in France with more ardour than ever.          The me
 moir of M. du Petit-Thouars on the family of the orchideoe,
 the forerunner of a large work oh the natural families of
 plants, which this eminent botanist is about to publish, —
 the memoir of M. Longchamp on the narcissi, — themono-
 graphy of the eryngia, by M. de la Roche, — have added
  greatly to the fame of their respective authors.
      M. du Petit-Thouars in particular has come to the reso
  lution of publishing his theory of vegetation, founded on
  the development in two directions, which he admits in the
  shoots, and of which we have already given an idea in pre
  ceding reports.
       M. Ventenat terminated his laborious career by a memoir
  on the genera samyda and ccesaria, of which he makes
  a new family closely allied to the rhamnoUcs : this last
   effort of his genius was intended for the continuation of
  the Jardin du Cels, a work which his death interrupted.
       The history of animals has been enriched by the com
   pletion of M. Olivier's work on the coleopterous insects, and
   by his description of all the gelatinous animals brought to
   gether by Linnaeus under the head of mednsce.        M. Peron,
   who collected a very great number of them in his voyage
   to the South Seas, adding his own observations to those of
   his predecessors, makes this family amount to upwards of
   one hundred and fifty species.     It is perhaps necessary to
   give M. Peron's words on this subject when detailing the
   singularities of these zoophytes: " Their substance seems
   to be nothing but coagulated water, and nevertheless they
   exercise the most important functions of life ; their multi
   plication is prodigious, and yet we know nothing of their
   peculiar mode of generation ; they are sometimes several
   feet in diameter, and 50 or 60 pounds in weight, and their
   nutritive system escapes our view ; they execute the most
   rapid motions, and the details of their muscular system are
    imperceptible; they have a kind of very active respiration,
    and its actual seat is a mystery ; they appear extremely
    feeble, and considerable numbers of fishes make them their
    daily prey: the zoophytes in question shine in the darkest
    nights like globes of fire ; some of them burn and render
    torpid the hand which touches them, — the principles and
    agents of these two properties remain still to be discovered."

   - The medusae, properly so called, have a gelatinous body
 nearly of the form of the top of a mushroom, which M.
 Peron calls umbrella, after the example of Spallanzanj ;
 but they differ from each other, in as much as some of them
have a mouth and others want it; some have several mouths,
and in others there is a production under the umbrella in
 the form of a pedicle.
     M. Peron from these characters has formed a tree of di
visions and subdivisions, in which all the medusae in ex
istence must necessarily fall to be classed, and in which he
has placed all those with which he is acquainted.        Faithful
and accurate paintings, executed by his fellow- voyager M.
Lesueur, explain all that variety of forms and colours so
necessary for subjects of natural history.
     To these inquiries into external characters, M. Peron has
added some interesting details on the internal structure of
these animals, and particularly the genus called rhizosto-
 mum. M. Cuvier had so denominated                 it,
                                                because he sup
 posed that the filaments attached to its tentacula were sof
many suckers, and that the nourishment thereby inhaled
proceeded to    a central cavity, from which     was distributed
                                                     it
to the whole body      byan infinite number of vessels arranged
yery regularly, and multiplied particularly in the edgesof the
 umbrella. The four apertures in the sides of the base of the
pedicle appeared to M. Cuvier to be the organs of respiration.
     M. Peron on the contrary, having observed several living
rhizostoma, and having seen them take in some small ani
mals  by   these four apertures, and suck them in towards the
four cavities to which they lead,         of opinion, that these
                                          is
are four distinct mouths and stomachs, and that the large
vascular apparatus, which fills the pedicle and the edges of
the umbrella,   is with much more probability set apart for the
office of respiration, as   it   almost always filled with air.

     M. Cuvier has this year instructed the class with respect
to certain species of reptiles, the bones of which have been
found buried    in the earth.   All of them had been regarded
as belonging to crocodiles, and even peculiar to       crocodile
                                                          a
of the Ganges called the Gavial genus; but there are lizards
of the safeguard or tapinambis species, which belong also
to the Gavial genus, although they have distinctly marked
differences in their respective characters.
    What   is most singular with respect to these fossil bones
of reptiles is, that they are found at     much greater depth
                                           a

    The environs of Maestricht also contain the bones of       a
great animal of that family, which some regard as fish anda

others as a crocodile. M. Cuvier has endeavoured to show
that it is a monitor, although a giant of its kind.      It is up
wards of 25 feet in length ; the tail is short in proportion, but
broader than that of the other species, and probably formed
a powerful rudder ; as every     thing favours the suggestion
that this animal was strong enough to live on the surface of
the ocean : its bones are generally found among those of
large tortoises and shell- fish.
   Mr. Jefferson, president of the united states of America,
has sent to the class a fine collection of fossil bones dug up
on the banks of the Ohio in North America : the greatest
part belongs to the huge animal improperly called the
mammoth by the Americans, and to which M. Cuvier has
given the name of mastodontus ; but there are several bones
in the collection belonging to the true mammoth of Siberia.
These two gigantic animals seem therefore to have formerly
inhabited the whole northern hemisphere.
   We cannot account for the extirpation of these enor
mous races, and of so many others that have been victims
of the same catastrophe, without being completely acquaint
ed with the strata in which these bones are buried, as well
as their succession and nature.      This is what has been at
tempted by Messrs. Cuvier and Brongniart in the environs
of Paris. So far as they have as yet been able to examine
the soil in the neighbourhood, they have found it to be
composed of several strata evidently different.       The lower
most stratum is an immense body of chalk, which extends
to England,     and contains nothing but unknown shells,
several of which belong to unknown genera.            Above this
chalk there is a stratum of clay, which does not contain any
organized body.      In several places are to .-be found those
strata of calcareous stones which are employed in building:
they are interspersed with shells, most of which are un
known, but they belong to genera with which we are ac
quainted, i. c. they resemble the sea-shells of the pre
sent day.
   Hillocks of plaister-stone are thrown as if by chance,
 sometimes on the clay, sometimes on the calcareous stone,
 and contain abundance of bones of land animals entirely
unknown, the skeletons of which have been described by
 M. Cuvier. In these beds of chalk and the clay which
 immediately covers them, the shells are those of fresh
 water, but the upper strata contain salt-water shells also.
   An immense heap of sand without any organized body
crowns all our eminences ; aqd, what is more remarkable
than any thing else, the highest stratum, namely, that
                                                            which

Which covers the whole, abounds in fresh-water shells. It
is onlv in the bottoms of valleys, or rather in the cavities
of this superficial stratum, that we find the bones of ele
phants and other- animals whose species we know, but
whose genera we are not yet acquainted with.
    It results, therefore, from the observations of Messrs.
Cuvier and Brongniart, that the sea, after having for a
long period covered France, and having several times
changed the inhabitants and the nature of the soil, gave
way to a temporary deluge of fresh water, during which
chalk was deposited ; but the deluge having returned, at least
a second time, seems to have destroyed the beings which
had been propagated : at this period the palceotherium and
the anoplotherium must have disappeared.         Every thing
tends to render it probable that this deluge made its ap
pearance a third time, and on this occasion perhaps the
elephants disappeared.
    By similar investigations in other countries, we may be
enabled to determine if there be any thing general in the
arrangement of the strata, and of the organized bodies
which they contain ; and we may thereby succeed in fixing
our ideas on the succession of the catastrophes which have
brought the surface of our globe into the state in which it
now is. .                         -
    M. Sage has given us some analyses and descriptions of
 certain stones, such as chalcedony, common agate, and
that kind of volcanic stone called gaestein: he has also
communicated some experiments on the cohesion which
lime contracts with various substances, — experiments which
will be useful in ascertaining the composition of various
mortar.
    M. Brochant, mining engineer, has communicated some
observations relative to strata much more antient than those
in the environs of Pafis, and which M. Werner has de
 signated by the name of soils of transition, because they
are placed between those primitive mountains anterior to
organization, and those secondary strata filled with the bones
of animals. Most of them are composed of fragments of
primitive soils united together like pudding-stones by va
rious cements, and here and there we now begin to find
remains of animal and vegetable organizations.
    Saussure had already noticed these soils in the Alps ;
but M. Brochant determines them with more precision and
follows them more into detail, chiefly along the Alps on
the side of France.

  north winds by the Apennines, is more favourable to the
  plants of warm countries than any other of the same lati
  tude, because the winter there is milder, although of longer
  duration, while the summer is cooler on account of the
  vicinity of the sea and the snow.
     The natural history of the department of Doubs has been
  embraced     in all its parts by M. Gtrod-Chantrans,        in a
  work submitted to the judgment of the class, and in which
  he gives the catalogue of all the species of plants and ani
  mals which he could find, with descriptions of the moun
  tains, mineralogy, springs, and other phaenomena.            It is
  much to be desired that all the departments of the empire
  were described with the same precision.
     Every person knows that dropsy, generally considered as
  the effect of an obstruction, is treated by aperients and sharp
  purgatives, given under every different form.         A memoir
  from the pen of M. Dcpartz has treated this regimen as
  rather too much followed. He has cited a number of obser
  vations which, in his opinion, prove that many cases of
  dropsy, particularly those produced by mental anxiety, de
  pend on a too great contraction in the vessels, and require
  mild evacuants.       He even asserts, that this kind of dropsy
  is more common than is generally supposed, and that it
  deserves all the attention which practitioners can bestow.
     M. Leguin, who, without being a medical man, has been
  occupied by a praiseworthy zeal of furnishing new agents
  to medicine, seems to have particularly attached himself to
  combat intermitting fevers, which are so common and so
  direful in all countries.     He has long treated them with
  gelatine,   and  assures  us he   has obtained the. most decided
  success.     This year he tried albumen, and found it very
  successful also.      He has already cured forty-one patients,
   by giving   them,   at the time of the fit, the whites of three
  eggs   diluted   in  warm    water with a little sugar. In his
  opinion this remedy, as well as gelatine, is the more con
  venient because we may lay it aside if the first fits which
  succeed its exhibition are not milder.
     M. Portal has this year read an account of a patient who
  laboured under the various symptoms of Phthisis pulmo-
  nalis, added to some others, the cause of which was un
  known. On opening the body, there was an abscess in the
  liver as well as in the lungs, and both abscesses com
   municated through an opening in the diaphragm.

MESSRS. LONDONS' PROCESS FOR PURIFYING MURIATE
                               OF SODA*.
This       process consists in purifying or refining muriate of
soda,    whether obtained from rock or fossil salt, brine,
springs, sea water, or from any other source, by fusion,
or by heat, or calcination ; and by the application of soda,
its nitrate, sulphate, carbonate, or any other of its com
binations ; potash, volatile alkali, lime, or their sulphates,
nitrates, carbonates, or other combinations; or by the ad
dition of any other material or re-agent that will effect the
decomposition, precipitation, or separation of the whole
or part of the earthy or metallic salts combined with the
muriate of soda.
    The muriate of soda (common salt) with the necessary
re-agents is to be put into a reverberating furnace, and such
a degree of heat applied as will fuse the muriate of soda,
which being kept in fusion a sufficient length of time, the
earthy and metallic parts are decomposed, precipitated, or^
separated ; and the purified muriate is drawn off or taken
out into proper receiving vessels as long as it continues to
come off clear, leaving the sediment or impure residue at
the bottom of the furnace.
    The muriate of soda thus prepared may be broken into
any sized grains or pieces required.
    If the muriate of soda be not required in that state of
purity in which it may be obtained by the above process,
the expense of re-agents need not be incurred.                  By mere
   • Extracted  from their specification, a patent having been granted for
their process.
                                                                   fusion

fusion as above described, a portion of the earthy and me
tallic salts, with which it may be contaminated, will be
precipitated, and the purer muriate may be separated as
already described.
    The muriate of soda left mixed with the precipitated re
siduum, is afterwards recovered by solution and evapo
ration.       |
    Salt so obtained, may be refined by the modes usually
practised with rock salt, viz. solution, deposition, and
evaporation ; and salt so refined will (say the patentees)
be purer and more fit for curing fish, and provisions for
 common use, than any small salt at present manufactured,
and may supersede the necessity of importing foreign or
bay salt altogether.
    M. Chladni, so well known for his various researches in
the science of acoustics, has invented anew musical instru
 ment, to which he gives the name of clavi-cylinder.         The
 imperial conservatory    of music   at Paris  have made  a  very
 favourable report on the subject of M. Chladni's invention,
 which they describe as resembling the flute and clarionet in
 the high notes, and the bassoon in the lower keys.          The
 report candidly states, that the clavi-cylinder is not so well
 adapted for lively strains as for solemn music ; but its effects
 in the orescendo and diminuendo are highly praised.
    M. Chladni himself describes his invention in the fol
 lowing terms : "The clavi-cylinder contains a set of keys,
 and behind this a glass cylinder seven centimetres in di
 ameter, which is turned by means of a pedal and a loaded
 wheel.    This cylinder is not the sounding body, but it
 produces the sound by friction ou the interior mechanism.
 The sounds may be prolonged at pleasure, with all the
 shades of orescendo and diminuendo, in proportion as the
 pressure on the keys is increased or diminished.       This in
 strument is never out of tune. It contains four octaves and
 a half, from ut, the lowest in the harpsicord, up to fa."
     William Jackson Hooker, esq., F.L.S., of Norwich,
 has lately returned from Iceland, where he spent the sum
 mer in investigating the natural history of that interesting
 country. He travelled with a retinue of Icelanders as far up
  the country as the perennial snow would permit, collecting
 numerous specimens of quadrupeds, birds, insects, plants,
  minerals, &c, making drawings of the most important
  objects of curiosity, and also purchasing, in different places,
                                                           many

Mr. Hooker visited the Geysers or hot spouting springs,
and pitched his tent for some time in their neighbourhood,
watching the most favourable opportunities for making

    We regret to add, that nearly the whole of this gentle
man's labours were lost, hy the disastrous circumstance of
the vessel in which he embarked for London taking fire
soon after they were out of sight of the island, and being
burnt to the water's edge.       The crew and passengers were
saved by a vessel which providentially came in sight soon1
after the fire began.
    Mr. Hooker, after whom the president of the Linnearr
Society named his new genus of mosses, is already well-
known to the lovers of natural history as the discoverer of
Buxhaumia aphylla, as well as by his scientific drawings for
the valuable work on Fuci, by his friend Dawson Turner,
esq., of Yarmouth ; and his descriptions of several new
mosses gathered by Dr. Buchanan, during his journey to
Nepal, published in the last volume of the Linnean Trans
actions.
    Beet-Root Coffee. — We          have frequently had occa
sion to mention the progress made on the continent in ex
tracting sugar from beet roots ; and it now appears that the
yellow beet root, when cut into slices and kiln-dried, fur
nishes an excellent substitute for coffee, particularly if ground
along with a small quantity of Turkey or West India coffee.
 It requires much less sugar than the foreign coffee, and is
 said to be much stronger. M. Vinnen of Coblentz claims
 the merit of having discovered this new application of beet
 root.    He cautions his readers against stripping the plant
 of its leaves for feeding cattle as is generally practised, and
 which not only injures the growth of the plant, but mate
 rially alters the qualities of the juice.
    Great exertions are making in ever department of France
 to produce substitutes for West India sugar, and prizes are
 daily offered by the various oeconomical societies of the
 continent for the discovery of the most proper material for
 that purpose. The saccharine matter of the grape has been
 the chief subject of the recent experiments of the French
  chemists.

   Mineralogy of the Brazils. — By letters lately re
ceived from Mr. Mawe, from Rio de Janiero, dated the
15th of August, we are informed that he is honoured with
the prince- regent's permission to travel and make, observa
tions in the mining district of the Brazils : he has already
passed some months in the government ef St. Pauls, where
he discovered a variety of fine clays for the purposes of
 porcelain, &c, and is lately returned from the mines of
 Canto Gallo. The gold mine of Santo Rita is between two
rocks of sparry limestone, a substance not before known to
 exist in that country, nor would they believe it until they
 saw it burnt into lime.    These districts, until now unex
 amined by any mineralogist, (in a country so rich in pre
 cious productions,) cannot fail to be highly interesting to
 the lovers of natural history.
   The following directions for training messenger pigeons        .
are extracted from an Arabic work printed at the imperial
press at Paris, under the title of

    " As soon as the young pigeons are fledged, they must
be taught to feed from a person's hand, and to drink from
the same person's mou'.h.       For this purpose take up the
young pigeon, and with your hand gently throw back its
head, open the bill, and put two or three grains of corn into
its mouth.     When you think it has eaten enough, take
some water into your mouth and make it drink by intro
ducing its bill : afterwards place it on the floor and play
with    it,teaching   to follow you.
                      it                  This exercise ought to
be' repeated twice or thrice   a  day, with the view of accus
toming the animal to be handled.            When the pigeon      is
 strong enough to fly      a little, if
                                      it  be
                                           a   male, you should

neither corn nor trees will detain it for a moment, while
 the desire of returning to its companion will quicken its

 will on some occasion meet an agreeable companion, and
of course neglect its master and its errand. For these rea

    Oil of   Cabbage Seed. — M. FranQois         de Salingre, of
Halverstadt,     manufactures a refined oil with the seeds of
the cabbage plant {Brassica campestrh).        Those chemists
who have examined this new production, describe it as
possessing the following properties :
    1 . It equals in point of yellow    colour and purity the
finest oil of Provence.
    2. It is inodorous, and has a taste of almonds, which
distinguishes it from the oil of rape-seed.
    3. It may be substituted for olive oil ui sallads, and for
 other domestic uses.
    4. When used as lamp oil, it gives a bright flame with
 out smoke.      It is also very oeconomical; a given quantity
will be consumed much more slowly than the same quantity
 of rape oil within the same time.

   3iL.IV. On the Ascent of Salmon over the 'Elevations in the
      Course of Rivers, called Salmon- Leaps. By John Carr,
     Esq., of Manchester.
                          To Mr. Tilloch.
  Sir, In   natural history the correction of an old error is
  Sometimes   of equal importance with the development of a
  new truth ; but when the latter is made productive of the
  former, the case is still more interesting.    I have to offer
  to your notice, Mr. Editor, an instance of this description
  in the natural history of the salmon ; and if you think it
  deserving a place in your respectable monthly repository, it
 is very much at your service.
     The natural element of salmon certainly is salt, not
 fresh water. It is in the sea only that they acquire their
  growth, and attain that vigorous strength and muscular
  energy in which they are not, perhaps, excelled by any other
  animal of equal weight and bulk.      Nature, however, has
 determined that they shall propagate their species only in
 fresh water; and it is for that sole, but important purpose,
 that they quit the ocean and ascend rivers and streams al
 most up to their very sources, in every country where they
 abound.
    Summer and autumn are the seasons when they enter
 fresh water in the greatest numbers, and when the shal
 lowness and transparency of the streams necessarily occa
 sion the period of their ascent being limited to times of flood
 only. But at these times such are the instinctive energies
 which impel, and the muscular powers which enable, them
 to advance, that no natural or artificial barrier across the
 streams, over which a sufficiency of water tumbles, has ever
yet been known to arrest their progress upwards ; and if at
these times their course is ever stayed, it results less from
the height or other difficulty of the opposing obstacle, than
from a deficiency of that due proportion of the descending
fluid, which is requisite to ailow the natural force to the
exertion of their wonderful powers.
    From the elevated ascent of these extraordinary 'fish,
many waterfalls and cascades have acquired the name of
salmon- leaps.     They are numerous in the united kingdom,
being    found  in  Wales, Ireland, and Scotland ; and some
are of such a height as to call forth the admiration and
astonishment of every person who views them. No one has
ever seen a salmon actually leap over any of these eleva
tions, and the proof of their doing so rests wholly on the
    Vol. 34. No. 139. Nov. 180Q.         X       circumstance

322       On the Ascent  of Salmon  over the Elevations
 circumstance of the. fish being found in abundance abovtf
 the falls, and the indubitable certainty that they must have
 passed them. I have never seen, in any publication, an ex
 planation of the manner in which salmon actually do ascend
 these heights, and the general opinion certainly is that the
 fish really leap over them.
    This notion of leaping is probably encouraged by observ
 ing, that when the rivers are but partially flooded, the sal
 mon actually do leap up against the falls.      Great numbers
 of them may be seen thus employed for whole days to
 gether ; but none will ever be observed to leap higher than
 about three feet, whereas to the top of the fall is probably
 many times that height.                                        (
    At some of these leaps, indeed, it requires only a simple
 inspection, and a moment's reflection, to perceive that no
 animal unprovided with wings could possibly clear them
 in the manner of a leap.     This impossibility, however, has
 been very little attended to ; and in some of the older pub
 lications on the subject, the very manner of the leap has
 been described, by gravely affirming that the salmon coils
 himself up in the form of a ring, and seizing his tail in his
 mouth, by the strained violence of an elastic spring over
 tops the high ascent in an aerial somerset.
    So readily accessible is the marvellous in minds untutored
 by reflection, that this most extravagant absurdity was
 once a very general opinion, and is still credited by many.
 The analogy of a bent cane flying off with an elastic bound
 was deemed sufficient both to illustrate and establish the
fact, and no consideration was paid to the awkward cir
 cumstance of the tail and mouth of the fish being at right
 angles to each other.
    It is now proper to say what is the real mode by which
 salmon actually do pass over the heights in question : and
 this I shall speak, not from any speculative guess or reason
ing on the subject, but from muown personal observation,
having frequently seen the transaction take place. In every
instance then, where salmon ascend those leaps, they do it
by swimming up, and over the face and brow of the water
fall, penetrating through the interior of the descending body
of water, by means of their vast muscular power operating
on the action of their tail.
    They never pass these leaps but at times when the stream
is very much flooded, and a large unbroken mass of water
is descending. Without such a solid column of water their
ascent would be physically impossible.       At these times the
water, as in all cases of flood, is highly discoloured ; and

         in the Coarse  of Rivers, called Salmon-Leaps.      323
Bb   dartingly quick is the ascent of the fish, as rather to re
semble the transient gleam of a passing shadow over the
Water, than a real substance penetraiing through it. These
are probably the causes of all the obscurity in the case. In
deed, when standing at the distance of only a few yards, it
requires a very strong and steady eye to catch the evanes
cent figure of the ascending; fish, and beholding can alone
convey any adequate conception of the rapid facility of the
passage upwards.       In a few instances I have seen the sal
mon beaten hack, on making the turn at the top ; but that
is uncommon, and it rarely occurs that the effort of the
fish miscarries.
    This extraordinary ascent of salmon up a perpendicular
column of descending water must of course have its limita
tion; but it would, I believe, be difficult to assign its limits,
or to discover an instance where it fails under admissible
circumstances.      I know but of two cases wherein salmon
can be prevented from ascending rivers which they frequent
in furtherance of that great and imperious duty which na-*
 ture imposes on them, and these are when the stream is
made to pass through apertures too small for the admission
of the fish, or when it does not descend over a fall, without
 regard to its height, in a sufficiently consolidated and un
 broken mass to allow of the salmon swimming up it.
     After accomplishing the great object of their journey into
 the fresh water, the salmon again descend to the ocean,
 but so shrunk and wasted by their detention in the rivers,
 where there is either no proper or no sufficiency of food
 for them, as scarcely to retain a third of their original
 weight.
     The spawn is deposited in holes purposely made in beds
 of grave), and covered with successive layers of the same
 materials ; and as it becomes animated each individual libe
 rates and provides for itself.     Their growth is singularly
 rapid, arriving at six or eight inches in length early in
 spring, at which season, the whole, then become immensely
 numerous, follow the old fish by descending with floods to
  the sea.
     In Cumberland is pursued a very singular species of
  aqueous salmon hunting, which is not, I believe, practised
  in any other part of the kingdom.         On the flat coasts of
  the sea, and adjacent to the mouths of the rivers, as the
  tide retires, some of the fish remain in the shallow water,
  that is in water two or three feet in depth. They can be
  readily perceived at some distance, from the swell of water
                               X  2                         which

on a horse accustomed           to the sport, and grasping a spear
made for the purpose, advances towards the fish, and a»
soon as the latter has discovered its pursuer and is making
off, a complete chase takes place between the horseman
and the salmon.         As soon as the man finds himself nearly
up with his game, the spear is thrown with such force and
dexterity as seldom to miss, and the salmon, entangled
with the weight of the spear, soon bceomes exhausted. So
very powerful is the salmon in water, that were the man to
strike it while he grasped the spefir in his hand, he would
instantly and inevitably be dragged from -the horse.

"   T
   In   the 23(1 Number        of this Magazine, of the year 1763,
was given    a short   account    of the breeding of trouts*: as we
have since received a more complete natural history from the
inventor himself, we hope it will not be disagreeable to
our readers to have a repetition on the same subject, as the
discovery really deserves some attention.                 The fishery of
this nimble and cautious animal is carried on in a destruc
tive manner, and commonly at the spawning-time, when
root and branch are destroyed together. But now we enjoy
the pleasure of eating trouts, and have them replaced many
hundred fold, and have the spawn secured from the danger
it is exposed to in the open ponds. If the system of the
inventor should displease, it must be considered that he
does not mean to offer a new theory of generation, but
a method of producing a greater number of fish for the
table ; which last may be obtained without knowing the
nature of the first.       Something similar to this is to be seen
in C. F. Lund's Treatise on the Generation of Fishes in
in-land Seas or Lakes. See the Memoirs of the Swedish
Academy of the year 1761, vol. xxiii. page 184." —We

 now    proceed   to give the     inventor's discovery in his own
 words    :
     Sir, — As I observe from the Literary Mercury of Al-
 tona, No. 20, 1764, that the Royal Prussian Society of
 Sciences have taken into consideration my invention of
 breeding trouts and salmon, wherein I have observed that
 the lecture thereon must have been pronounced on an indif
 ferent and partly an erroneous system ; and that a Northern
 Society of Sciences has, in an Essay on the natural Gene
 ration of Fishes, placed that which I had observed, after
 frequent experiments, among the desiderata; — at Peters-
 burgh and several other places they have considered this
 method of an artificial breeding of trout and salmon, as a
 false chimera.      I am aware that naturalists are frequently
 furnished with matter to search for further discoveries after
 an invention is made public, and that critical examinations
 will clear up any doubtful opinions on a firm basis ; I have
 therefore been led to further experiments, to find out the
 true causes; and how duplicate bodies, in the human as
well as in the whole animal creation, are generated ; which,
 though they have a double body, yet have but one stomach.
 I have thought it a duty incumbent on me to lay my ob
servations on this subject, as well as on others, before the
 public.     It would be needless, and not to my present pur
 pose,   to  mention  every trifling experiment which I made
 within the first sixteen years before my conclusions were
drawn, and in twenty-four years more afterwards, on the
artificial increase of trouts and salmon.       Perhaps I may be
induced hereafter to give more circumstantial accounts on
this subject.
    The box, or trough, or water-bed, in which the eggs
animated with the milt or sperm of the male trout are scat
tered, needs no particular form ; yet it will not be unne
cessary to give a description how my own are made.
                                 §1.
    (1)  I  had boxes made of several woods, (but     I found oak
to be the best,) of about twelve foot long, one foot and a
half wide, and six decimal inches deep.
    (2) At the head of the trough, where the water is to run
in, is laid a thick board about two and a half or three in
ches thick, about a foot wide, and as long as the trough is
wide; in the middle of this board is made a hole six inches
long, and about four inches wide in the clear, with a rabbet
on all the four sides of this hole about an inch and a half
wide and deep, so as to admit a square frame with anaper-
                                   X 3                        turc

326             On Breeding   of Fish, and  1ke         i
ture of six inches by four inches, or of the same size as
the hole; which frame must be covered with a brass gra-;
ting (for iron will rust) of a moderate strength, and close
enough to prevent the smallest water-mouse from passing
through ; otherwise all the spawn and young fry will be in
danger of being devoured by them.
    (3) Near the middle of this box or trough lay another
piece of thick board across, as long as the width of the
trough, and about six inches or more wide ; which, when
nailed upon the edges of the side pieces, will keep them
more steady and firmer.
    (4) Let the lower enc|-board,    where the water is to run
off again, be at least three inches thick, as the greatest
pressure is against it ; have an opening cut in the top six
inches wide and four inches deep, and a rabbet made on
the outside and another on the inside, deep enough to leave
at least an inch thick of the solid board in the middle, and
wide enough to admit a frame with a brass wire grate like
(2) on the outside, which can be shoved in from them ;
the wires should not be above a line and a half asunder,
like those at the top, and for the same reason men
tioned before. In the inside, opposite this opening, shove a
bit of board in in its groove downwards, to stem the water
either entirely, or to regulate its running off, according as
you find it necessary, or to pull it entirely out when the
whole of the water is to run off.
    (5) There must be two strong covers, one between the
two cross pieces described in (3, 3), and the other below
the middle cross-piece quite to the lower end (4); both
covers must be fastened behind with strong hinges, and
before with handles to lift them conveniently up by ; and
as these boards are apt to warp, on account of the water
within and the air without, it is requisite to have each
 clamped with two or three cross-pieces.
    (6) If you think fit to give the young fishes more air
 than what enters at the two brass grates, you may have in
each cover a hole made of the same size, and guarded with
a brass wire grate, as (3), and for the same reasons : I have
done this out of precaution, but have found it in the end
 to be unnecessary.
                              §11.
    (l) Spring-water out of rocks or stony ground is the
 properest for breeding    trouts or salmon ; but where it is
not to be had, any other spring-water may do, provided
the current is strong enough to prevent freezing in cold
frosty weather.
                                                         (2) If

              spring has not fall enough, you must raise a
dam round       one or two feet higher than the top of your
                 it,

          ;       the water from thence through     pipe or              a
gutter to the first grate in the opening on the head-part of
the trough,      § (2), of one decimal square inch diameter,
                     I.
and determine its length at least two inches above the grate;
the remaining water from the spring can be led off side
ways.      If
            you wish to have more breeding-troughs than
one, they should be fixed in the same directions as the
first; and    larger pipe must.be put to the head of the
                a
spring,    which  must empty itself into smaller pipes laid
across the water-trough,    so that each trough may have its
proper quantity of water conveyed into             or     may be
                                                              it
                                                               ;        it

choice of every one's pleasure, as the most convenient me
thod will be soon found out.
   (3) After the box or trough     properly finished,     must be
                                        is                              it
placed horizontally  upon   two legs of  wood,  stone,  or brick               ;
and within upon its bottom put some clean-washed gravel
level, about the size of peas and beans, two inches high;
afterwards sprinkk some coarser gravel or pebbles over                        it,
the smallest of them of the size of beans, and some bigger
than hazel-nuts.    This last    done, that upon the surface
                                    is
of the smaller gravel many deep holes may be formed, to
prevent the continual motion of the water from carrying
away the eggs,       being necessary that they should remain
                       it
where they were at first sprinkled in.
   (4) Then let the water run into the trough as directed
in (2), and raise    higher or lower according to the in
                          it
                in
structions      §   (4), so that the water covers the gravel
                       I.
always one or two inches. This being done, you have ac
complished all that     necessary to the apparatus for breed
                               is
ing trout and salmon.
                                    §   HI.
    (1)The   time of spawning begins the latter end of No
vember, and commonly ends the latter end of January or
beginning of February; but the spawning-time of each
trout continues only about eight days, as the eggs of the
female and sperm of the male become in some sooner, in
others later, ripe. Trouts meet in rivulets in great numbers
in the before-mentioned months       and such as are ready for
                                             ;

tion both male and female get rid of their spawn and sperm.

328               On Breeding    of Fish, and  the
    As a single drop of sperm contains vast numbers of ani
malcules, sufficient to animate a hundred eggs, and as the
water is loaded at this time with the sperm, it is no wonder
that almost every egg becomes a fish. Every t es: iir spawn in
the female comes to its perfection and ripeness on the same
day ; but it is not so with the sperm of the male, for the
white roe lies like a solid substance, divided in two parts in
its body close to the back, and grows gradually liquid, and
dissolves itself into a creamy fluid, beginning at the lower
part, and discharges about the sixth part of each division
every day ; so that within eight days all the sperm becomes
liquid and runs off.
                                §IV.
    (1) To breed young Trout. — Take full-sized trouls out
of the rivulets in December and January, when they gather
together to spawn: as in some rivulets their spawn becomes,
later ripe, you may, in the latter end of January, let part
of the water drain off, by stemming the water above, that
you may take as many out as you want.              If after gently
stroking    their bellies with the  fingers some  spawn   or sperm
goes on, it is a sign that both are ripe, and those must be
put into a large pail or tub for use.
    (2) Then take a wooden, earthen, or copper bowl, put
into it a pint, quart, or more of clear water; take out of
your pail one fish after another, stroke it with the hands or
fingers hard downwards, till the spawn discharges into the
bowl ; you need not fear it will hurt them, for they can,
without danger to them, bear great pressing: then rub the
belly of the male trout in the same manner, till some of
its milt discharges       into the water (a little is sufficient),
then stir the whole with your hands so as to mix it well,
 and all the eggs or spawn will be impregnated ; then put in
 more clear water to disperse them more asunder: after the
eggs are impregnated with the sperm, they are apt to clog
 together, which hurts them in the end ; it is therefore
 necessary to thin them with more water, and to sprinkle
 them into the breeding- trough § I. (4).
    A small space will receive a great quantity of spawn, yet
 they must not lie too thick ; •otherwise when they touch
  each other too much, they will get in a few days into
 putrefaction, and appear as if a fine downy wool was spread
 over them ; and so long as they remain in this state they
 are unfit.    To prevent this, take a thin slice of wood, or a
   addle, about the breadth of a hand, and paJdle with it
 E ackwards and forwards, on the sp:»t where the spawn lies
 too thick, to spread by this motion the spawn asunder.
                                                              (3) I*

              Natural History of their Generation.           329
     (3) It  will be necessary to repeat this manoeuvre twice a
week, or at least once a week ; and by paddling with your
wooden slice in all parts, you will bring the water upon the
pggs in motion ; for let the water be ever so clear, there
will adhere to the eggs in a few days a subtil filth, which
lays the foundation for their corruption, even when the
fish is already alive in the egg ; therefore it is necessary to
clear them by this gentle means.
     (4) After the eggs have been about three weeks in this state,
one may perceive through their hard skin a divided black,
spot, which are the eyes of the young fish ; the body is loo
 transparent to be seen with the naked eye ; but after four
weeks, if you squeeze one of the eggs between your lingers,
 you will see the fish make a motion, and turn within, then
 you may perceive his form. At last, after lying five weeks
 in this state, and under a continual current of running
 water, the young fishes will bore their heads through,
 the shell of the eggs ; and by moving with their bodies
 will, in about half an hour, free themselves entirely from
 the shell, with the yolk of the mother egg hanging to
 their bellies like a small bag. When they are out of the
 egg, they will lie' still in the cavities between the gravel,
 and have then the appearances as if the head of a pin were
 fastened to a reddish field-pea, on account of these hanging
  bags : for three or four weeks they receive their nourish
  ment from the substance contained in this bag, till by de
  grees, as the fishes grow larger, the bags disappear; then
  they begin gradually to assume the shape of fishes, and
  having no further sustenance from this bag, they will seek
  for food themselves.      But as in so small a compass as this
  breeding-trough there cannot be a sufficient quantity of
  small insects to be found for their sustenance, they seek
  for room, where they may meet with them in greater abun
  dance ; they then follow the current of the water, and slip
  through the brass grate at the end of the box, where you
  should have a larger wooden box like a brewer's cooler, or
   a small clean fish-pond,      covered with gravel to receive
   them ; in which they will grow in about six months con
  siderably.
                                § V.
       To instruct my readers as much as possible,     I shall add
   several observations of the formation of these young trouts.
       (l) After an egg has been impregnated by the sperm of
   the male (which is through an invisible opening into it), it
   lodges in the white liquor under the shell, and round the

  lour, and seems to fill up the greatest space in the egg,
  except the little white round it.
      (2) As soon as this little animalcule has assumed the na
  ture and form of a fish, it appears that the yolk in the egg
 is separated by a most extreme thin skin from the outward
 hard membrane.
      (3) The fish itself, except the eyes, is very transparent,
 and as liquid as a little mucilaginous water, yet in shape
 longish ; it lies bent within the outward membrane of the
 egg, and round the thin skin that covers the yolk (2).
     (4) From this time the fish is to be considered as one
 body grown to the yolk, from the gills downward to the
 outlet, which is in length about a quarter part of the in
 ward circumference of the egg.          This yolk, which looks
 like a bag, becomes the belly of the fish ; but is extended
 at first above fifty times the size of its natural belly, and
 without entrails.
     (5) On this expanded belly, expecially from the salmon-
 trout, are plainly to be seen many blood-vessels, divided
into smaller branches, and so plain that the arteries may
 be distinguished from the veins with the naked eye ; and it
is no wonder, for as it has been mentioned (4), that this
 hanging belly is fifty times bigger than it should be in pro
 portion to the size of the fish, so the blood-vessels are in
proportion expanded, and are to be very plainly seen, as
long as the fish remains in a state of transparency like
water.
     (6) If you open one of these bags with a needle, a liquid
runs out of a yellowish colour, which is the nutriment of
the fish.    Then the bag shrinks in like an empty bladder,
and the fish dies.     After the fish has been out of its egg
about a fortnight, a thin skin separates from the inward
coat of this hanging belly, and then it shrinks so much
that it disappears entirely. After the belly is entirely shrunk
to its proportionable size, this inward skin shrinks likewise ;
and because the intestines begin from the mouth, it forms
                                                                   "
a passage into the stomach, and continues narrower con-
traded and formed into guts, which lay one over another,
terminating at the outlet in the belly.        It is further to be
observed, that the heads of the trouts, when they first have
the shape of fishes, have not the usual form ; they look as
if the snout was chopped off near the eyes ; but as their
bellies shrink, the heads grow, the mouths are formed,
and in about three weeks the heads get their proper shape.

  JL,ast1y,    I shall make a few additions, which flow from tho
  farmer       observations,     and are the result of experiments
  which      I  have  no  inclination   to publish at present.
                                      § VI.
      (1) According to the course of nature, no trouts or sal
  mon are generated in ponds or standing waters.
      (2) They cannot be bred there if millions of pregnant
  eggs were put into them.
      (3) The young trouts, in the first two or three weeks,
   are very tenacious of life ; for after the head is dead, the
   body will live two days before they are quite dead : this is
   to be understood of healthy fish kept in a current of fresh
,  streaming water.
       (4) Although the young trouts love to swim with the
   current, within six weeks, out of their breeding-troughs,
   § IV. (4), yet they can be kept within them six or more
   weeks longer by particular manoeuvres.
       (5) They are not easily to be caught, on account of their
   small size and nimble motion ; notwithstanding they may
   be collected in a pail.
       (6) They may then be put into a proper water, or can
   be put through a funnel into bottles, and carried to any
   part, provided the water do not freeze.
       (7) The ripe eggs of a trout, after they are four or five
   days apparently dead, and gone into a kind of putrefaction
   so that the stench is intolerable, may yet be recovered, and
   bred into fishes.
       (8) The eggs of the trout will not produce fishes so long
   as they remain connected with the egg stock.
       (9) The natural causes why a hen brings a live chicken
   into the world may very easily be accounted for from the
    observations I have made in the breeding of trout.
       (10) The natural disposition of the animalculas of the
   sperm which enters the egg may be considerably increased.
       (11) I have made many experiments, in which I have
    found that two animalculae had slipt into the egg, and that
    double fishes have been generated ; although they had two
   bodies, they had but one common'stomach : how this hap
    pens,    see  §  V. (1).
        (12)   Of   these monstrous productions, the most of them
    were opposite to one another, and had their stomach in
    common between them ; yet in a strict sense the stomach
    only,    the   rest  of  the guts divided     in about three weeks
    separately.
        (13)    Some of these double fishes were         fixed by their
                                                                  sides

332               On Breeding   of Fish, and   the
sides together ; and this happens when two animalculae of
the sperm enter the egg in a direct line, 90 degrees from
one another.
   (14) I have seen only one of these double fishes, where
the backs were across nearest the tail in a direct angle, so
that this fish formed a kind of a cross. This happens when
two animalculae enter one egg, and are placed opposite each
other from their direct line to 90 degrees.  These monsters
(12, 13) were grown together from the head to the opening
of the belly, and that (14) had in some degree a joint
body; but the backs were distinguished one from an
other.
   (15) All these kinds of monstrous productions die in
four or five weeks after their common bag, or belly, is emp
tied ; for as each head endeavours to follow its own direc
tion in pursuit of food, and both hinder each other, nei
ther of them is capable to perform its intention ; so it is
impossible that either head can receive its proper nourish
ment, therefore they both must starve.
   (16) All monstrous productions in the human and other
animal creations, which have a joint stomach, are produced
•when an egg is impregnated by more than one spermatic
animalcula.
   (17) All observations made on the trout, and its artificial
method of breeding, hold good with regard to salmon.

  Directions    for Breeding Salmon, Trout, Cray-Fish, &c.
   Neither the form nor any particular kind of materials
are essential  for the troughs ; but the following seem to be
most eligible : oak of two inches thick, twelve feet long,
one foot ten inches wide, and thirteen inches deep on the
outside ; the top divided into four parts.
   Spring-water out of rocks or stony ground is the pro-
perest for breeding trouts and salmon ; but where it is not
to be had, any other spring will do, provided the current is
6trong enough to prevent its freezing in hard frosty weather.
If  the spring has not fall enough, you must raise a dam
round  it, at least a foot higher then the top of your trough;
convey   the  water   from  thence through    pipe or gutter to
                                               a
the first grate in the opening on the head of the trough
of an inch and half diameter, and let the fall from the grate
from the end of the pipe or gutter be two or three inches    ;
the remaining water of the spring can be drawn off side
ways. If you are inclined to erect several troughs, you
may either put them      by the side of one another, or at the

the troughs horizontally upon legs of wood, stone, or brick ;
on the bottom of this trough put some clear washed pebbles
about the size of peas two inches thick ; then sprinkle over
them some few larger of the size of small walnuts : this
last is done to form recesses, to prevent the continual mo
tion of the water from carrying away the eggs.
    Take care that the water which runs in and discharges
itself always covers the gravel at least two inches. To
breed young trout, you must take some out the latter end
of December or the beginning of January, when they
meet to spawn: if by stroking their bellies with our fingers
some spawn comes out, it is a sign they are ripe, and
these fish may be put into a tub for use.

out your fishes one after another, stroke them with your
 hand or fingers hard downwards, till the spawn discharges

  close to prevent the cray-fish from getting out, and put

XLVI.    On some Phcenomeiia which take place in                        tti&
     Formation of Saltpetre. By M. Longchamp*.
In  chemistry there are several theories which reason avows,
but which experience cannot always confirm.       The theory
which I   am about to give        of   certain   phaenomena       that take
place in the formation of saltpetre, is supported      by facts
known to every chemist, and confirmed by a great number
of experiments, all of which have been published by such
respectable authorities, and are in themselves so Consonant
with our chemical doctrine, thai scarcely any objection can
be offered against them.
   When we reflect on the formation of saltpetre, and on
the formation of nitrates in general, we ought to be much
surprised at the difficulties experienced in our own and
other northern climates in the manufacture of saltpetre;
while in other countries, and particularly Spain and India,
the nitrate is produced on the surface of the ground, al
though the inhabitants contribute no manual labour what
ever to its formation.
   We must seek, therefore, for the cause of this pheno
menon in the nature of the climate ; and we shall support
this assertion by experiments and well-ascertained facts.
   In India and Spain when the rainy season is at an end
the atmosphere becomes dry, and continues so during a
great part of the year; while in the North it is always hu
mid, except when the cold is so severe as to precipitate part
of the water which it holds in solution. But as the diyness
of the southern hemisphere has a different origin from
that of the northern, the phenomena are also very diffe
rent. In fact, the atmosphere being very warm seeks every
where for water to dissolve, and sucks        as      it,
                                                    were, from
                                                            it
the bowels of the earth; but this water coming to the sur
face of the soil, brings with      the nitre which
                                       it                held in it
solution, and deposits     to be combined with the air.
                             it                                In
the North, on the contrary, not only       the air cold, but the
                                                 is
ground also :   there    no evaporation, and the water re
                        is
mains in its bowels; and when, in summer, the dryness
occasioned by the heat tends to bring the water to the
surface of the earth, and brings the nitre which          held init
solution, fresh rains succeed and carry      down again to
                                                      it                  a
certain depth.
   In this way we can easily explain why the nitre which
we find in the earths of India and Spain presents itself at

 cannot be doubted for        moment, since we extract
                                       a                       from                 it
 several plants, such as lettuce, onions, turnips, &c, par
 ticularly turnsole. Now           has been clearly established
                                            it
 that         not formed
                 is            the act of vegetation, but rather

       it it
that     existed ready formed in the soils in which these
 plants have been cultivated *.
   It  remains therefore to explain how the nitre           formed             is
in the bowels of the earth. Is          to the decomposition of
                                                      it
animal and vegetable substances that the formation of ni
trates     owing?
            is        Without doubt nitric acid         formed in         is
this decomposition, and consequently nitrates, since there
are salifiable bases for saturating this acid: but           do not            I
think that this      the principal cause of the formation of the
                         is
nitre  ; lor, in fact, we know extremely well that the nitric
acid in artificial saltpetre works        produced very slowly,
                                                      is
and cannot be formed except in         humid and stagnant at

mosphere, at temperature always uniform and rather low.

Now not one of these conditions          fulfilled either in Spain
                                                      is
or the East Indies.      We cannot therefore attribute to the
decomposition of animal and vegetable substances                 the
formation of nitre in the bowels of the earth or at least             ;                  it   is
but   a very trifling cause compared to the effects.
    Does nitre exist ready formed in the bowels of the earth,
as we find the sulphates, carbonates, borates, muriate of
soda, &c.        This has not been hitherto proved
                  ?                                        any one             by
factf; and even          be found in mines, does
                           if   it                     follow that        it
this salt must be diffused over the whole surface of the
globe Sea salt, however, which

is not to be seen efflorescing on the high roads in Spain.
    Nitre not being the result of the decomposition of ani
mal and vegetable substances, nor being natural produc            a
tion, we ought to seek its origin in the atmosphere             and                  ;
this will be very easy to find.

  electricity*. Now we also know that when we pass a cer
  tain quantity of electrical sparks through a mixture of
  azotic and oxygen gas, nitric acid is formed : therefore
 when the same phenomenon takes place in the air and in
 our laboratories, the same results ought to take place; and:
 this is what actually happens : for it has been clearly proved
 by Margraf, and subsequently by several other chemists,
 that all rain water contains nitric acid.        The stronger the
 detonation, the greater quantity of this acid is formed : in
 Spain and India, therefore, where the thunder is more fre
 quent in rainy weather, and where the detonations are also
 stronger than in northern regions, of course more nitric
 acid is produced in the former than in the latter regions.
     By this formation of nitric acid in the air, may we not
 explain a part of the phenomena which we observe in
 storms ? I shall examine therefore the theory which some
 naturalists have given on the subject. M. de Saussure
thinks that the electric fluid exists in the higher regions J
 that it every where tends to find an equilibrium ; and that
our globe, being frequently deprived of it by some given
causes of destruction, recovers it in the higher regions,
where the rarefaction of the air admits of its existing more
easily than in our atmosphere.            From this he conceives
a part of the earth to be sufficiently heated to reduce into
vapour a part of the water on its surface : this vapour, com
municating caloric to the air which surrounds              it,
                                                          renders         it
thinner and forces     itto ascend.     In this way there       ver

tical wind established which carries the heat into the upper
strata of the air, and renders them susceptible of dissolving
the vapours which       it carries along with it.    The air being
in no respect     cold  enough for condensing them, they are
diffused nearly uniformly into the mass of very high ver

  heat rendering the mass lighter, forces it to rise higher and
  higher, and to attain the regions where the rarefactioti of
  the air gives to the electric fluid the liberty of moving up
  and down in the column.
•*   If  M. Saussure succeeds by this reasoning in accounting
  for the loud detonations which we then hear, it does not
  appear to me that it explains the causes of the formation of
 water, orof the other aqueous substances which are precipi
  tated.   May we not be allowed to suppose that the positive
 or vitreous fluid and the negative or resinous fluid, being
  brought into contact by means of the column of vapours,
 effect the formation of the nitric acid ; and that the water
  held in solution by the azotic and oxygen gas, being set free
                                                                  43
 by their combination, occasions the phaenomena which we
 observe in these circumstances ?
     But if this formation of the nitric acid in the air were
 doubtful,   I  could support it by a phaenomenon generally
 known, but which         has not yet received a satisfactory ex
 planation ; whereas, according to my theory, it is a fact
 perfectly natural, and which, I must also add, has even
 served as the basis of all my reasoning.
     We cannot conceive how the nitrate of potash comes to
 be formed under the tiles of a roof, since this fact is in
 contradiction wuh every thing that we know on the subject
 of the nitrates ; for, as I have said, the nitric acid is only
 formed, in our climate, in places where the air is stagnant,
 and even when this temperature does not generally exceed
 that of our globe*. Now in a granary the air is not stag
 nant, and is never at the same temperature, since it varies
 annually from — 10° to + 20° (= + J 8° to 68° of Fahr.) :
 we must therefore seek for the cause of this phaenomenon
 in other principles than those adopted by the chemists to
account for the formation of saltpetre.
     Having reflected on the long continuance of snow on the
roofs of houses, and knowing also that this substance con
tains a considerable quantity of nitric acid, I cannot help
thinking that this is the sole cause of the phaenomenon.
 In short, the tiles under the above circumstances perform
the same office with the earths of India and Spain : the part
which is inside the granary, being always dry, absorbs the
nitrated water found in its interior; and this water, being
dissolved by the ambient air, deposits the nitre on the sur
face of this tile, as it deposits it on the surface' of the soil
of warm countries. Thus in winter it is the nitric acid of

the snow which is combined with the salifiable bases of the
tile : in summer the former is brought by the rains.
     If it be easy, from the above theory, to explain how the
nitric acid comes to be found in the earth of India and
Spain, as well as in the tiles of the roof, it gives us no as
sistance in explaining why nitrate of potash is found there
in preference to nitrates of lime and of alumine, since tiles
 ape made of these salifiable bases ; and without doubt they
help to form the soils of Spain and India, while no potash
at all enters into their composition.              My object was to
 point out the origin of the nitric acid in most saltpetre
 substances,    and not that of potash: I shall merelv add, for
 the sake of those who ask reasons for every thing because
 they wish to account for every thing, that it is a fact of
 observation, namely, that the same materials which are
 applied to the formation of nitrates, when exposed to a
 damp and stagnant air, yield nothing for the most part but
 nitrate of lime; whereas, when they are exposed to a dry
 and agitated air, they yield almost nothing but nitrate of
 potash*.
     It is not enough to establish a theory, we must also ren
 der it as useful as possible; and for this reason I have pub-
     The most direct application that can be made of these
 hints is without doubt the manufacture of saltpetre.            In
 fact, there are about three millions of pounds of sajtpetre
 made annually ; and for this it requires at least 798 mil
 lions of saltpetre materials, since I estimate about six
 ounces as being the produce of each cwt. of materials. At
 least an equal quantity of water is used in lixiviating these
 materials ; and if we admit that there is only 0*0001 of ni
 tric acid in this water, it follows that it would give as the
 result 79,800 pounds of acid ; which, adopting the propor
  tions given by Berthollet for the component parts of nitrate
  of potash, would give 164,130 pounds of this salt.
      Rain and snow water may therefore be advantageously
  employed, not only in lixiviating saltpetre substances, but
  for watering artificial nitre- works, and by this means the
  produce will be greatly increased.

     I . Further Inquiries     on the Action of Potassium              on
        Ammonia,         and on the Analysis of Ammonia^.
The      most remarkable circumstances occurring in the ac
 tion of potassium upon ammonia are the disappearance of
 a certain quantity of nitrogen, and the conversion of a part
of the potassium into potash.
    The first query which I advanced in the last Bakerian
Lecture, on this obscure and difficult subject, was whether
 the gas developed in the first part of the process of the ab
 sorption of ammonia by potassium is hydrogen, or a new
species of inflammable aeriform substance, the basis of ni
trogen ?
    Experiments made to determine this point have proved,
 as I expected,  that the gas differs in no respect from that
given out during the solution of zinc in sulphuric acid; or
that produced during the action of potassium on water. By
slow combustion with oxygen, it generates pure water only,
arid its weight, in a case in which it was mixed with at
mospherical air, precisely corresponded with that of an
equal quantity of hydrogen.
    Another query which I put           is,
                                      Has nitrogen    metallic   a
basis which alloys with the metaU employed in the experi
ment   ?
    This query cannot answer

 I    have examined the potassium generated in the process.

in the common experiment of the gun-barrel          and gives;

t   The account of the principal facts respecting the action of potassium on
ammonia,   in this communication, were read before the Royal Society,
February   2,1809.  The paper was ordered to be printed March 16, 1809.
At that time, having stated to the council that had since made some new
                                                  1
experiments on this matter, and on the subjects discussed in the Bakerian
Lecture for 1808,    received permission to add them to the detail of th.e
                     1
former observations for publication.
                                    Y   2                    crystallized.

340                  New analytical Researches
crystallized.       I made a solution of it in muriatic acid ; brat
hydrogen       alone  was evolved.
     I distilled a quantity of the fusible substance from nine
grains of potassium in an iron vessel, which communicated
 with a receiver containing about 1 00 grains of mercury, and
by a narrow glass tube the gas generated was made to pass
 through the mercury ; the object of this process was to de
 tect if any of the same substance as that existing in the
 amalgam from ammonia was formed ; but during the whole
period of distillation the mercury remained unaltered in its
appearance,       and did not effervesce in the slightest degree
when thrown into water.
     That the nitrogen which disappears in this experiment is
 absolutely converted into oxygen and hydrogen, and that
its elements are capable of being furnished from water, is a
 conclusion of such importance, and so unsupported by the
 general order of chemical facts, that it ought not to be ad
 mitted, except upon the most rigid and evident experi
 mental proof's.
     I have repeated the experiment of the absorption of am
 monia by potassium in trays of plaiina or iron, and its di
 stillation in tubes of iron, more than twenty times, and oftea
 in the presence of some of the most distinguished chemists
 in this country, from whose acuteness of observation               I
 hoped no source of error could escape.
     The results, though not perfectly uniform, have all been
 of the same kind as those described in page 55*. Six grains
 of potassium, the quantity constantly used, always caused
 the disappearance of from 10 to 12•5 cubical inches of well
 dried ammonia. From V5 to 6 cubical inches of hydrogen
 were produced, a quantity always inferior to that evolved
 by the action of an equal portion of the metal upon water.
  In the distillation from li to 17 cubical inches of elastic
 fluid were evolved, and from 1•5 to 2•5 grains of potassium
  regenerated.
     The quantity of ammonia in           the products, varied from a
  portion    that  was   scarcely  perceptible to one-twelfth or one-
  thirteenth of the whole volume of elastic fluid ; and it was
  least in those cases in which the absence of moisture was
  most perfectly guarded against. Under these circumstances
  likewise, more potassium was revived ; and the un absorb
  able elastic fluid, and particularly the hydrogen, in smaller
  proportion.
      When the products of distillation were collected at dif-
  fsrent periods, it was uniformly found that the proportion

vanced.
   The first portions contained considerably more nitrogen
in proportion, than the gases evolved during the electriza
tion of ammonia, and the last portions less.
   I shall give the results of an experiment, in which the
gases produced in distillation were collected in four different
vessels, and in which every precaution was taken to avoid
sources of inaccuracy.
   The barometer was at 29*8, thermometer 65° Fahrenheit.
   Six grains of potassium absorbed 12 cubic inches of well
dried ammonia. The metal was heated in a tray of platina,
and- the gas contained in a retort of plate glass.
   5-8 cubical inches of hydrogen were produced.
   The fusible substance was distilled in an iron tube of the
capacity of 3 cubical inches and half filled with hydrogen,
the adaptors connected with the mercurial apparatus con
tained '8 of common air.
   The first portion of gas collected (the heat being very
slowly raised, and long before it had rendered the vessel
red,) equalled 7•5 cubical inches.      It contained •& of am
monia. 7 of the residuum, detonated with 4{ of oxygen gas,
left a residuum of 4.
   The second portion, equal to 3 cubical inches, contained
no ammonia.       7'2 measures of         detonated with 3*8 of
                                         it,
oxygen,    left
              a  residuum  of  3"5.
   The third portion was equal to cubical inches; at this
                                         5
time the tube was white hot     ;    contained no ammonia
                                    it                        i
8"5 of it detonated, with 4'5 of oxygen, diminished to 2-5.
   The last portion was     a cubical inch and half, collected
when the heat was most intense. 4*5 measures, with 3*75
of oxygen, left    aresiduum of 2*8.           /
   The iron tube contained, after the experiment, (as was
ascertained   by admitting hydrogen when         was cool,) 2-7
                                                it
of gas; which seemed of the same composition as the last
portion.     The adaptors must have contained '8 of similar
                                                         a
gas.
   The tube contained potash     inits lowest part, and in its
upper part potassium, which gave         by
                                         its action upon water
\{ cubical inch of hydrogen.
   As the largest quantity of hydrogen        always produced
                                               is
at that period of the process in which the potassium must
be conceived to be regenerated, and in which the gases
being in the nascent state, its power of action upon them
would be greatest,     occurred to me, that

 larger quantity of it destroyed by the distillation of the fu

 by the distillation of it in its common state.          On this idea
J    made several experiments : the results did not differ much
 from each other, and were such as I had expected.              I shall
 describe one process made with the same apparatus as that
 which I have just detailed. — Barometer was at 29•5, ther
 mometer 70° Fahrenheit.
     Six grains of potassium were employed in an iron tray;
 10 cubical inches of ammonia were absorbed, a small glo
bule of metal remained unconverted into the fusible sub
 stance.    A fresh piece of potassium, weighing six grains,
was introduced into the tray.
     The iron tube and the adaptors (having together a capa
city equal to 4*3 cubical inches) contained common air.
          gas was collected in three portions, there was no ab
   • The
sorbable quantity of ammonia in either of them.
     The first portion, that produced before the tube became
red, was eight cubical inches.        1(V25 of   it,  detonated with
3•5 of oxygen, diminished to 8.
    The second portion equalled five cubical inches 9-J- of    ;
this, with of oxygen, left residuum of 3£.
              5                   a
     Of the third portion,   2   cubical inches and       came over.

9   of  it,detonated with   5   of oxygen gas,      left  a residuum
of 1-4.
    The iron tube and the adaptors contained, at the end of
the experiment, as was proved         by cooling and the admis
sion of hydrogen, 2*3 cubical inchesof gas, which appeared
of the same composition as the third portion. Nearly                 7
grains of potassium were recovered.
    A   comparison of these results, with those stated in the
preceding page, will fully prove, that there       isa  much smaller
proportion of nitrogen to the hydrogen, in the case in
which the olive-coloured substance         is distilled with potas
sium, than in the other case, and there         is  likewise   alarger
quantity of potassium converted into potash.
    The loss of nitrogen, and the addition of oxygen to the
potassium, are sufficiently distinct in both processes; and
the want of   a   correspondence between these results, and
those of the experiment detailed in page 55*, are not greater
than might be expected, when all the circumstances of the
operation are considered.          In the instance in which          a
double quantity of potassium was employed, more potash
must have been formed from the oxygen of the common
air in the tubes; and the fusible substance, in passing
                      * See page of this volume.

 of the removal of the different portions of gas, likewise,

     [n instances when the heat has been more rapidly raised,
 I have generally found more potassium destroyed, and less
 nitrogen in proportion in the aeriform products.          In such
 cases, likewise, the loss of weight has been much greater;
the gases have been always clouded, and the adaptors, after
being exposed to a moist air, emitted a smell of ammonia;
from which it seems likely that small quantities of the dark
gray substance described in page 50 of this volume* are
sometimes carried over undecompounded in the operation.
     In some late experiments, I substituted for the iron tube,
a tube of copper, which had been bored from a solid piece,
and the sides of which were nearly a quarter of an inch ia
thickness.       My object in using this tube was not only to
prevent    the  heat   from being too rapidly communicated to
the fusible substance, but likewise to be secure that no me
tallic oxide was present ; for though the iron tubes had been
carefully cleaned, yet still it was possible that some oxide,
which could not be separated from the welded parts, might
exist, which of course would occasion the disappearance of
 a certain quantity of potassium.
    I shall give the results of one of the processes, which 1
regard as most correct, made in the tube of copper.           The
barometer was at 30-5; thermometer was at 59° Fahrenheit.
    The tube contained two cubical inches and half, and was
filled with hydrogen.
    Six grains of potassium, which had absorbed 13 cubical
inches of ammonia in a copper tray, were employed.
    The adaptors connected with the mercurial apparatus and
the stop-cocks, contained *7 of atmospherical air.
    The gas given off was collected in two portions.
    The first portion was equal to 1 1 Cnbical inches. It con
tained -8 of ammonia; 11 of the residuum, detonated with

    In this experiment the heat was applied much more slowly
than in any of those in which the iron tube was used, and
even at the end of the operation the temperature was little
more than that of cherry red.
    In the upper part of the stop-cock there was found a
minute quantity of gray powder, which gave ammonia by
the operation of moisture.
    In no case, in which I have used the copper tube in like
processes of slow distillation, has there been less than four
grains of potassium revived ; and the proportion of nitro
gen to the hydrogen in the gas evolved has been uniformly
much greater than in processes of rapid distillation in the
tubes of iron ; vbut the whole quantity of elastic matter pro
                                 '
cured considerably less.
    Copper has a much stronger affinity for potassium* than
iron. It occurred to me as probable, that this attraction,
by preventing the potassium from rising in vapour at its
usual temperature, and likewise by the general tendency of
such combination to give greater density, might occasion a
diminution of its action upon the nitrogen in the nascent
state.      Ammonia has a strong attraction for the oxide of
copper, and it consequently is not unlikely that the fusible
substance may combine with metallic copper, and that this
compound may not be entirely destroyed in the distillation.
And assuming this, it may be conceived that the loss of
hydrogen partly depends upon some combination of the
basis- of ammonia with copper.
    I had a tube, of the capacity of 1\ cubical inches, made
of wrought platina, cemented by means of fine gold solder.
The fusible substance was obtained (as usual from six grains
of potassium) in a tray of platina, where it was brought in
contact with a large surface of platina wire ; the distillation
was slowly conducted ; but before the temperature                     of the
 tube had approached          to that of ignition, it dissolved and
gave way at the points where it was soldered, and a violent
combustion took place.             Only seven cubical inches of gas
were collected; but         of this,  allowing for the hydrogen that
filled the tube, nearly three-fifths were nitrogen.
     I am making preparations for performing the experiment
in a bored tube made from a 6'ingle piece of platina, and
likewise in tubes made of other metals, and I hope to be
   *
      Copper heated in potassium speedily dissolves,   and diminishes its fusi
bility ; but potassium requires a white heat to enable it to combine with
iron.    In another experiment, in which I distilled the fusible substance in
an iron tray, contained in the copper tube, a considerable quantity of cop
per, that had been dissolved, was found in the state of powder deposited
tipon the tray, or louse iu the bottom of the tube.

able, in a short time, to have the honour of laying the re
sults before the society.
   I shall make no apology for bringing forward the inves
tigation in its present imperfect state, except by stating
that my motive for so doing, is the desire of being assisted
or corrected by the opinions and advice of the learned che
mical philosophers belonging to this illustrious body.         In
an investigation connected with almost all the theoretical
arrangements of chemistry, and in operations of so much
delicacy, it will, I conceive, be allowed, that it is scarcely
possible to proceed with too much caution, or to multiply
facts to too great an extent.
   The different phenomena presented by the processes of
distillation in different metallic tubes, may lead to new ex
planations of- this intricate subject ; and though the facts
cannot be easily accounted for, except on the supposition
that nitrogen is an oxide, yet till the proportions and
weights are distinctly ascertained, the inquiry cannot be
considered as far advanced ; for in an experiment in which
the processes are so complicated and delicate, and in which
the data are so numerous, it is not easy to be satisfied that
every source of error has been avoided, and that every cir
cumstance has been examined and reasoned upon.
   All conclusions on the action of potassium on ammonia,
are immediately dependent upon the results of the electrical
analysis of the volatile alkali. In a letter which I received
in the course of the last month from Dr. Henry, that ex
cellent chemist has stated that he conceives I have rather
under-rated the quantity of nitrogen in ammonia, accord
ing to the proportions given in the Bakerian Lecture for
1807.      This notice has induced me to repeat the experi
ment, under new circumstances, and I find not the slightest
reason for doubting of the entire accuracy of my former
results.
                       I
   In the new trial, used mercury which had been recently
boiled in the tube for electrization ; the ammonia was in
troduced after being long dried by caustic potash, from a
receiver in which it had not been generated, and which had
likewise been inverted over boiling mercury.        The gas left
no perceptible residuum, when absorbed by water deprived
of air by boiling. In this process, 15 measures of am
monia expanded, so as to fill 27 measures; and the hydro
gen by detonation with oxygen, over water freed as much
as possible from air, proved to be to the nitrogen as 73*8
to 26*2.     In the experiment three explosions were made,
the oxygen being deficient     in the first twoj  so that no  ni

   Except when precautions of this kind are employed, as                    I
have before noticed, no accurate data can be obtained re
specting the proportions of permanent gases obtained from
ammonia by electricity.
   When the gas is generated and decomposed over the
tame mercury, there is always a greater expansion than the
true one ; and when the mercury is not boiled in the tube,
and when common water is used, the nitrogen will be al
ways over-rated, unless this error is counteracted by an
opposite error, that of detonating with an excess of oxy«
gen *.
   Dr. Henry had the kindness to send me the apparatus,
in which he conceived, at that time, that he had witnessed
the formation of water in the decomposition of ammonia
by electricity, by his ingenious method of applying hygro-
nietrical tests.
    I tried one experiment only with             it,
                                             and in this there
geemed to me to be more moisture exhibited in the elastic
tnatter after electrization than before, when        was cooled

tests, water must be less sensible in ammonia than in hy

XLVIII.         Inquiry whether Ncevia Materna, with which
       Children are sometimes born, should be attributed to the
      Imagination of the Mother.
                            To   Mr.   Tilloch.
 Sib,    In   looking over a late volume of the Linnean Trans
 actions, I met with a fact that seems almost to set at rest a
 long disputed physiological question, which formerly en
 gaged a considerable share of attention in the philosophical
 world, but has not hitherto, as far as 1 know, been satis
 factorily resolved.
       The question to which I allude, is that which refers to
 the share which is be attributed to the imagination of the
 mother in producing the marks which infants are some
  times born with, by philosophers of a former day, the af
  firmation of this question was decidedly insisted upon, and
  more than one volume has been filled with reputed instances
  of the effects of the mother's imagination upon her off-
  Spring.      In the present day, too, the whole female world
  still retain a similar belief upon this subject, and almost
  every woman can quote her own or her neighbour's expe
  rience in support of her opinion.           The medical men, how
  ever, always laugh at their histories, and consider them as
  mere idle tales.       I was myself for a long time prepossessed
   with the same notion ; but at length I heard of two or three
   instances of children having been born without limbs of
   with wounds, in consequence of the mother's imagination
   having been violently acted upon ; which almost staggered
   my scepticism.        One of these cases was related to me by
    *n intelligent friend who had seen the child born with only"
    one leg, as well as its mother, who declared her firm be
    lief, that the cause of this imperfection in her child was a
    violent fright which she experienced from seeing a beggar
    suddenly uncover the wounded stump of his thigh.             My
    friend very closely cross-questioned this woman ; and Ihe
    result of his examination was an entire conviction that it
                                                                 was

S48                   On NcBvia Materna.
was a fact that she had been frightened when pregnant in
the way she stated, and that the infant subsequently born
was maimed precisely as the beggar was who had been the
cause of her alarm.     Since learning this fact I have been
more inclined to listen with patience to similar histories,
yet with some doubts, chiefly built upon the universal in
credulity of the medical men to whom I have related them,
remaining.     These, however, are now done away by the
fact stated in the Linnean Transactions alluded to above,
the substance of which I shall briefly state.
   The servant of Mr. Milne, F.L.S., in removing a kettle
from the fire, trod very heavily upon the tail of a pregnant
she cat lying upon the hearth. The cat immediately uttered
a dreadful scream, and ran out of the room with every
mark of violent terror. When this cat littered, half of her
kittens had their tails bent in the middle at right angles,
with a round knot thicker than the rest of the tail at the
angle formed.
   This fact seems to be very important, and to prove nearly
to a demonstration, that the imagination of pregnant fe
males has the power of acting upon the bodily conforma
tion of their young.     It is very certain that the tails of the
young kittens were not trodden upon.         What then could
have thus distorted them, but the imagination of the parent
influenced by the sudden alarm which she felt ? It may be
denied that the distortion was the consequence of the pres
sure on the mother's tail ; but such a denial appears to me
very unphilosophical, especially when we take into account
the number of similar facts on record, with respect to the
human species.      If this were the first instance heard of,
there would doubtless be reason for hesitation; but it is so
closely analogous to hundreds of like events which are
stated to have occurred to women, that it seems to me con
clusive.    It may be said perhaps that cats are exposed to
have their tails trodden upon every day, and that we never
hear of similar mutilations.      But it should be considered,
that in the case recorded in. the Linnean Transactions, it
was the extraordinary injury sustained by the animal, and
the violence of the impression it made upon her, thatalont
caused the circumstance to be recollected. Mr. Milne would
never have remembered any ordinary scream of his cat from
having been accidentally trodden upon, nor have thought of
referring to it the remarkable conformation of her kittens.
    I shall be glad'if some of your physiological correspon
 dents would favour me with their opinion on this state

XLIX.        On Crystallography.         By   M. Hauy.       Translated
  from the last Paris Edition        of his Traite    de Mindralogie.

 Of   secondary    Forms, the Molecules of which differ           from
                        tile Parallelopipedon.
It is    a character common to all the primitive forms tp be
divisible parallel to their different faces.           In the paraHelo-
 pipedon,    this division,    when   not joined   to  any other which
can take place in different directions, evidently leads to a
form of molecule similar to the nucleus.                 In the regular
hexahedral prism, it gives as a molecule an equilateral tri
angular prism, as we have already seen in another place.
In the octahedron, it seems to tend towards molecules of
two different forms, some tetrahedrons and others octahe-               ,
drons. This mixed kind of structure takes place also with
respect to the tetrahedron.            But every probable reason
 concurs to exclude the octahedron, and to adopt the tetrahe
 dron in preference, as being, in these cases, the true inte
 gral molecule.      Under he head Filiated Lime more par
ticulars will be found on this subject.
    If we divide in the same way the dodecahedron with
 rhombic planes, the molecules will be, without equn
 vocation, tetrahedrons with triangular isoscele faces. Under
 the article Garnet, every thing relative to this kind of struc
ture will be found.
    With respect to the dodecahedron with isoscele triangular
 planes, we cannot extract the molecules that compose it
without dividing it in directions different from those which
 would be parallel to the faces. The tranchant planes in this
 case ought to pass by the axis, and by the ridges contiguous
 to the summits, whence irregular tetrahedrons result as
.molecules.      This point of theory will be treated of in the
 article Quartz.
    The other primitive forms are also sometimes subdivided
 in directions which are not parallel to their faces.               We
have already had an example of this, relative to the rhom
boid of the tourmaline, whose subdivision, following planes
                                                                 which

 which pass by the axis and by the oblique diagonals, gives
 the result represented in fig. 10, where we see that the
 molecules are tetrahedrons. Observation also proves thai
  the oblique quadrangular prism which is the nucleus of
 pyroxene, has natural joints situated parallel to a pjane
 which would pass by the small diagonals of its bases ; from
 this we may conclude that its molecules are triangular
 prisms.
     I shall not insist further on these modes of division,
which will be explained at greater length when we come to
 speak of the articles which represent them ; but I ought
not to pass over a result which serves to connect the cry
 stallization of substances, whose molecule is the tetrahe
dron or triangular prism, with that of substances which
 have, as primitive forms, simple assemblages of elementary
parallelopipedons.
    This connection consists in the tetrahedral or prismatic
molecules being always assorted in such a manner, in the
 interior of the primitive form and of secondary crystals,
 that on taking them by small groups of twos, fours, sixes,
or eights, they compose parallelopipedons, so that the
ranges subtracted by the effect of decrements are nothing
else than sums of these parallelopipedons.
    That we may better conceive how this takes place, let us
conceive for a moment that the small rhomboids which re
present the molecules of carbonated lime are divisible into
tetrahedrons, as we have seen with respect to the rhom
boids which belong to the tourm iline.       This view does not
change     the explanations which  we   have given of the diffe
rent secondary    forms  of which   carbonated   lime is suscep
tible : i. e. in order to determine these forms by the help of
theory, we should always confine ourselves to the consi
deration of decrements by one or more ranges of rhom-
boidal molecules.
    What is only an hypothesis with regard to carbonated
lime, is changed into reality with the tourmaline. Although
the rhomboids produced at first by the mechanical division
of the crystals of this substance are ultimately resolved into
tetrahedrons, the decrements which give the secondary
forms are produced by subtractions of these rhomboids si
milar to the primitive form ; so that we may suppose, in
calculations relative to the determination of these forms,
that the tetrahedrons which represent the true molecules
are connected with each other in an invariable manner in
each rhomboid.
    Let us cite another example drawn from a very simple
                                                      structure,

                            On Crystallography.                            351
structure, which is that of crystals whose primitive form
is the regular hexahedral prism. Let A D be always (fig. 40)
one of the bases of this prism subdivided into small
triangles which are the bases of so many molecules.                        It is
evident that any two given triangles adjoining the other,
such as. A p i, AO i, compose a rhombus, and conse
quently the two prisms to which they belong form by their
union a prism with rhomboidal bases, which is one of the
kinds of parallelopipedon.
     Let us now imagine that the triangular prisms, which
 are the elements of these parallelopipedons, are invariably
connected with each other.                 We may substitute for the
arrangement represented in fig. 40, that of fig. 41 merely
 composed of rhombuses, which will be the bases of so many
 parallelopipedons.
      Now if wesuppose a series of laminae piled up on the hex
 agon ABC DFG, and which undergo, for example, on
 their different edges, subtractions of one range of parallelo-
                similar to those now in question, these edges will
    e successively arranged like the sides of hexagons ilmnr h,
 Eipedons
 kuxy g e, &c. : hence we see that the quantity in which
 each lamina shall exceed the following one will be a sum
 of parallelopipedons, or prisms with rhomboidal bases ; and
 it is easy to judge that the result of the decrement, sup
 posing that the latter attains its limit, will be a straight
 hexahedral pyramid, which will have as a base the hexagon
 ABCDFG.
      All the other different primitive forms of the parallelopi
  pedon give analogous results. We might even substitute
  for each of these forms a nucleus similar to the small pa
  rallelopipedon, which are assemblages of tetrahedrons                        or
  triangular prisms ; and we should also succeed in explaining
 the secondary forms by laws of decrement referred to this
  nucleus, which would also be given by mechanical di
  vision.       We shall use it in this manner with respect to
  quartz, because in this case the substitution of the paralle
   lopipedon for the bipyramidal dodecahedron leads to more
   simple decrements for certain varieties*.
                                                                         I  shall
      • We are acquainted with crystals whose mechanical division gives first
   a prism with rhomboidal bases which have different angles of 120° and 60°.
   This prism may be afterwards subdivided in the direction of one of the dia
   gonals of its bases: from which it results that we might also extract imme-
  .dlately from the secondary crystal a hexahedral prism i but which would not
    be regular.   In these cases we shall adopt the prism with rhomboidal bases,
   for  the nucleus, because this form, besides being simpler, has a character of
 '*                                                                    regularity

 352                          On Ctystallography.
     I shall give the name of subtraclive molecules to those
 parallelopipedons composed of tetrahedrons, or of triangular
 prisms, and whose ranges measure the quantity of the de
 crement which the laminae of superposition undergo when
 applied on the faces of the primitive form.
     We find from what precedes, that, to speak precisely,
 theory would not admit of our proceeding towards its prin
cipal object, on stopping at the parallelopipedons given in
the first place by the mechanical division of crystals ; and
the kind of anatomical dissection afterwards undergone by
these parallelopipedons, when we try to ascend to the true
form of the integral molecule, is an ulterior step, without
which, observation, rather than theory, would leave some
 thing unfinished.            The parallelopipedon here represents
unity,    at  which     all  the results of the theory end ; and frac
tions formed of its subdivisions beyond this unity are of no
consequence.
    We see at the same time, that by means of this con
formity between the results given by the various forms of
integral molecules, theory has the advantage of gene
ralizing its object by chaining to asingle fact the multitude
of facts, which from their diversity seem little susceptible
of concurring in one common point.
regularity which the other has not, and which consists in the equality and
similitude of its lateral faces.
   Here a consideration presents itself which we ought not to omit. Let
ABCD (fig. 42) be the upper base of one of the prisms we have mentioned.
Let us suppose for a moment that this prism cannot be subdivided except
parallel to its four panes and to its two bases. The arrangement of the small
rhombuses situated on both sides of the rhombus ABCD will represent the
effect of a decrement by one range on the two longitudinal ridges terminated
by the points A and C ; and it is visible that this decrement will produce for
the secondary form, a hexahedral prism, whose base is represented by B' I
mD'r/i.
   Now if we    conceive that the rhomboidal prism which has for its base
ABCD,      may be subdivided in the direction of the diagonal B D into two
triangular prisms, all the small rhomboidal prisms of which it is the assem
blage being susceptible of the same division, we shall suppose that the
•mall vacuums which existed between I and m on one hand, and between
h and r on the other, in the hypothesis of the decrement. are filled up by
triangular prisms, in which case the hexahedral prism will be immediately
given without any decrement. Nevertheless we cannot admit of considering
the faces which will be in this case as being produced in virtue of a decre
ment by one range, because then the form of the secondary crystal is merely
composed of small rhomboidal prisms similar to the primitive form, as would
have taken place if the decrement was produced by two or more ranges ; so
that here it is only a particular case which should seem to have been assimi
lated with all the others for the sake of uniformity in the laws of structure.
The same reasoning applies to primitive forms different from the parallelopi
pedon, as we shall nod in the course of thi* work.

      Difference between the Structure and the Increment.
     In the preceding development of the theory, we have
 supposed that the component laminae of crystals originally
 of one and the same species, issue from one common nu
 cleus, undergoing decrements subjected to certain laws,
 upon which the forms of these crystals depended. But here
 it is only a conception, adopted to make us more easily per
 ceive the mutual connections of the form in question.
 Properly speaking, a crystal in its entire state is only a
 regular group of similar molecules. It does not commence
 by a nucleus of a size proportioned to the volume which
 it ought to acquire, or, what comes to the same thing, by
 a nucleus equal to that which we extract by the aid of me
 chanical division ; and the laminae which cover this nu
 cleus , are not applied successively over each other in the
 same order in which the theory regards them.              The proof
 of this    is,  that among crystals of different dimensions
 whiqh are frequently attached to the same support, those
 which can only be distinguished              by
                                            the microscope are as
 complete as the most bulky; from which                follows that
                                                              it
 they have the same structure,         e. -they already contain
                                        i.                                  a
 small nucleus proportioned to their diameter, and envelop
 ed   by the number of decreasing laminae necessary, in ordet
 that the polyhedron should be provided with all its faces.
We do not perceive these various transitions of the primi
 tive to the secondary forms, which ought to take place                    if
 crystallization constructed, as        if   by
                                           courses, the species of
 pyramids superadded to the nucleus, in going from the base
 to the summit*.
    We must therefore conceive, for example, that from the
 first instant    a crystal, similar to the dodecahedron with
rhomboidal planes derived from the cube (figs. 11 and 12),
is  already a   very small dodecahedron, which contains cu             a
bical nucleus proportionally small, and that in the follow
 ing instants this kind of embryo increases without changing
its form,    by   new strata which envelop         on all sides
                                                         it        so  ;
that the nucleus increases on its part, always preserving the
same relation with the entire crystal.
    We shall make this idea apparent               by
                                                  construction re

 may conceive that the assortment has commenced                  the                          by
 square  BNDG,       and that different piles of small squares
 are afterwards applied on each of the sides of the central
 square; for example, on the side        N      the first place the

 place if  the  dodecahedron commenced              cube propor              by   a
 tioned to its volume, and which afterwards increased             an                          by
 addition of laminae continually decreasing.
    But on the other hand, we may imagine that the assort
 ment had been at first similar to that which we see (fig.
 43 C), in which the square                         BNDG

 squares, carried on that of the middle       small cube, so that   a

on each of its sides        pile of three

attained its    greatest dimensions decrease successively,)
 was already, as it were, displayed in the growing crystal.
   A great deal remains to be done before we can terminate
the theory of crystallization.   We have only given the laws
of the structure of crystals, and we are now enabled to un
ravel those of their formation.     The affinity of the mole
cules for each other, the nature of the liquid in which cry
stallization takes place, its degree of density, temperature,
and other similar circumstances, would be so many ele
ments which we ought to take into our calculation, and
the solution of the problem would determine the law of
decrement which ought to take place in each particular case
in virtue of the same circumstances, and the form of the
secondary crystal which would result from that law.
   We can very well conceive in general, that stony, me
tallic, or other molecules, suspended in a liquid, and dis
posed to reunite m order to form a crystal, are attracted
at the same time by each other, and even by the molecules
of the liquid; and it is because their mutual affinity is
stronger than that of the liquid that their union is produced.
Now the attraction of the liquid varies on account of the
circumstances which we have mentioned ; and thus its dif
ference from the mutual attraction of the molecules, which
is always the same, ought also to undergo variations which,
influence crystalline forms in their diversity* And if there
are heterogeneous matters in the liquid, they will act on their
part in order to modify the action of the liquid on the true
molecules.     It would seem that we have a proof of this in
certain crystals of axinite, one part of which is of a violet
colour with manganese, and the other green, in conse
quence of chlorite being present.     The former presents ad
ditional facets, which are not observed in the latter, which
is besides more regularly formed, and has not a striated sur
face, like the violet part.
   A superabundant portion of some of the essential princi
ples, which would be, as it is said, in excess, might also
have an influence on the form of the crystal, by adding its
own particular action to that of the liquid.        For it can
hardly be doubted that there is for every substance a fixed
proportion of principles, which constitute its true nature ; so
that all which exceeds the limit given by this proportion
ought to be regarded as accidental, and assimilated to a he
terogeneous substance.
   But the above are only slight hints, by no means suffi
cient to clear up the subject. Our acquirements have more

progress to make, before geometry can have the data neces
sary for submitting to a precise and rigorous theory the
 combined forces of the different agents which concur in
crystallization, and ascend from thefacts already establish
ed, to other facts more general, and more allied to the
true causes which depend immediately on the will of the-
Supreme Being.     It is a rich mine, the working of which
is merely commenced, and which waits for more favourable
times and more scientific workmen to follow the vein to
the greatest depth.
Of   Crystals with a Moiety reversed, and of those which
                appear to penetrate each other.
   We have hitherto considered crystallization as impress
ing on its results the character of the greatest possible per
fection, and producing nothing but isolated forms, exempt
from every thing that could affect their purity and symmetry.
It remains for us to describe certain accidents, which, un
der the appearance of exceptions or anomalies, still possess
a latent tendency towards the same laws to which the struc
ture is subjected, when nothing deranges their progress or
disturbs their harmony.
   In ordinary crystals, the faces adjacent to each other al
ways form saliant, and never re-entering, angles.         But
crystalline forms also exist which present these last angles ;
and Rome de l'Isle was the first who observed that this
effect took place when one of the two moieties of a crystal
was in a reversed position with respect to the other *.     A
very simple example will enable us to conceive this re
versal   .
  Let  us suppose that B d (fig. 44) represents an oblique
prism  with  rhomboidal bases, situated iu such a manner
that the panes ADcia, CD dc, are vertical, and B D are
the acute angles of the base ; and the latter proceeds' in a
rising direction from A to C. Let us, besides, suppose that
the prism is cut into halves, by means of a plane which
should pass by the diagonals drawn from B to D, and from
b to d, and that, the half situated on the left remaining
fixed, the other half is reversed without being separated-
from the former.     The crystal will be presented under
the aspect which we see in fig. 45, where the triangle b' d'
which was one of the halves of the lower base (fig. 44),             is cf,
now situated in the upper part (fig. 45), and forms saliant      a
angle with the fixed triangle ABD, while the triangle

  EDC       (fig. 45), which was one of the halves of the supe
  rior base (fig. 44), is transported into the lower part (fig.
 45), and forms a re-entering angle with the fixed triangle
 aid.
      We   can easily conceive that the plane of junction D B b d
 of    the two halves of a rhomboid, is situated like a face pro
 duced in virtue of a decrement by one range on one or other
 of the ridges Aa, Cc, (fig. 44); and thus the manner in which
 these two halves join is in strict relation to the structure.
      Now if we imagine a secondary form which has for its
 nucleus the same prism, and if we suppose that it has been
 cut in the directions of the plane D B lid, and that one of
 its halves is reversed in such a manner that the half of the
 nucleus which corresponds with it assumes the same posi
 tion as in the preceding case, the assortment might be such
 that there is still a re-entering angle on one hand and a
 saliant angle on the other, which will result from the mu
 tual incidences of the faces produced by decrements.
      In certain cases the plane of junction, on which the two
 halves of the crystal are joined, is situated parallel to one
 of the faces of the nucleus, and the assortment does not
admit of presenting a re-entering angle opposed to a saliant
angle.
      J have given to these reversed crystals the name of hemi-
 tropes*, and I call hemitrope crystals such as are thus re
 versed.      They seem to indicate a polarity in the integral
 molecules, as I shall explain'more at length under the head
 of spinell. We shall also find under the articles feldspar,
pyroxene, oxidated tin, &c, remarkable examples of hemi-
tropes.
      Another accident extremely common, is the manner in
which grouped crystals are inserted into each other f. This
kind of apparent penetration is subject to so many diver
sities, that frequently, among crystals of the same group,
we do not find two relative                   positions resembling each
other. We must except, however, staurotide, the prisms
of which, as we shall see, have their junction limited to
two particular cases, which we shall make known when
treating of the crystallization of this substance.
     But although in general the positions in grouped crystals
are infinitely variable, we find, on a closer examination,
    * Rome' de l'Isle calls them macks. But this name being already applied
to a very common species of mineral, I have thought proper to avoid the
double application of the term.
    t  The German word       druse is sometimes used  to designate a group  of,
crystals.

that they are subjected to certain laws always analogous to
those of the structure; and that these crystals, instead of
being tumultuously precipitated         on each other, have in
some measure concerted their arrangement.
    Let us also on this occasion choose a very simple exam
ple. Let A     C   (fig. 4&) be a cube, and M N r an equi
lateral triangular facet produced in the place of the angle A,
in virtue of a decrement by one range round this same
angle. Let us suppose a second cube modified in the same
manner, and fastened to the former by the facet which re
sults from the decrement indicated.          We shall thus have
the assortment represented by fig. 47.
    We may now conceive that one of the two cubes, that
for example which is placed below, is increased in all its
dimensions, except at the places where the other forms an
obstacle to it. In proportion as this increment becomes
more considerable, the upper cube will be more and more
 engaged in the inferior one, and it may even finish by being
 entirely masked or concealed by it. We observe crystals
 effectually sunk into each other at various depths ; but
 which have always a plane of junction situated like a face
 produced by a decrement, in such a manner that the two
 structures follow their ordinary progress, each on its own
 part, the length of this same plane, which serves as their
 respective limit.    I have divided cubes of fluated lime in
 serted into each other; and I have remarked that the la
 minae of each extended without interruption, until suddenly
 stopped by the common plane of junction.
     The example now quoted relates to a very simple and
 very regular law of decrement. But frequently the laws
 which determine the plane of junction are more or less re
 mote from this simplicity, and there are a few which are
 somewhat extraordinary.
     When two prisms cross towards the middle of their axes,
 there are two planes of junction, which unite, crossing
  each other on one common line, as we shall find under the
 article staurotide, and both these planes also have positions
 analogous to those which would be determined immediately
 by laws of decrements.
     To conclude : I have here presented the results of but a
  small number of particular observations.       I propose after
  wards to resume the subject now glanced at, and to give a
  fuller development to the theory of which I think it sus

   L.    An Examination of the Review which appeared in
      lheX]llth Number of" The Retrospect," &c, of Doctor
       Herschel's Essay on the coloured Rings discovered by
       Sir Isaac Newton.
                          To Mr. Tilloch.
   Sir,   This  paper is transmitted to you by a little club of
  friends who occasionally meet together for conversing on
  philosophical subjects, and who suppose that what is now
  communicated may be made welcome to a place in your
  very impartial and valuable Magazine.
      For some time past our chief object has been to consider
  more particularly of the progress of discovery in the differ
  rent branches of physical science, by the increasing ardour
 for experimental researches, happily now so prevalent both
 on the continent and in our own country ; and which re
  flects so much lustre on the present times.
      Though our reading is pretty extensive in original and
 other publications of this sort both foreign and domestic,
 yet it was not till lately we met with some numbers of a
 periodical work called " The Retrospect," &c, which first
 appeared a few years ago.      From the plan of that publica
 tion and its high pretensions, as stated in the general title,
 we had some curiosity to dip into it ; when very soon we
found our attention arrested by a review of an experimental
essay under the following title :     " Experiments for inves
 tigating the Cause of the coloured concentric Rings (dis
 covered by Sir Isaac Newton) between two Object-glasses
laid upon one another.         By William Herschel, LL.D.,
F.R.S."
     When that paper first appeared in the Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society of London, we well re
member to have perused it with high satisfaction ; notonlv
on account of the remarkable skill discovered by the author,
in bringing forward many new and curious experiments
leading to important conclusions, but also because the
structure of the whole piece appeared to us as an example
of the inductive method of proceeding in natural philosophy
worthy of ranking with the best models we have of the
kind.
     We therefore need scarcely mention our surprise at finding
that nothing whatever of that subtile and elaborate perfor
mance was held of any account by the writer who furnished
that review of it for the 13th Number of The Retrospect.
     Though to those who have studied optics, any vindica-.

360             Dr. HerscheVs Reviewer    reviewed.
tion of the experimental essay in question is surely unnefces-
sary, yet it may not be amiss to do something in this way,
for the sake of disabusing many other very intelligent per
sons who otherwise might be misled by criticisms as confi
dently delivered by this reviewer as they appear to us, one
and all of them, ill founded.
     It would be a very unlucky issue indeed, especially of
experimental researches, when pursued by a man of Doctor
Herschel's abilities, to be wholly destitute of value. Ne
vertheless this reviewer, as has been already noticed, from
 the beginning to the end of his lucubrations on the essay,
very carefully inculcates that it ought to be so estimated.
     Though we are far from questioning the right of private
judgement, especially within the calm precincts of philoso
 phy, yet we are of opinion that fair controversy will here
 always reject an union with Ihe passions ; and that the
 love of truth for its own sake, when it is in reality the
 governing principle, will sweeten opposition, and join to
 gether antagonists in sincere and mutual esteem.
     Accordingly, on the present occasion, from the many'
 prefatory eulogiums on the author of the essay, we naturally
 expected, along with any power of argument, gentleness
 and decorum on the part of the reviewer, when exposing the
 imagined failures of a person who has done so much for sci
 ence, and who in every view of his character was so highly
 entitled to consideration.
      In place of that deference, however, which we looked"
 for, and which certainly would in no way have weakened
  the force of the reviewer's fancied refutations, the very
  contrary seems to be indulged in. Every thing in the course
  of his strictures, in paint of manner, is so sour and super
  cilious, and so totally exclusive of approbation, as very ill
  corresponds with any measure of complacency, or respect
  for the author of the essays This, when confronted with
  that ample store of compliment and encomiums which
  usher in the strictures, is in some danger, we fear, of being
  viewed by many as a very gross inconsistency ; and so far,
  perhaps, the reviewer has been unfortunate in exposing the
  cordiality of his professions to some degree of doubt.
      At a meeting of our little circle lately, this wayward sort
  of see-saw of first writing art author so handsomely up, and
  then immediately so completely down again, was not spared.
  One observed, tartly, that so novel and incongruous a plan
  of criticism was like wrapping up garlic and assafoetida iri
  verveil and rose leaves : another, that he never yet had found
  the sprinkling of lavender or Hungary water entirely to
                                                      countervail,

countervail, when any unsavoury thing had got behind the
wainscot : a third exclaimed, with more archness of man
ner, that it was a right cunning experiment, and by all the
world like applying, what he whimsically called, a meta
physical syphon to the merit of an author; by which, in
the first instance, the merit was indeed made to mount up,
but as certainly, added he, shaking his head, to wheel round
to the contrary direction ; till by degrees the whole stock
should be drawn off, in the way of hocus-pocus, by the
preponderant bias in the longer leg.
 :
     Rut to'interpose a little in favour of the reviewer, from a
wish of reconciling appearances, it is only fair to consider,
as l,e himself indeed expressly warns us to do, that whilst
he was bl                         the author  by  panegyric, yet
so miserably cold on his essay, almost in the same breath,
he lay under a conflict between his great respect for Doctor
Herschel and his paramount obligation to fidelity, when
delivering his awards in philosophical matters, for the edi
fication of the public.
     It comes therefore, in the next place, to he examined
how far the solidity of this reviewer's matter can justify
that fervour of his critical zeal which, on the present oc
casion, has led him to be so fastidious and magisterial ;
under the great delusion, as it should seem, of his being so
warranted on the score of duty, that he might give the
greater consequence and currency to his critical manifestos.
   '
     For prosecuting, in the hopes of success, a subject well
 known to be important, and also of a recondite nature,
Doctor Herschel, in the true spirit of experimental philo
 sophy, conceived that every thing depended on a full dis
 covery of the phenomena of the coloured rings he treats
 of in his essay, as far as they could be traced by the most
diligent and varied trials. Before he entered on these expe
 riments no philosopher had ever seen but one set of rings,
 namely, that discovered and treated of by Sir Isaac New
 ton.     But whilst viewing that beautiful appearance as pro
 duced by the contact of the famous Huygenian              lenses,
 Dr. Herschel detected between his glasses several other sets
 of coloured rings, which, by the peculiar construction of his
 apparatus, were formed at the same time. To a person
 then employed as he was, such very new phaenomena could
 not but be deemed most worthy of attention. Nor will it be
 asserted, along with the reviewer, by any one who has pre
 tensions to science, that to examine their nature and pecu
 liarities could be of no avail. The fact    is, as appears from
 the essay, that this patient and acute philosopher has, with
                                                      remarkable

 remarkable success, observed those new sets of coloured
 rings whilst undergoing a variety of surprising and intricate
changes, all of which he has reduced to order, and fully
explained. From this store of facts, entirely new, he has
moreover established, beyond all contradiction, the four
general propositions, in pages 47 and 48 of his paper, con
cerning the formation of the Newtonian rings themselves.
    This reviewer, however, makes very short work in de
claring the whole of this research as good for nothing. For
in the 13th Number of The Retrospect, page 24, it is said,
"   The principal novelty of those experiments appears to be
the unnecessary complication that is introduced into them;
the rings, exhibited by a series of successive reflections, are
confessedly repetitions of those which Newton observed in a
simpler form : and from this complication Doctor Herschel
obtains only fumum ex Julgore." Indeed ! highly decorous
Jatinity to be sure, and given us, by way of boast, in an
appropriate character.
    We can scarcely conceive any thing more unreasonable,
or less worthy of a serious reply, than this most strange
objection to such a detail of instructive experiments as has
been just alluded to; and on the unmeaning grounds that
the rings exhibited by a series of reflections are unneces
sary complications,    because repetitions of those which
Newton observed in a simpler form.       For on that very ac
count, of their being so seen by a series of reflections, much
knowledge has been derived concerning the nature of all the
rings.   This has been most particularly and clearly shown
in   the essay.
     Had this   reviewer    lived in the days of the celebrated
Hadley,    the inventor    of that noble instrument known all
over   the world by his name, he surely, according to his
seeming capacity of judging of matters of this kind, would
have thought Hadley very idly employed in having to
do with the moon and stars by means of reflections,
                                                                    '
when to be seen at a single glance in the reviewer's
simpler form : and yet it is well known that by the aid of
seeing these luminaries by reflections a great object was ac
complished, for the benefit of mankind, by the construc
tion of the sea quadrant. Or let us ask the reviewer, what
is the case when viewing distant objects through a tele
scope ?     Here also we find that by having availed ourselves
of a little of that complication so decried by the reviewer,
and of images formed by reflections, we see much further,
and much better, than he could do by looking at the same
things in their simpler form as he calls it; that       is,
                                                      without

the help of the telescope.    The simplest of all simple forms
the reviewer will admit is that of the sphere : yet Archi
medes, when investigating several curious properties of
that solid, doubtless employed many reflections ; and the
reviewer might impugn the demonstrations of that geome
trician   as unnecessary complications, with as much justice
as he has done     Doctor Herschel's proofs proceeding from
reflections also, both mental and optical.      In short, what
is found in the foregoing quotation is so flimsy as to debar
all philosophical discussion, and cannot be gravely replied
to.
    Another of the strictures is the following : (Retrospect,
page 23, line 4, from bottom ; when the reviewer, speaking
of Dr. Herschel's essay, says,) " We cannot consider it by
any means as adding to the value of those treasures of sci
ence, which have in the course of years been accumu
lated in the Philosophical Transactions."      The reader need
not be here told how much those justly celebrated volumes
have derived their importance by recording knowledge sup
ported by experience as science in its best form.     In reply,
therefore, to the passage just now quoted, we shall. have an
opportunity of entering a little more particularly into the
nature of Doctor Herschel's experiments and proofs, by
putting a few questions to the reviewer.
    Considering the avowed importance of the subject, is it
not an addition to our stock of knowledge to have been
made acquainted with many different ways of obtaining a
sight of these coloured rings ; not only by means of glasses,
but of metals? See the essay, articles 1, 2, 3.
    Is it not an addition to our stock of knowledge to have
discovered and shown that the colours of these different sets
of rings are alternate? (see article 14,) and to have ex
plained the cause of that alternation ? See article 17.
    Is it not an addition to our stock of knowledge to have
shown that the colour of the rings, as well as their size,
can be suddenly changed, according to an invariable law,
by the interposition of shadows? (see article 15,) arid to
have explained the cause of these changes ? See article 18.
    Is it not an addition to our stock of knowledge to have
proved also by experiments, the four propositions in pages
47 and 48 of the essay, relating to the action of the several
surfaces as contributing to the formation of the coloured
rings ?
    Is it not an addition to our stock of knowledge to have
shown that from a polished metalline speculum we can ob
tain most beautiful coloured irises ? See article 33.
                                                             If.

 36*           Dr. Herschel's Reviewer reviewed.
    If the reviewer still continues his negative to those ques
 tions, his notions of knowledge and science must be of
 some very peculiar conformation.
    Further, in The Retrospect, pages 23 and 24, it is saidi
 "  Doctor Herschel seems to have confined his study of the
 phaenomena of light almost entirely to the works of New
 ton." And was not his doing so, in this paper, highly
 proper ; when he was, by experiments, investigating the
 cause of the coloured rings discovered    by Newton ? It is
 immediately added, ?' not thinking it worth his while to
 inquire whether the last hundred years had produced any
 thing deserving his attention ; and taking it also for granted,
 that little or nothing was known before him," &c. This,
 and some other morsels of the like sort, which are passed
 over, nearly rival in elegance the reviewer's fumum, &c.
 But as nothing whatever is to be found in the essay that
 can show what the author takes for granted, we are quite
at a loss in conjecturing who has let the reviewer into that
 secret.
    Again, in The Retrospect, p. 24, line 6, it is said, " But,
in fact, the colours of those plates were by no means the
discovery of Newton ; they have been described with great
accuracy by the ingenious, but too much neglected, Doctor
Hook."       Here the reviewer discovers a laudable sympathy
and concern for departed merit; but we find nothing in the
essay which could induce him thus to conjure up the shade
of that philosopher. The tendency of the passage last quo
ted, though it cannot be supposed intentional, is to fasten
a charge of ignorance on the author ; as if he had ever
maintained that the phaenomena of these coloured thin
plates were the discoveries of Newton.       The author in his
essay has never alleged any such thing.        He has said, in
deed, and truly, both in his title and elsewhere,       that the
coloured rings were discovered by Newton.         This it is well
known Newton did by making use of prisms, and at last
object-glasses, brought into contact. See Newton's Opticks,
book II., part I. observations 2, 3, 4.
    Again, in Retrospect, page 24, we find as follows :    " The
experiment made by strewing particles of hair-powder in a
sunbeam, is still more unconnected with the question."
The most evident and close connection of that experiment
with the subject will be best seen by Doctor Herschel's
own words ; when it is considered that he was then bring
ing his proofs from experiment to bear against the existence
of the fits of easy reflection and easy transmission of light.
    As a reason for pronouncing that experiment uncon
                                                          nected

                  Dr. Herschel's Reviewer    reviewed.          365
uected with the question the reviewer adds : " Because the
rays of light undergo certain flections and modifications in
the neighbourhood of bodies near which they pass, it surely
does not follow that they are not liable to other modifica
tions at the surfaces of transparent bodies.         In fact, these;
colours     are identical with those  of the  coronae  described by
Mr. Jordan and other authors."
      The reviewer must have been slumbering when he would
have the reader tcbelieve Doctor Herschel had still to leani
from him that light may be liable to modifications at the
surfaces of transparent bodies ; since the close investigation
of those very modifications makes the sole business of Doc
tor Herschel's essay, from the beginning till very near the
 end. This hypothesis of the reviewer's inattention is further
 confirmed by what is immediately added in the conclu
 sion of the last quotation.        There the originality of the
 experiment alluded to has wholly escaped him ; for he
 mentions it as nothing but what had before been iamiliar to
Mr. Jordan and other authors.
      But to proceed : The proofs which the author has brought
 forward against the existence of the fits of easy reflection
 and easy transmission of light are detailed in the 31st and
 32d articles of his essay, and may be considered as the
 most important part of it ; as leading on to new views
 and improvements of Sir Isaac Newton's               philosophy of
 light and colours.
      Let us therefore next see what the reviewer has given us
 about this. The quotation is from the 24th page of The
 Retrospect.
                   " We do not wish to be considered as stre
 nuous defenders of the Newtonian fits of easy transmission
  and easy reflection ; but we will venture to maintain that
  Doctor Herschel has advanced no one a/gument that can
  have any weight in lessening the probability of their ex
  istence." And in five lines further on, it is added : " Nor
  had Doctor Herschel any reason to expect a sensible change
  in the appearance of the rings, when they were viewed
  through the wedges of air and glass which he describes,
  6ince those wedges were much too thick to produce any
  observable colours in white light, and for the same reason
  too thick to produce any perceptible interruptions in the
  rings*; the effects of the interruptions of two portions of
   light, differing but very little in refrangibility, being so dif
   ferent as to counteract each other."
       Now really in the whole of this, till we come to the aste~
    risk, there is nothing to be found in the form of argument.
    That the wedges described by Doctor Herschel were much
                                                                  too

  SC6             Dr. Her selter s Reviewer    reviewed.
  too thick cannot surely be admitted on the reviewer's Ipse
 dixit.     This position ought to have been established by
 some proof, not by naked assertion ; since the author, in
 his paper, had 30 minutely shown that the thickness of his
 wedges was such as to warrant his conclusions.             The truth
 is, that the reviewer here contradicts not Doctor Herschel,
 but Sir. Isaac Newton, who has proved that plates of air
 between his object-glasses, as thick, and a great deal thicker
 than many to be found in Doctor Herschel's wedges, will
 produce observable changes in white light.
     Newton, in his Opticks, edition 1721, page 178, de
 termines experimentally the thickness, in, parts of an inch;
 of his plates of air at the first, second, third, fourth,
 fifth &c. ring, as respectively equal to a fraction whose
 constant denominator is 178000, and the numerator ac
 cording to the series 1.3.5.7-9, &c. These were the thick
 nesses of the respective plates of air between his object-
 glasses, when his eye was placed perpendicularly in the
 axes of the rings.      Further, in page 1 79, he determines all
 these different thicknesses when he viewed                 the rings
 obliquely.      By his table, given us in that page, it appears
 that any individual ring ot a given diameter, with a certain
 thickness of air at that place, will, when seen in the most
 oblique position, be increased 3•5 times in diameter, and
 that the thickness of the plate of air at the same place will
 be increased 12-25 times.
    As to the number of rings which can be perceived and
 counted, Newton mentions that, under favourable circum
 stances, he has sometimes seen more than twenty of them ;
 and in the usual way eight or nine.          But even supposing
 we could see none beyond the limits of the eighth ring, the
question before us is, what would be the thickness, ac
 cording to Newton^ of the plate of air at that place ? This;
when the eighth ring is seen perpendicularly, with the ob-
                                                       15

to         parts of an inch.     Here then we have the authority
of Sir Isaac Newton for saying that        a ring will be formed
and perceivable     when light passes through a plate of air of
          The reviewer will not deny that the production of a
 -g^.
 ring is   a change  made on white    light.
                                                                 Now

              Dr. Herschel's Reviewer    reviewed.            3(5/
   Now the thickness of Doctor Herschel's plate of air of
wedge at its greatest opening is stated, in his paper, to be
     part of  an inch. This   wedge was 3"6 inches in length ;
and an easy calculation will show that from the sharp end,
forward for three inches, the thickness (increasing from
zero all the way) did not exceed that determined as above
by Newton. This, it is presumed, will be sufficient to
show that Doctor Herschel's wedge of air was thin enough
for his purpose ; and that any individual ring of a secondary
set, when seen within three inches from the sharp end,
must appear broken or interrupted in such parts as let
through the rays of its own colour, granting they were in
fits of easy transmission at their incidence on the under
most plate of the wedge.
    But it might have been assumed that 1 2 rings, instead
Of 8, may be rendered perceivable by Newton's object-
glasses ; in which case the thickness of the plate of air at
that place will be      parts  of an inch, which is greater than
the greatest opening of Doctor Herschel's wedge.
    Let us now return to the last quotation fromThe Retro
spect ; in order to consider the import of The two lines
which follow the asterisk. There we meet, for the first
time in the whole course of the strictures, with something
having the form of an argument.            The reviewer tries to
prove that certain counteractions will take place to prevent
the breaks or interruptions of the secondary rings from
being perceivable, because the wedge of air, in his opinion,
is much too thick. But though we certainly should have
welcomed any opportunity of philosophical discussion on
a topic of this kind, yet we are obliged to declare that, after
having repeatedly and carefully endeavoured to catch the
meaning of these two lines, they appear to us altogether
unintelligible ; and we are persuaded they must be so judged
of by every one conversant about optics. We are, how
ever, far from saying that the reviewer had not in his mind
some meaning or other which bore on him, very cogently,
in support of such counteractions : but surely he must have
thought very highly of his powers of elucidation, if he really
expected in the compass        of two lines to enlighten his
readers, and establish his conclusions, on a point of this
kind. But as these his conclusions, by his own admis
sion, depend on Doctor Herschel's wedges being much too
thick, the contrary of which has been made evident, it
cannot be expected that such supposititious and imaginary
                                                   counteractions

  Sfifi         Dr. Hersclwl's Reviewer   reviewed.
  counteractions are to set aside Doctor Herschel's proofs de
 duced from facts.      At the same time, could the reviewer
  have made some stand on this ground, and had he conde
 scended     to have illustrated intelligibly the sources of his
 contradiction, we should have respected such an instance
  of philosophical scrutiny and such an invitation to candid
  disquisition.    But in place of that, this reviewer all of a
  sudden   chooses  to envelop himself in that smoke he has
 so ready at command ; and so vanishes in a cloud of abor
  tive and fathomless opinions. -
     To conclude : It is well known that the fits of easy re
 flection and easy transmission, imputed to the rays of light
 by Sir Isaac Newon, have long been considered as a part
 of his philosophy in some measure doubtful. In the essay at
 present under consideration, the author has the merit of
formally bringing this celebrated theory tti the only test
 which can finally determine its pretensions, and set so im
 portant a question for ever at rest. If, when thus sifted by
 a more enlarged experience, and by so skilful a hand, it hag
 been reserved for Doctor Herschel to show its fallacy, yet
 no generous mind will be disposed to grudge him that suc
 cess, or to venerate the less the name of Newton, though
 one of his most earnest and most illustrious followers has
 so improved his philosophy, even by clearing it of bis own      ^
 mistakes : 3ny advances of this kind, even at such a price,
 we cannot doubt would have been hailed by Newton himself.
 That truly great and excellent person had far more wisdom
 as well as humility than to harbour the weak and prepos
 terous ambition of being accounted infallible as a mortal.
 Any lapses, however, that can be ascribed to him, figure
 only as small spots do on the meridian sun, considering
 that effulgence of science struck out of darkness by the
 sublimity of his genius, and which he has bequeathed to
 mankind.       In the present instance, whatever new scion is
 destined to adorn the philosophy of light and colours, in,
 consequence of the advances now made by Doctor Her
 schel, one thing is certain, that it must derive its vital
 growth by being grafted on that tree of knowledge still
 sound at the core, first planted by the hand of Newton, and
 which cannot but ever endure and flourish, to be beheld by
 all eyes as one of the monuments of his glory !

        MY DEAR SIR         f,
 -1-   should sooner
                  have cotnmunicated the account, which
you  are so good as to request, of my further experiments
on the decompostion of ammonia,      had not been anxious
                                                   if  1

 sults not affected       any of those numerous causes of error,
                            by
 which easily insinuate themselves into processes of so much
 delicacy.     You have already been informed that the fact,
 which    I lately mentioned to you, (tending to prove the ex
 istence of oxygen as an element of the volatile alkali, by
 the discovery of oxygen gas in the products of its analysis,)
is  nof entitled to confidence, owing to the admission of                     a
 small quantity of atmospherical air          way which was not
                                                   in   a
 at all suspected.      Frequent repetitions of the same process,
 under circumstances wholly unobjectionable, have fully sa
 tisfied me that no portion whatsoever of oxygen gas                          is
 evolved       by
               electricity from ammonia even when,         means    by
 of an apparatus constructed for the purpose, the only me
 tallic surface exposed to the gas consists of the sections of
 two platina wires, each l-50th of an inch in diameter, the
 wires themselves being inclosed in glass tubes which are
 sealed hermetically round them, and then ground away,
so as to expose only the points.       Nor does any difference
in the nature of the products arise from electrifying the gas
either under increased or diminished pressure, the latter of
which,        appeared to me probable, from the known in
              it
fluence of elasticity in impeding the combination of gaseous
bases, might prevent the oxygen of the alkali from uniting
with hydrogen to form water, and occasion the expansion
of both into the state of gas.
    Having failed, therefore, to acquire, in this way, proof
of the existence of oxygen in the volatile alkali,      was nextI
led to  seek   for some unequivocal   mode   of evincing the pro-

be scarcely le9s satisfactory in establishing oxygen to be
one of its constituents, than the actual separation of oxy
gen gas. The most careful observation of ammonia, during
and after the agency of electricity, does not discover the
smallest perceptible quantity of moisture.      In order, there
fore, to subject the gas to a satisfactory test, I had recourse
to the following contrivance : — Ammoniacal gas, 1 had pre
viously found, may be so far desiccated .by exposure to
caustic potash as to show no traces of condensed moisture,
on the inner surface of a thin glass vessel containing               it,

                                         is
in the state of    athin film of ice.       glass globe, of the
                                              A
capacity of between two and three cubical inches, was filled
with gaseous ammonia, which was then dried               sticks of
                                                           by
pure potash, fastened to pieces of steel wire, so that they
could be withdrawn after having exerted their full action.
This point of dryness was ascertained         applying ether, or
                                               by
a   mixture of snow and salt, to the outside of the globe.
By means of a«peculiar apparatus, the gas was next strongly
electrified, and the cooling power was again applied to the
outer surface of the globe.
     In the first trials that were made with this apparatus
water certainly seemed to have been formed                 by
                                                        the elec
 trization of the alkaline gas; for the same portion of gas,
which was not affected
                                    by
                                   freezing mixture before the
                                    a
 process, gave evident signs of condensed moisture when
the cooling power was applied after long continued elec
trization.    The appearance was not only quite satisfactory
 to myself, but to Mr. Dalton, and several other chemical
 friends, to whom       I showed the experiment.        Finding,
 however, that the appearance varied as to its degree,         was
                                                                I
induced to repeat the process with redoubled precaution;
 filling the globe, previously heated, with hot mercury, and
drying, not only the quicksilver, but tlie iron cistern which
 contained   it,   byexposure to long continued heat.         The
 electrified gas now betrayed no signs of moisture on the
 application of    a temperature 20° of Fahrenheit, and gave
 only the smallest perceptible traces            cold of 0° or
                                                  by   a              a
few degrees below.         Icannot help suspecting, therefore,
 that the moisture manifested in the earlier experiments was
 derived from the mercury or from some extraneous source,
 and was not generated         by
                              the action of electricity *.

    The avidity with which ammonia retains moisture, and
again absorbs it when artificially dried, is very remarkable.
A confined quantity of common air may be completely de
siccated, in the space of a few minutes, by pure potash, or
by muriate of lime; so that no ice shall appear in the inner
surface of the containing vessel when exposed to a cold of
— 26° of Fahrenheit.               But ammonia requires exposure
during some hours to potash, to stand the test even of 0°
Fahrenheit ; and a single transfer of the dried gas, through
the mercury of a trough in ordinary use, again communi
cates moisture to it.         Muriatic acid gas, freed merely from
visible moisture, deposits no water at the temperature
of 26° Fahrenheit.          This is probably owing to its strong
affinity    for  water;    for  electricity, after the full action of
muriate of lime, evolves, as I have lately ascertained, about
l-35th its bulk of hydrogen gas; the recent muriatic acid
gas c,iving about l-14th after the same treatment*.
    From the average of a great number of experiments on
the decomposition of ammonia by electricity, I was for
some time led to believe that you had rather under-stated
the proportion of permanent gases obtainable from it by
this process (viz. 108 measures of permanent gas from 60
of ammonia, or 180 from 100). For the most part, I had
found the bulk of ammonia to be doubled by decomposi
tion, even when the gas was previously dried with extreme
care.      In one instance a small bit of dry potash was left in
the tube, along with the ammonia, during electrization,
with the view of its absorbing water, which I supposed at
that time to be generated by the process.                 In this case, 59
any water that may have been generated by electricity.         But though this
supposition may explain the non-appearance of visible moisture, it does not
account for the inefficiency of a powerful cooling cause to discover traces of
watery vapour ; for this is a test which renders apparent very minute quan
tities of water in gases.
    * In a course of experiments, which I have described in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1800, it appeared that muriatic acid gas, after being dried
by muriate of lime, gave nearly as much hydrogen by electrization as gas
which had not been thus exposed.       I was not however aware, at that time,
of the extreme caution necessary in experiments of this kind ; and was sa
tisfied with transferring the acid gas from a large vessel, in which it had
been dried, into the electrizing tube, a mode of proceeding which I now
find to be quite inadmissible. The action of muriate of lime, which has
undergone fusion, on muriatic acid gas, is rendered very sensible, when
considerable quantities are used, by the evolution of much heat, and by a
diminution of the volume of the gas.       Ammonia also is contracted in bulk
by dry caustic potash. Muriate of lime cannot be employed for its desic
cation, since this substance rapidly absorbs the alkaline gas, even when the
 gas has been previously exposed     t,o quicklime. In this case the ammonia
attracts a portion of muriatic acid from the earthy salt agreeably to the law
of affinity, which has been so ably illustrated by Berthyllet.

and 492     : 978    : :  100  :  1 98*78.    These proportions, you
will find, correspond very nearly with those long ago stated
by Berthollet *, who converted 17 measures of ammonia
by electrization into 33 measures of permanent gas, which
is at the rate of 194 from 100.              Having lately, however,
carried on the process with the observance of additional
precaution, (the mercury being first boiled in the tube, be
fore admitting the ammonia, and still remaining hot when
the gas was passed up,) I have obtained from the alkali less
than double its volume of permanent gas, viz. 280 measures
from 155, or at the rate of 1 90- 6 from 100. The varia
bleness of the first set of results arises, I believe, from the
uncertainty of the quantity of ammonia decomposed. For
if the smallest portion of moisture remain in the tube, a
little ammoniacal gas will be absorbed, and will be slowly
given out again as the electrization goes on, thus rendering
the actual quantity submitted to experiment greater than
appears.      It is probable also, from a fact which I shall af
terwards state, that mercury itself, unless when heated, may
absorb a small portion of alkaline gas.
    The proportion of the hydrogen ami nitrogen gases to
each other in the products of ammonia decomposed by
electricity, I am satisfied by recent experiments (June 1809)
is as nearly as possible what you have determined, viz.
74 measures of hydrogen gas to 26 of nitrogen.                    The
nearest" approximation I have made to these numbers is
73-75 to 26 25. Our only method of analysing mixtures
of these two gases (viz. by combustion with a redundancy
of oxygen) is not, 1 believe, sufficiently perfect to afford a
nearer coincidence.

   tion of ammonia by electricity influenced me to attempt
   the discovery of a shorter and more summary method of
  analysis.     The most obvious one was its decomposition by
   oxymuriatic acid gas; but this plan was abandoned, from
   the impossibility of confining both the gases by any one
  fluid ; since the water acts powerfully on the one, and mer
  cury on the other.         But a mixture of oxygen and ammo-
  niacal gases more than answered my expectations.                       When
  mingled in proper proportions, these gases, I have ascer
  tained, may be detonated over mercury by an electric spark,
  exactly like a mixture of vital and inflammable air ; and
  the results of the process, with due attention to the cir
  cumstances, which will soon be stated, afford an easy and
  precise method of analysing, in the space of a few minutes',
  considerable quantities of the volatile alkali.                      With a
 greater proportion of pure oxygen gas
                                                        * to ammonia than
 that of three to one, or of ammonia to oxygen than that
 of three to 1*4, the mixture ceases to be combustible.
 When the proportions best adapted to inflammation are
 used, oxygen gas may be diluted with six times its bulk of
 atmospherical air, without losing its property of burning
 ammonia.
      Atmospherical air alone does not, however, inflame with
 ammonia in any proportion that I have yet tried; though,
 by long continued electrization with air, ammonia is at
 length decomposed ; its hydrogen uniting with the oxygen
 of the air and forming water, while the nitrogen of both,
 composes a permanent residuum.                   Forty-five measures of
 ammonia beins; electrified with eighty-six of common air,
 the total 131 became 136, and 132 after being washed with
 water.      Of 1 7 "2 measures of oxygen, contained in the 86
 measures of air at the 'outset. only 2-9 were left, and these
 also would probably have disappeared                   by continuing the
 operation.      If a mixture of ammonia and atmospheric air,
each previously dried by caustic potash and then electrified,
 be examined, the production of water is made sufficiently
apparent on applying ether to the containing vessel,                         hi

    f The result of this experiment shows, moreover, that        even supposing
oxygen to be a constituent "f ammonia, we are not to expect its evolution,
in a separate form, by electricity; since, when electrified with ammoniacai
gas, oxygen gas is deprived of its elastic form, and its base is condensed into
water by union with nascent hydrogen evolved from the alkali.

374                     Experiments on Ammonia,
gen vary essentially according to the proportion of the gases
which are employed. If the oxygen gas exceed considerar-
bly the ammonia (that is, if its volume be double or up
wards) the ammonia entirely disappears, and no gases re
main, but a mixture of nitrogen with the redundant oxy
gen. The moment the detonation is completed, a dense
cloud appears*, and soon afterwards settles into a white
incrustation on the inner surface of the tube.                   The quan
tity   or  this  substance     which     is  produced    is too  minute for
analysis ; but its characters resemble those of nitrate of
ammonia, the acid ingredient of which is probably gene
rated by the action of oxygen on the nitrogen of one part
of the volatile alkali. Accordingly, when the excess of
 oxygen is removed by sulphuret of lime, the nitrogen ge
 nerallv falls short of the proportion which ought to accrue
 from a given weight of ammonia ; and hence it i6 scarcely
 possible to attain, when a considerable excess of oxygen is
 used, an accurate analysis of the volatile alkali.
     When, on the contrary, the ammonia exceeds consi
 derably the oxygen gas, no producti m of nitrous acid ap
 pears to take place; for the residue, alter detonation, is
 quite free from cloudiness.                 It is remarkable, however,
 that ammonia when fired, in certain proportions, with less
 oxygen than is required to saturate its combustible ingre<-
 dient, is nevertheless completely decomposed. Part ot its
 hydrogen is sufficient for the saturation of the oxyeen ; and
 the remaining hydrogen, and the whole nitroiien of the am
  monia, together with that existing as an impurity in the
  oxygen employed, remain in a gaseous state, and compose
  a mixture, which may be inflamed by adding a second
  quantity of oxygen gas, and passing an electric spark f.
  In this way all the hydrogen of the volatile alkali may be
  saturated with oxygen, and condensed into water; and the
  whole of the nitrogen may be obtained as the final result of
  the process.         Alter determining the amount of the oxygen,
  consumed both in the first and second combustions, it is
      •In some cases I have observed, that when the cloud does not occur im
  mediately, it maybe made to appear by agitating the quicksilver contained
  in the detonating tube. This is probably owing to the disengagement of
  some ammonia, which had lodged in the mercury.        The fact confirms what
  I have already suggested respecting the cause of the variable proportion of
  gases evolved from ammonia by electricity.
     + This is analogous to what happens when ether, alcohol, or any of the
  aeriform compounds of carbon and hydrogen, are exploded with a deficient
  proportion of oxygen ; for much of the hydrogen is found in the residuum
  in the state of gas, and again becomes susceptible of combustion after the
   addition of a second "[uantity of oxvgcn.   (See Mr. Cruickshank's excellent
   papers in the fifth volume of Nicholson's Journal, 4to.)

easy to calculate the quantity of hydrogen in the saturation
of which it    has been employed^ for, when no nitrous acid
has been formed, the hydrogen will be pretty exactly double
 in volume the oxygen which has been expended.                  ,
    These general observations will tend to render the fol
lowing experiments more intelligible.           They may be di
vided into two classes; 1st, those in which ammonia was
fired with an excessive proportion of oxygen ; and 2dly,
those in which the oxygen used in the first combustion was
insufficient, or barely adequate, to saturate the whole hy

total 67 became 34 when exploded.            Water did not pro
duce any further diminution, but sulphuret of lime left only
8 measures.      Now, 34 — 8 = 26 shows the quantity of
oxygen gas which escaped condensation ; and this, de
ducted from the original quantity (43), gives I 7 measures
for the amount of the oxygen expended.           The last number
17, being multiplied by 2, gives 34 for the hydrogen ap
parently consumed.        The final residue 8 — 1•66 (the ni
trogen   introduced    by the oxygen gas) = 6*34 is the nitro
gen   obtained  from   22$ of ammonia; and if to this the hy
drogen   be  added,   40' 34 measures of permanent gas will be
the total result.     Hence 100 measures of the gas produci
ble. from ammonia, should contain 84*29 hydrogen and
15-71 nitrogen;      numbers too remote from those, which
have been already assigned, to be considered even as ap
proximations to the truth.        The error arises from the com
bination of oxygen, during combustion, not only with the
hydrogen, but with the nitrogen of the alkali, the latter of
which consequently appears deficient, and the former pro-
portionably in excess.
   Frequent repetitions of this combustion, with a consi
derable excess of oxygen gas, continued to give a deficient
proportion of nitrogen ; and as no accurate conclusions
can be drawn from experiments of this kind; I shall pro-
seed to those   of  the second class.

                              To    Mr. Tilloch.
                                                    Bawtry,   Nov. S, 1809.
Sir, Some    years ago my attention was directed to make
observations on the leech-worm as a weathtr-glass : these
were published in The Gentleman's Magazine 1804; "since
which period I have had many opportunities of noticing
several particulars respecting them : these are here com
mitted to paper, to stimulate the curious to an inquiry into
the cause of this phaenmnenon. If these observations should
tend to the object in view, ana be worth the perusal of the
public, you will be kind enough to insert them in your
Miscellany. I am, sir,
                           Your most obedient servant,
                                                               W. Peck.
Changes    that    I have observed in the Animal before           any par
                  ticular Alteration of tlie Weather.
    1. When the leech lies motionless at the bottom of the
glass, and is frequently in a spiral form, the weather in
summer will be serene and beautiful : the same denotes
clear frosty weather in winter,
    2. If it creeps up to the top of its lodging, it will rain
within twenty-four hours in summer, and snow in winter.
   3. When the leech gallops through its limpid habitation
with swiftness, it denotes wind, and seldom rests until it
•blows hard.
   4. When the leech lodges almost constantly out of the
water, and discovers uncommon uneasiness in violent throes
and convulsive-like motions, a storm of thunder and rain
will   succeed.
                       Method      of   keeping Leeches.
    1. Put a few into an eight- ounce phial two-thirds full of
spring water, with some fine sand or moss at the bottom.
As the leeches have no other evacuation but through
the pores of the skin, which passes from them in per
spirable matter, and adheres to the body in the state of
slime, which, if not timely removed, prevents these eva
cuations, and causes the death of the worm ; the use of sand,
or moss, is that       may rub the slime off its body, which
                        it,
afterwards floats in the water.      Over the top of the phial
tiea   piece of leather pricked full of holes to admit air.
    2. The   water   must be changed once         week a   spring :
                                                            water

                    Observations          on the Leech-worm.                           3TJ
water is the best.  Sometimes it is necessary, when there
is a great change of temperature between the' water and
that contained in the phial, only to put half or two-thirds of
the fresh to the other.  Leeches should be kept in a cool
situation in summer, and a rather warm one in winter.
   3. The leeehes that have been used for bleeding should
be kept in a separate phial till they appear perfectly well.
             Directions      for      using Leeches in Bleeding.
   1. It is necessary to clean the skin from any foreign
matter * that may have been applied or adheres to             with             it,
soap and water      afterwards rub
                        :                dry with     clean cloth,
                                                     it              a
as liniments, &c. which are frequently applied in cases of
bruises, or sprains, prevent them from taking hold, and                                    if
3ny do so, they die        any part where hair grows must be
                                 :
clean shaved,    to prevent the hair from annoying them.
These are precautions ihat are necessary.
   2. When leeches are applied, the patient should be in
as horizontal     position as possible. Then take
                    a                                      wine or         a
any other glass large enough to give room for the quantity
thatit   iswished to take hold at once, being much better
than the fingers        gives the worms free motion in their
                        ;   it
circumscribed limits, retains them           their proper place,
                                                          in
and supports them from falling.          The glass should be re
clined on one side to admit       free access of air. The leeches
                                           a
should be chosen large, to answer their purposes the more
effectually.   When they seem sufficiently filled,           small             a
portion of salt should be put to their mouths, which will
cause them to fall off, being better than taking them with
the fingers, as    bruises them.

phial till well.  Every leech should have a clean plate to
disgorge itself on.
   These observations have occurred in practice ; and I am
convinced that if they' are strictly attended to, the mortality
amongst leeches will be much lessened.
   N. B. Those who wish to use a leech as a weather
glass should choose one that has not been used for bleed
ing; for after they have been used they are frequently
sickly, and will bury themselves in the sand for days to
gether.
                       LIII.       On Broom Flax.
                              To   Mr. Tilloch.
                                            Chesnut Walk, Walthamstow,
     The                                         November 23, 1809.
              inclosed specimens of the refuse and very worst
of the flax of broom      speak for themselves.
   To procure the flax of broom it is only necessary to steep
the twigs, or former year's branches (and the most vigo
rous shoots are the best) for two or three weeks, more or
less according to the heat of the season, in stagnant water ;
or to boil them for about an hour in water. This done,
the flax comes freely from the twigs ; and, where there is
not machinery for the purpose, may be easily peeled or
stripped off, by children or others, at any time when not
quite dry, in the same way as hemp is peeled from the
stalks.    And what adds to the value of the discovery, if it
may be so called,       is, that on being cleared of the flax, and
steeped   for  some   time   in boiling water, the twigs, or wood,
become tough and beautifully white, and are worth, at                    a
medium, from       a  shilling to eighteenpence per pound for
making carpet brooms, &c.
   When stripped from the twigs, the flax requires only to
be well washed in cold water, then wrung and shaken well,
and hung out to dry, previously to its being sent off to the
paper manufacturers, &c.              Professor Davy has bleached
some of  it   for me; and     I have seen    itspun.
   The discovery and my experiments respecting broom flax
have occupied the greater part of my leisure hours for se»
veral months past, and have been attended both with trouble
 and expense   ;   if
                  yet    the poor on the north side of the Tweed,
 and in Ireland, (independent of those belonging to such of
 the 9700 parishes in England as have broom in them,) are
 bettered by    the discovery,      itwill give me more real satis

faction than if I had taken out a patent and made a fortune
by it. With regard to any reward for my experiments
and trouble I am not sanguine : if it be said of me that               I
have been useful to my country, and have not lived in vain,
 I  shall be satisfied.
     As the idea of flax being furnished by broom is new,              I
have sent specimens of the flax to the Royal Society, to the
Board of Agriculture, to the Society of Arts, to the British
Museum, &c; and I have sent you the inclosed specimens,
that you may inform the public in what manner the poor,
in counties where broom is plentiful', if they want employ
ment, may find one, easy and by no means unprofitable.

     P.S. The   fibres of all kinds of mallows I find are un
commonly        beautiful ; particularly the malva sylyestris.
They are finer and prettier than camel's hair, which they
somewhat resemble; and there is no difficulty in procuring
 them.
JAV.    On Respiration. By William Allen, Esq., F.R.S.
      and William Hasledine Pepvs, Esq., F.R.S.*
One of the most prominent features in our last communi
cation was the evolution of a considerable quantity of azote,
when oxygen gas nearly pure was respired ; and although
 a considerable part of this azote must undoubtedly be at
 tributed to the residual gas in the lungs, after the most
forcible attempt at expiration, yet the fact seemed to de
mand still further investigation, it appearing of consequence
 to ascertain whether the increase of azote was uniform
throughout the latter stages of the experiment, or solely
 confined to the earlier periods.
    By adverting to our former paper, it will be found, that
in an experiment where more than 3000 cubic inches of
oxyaen passed through the lungs in seven minutes and a
quarter, 62 cubic inches of azote were found in the first
 250 cubic inches expired, though the gas originally con
tained but 2-5 per cent., or only 6 cubic inches in this
quantity ; in the two next portions expired, consisting of
562 cubic inches, we found 56 cubic inches of azote,
though this quantity of gas, before it was respired, con
tained only 14; these, first portions, were given off in about

 two minutes, and contained nearly 100 cubic inches of
 azote more than could be accounted for in the oxygen em
ployed ; hence it is plain, that a large proportion of the
increase is evolved in the first periods of the process.
   Our attention was particularly directed to this point in
the following experiment.      The oxygen, procured as usual
from hyperoxygenized muriate of potash, was found to
contain four per cent. of azote ; the experiment was con
ducted in the same manner as the preceding ones, except
that the tubes of the gasometers were filled with oxygen,
and the gas was not merely passed once through the lungs,
but breathed backwards and forwards in order to prolong                       t
the duration of the experiment, which began and ended
with a forcible expiration.     Portions of the respired gas
were preserved for examination from each of the gasome
ters, in the following order:

The portion of oxygen remaining in    the water gasometer of
the original quantity, not employed in the experiment, was

here the deficiency was greater than we had ever remarked
before ; but on passing au equal quantity of common air
from the water gasometer, and registering it in the mercu
rial ones, we were satisfied that the apparatus was quite
perfect.   It  is,
                 however, to be considered, that the respi
ration in this case was not natural, and that some small
degree of force was required when the inspirations and ex
pirations were made in the mercurial gasometers, which
renders this experiment rather different from those which
had preceded   it  and
                     ;    appears to us probable, that
                              it                        por             a
tion of air was forced into the extremities of the bronchia,
which could not be suddenly expelled by the strongest at
tempts at expiration.     Hence also, perhaps, the constant
though smaller deficiency, even when the air was only once

passed through the lungs ; but        when the process is con
tinued for  a much longer time, it is probable that the ves
sels recover their tone, and are able to expel nearly the
whole of the volume admitted.
    The air expired in the present instance being examined
in the manner described in our last paper, we found that
100 parts from each of the gasometers contained the fol
lowing proportions :

 The whole azote, found           after the -ex

Here the increase of azote appears rather greater,                  viz. 110
   * The apparent deficiency here 4-96 arises from this circumstance, that
the separate portions of oxygen not having been ascersained, this calculation
has been made with the corresponding but smaller portions of expired
gas.
                                                                        cubic

cubic inches, but the calculation in this case is made upon
the gas expired ; and, from the above statement, we may
see that the evolution of azote goes on diminishing; we
have sometimes even found, that towards the close of an
experiment it has been almost reduced to nothing.        The
question now      whether this increase of azote can be ow
                             is,
ing to the residual gas contained in the lungs at the be
ginning of the experiment, or whether      portion of oxygen                a
   not actually exchanged for azote, when pure oxygen gas
is is
   respired.
   Here     may be useful to compare the azote found in our
               it
former experiments on oxygen, with the present.

 The     greatest increase             of        azote    was       in      the 2d and 3d expe
  riments, when the thermometer was at 70°, which might
  materially influence the results in the other cases,    :      was                           it
  not higher than 53.
     From the experiments of Goodwin, we might be inclined
  to admit the capacity of the lungs, inferred from the 1st
  and 4th experiments, as very possible        but      seems diffi     ;           it
  cult to conceive that    can amount to 236 or 225 cubic
                                       it
  inches    and yet this must be the case, unless         portion of                    a

                                     it   is
  oxygen.
     Having,            by
                  the kindness of our friend Henry Cline, jun.,
  been furnished with the lungs of        stout man, about five
                                                              a
  feet ten inches high, taken from the body not long after
  death, and        sound state, we proceeded to ascertain the
                        in   a
  quantity of air contained in this organ after the most com
  plete expiration, as in death.
     Henry Cline had judiciously taken the precaution to                                                 di
  vide the trachea just below the crichoid cartilage, before he

  opened the thorax he then inserted
                                   ;                            brass   a                      a
  stop-cock, which he tied firmly      to   the   trachea, and at
  tached an empty bladder to the other end.         The cock was
  then turned, so as to communicate with the bladder, and
  on opening the thorax 31 cubic inches of air were expelled
                                            \
  into it. The weight of the lungs was four pounds one
  ounce. A very large glass jar being placed in         shallow tin                     a
                                                                                               yessel,

  384                       On Respiration* ,
 vessel, was filled to the brim with water, the lungs wef«f
 then completely immersed, and the water which flowed
 over, and was the measure of their volume, weighed si*
 pounds two ounces : we next cut a portion of the lungs
 into small pieces, under a large inverted glass of water, and
 attempted to squeeze the air from the cells; but although
 several cubic inches were thus procured, we were soon con
 vinced that it was utterlv impossible to arrive at our object
by these means, as no force that we could use seemed ca
 pable of expelling the air from the cellular membrane, into
which it escaped from the vesicles. We therefore took por
 tions of the lungs, which weighed 2774 grains; the mass
being put into a piece of new hair cloth, was subjected to
the action of a powerful screw press, and the fluid was re
ceived in a vessel ; after twice undergoing this operation,
the mass weighed only 660 grains. Its specific gravity was
very nearly that of water, viz. '930 water being I •000 : the
fluid procured by the press was of the specific gravity of
 1*019; this would make the specific gravity of the lungs
"997i water being 1-000: hence it appears, that the sub
stance of the lungs, and the contents of the blood vessels
together, are so near the specific gravity of water, that they
may be fairly considered as the same.
    Then, as the mass of the lungs was equal to 4 pounds of
water, though 6*2 pounds of water were displaced by them,
and as a pound of water occupies the space of 28 875 cubic
inches, we have the following calculation :
      lbs. oz.
        6   2   water displaced by the lungs             ,
        4   1   weight of the lungs
        2   1 , or 59- 554 cubic inches of air in the lungs, to which
mustbeadded 31-580 the volume of the air forced into the
                             bladder on opening the thorax.
                   91-134
and this gives us 91 "134 cubic inches, as the air contained
in   the lungs of this person after death; and when we re
flect that the air must have been under compression, when
the lungs were immersed in water, some iorce being re
quired to keep them down, and also that not iess than 7 or
8 cubic inches must be contained in fauces, &c, we can-
pot estimate the whole at less than 100 cubic inches.
    It is further to be noted, that these 100 cubic inches
would occupy much more space in the temperature of the
human body, than In the mean temperature in which the
examination was made ; and this difference would be nearly
                                                              8 cubic

                          On Respiration.                  385
8 cubic inches ; the air left in the lungs, after complete
expiration, would therefore be 108 cubic inches ; but the
mean of our experiments would make it 183.

 We are then almost compelled to allow that when pure
 oxygen is respired, a portion of azote is given off from the
'blood.
    We now resolved to perform a series of experiments
 upon some animal which lived wholly upon vegetable food,
 and made choice of the Guinea pig as one of the most ma
nageable.
    The apparatus consisted of our two large mercurial gaso
meters, which were made to communicate with a strong
 trough E, in the middle of which a small mahogany table D
was made fast by a screw, for the purpose of supporting the
animal under the bell-glass A; two holes were made through
the table for the insertion of tubes to supply and take off
the air, each of them communicated with one of the mer
curial gasometers ; the tube B delivered gas towards the
upper part of the glass A, in order to bring the supply of
fresh air near the head of the animal : the opening of the
tube C was placed within half an inch of the table to con
vey off the respired air; the gasometer connected with this
tube was made to communicate with a mercurial bath G,
in which portions of the respired air were preserved for ex
amination.     Quicksilver being poured into the trough E,
so as to rise to a level with the top of the mahogany stand,
we placed a Guinea pig upon       it,with the bell-glass over
him, and as its edges were immersed in quicksilver, the
animal was completely confined in atmospheric air we   :
found that his body occupied the space of 39 cubic inches,
which deducted from the cubic contents of the glass A, left
55 cubic inches for the air confined with the pig, to which
must be added    5 more for that contained in the tube C.
           First Experiment with Atmospheric Air.
  The pig   was placed   upon the stand, and the apparatus
arranged   as   represented in the plate :250 cubic inches of

atmospheric air were admitted into the mercurial gasometer
communicating with B : the gasometer communicating with
C was quite empty, the apparatus being tried was found
perfectly air tight, and the whole quantity of air 310 cubic
inches.
   The cocks H and I being opened, gentle pressure was
made upon the glass of gasometer B, so as to cause the air
to pass through A, which consequently drove an equal por
tion through the tube C into the empty gasometer; a quar
ter of an hour was employed in passing the gas, which
measured exactly 250 cubic inches in C, so that there was
no alteration of volume; the cocks H and I were now
closed, and the respired air being examined by the usual
methods, 100 parts were found to contain
                              5 carbonic acid

As    the air after the experiment had experienced                 no altera
tion of volume, and as it contained the same proportion of
azote as atmospheric air, this substance had remained un
altered. But 15-50 cubic inches of oxygen had been con
verted into carbonic acid gas.

I.  A wrought-iron moveable Caisson with a Rudder, for
   Docking a Ship, while riding at her Moorings, in any
   Depth      Water, leaving her Keel dry in
                 of                             Jew Hours,                     a
   without removing her Stores or Masts.
     "This floating dock     made of wrought-iron,
                                        is           half an
inch thick, 220 feet long, 54 feet wide, and 30 feet deep,
and will weigh about 400 tons, with     flanch six feet wide    a
on the top, Tor the workmen to stand upon, and also to
strengthen the caisson.
     "
     The weight of this caisson, when immersed        water,                           in
is nearly 350  tons;  but, for reasons mentioned   below,
                                              Bb        2                                         is it

388           Inventions for the Improvement of
is rendered nearly buoyant, being surrounded by an air re
ceptacle capable of suspending the whole weight with great
exactness, which is riveted to it in such a manner as also
 to strengthen the caisson, and support the principal shores
 from the ship.
     " This caisson draws nine feet water. When taken to
the ship intended to be docked, the water is to be let into
it at an opening or plug-hole at the bottom, and it is to be
 suffered to sink until the upper part is even with the surface
 of the water, the air receptacle still keeping it buoyant.
 A small quantity of air is then to be discharged by opening
 a plug-hole in the air receptacle, until a quantity of water is
 let in just sufficient to sink the caisson, which is to be then
 drawn under the ship's bottom.          This being effected, the
 caisson (nearly buoyant) is then to be raised to the surface
 of the water by ropes made fast from the caisson to each
 quarter of the ship. A pump placed within the caisson, and
 worked by a steam-engine of 12-horse power, placed in a
 barge alongside, will empty it in tliree hours, and reduce
 the ship's draught of water eight feet ; that     is, from 26 to
  18 feet ;   when she may be carried up into shoal water, the
 caisson floating with      adraft of only 18 feet of water, while
 the ship she carries would have required 56 feet.        She may
 then be carried into shoal water,          required, or alongside
                                           if
 wharfs, or jetty-heads of the dock-yards.
      " The ship's sides and bottom tending to fall outwards,
 by its own weight, and the sides and hottom of the caisson
 tending to be forced inwards,        by the external   pressure of
 the water,    is
              it   obvious that  by   placing props or shores, be
 tween, both will be supported, while the ship will ride with
 all her stores on board and masts standing, nearly as easy
  as when floating in the water.
      " Should inconvenience be apprehended at any time from
 blowing weather, the caisson may be cast off, and let fall
  to the bottom, where cannot be injured, and from whence
                            it
it   may be raised to the ship's bottom again at pleasure, with
  as little labour as weighing an anchor.
      " The upper part of this dock will be 12 feet above water
 when there        is  first-rate ship in it; this
                        a                           is   asufficient
 height    to prevent the  sea breaking over.
     " By this means ship may have her bottom examined,
                            a
  and be out again in six hours, without coming above the
  Nore, and without undergoing the tedious process of un
  shipping and re-shipping her stores, or waiting for spring-
  fides, pr fair wind, to enable her to reach to, or return
                                                             from,

                      Naval Architecture,  &c.                389
from, dock, which, on an average, now requires three
months, accompanied with an expense of nearly 10,000/.
per month in wages, subsistence, &c. &c.
    '* This
              plan may be practised in all countries, and must
be particularly advantageous where there are no dry docks
or flowing of tide.
    " Ships on many foreign stations when requiring to be
docked are now obliged to be sent home, at a great expense
of money and waste of time, others being sent to replace
them. This may be avoided in future. Docks made in
England may be sent out in pieces of five or six tous with
the necessary rivets and bolts, and ready to be put together
wherever they may be wanted.
     " A caisson capable of docking a first-rate ship will not
cost above nineteen or twenty thousand pounds, (for mer
chantmen and smaller ships, the size and cost will be pro-
portionably less,) and (judging from the duration of
wrought-iron salt-pans) will last 20 years without repair.
When worn out it may be broken up, and will sell for one-
third of its original cost.
     " By adapting caissons to the local circumstances, ships
of war and merchantmen with all their stores and cargoes
on board, can be carried to wharfs and store-houses up
rivers where the depth of water is not above one half the
ship's draught : For example, in the river Clyde the ships
may be carried to Glasgow, instead of being obliged to 'un
load twenty miles lower down the river."
II.    Improved System      for  Tmuing Ships,   Floating Docks
                              or Caissons.
    "   This subject,    as  connected with   naval affairs, pos
sesses much importance.
     " It   will readily occur that there are many instances on
record where objects of the first magnitude might have been
gained by the help of an improved system of towing ves
sels,    particularly when entering or leaving harbour.       But
although the system about to be explained is perfectly
applicable to general purposes, it was chiefly with the view
of rendering our floating dock complete in all its appen
dages, that we were induced to direct our attention to the
subject.
     if With respect to the general application of the system
of towing, it will occur, that an apparatus of this descrip
tion ought to attend every naval expedition.           It will of
course be useful in towing ships into action in light winds,
in bringing off disabled vessels, and also in propelling fire-

390         Improvements   in Naval Architecture,  &c.
ships against wind and tide after the crew have abandoned
them ; while, by the same contrivance, the look-out ships
of a squadron, or packet-boats, will be enabled to enter or
leave harbour in spite of wind and tide.        But as those in
terested   in  the  adoption  of such  improvements need not
be informed       of their manifold  advantages, we shall con
fine ourselves to a brief description oi our towing ap
paratus.
    "  The employment of steam-engines for this purpose
has no novelty ; but, however competent this agent in other
 respects, it has generally failed in this branch of its appli
cation, not from its own incompetency, but from a defect
in the communication required between the power and the
water upon which it is desjtined to act ; and from not con
sidering that a power insufficient to move a vessel with
others in tow, may be sufficient to move them alternately,
that is to say, first the vessel containing the engine, and
 then, by the communicating rope, the vessels which the
 first-mentioned vessel has to move.
    " A    steam-engine of fifty tons weight on board a barge,
 or ship, will tow with much greater power and effect, while
 only impelling a vessel forward by the action of the engine
 against the water, than a thousand men can do with sweeps.
 But if the same engine is applied lo wind up a rope, made
 fast to. buoys, anchors, or any other fixture, the power can
 be increased to any extent, at the expense of a loss of tim$
 merely equal to the effect gained.
    " Many of the naval harbours in England are so situ
 ated that it is a fair wind to go to sea with, when perhaps
 it blows directly into the harbour's mouth. By the placing
 of buoys, at about 400 yards distance from each other, this
 difficulty may be overcome : w ith an engine of the above
 description, men of war and transports might be towed out
 clear of the harbour in a short time.
     " This may be effected in the' following simple manner:
 — The steam-engine will drive itself in the barge to the first
 buoy, where it will be made fast, at the same time paying
 out about 400 yards of tow-rope, or less, as the case may
 require, one end being fast to the ship to be taken in tow,
 the other being fastened to a capstern, to be moved round
 by the power of the engine. . This movement brings the
 ship up to the first buoy, where it is made fast, when the
 engine with the barge starts afresh to the next buoy, and
 ¦o on until the ship or ships in tow arrive at the outer buoy.
 In situations where there are no buoys, anchors may be
  dropped, and speedily weighed again by means of the steam-
                                                         engine ;

cessary.     Generally the power of the engine will be found
 quite  sufficient.

right hon. Sir Joseph Banks, president, in the chair.                       It

   Nov. 16. — Alexander Marsden, esq., vice-president, in
the chair. The Croonian Lecture on muscular motion,                          by
Dr. Wollaston, was read. Dr. W., perceiving that his re
marks were rather unconnected to form regular essay,
                                                   a                        di
vided his lecture into three parts; the first on the duration
of muscular action. This he attempted to ascertain bv
pressing his finger on his ear, till  resembled the sound of
                                              it
carriages passing along     pavement
                                 a     of stones about four
inches in diameter.    These vibrations he found to vary ac
cording to the pressure from 15, which were the least, to 45,
the most; but the general number he found to be 30 in                        a
minute.    He afterwards endeavoured to imitate the sound
of carriages    by
                 rubbing two notched sticks against each
other, and experienced nearly the same results.     Some of

    i                      Royal Society.                    395
his friends repeated these experiments with the like effect.
The   second part was on the cause of sea- sickness, which
the lecturer attributed to the pressure of blood upon the
brain ; and observed that the sickness was always most vio
lent when the vessel pitched most, or rather at the moment
when she descends from the wave on which she had been
elevated.      In this case respiration is difficult ; but when
effected,   it  assists the circulation, and gives relief to the
sickness. The stomach he also found to be slightly de
ranged, probably from the same cause, or from the action
of the system to resist the effects of the unnatural motion
of the vessel. The third and last part illustrated the ad
vantages of riding on horseback and in carriages, which
enables the system to propel the blood from the heart.
Dr. W. related a case of a gentieman, who, finding him
self very ill, ordered his coachman to drive him to the resi
dence of a fashionable physician; who fortunately happened
not to be at home; he then resolved on driving to another,
who also happened to be absent : by this time he had con
siderably recovered from his depression, and determined on
going home, and taking the same exercise next day, which
he did, and speedily recovered without any aid from flrugs.
   The reading of the Bakerian Lecture on some new elec
tro-chemical researches on metallic bodies, and on the
combinations of hydrogen, by Mr. Davy, commenced
November 10, and was continued on the 23d, and the con
clusion postponed to a future meeting.
   Mr. Davy stated his objects in delivering this lecture, to
be the elucidation of various important parts of chemistry
by new experiments, and the communication of some new
facts respecting metallic bodies, and their combinations in
timately related to the general philosophical theory of the
science. In the first section he discussed the various hypo
thetical notions that had been formed respecting the metals
of the fixed alkalis, particularly those of MM. Gay-Lussac
and Thenard, M. Curadau, and M. Ritter.              He brought
forward many experiments to prove that potassium and
sodium, by combustion, produce merely dry potash and
soda ; and that they neither form water nor carbonic acid;
and he establishes the fact, that the potash formed by the
combustion of potassium in muriatic acid gas contains less
water than that which is considered by M. Berthollet as the
dry alkali.      He showed that when potassium is made to
act uporj ammonia, it is the volatile alkali, and not the
metal, which is decompounded, for the potassium can, under
                                                          certain

  certain circumstances, be recovered unaltered ; and when
 ever a portion of it is converted into potash some nitrogen
 always disappears.
                      — The discussion concerning the nature
 of nitrogen he reserved for the conclusion of the lecture.
 His general inference from the experiments in this section
 was, " that potassium and sodium can with no more pro
 priety be considered as compounds than any of the anciently
 known metals, and that they belong to the same order of
 substances."
    In the course of his investigation Mr. Davy described &
 new and curious gas composed of tellurium and hydrogen,
 which is soluble in water, which combines with the alkalis,
 and has the characters of a weak acid : a new fact added to
 those already known concerning sulphuretted hydrogen,
against the idea of oxygen being the acidifying principle.
                   SOCIETY OP ANTiaUARIES,
    This Society met at the same time and on the same
 evening as the Royal Society.      A curious paper by Doctor
Willan, on " New Fire," was read, detailing the process
of igniting wood by friction, and the superstitious customs
of the Northern nations in preserving such fire unextin
guished ; with many incidental particulars of ancient man
ners and customs connected with this ceremony.             Some
letters from Sir C. Cornwallis, when at the court of
Spain as minister to James I., were also read ; but they
contained little that was either very novel or very interesting
respecting the manners of that country.       The ceremony of
the bull-feasts has been often described, and is already suf
ficiently known.

                         To  Mr. Tilloch.               \
Sir, Having       lately had occasion, for a particular purpose,
to ascertain  the probable number of plants that have been
described, it may perhaps save some of your botanical
readers, who, like me, know of no other mode of satisfying
their curiosity than by counting the number of species in
the most complete enumeration published, the pain of un
dergoing a like tedious process, if     I put on record in your
excellent publication the result of my labour.

           Poisonous Effects   of Champignons, &c.          395
   The method     T  adopted was to extend upon a sheet of
paper the number    of  species of all the genera enumerated
by Dr. Turton in his translation of Gmelin's edition of the
Systema Nature, and then to add them together.            I used
this work as far as the class Gynandria, because it seems to
contain all Willdenow's species, with some additions. Gy
nandria and Moncecia I extracted from Willdenow's first
      of his fourth volume, which was not published when
  >r. Turton's work came out : the remaining classes were
Eart
taken from Dr. Turton.        From this examination I found
that in these works are described 2046 genera, and 19,803
species, of plants; of which 638 genera have but one spe
cies, 263 but two, 174 but three, and 124 but four.
    I  consider this enumeration, however, but as an ap
proximation to the truth.      Willdenow's work must be de
fective, and I conceive Gmelin to be particularly so in the
Cryptogamia class. Probably we should not be far from
the truth if we call the number of described plants 22,000.
The first edition of Linnaeus's Species Plantarum contained
only 7,300 species. — I am, sir,

 Nov. 14, 1808.                                    BOTANICUS.
            POISONOUS EFFECTS OF CHAMPIGNONS.
    A  family, consisting of the father, mother, and daughter,
 died last month in the commune of Portels, in France, from
 the effects of eating champignons, which they procured
 from an old woman who was in the regular habit of col
 lecting them for sale. The old woman herself, although
 she had used a great quantity of the same kind of cham
 pignons as food for several meals, escaped all disagreeable
 effects.   It was found, upon inquiry, that she was intoxi-
 ca ed with sour wine at all her meals, and the effect of ve
 getable acids in counteracting narcotic poisons is well known.
 It is somewhat singular that the persons who died, and the
 inhabitants of the place where they lived, concurred in
 assuring the medical attendants that they had repeatedly
 used the same species of mushrooms as food in former sea
 sons, but without any bad effects.      The French naturalists
 have suggested that the insalubrious state of the atmosphere
 during last autumn may have given the poisonous qualities
 to the champignons in question.
                    MEDICAL FUMIGATIONS.
    The French journals lately received contain various re-
 ports.from different parts of the continent on the subject
                                                               of

896     Medical Fumigations. — Remedy for Tapeworm.
of Guyton de Morveau's antiseptic process.          In Poland
the oxygenized muriatic acid fumigations were resorted to
in the military hospitals with the greatest effect: not only
were various putrid effluvia dispelled in this manner, but
the vermin of all descriptions with which the patients were
infested were extirpated. M. de Laborde, chief physician
in the marine department at Antwerp, on the 18th of Oc
tober 1808, communicates the following account to M. de
Morveau : — " During the raging of the present epidemy,
which suddenly attacked a great number of persons, we
were under the necessity of bringing the patients from the
  alleys into the usual hospitals.     In one hall, which was
f adly  aired, and   where  numerous   cases of dysentery and
ataxic fevers corrupted the air, I had recourse to the oxy
genized fumigations, and succeeded in preventing the con
tagion from spreading; the last-mentioned patients them
selves were not even attacked.      Finally, in a ward where
there were forty or fifty severe cases of dysentery, a form
under which several ataxic quotidian fevers are concealed,
and which are very prevalent at this season of the year, a
few fumigations were sufficient to banish the bad smell,
and no disgust was occasioned."         [The same process is
adopted (in preference to Dr. Carmichael Smith's) on board
the squadron in the Scheldt ; it is also used in the various
naval hospitals ; and sometimes great advantages are derived
by directing these fumigations on putrid, gangrenous, or
atonic ulcers, by means of a funnel.]
                 REMEDY     FOR TAPEWORM.
    Common spirits of turpentine have been recently admi
nistered by several medical gentlemen of the metropolis,
with great effect, in the cure of tapeworm.         The doses
given were in some cases so large as two ounces ; but those
of half an ounce at a time, repeated twice a day, were ge
nerally found to answer the purpose of expelling the whole,
or at least 'the greater part of the animal, at one discharge.
The vehicle in which the turpentine was administered was
generally honey.
                         To Mr. Tilloch.                       ,
    Sir, — It is a fact known to most good housewives, and
should be known to all, that if they begin to grate a nut
meg from the stalk end it will prove hollow throughout,
whereas if the same nutmeg had been grated from the other
end it would have proved solid and sound to the last. The
reason of this appears to be, that the centre of a nutmeg
                                                       consists

                       Nutmegs.   — Optical Illusion.            397
cqnsists of a number of fibres issuing from the stalk, and
its continuation through the centre of the fruit, the other
ends of which fibres, though closely surrounded and pressed
by the fruit, do not adhere to it ; the consequence is, that
when the stalk is grated away, those fibres having lost their
hold, they insensibly drop out, and the nutmeg appears
hollow ; and as more of the stalk is grated away, others of
them drop out in succession, and the hollow continues
through the whole nut ; whereas by beginning to grate at
the other end, the fibres above mentioned are grated off at
their core end with the surrounding fruit, and they do not
drop out and cause a hole. The want of knowing this has
caused many excellent nutmegs to be condemned as da
maged fruit, and others, of perhaps less value, to be com
mended, according as accident or caprice caused them to
be grated from the stalk, or top end.              And here I beg to
mention, that, the oil of nutmegs being of great value, it
has often been extracted from the nuts which are exposed
to sale, whereby they are rendered of very little value ; and
the way to know good nutmegs is to force a pin into them,
when, if good, however dry they may appear, the oil will
be seen to ooze out all round the pin, by the compression
 occasioned in the surrounding parts by its being forced in.

                              To  Mr. Tilloch.
     Sir, — Having        lately, sometimes, had occasion to walk
 on different parts of the banks of the Thames when the tide
 was full, I observed objects much better -on the other side
 than when it was ebb ; and that cattle, houses, trees, &c. in
 the meadows, as well as the meadows themselves, that did
 not appear at all when the tide was ebb, seemed, when it
 was full, to be raised up very considerably.            Has any of
 your correspondents observed             this with regard to the
 Thames, or any other river, where the meadows behind the
 banks are in many parts lower than the surface of the river
 when the tide is full ? And if so, could they explain the
 physical cause, or principle in optics, on which it depends ?
                                    I am, sir, yours, &c.

 LIX.     Description of a Rotative Steam Engine, the Piston
    of  which   makes a complete Revolution at a Distance from
    tlie revolving Axis.     Invented by Mr. Samuel Clegg,
    of  Manchester.
IVIany      attempts hav% been made to. produce a rotative
 motion by means of steam, without deriving it from, or
 making use of, the rectilinear motion of the piston in the
common or reciprocating engine. For this end steam
 wheels and other contrivances have been resorted to, but
 hitherto with little effect, owing to loss of steam, or to an
increase of friction produced by the means employed to
 prevent this waste.      Still a rotative steam engine appeared
 to promise go many advantages,         could it be well accom
plished, that some engineers continued to apply their
 thoughts to the subject, and Mr. Clegg announces that he
has succeeded in producing a simple and effective engine
of this kind, for which he has obtained a patent. This
 engine has no outward movements except the revolving
 shaft, which occupies the centre and works through a stuff
 ing box in a cistern of water M ; and which being the
 only opening into the engine prevents the entrance of all
 air excepting what is. contained in the water used for in
jection. The steam pipe is at P, and the air pump is within
 the condensing vessel.       The following is a description of
 the engine :     See plates XIII and XI v.
    Fig. 1 is the underside of a circular piece of cast iron,
 and of a diameter and thickness proportioned to the size'of
 the engine.     I is the common centre of the different circles
 shown on this piece.         With any convenient radius less
 than that of A A describe the circle CC, and within the
 latter the circles D D and EE — the radius of the latter
 being the least of those now named. From the uses of
 these parts, which will be immediately described, an idea
 of their relative dimensions will readily be inferred.
    Let that part of the surface A B, A B which is contained
 between the circles A and C be plain. Between the circles
 C and D sink a circular groove CD of any given depth ;
 and between the circles D and E let another circular groove
 be cut of the breadth D E, and of any given depth less than
 that of the groove C D. Let the remaining part of the
 surface A B, namely, that included between E and B, be
 cut down to any depth less than the depth of the groove
 DE.
     Into the groove C D let such      a  number of segments of a

circle b» fitted as shall form a complete circle, excepting
the spare   LL,    which is occupied by adjusting screws, or
springs to keep the segments close together. The segments
are the breadth (or nearly) of the groove CD, and of a
depth less than the depth of the groove C D.          Those sides
of them which apply to each other are to be ground to
gether plain, and air-tight if possible.        Their under sur
faces, which     are  shown  in   fig. 1., are to be flat, so that
the whole may form one complete plain surface, excepting
the Space before mentioned, which is taken up by adjust
ing screws or springs           LL,
                                  which screws or springs are
placed  so   far  below  the  surface   as to let a roller pass by
them, which will be mentioned hereafter.
    Figs. 2 and 5 represent vertical sections of the plate and
grooves of fig. 1, resting upon a circular chamber or hol
low space Y Y, to which chamber the said plate forms a
light covering, excepting that space occupied by the springs
or screws    LL   as before mentioned.
    I, the centre of all the grooves and circles before described,
is also the centre of the shaft. On the shaft I is fastened
a plate or coupling ZZ, in which is inserted a bar F. This
bar may be of any given breadth, but in depth must be less
than the depth to which the circle E B was cut down below
the surface A 13.     To this bar is attached a wheel or roller
G, shown in fig. 3 upon a larger scale. The manner in
which it is attached to the bar F is also there seen, and it
is so attached to it that the top of the wheel or roller O
 shall always be higher than the top of the bar F. The
wheel G being attached to the bar F will, when the
bar is made to revolve, describe a circular path H H H
 along the plain surface of the segments before described.
 Let that portion of the plain surface of each segment which
 answers to the path of the roller G be rounded off, in such
 a manner as to make that portion of the surface an arc of a
 circle, the convex circumference of which is presented to
 the roller G.      In fig. 3, at H is shown a perpendicular
 view of one of the segments, rounded off in the manner
 described, and presenting its convex circumference to the
 roller G. There may likewise be another roller attached
 to the bar behind        it,to lower down the segments in the
 same manner in which they are raised              by
                                                   the first roller.
 Now   it   is obvious, all the said segments being           in
                                                               their
 places in the groove CD fig.         1,that the roller G, in per
 forming    a revolution round the centre      I,must travel along
a    series of convex arcs of circles equal in number to the
 number of segments in the groove          CD. The groove D E

                Description          of a      Rotat ive Steam Engine.           403
 is in fact     a recess        in           groove CD, and may, if
                                     the deeper
 necessary,         be filled   with hemp and tallow, or any other
  material which may answer the purpose intended.
      It must be remembered that fig. 1 is a view of the un
  derside of this machinery. Figs. 2 and 5 are sections of                       it,

  upon      aflat facing       O. Each segment projects over the

is   the rounded surface for the roller to lift them.

  segments are all in their places, they complete the semi
 circular chamber, and fit so close on their seats and in the
    roove, that were the chamber to be filled with any elastic
    uid, they would prevent its escape (or nearly), excepting
  where the space           left for the springs or adjusting screws.

   The preceding particulars are drawn from Mr. Clegg's
specification of his invention. For the following, by which
we are enabled to make our readers acquainted with all the
parts of a steam engine on this construction, but which
being, in some respects, common to all steam engines,
were not specified, we are indebted to the patentee, who,
on being asked, communicated them with the greatest
readiness, and also the drawings from which the engravings
have been made.

 that there is only the friction of the blocks to overcome.
 Supposing the pressure upon the piston to be 800lb., the
 weight of all the blocks will be about 500lb. for such a
 sized piston, and will seldom exceed more for the largest
 engines, as the space for the bar to pass will be nearly the
 same in all, the strength of the bar depending upon its
 breadth, not on its thickness : thus 800lb. will move
 through the space of 16 feet, whilst 500lb. goes through
-the space of half an inch: then, if the descending of the
 blocks is taken into consideration as before described, the
 friction of the blocks will make no sensible difference to the
 progress of the piston.

  II.   Furtlur Inquiries   respecting    Sulphur and Phosphorus.
I    have stated, in the last Bakerian Lecture, that hydrogen
is  produced from sulphur and phosphorus in such quanti
ties,    Voltaic electricity, that
        by                            cannot well be considered
                                        it
as an accidental ingredient in these bodies.      have likewise
                                                        I
stated, that when potassium        made to act upon them, the
                                   is
sulphurets and phosphurcts evolve less hydrogen in the
form of compound inflammable gas          the action of an acid,

state, and from this circumstance       have ventured to infer,
                                             1
that they may contain oxygen.
    On the idea that sulphur and phosphorus are deprived of
some of their oxygen by potassium,          would follow, that
                                                  it

406                   New analytical Researches
   With the view of examining the nature of the substances,
separated by the action of muriatic acid upon the sulphurets
and phosphurets of potassium, I combined a few grains of
sulphur and phosphorus with one-fourth of their weight
of potassium, and exposed the compounds to the action of
a strong solution of muriatic acid.  As in the former cases,
less inflammable gas was produced than would have been
afforded by equal quantities of the uncombined potassium,
and considerable quantities of solid matter separated from
both compounds, which, after being washed, were col
lected in a filter.
     The      substance   which separated from the sulphuret was
of a dark gray colour*,        and   was harsh to the touch ; it had
no taste, and    at common       temperatures no smell ; but when
heated, it   emitted   the  peculiar odour of sulphur.          Its spe
cific gravity  was   rather  less  than that of sulphur.    It softened
at a low heat, so as to be moulded like wax between the
fingers.    It was a non-conductor of electricity. When
heated upon a surface of glass, it soon fused, entered into
ebullition, took fire, and burnt with the same light-blue
flame as sulphur. . A small particle of            it,
                                                   made to combine
with silver, presented the same phenomena as sulphur.
   The substance from the phosphuret was of an amber
colour, and opaque.             could not be examined
                               It                             in the air,

                               it                         aloose pow

                              it                 took fire, and burnt
                                                it

naphtha,       was found to differ from phosphorus, in being
                it
much deeper coloured, perfectly opaque, and very brittle.
Its fusibility was nearly the same, and, like common phos
phorus,       was perfectly non-conducting.
               it
   In experiments upon the union of potassium with sulphur
and phosphorus the heat           so intense, that when larger
                                    is
quantities than      few grains are used, the glass tubes are
                      a
uniformly fused or broken in pieces, and in consequence                   I
have not been able to operate upon such        scale, as to make
                                                     a
an accurate examination of the substances just described,
anvi to determine the quantity of oxygen they absorb in
being converted into acid.      Metallic vessels of course can
not be employed but       ; intend to try tubes of porcelain, in
                              I
a further investigation of the subject.
    It   evident that the sulphur and phosphorus, separated
         is
in these processes, are not in their common state and the     ;
phenomena would certainly incline one to believe that they
     • Possibly this colour may have been produced by the decomposition    of
a   film of soap of naphtha adhering to the potassium.
                                                                          are

                         It may, know, be said, that it is
 possible that they are merely combined with more hydrogen,
 and that the sulphur in this state is analogous tothehydro-
 genated sulphur of Berthollet, and to the alcohol of sulphur
of Lampadius.
      But when I decompounded dry sulphuret of potash by mu
 riatic acid, of the same kind as had been used for decom
 pounding the sulphuret of potassium, the substance produced
 seemed to be merely in that form, .in which, according to
  the able researches of Dr. Thomson, it is combined with
 water; and notwithstanding the ingenious experiments of
 M. A. Berthollet and M. Robiquet*, the nature of the
 substance produced during the passage of sulphur over ig
 nited charcoal is far from being fully ascertained.       In a
 series of experiments, which my brother Mr. John Davy
 had the goodness to undertake, at my request, in the labo
 ratory of the Royal Institution, on the action of sulphur
 on charcoal, the products were found to be very different,
 according as the charcoal employed differed in its nature.
 Tn an instance, in which imperfectly made charcoal was
 employed, the liquor that passed over left by combustion a
 residuum that had all the properties of carbonaceous matter ;
 which agrees with the observations of MM. Desormes and
 Clement ; but when the charcoal had been well burnt, there
was no such residuum produced.          It was found, that the
 same charcoal might be employed in a number of processes
 till it was nearly entirely consumed, and that the sulphur,
 not rendered liquid, might be used for several operations.
In all cases mixtures off sulphuretted hydrogen gas and
 hydrocarbonate were evolved.
     I particularly examined a specimen of the liquor which
had been obtained in the last process from charcoal that had
been often used. It was a non-conductor of electricity, and,
when the Voltaic spark was taken in              it,
                                            did not evolve gas
with more rapidity than sulphur; and this gas proved to be
sulphuretted hydrogen.
    Supposing the liquor to contain hydrogen              in
                                                   considerable
quantities,  I   conceived that   must be decors posed

fluid similar to the sulphuretted muriatic acid   though when

oxygen than in its common state.       This idea has likewise

   The charcoal, which had been made with great care, was
preserved for     quarter of an hour in
                  a                           state of ignition, in

vided carbonaceous matter, collected in an arborescent state
upon the platina wire to which the charcoal was attached.
The gas had increased            volume one-sixth
                                    in                 but this was
                                                            ;
owing to the evolution of carburetted inflammable gas
from the charcoal the nitrogen was unchanged in quantity,
                        ;
and, as far as my examination could go, in quality.             The
points of the charcoal where the heat had been intense,
were rather harder than before the experiment.
 I    have mentioned, page 102           J,
                                        that charcoal, even when

after exhaustion of the globe. They were preserved, for
nearly an hour, in intense ignition, by the same means that
had been employed in the experiment on nitrogen. At first,
white fumes arose, probably principally from the formation
of common muriatic acid gas, by the action of the hydro
gen of the charcoal upon the oxymuriatic acid, and the
combination of the gas so produced, with aqueous vapour
in the globe ; but this effect soon ceased.     At the end of
the process, the oxymuriatic acid gas was found unaltered
in its properties, and copper leaf burnt in it with a vivid
 light.   The charcoal did not perceptibly differ from the
 charcoal that had been exposed to nitrogen.         My view in
making this experiment, was to ascertain whether some
new combination of carbonaceous matter with oxygen
 might not be formed in the process, and I hoped likewise
 to be able to free charcoal entirely from combined hydrogen,
 and from alkaline and earthy matter, supposing they ex
isted in     it,
              not fully combined with oxygen.       That hydro
 gen  must  have  separated in the experiment,       not possible

       IV. FurtJier  Inquiries respecting Muriatic Acid.
   The experiments on muriatic acid, which have already     I
had the honour of laying before the Society, show ihat
the ideas which had been formerly entertained respecting
                                                                                 '
the difference between the muriatic acid and the oxymu
riatic acid are not correct. They prove that muriatic acid
gas is   compound of substance, wnich as yet has never
         a                  a
been procured in an uncombined state, and from one-third
to one-fourth of water, and that oxymuriatic acid        com          is
posed of the same substance (free from water) united to
oxygen.     They likewise prove, that when bodies are oxi
dated in muriatic acid gas,         it         by
                                          decomposition of the
                                         is         a
water contained in that substance, and when they are oxi
dated in oxymuriatic acid,           it        by
                                         combination with the
                                          is
oxygen   in  that body, and   in  both  cases there   always     is          a
union of the peculiar unknown subsjance, the dry muriatic
acid with the oxidated body.
   • Charcoal, over which
                              sulphur has been passed, as in the experiments
page 407, as has been shown by M. A. Bert bullet, contains sulphur, and
this find after being heated to whiteness such charcoal
   I                                          ;              is
                                                             a    conductor of
electricity, and does not differ in its external properties from common char-

   410            New analytical Researches,           &c.
       Of all known substances belonging to the class of acids,
   the dry muriatic acid is that which seems to possess the
   strongest and most extensive powers of combination.                 It
   unites with all acid matters that have been experimented
   upon, except carbonic acid, and with all oxides (including
   water), and all inflammable substances that have been tried,
   except those which appear to be elementary, carbonaceous
   matter and the metals ; and should its basis ever be sepa
   rated in the pure form, it will probably be one of the most
   powerful agents in chemistry.
      I have lately made several new attempts to procure un-
   combined dry muriatic acid ; but they have been all un
   successful.
      I heated intensely, in an iron tube, silex in a very mi
  nute state of division, and muriate of soda that had been
  fused ; but there was not the smallest quantity of gas evolved.
   In this case, the silcx had been ignited to whiteness be
  fore it was used; but when silex in its common state was
  employed, or when aqueous vapour wes passed over a mix
  ture of dry silex and dry salt in a porcelain tube, muriatic
  acid gas was developed with great rapidity.
      I have stated, page 79*, that a sublimate is formed by
  the combustion of the olive-coloured oxide of boracium in
  oxymuriatic acid. On the idea thaf this might be boracic
  acid, and that dry muriatic acid might be separated in the
  process, I examined the circumstances of the experiment ;
  but I found the sublimate to be a compound of boracic and,
  muriatic acid, similar to the compound of muriatic and
  phosphoric acid.
      I heated freshly-sublimed muriate of ammonia with po-
. tassium ; when the quantities were equal,             as much hydro
  gen gas   was  developed   as  is generated by     the action of water
  on potassium ; much ammonia was evolved, and muriate
  of potash formed ; when the potassium was to the muriate
  as 4 to 1, less hydrogen appeared, and a triple compound
  of muriatic acid, ammonia, and potassium, or its protoxide
  was formed, which was of a dark-gray colour, and gave
  ammonia and muriate of potash by the action of water.
  There was not the slightest indication of the decomposi
  tion of the acid in the experiment.            The process in which
  this decomposition may be most reasonably conceived to
  take place, is in the combustion of potassium in the phos-
  phuretted    muriatic acid, deprived by simple distillation
  with potassium of as much phosphorus as possible. I am

LXI.  Account of certain Colours dug up at Pompeia.
  Read to the National Institute ihe 6th of March 1S09.
  By M. Chaptal*.
Her     majesty the empress and queen did me the honour
to present me with seven specimens of colours found in the
shop of a colour merchant at Pompeia.
   No. 1. seems to have received no preparation from hu
man art ; it is a greenish and saponaceous argil, such as
nature exhibits in several parts of the globe ; it is analogous
with terra Veronica.
   No. 2. is an ochre of a fine yellow, which has been
cleansed by washing, as still practised, from all the prin
ciples which might injure its fineness or purity.   As this
substance becomes red when calcined in a moderate heat,
the yellow colour, which it has preserved without any alte
ration, furnishes us with a new proof that the ashes which
covered Pompeia were not very hot.                       \
   No. 3. is a reddish-brown of the same nature with what
is now used in commerce, and employed for the coarse
reddish  paint applied to casks in sea ports, and on the
doors, windows, and railings, belonging to some houses.
This colour is produced by the calcination of the yellow
ochre already mentioned.
   No. 4. is a pumice-stone, very light and white; its tex
ture is fine and serrated.
   The three remaining packets contained compound co-
Jours, which     I
                 was obliged to submit to analysis in order to
discover their constituent principles.
   The first of these three, being No. 5, is a fine rich and
deep blue ; it is in small pieces similar in form.   The ex
terior of the pieces is paler than the interior, which is
brighter than the finest Saunders blue.
   The muriatic, nitric, and sulphuric acids make a slight
effervescence with this colour ; they seem to brighten                   it,
even after a  long ebullition   the oxygenized muriatic acid
                                    :
has no action on it.
   This colour has therefore no connection with ultrama
rine, which      is
                  destroyed         by
                                 these acids, as observed                 by
Messrs. Clement and Desormes.

    412     Account           of certain    Cobours dug up at Pompeia.
       Ammonia has no action on it. When exposed to the
    flame of the blow- pipe, it becomes black, and forms a Jritie
    of a reddish-brown colour, by the prolonged action of the
    flame. When melted by the blow-pipe with borax, it gives
    a greenish-blue glass.
       When treated with potash           on a platina saucer, it pro
    duces   a  greenish   fritte,   which    first becomes brown, and
    ends in assuming the metallic colour of copper. This fritte
    partly dissolves in water : the muriatic acid when poured
    into the solution forms an abundant flaky precipitate, and
    the liquor, when decanted from above the first precipitate,
    furnishes a considerable additional quantity with oxalate of
    ammonia.
        The nitric acid dissolves with effervescence the residue
    left undissolved by the alkali ; the solution is coloured
    green. Ammonia forms a precipitate in                   which    it,
                                                                       re-       it
                                         excess, and the solution then
                                            it
    dissolves when we pour                  in
    becomes blue.
        This colour therefore seems to be composed of oxide of                         ,
    copper, lime, and alumine               resembles Saunders blue in

                                            a
    or rather   atrue fritte.
        The process           by
                          which the ancients obtained this colour
    seems to be now lost          all that we know, from consulting
                                        :
     the annals of the arts,                is,
                                        that the use of this colour      of       is
    a   more ancient date than the destruction of Pompeia.
    M. Descostils has remarked lively shining and glass blue
                                                  a
     on the hieroglyphical paintings of an Egyptian ,monument,
     and he ascertained that this colour was owing to the pre
     sence of copper.
        Setting out from the nature of the constituent principles
     of this colour, we can compare            to nothing so well as the
                                                            it
v    Saunders blue of the moderns             when we consider
                                                       :              with   it
    respect to its utility in the arts, we may with advantage
     oppose     itto ultramarine and azure, particularly since
     M. Thenard has made known                  preparation of the latter,
                                                            a
     which admits of its being employed with oil. But modern
     Saunders blue has neither the lustre nor the solidity of co
     lour conspicuous in that of the ancients while azure and    ;
     ultramarine are much higher in price than              composition
                                                                     a
     the three elements of which are of little value.               would   It
     therefore be of some importance to discover the processes
     by  which this bine colour was prepared.

whitish grains.       Analysis has discovered the same prin
ciples  in  it as   in  the preceding ; we may consider il as a
composition    of   the  same nature in which lime and alumine
are in stronger proportions.
   No. 7. has a fine rose tint ; it is soft to the touch; is
reduced between the fingers to an impalpable powder, and
leaves on the skin an agreeable rose»colour.
   When exposed to heat, this colour becomes at first black,
and ends in white. It gives out no perceptible smell of am
monia.
   The muriatic acid dissolves it with a slight effervescence:
ammonia produces in the solution a flaky precipitate, which
potash redissolves entirely.
   The infusion of gall-nuts and hydrosulphuret of am
monia did not denote the presence of any metal.
   We may therefore regard this red colour as a true lac, in
which the colouring principle is founded upon alumine. In
properties, shade, and in the nature of the colouring prin
ciple, it has an almost perfect analogy with the madder lac
which I have mentioned in my treatise on dyeing cotton.
The preservation of this lac for nineteen centuries without
any perceptible alteration, is a phenomenon which must
astonish chemists.
   Such is the nature of the colours presented to me by the
empress : they seem to have been destined for painting :
nevertheless,     if we examine the varnish of the Roman
earthen-ware, of which we find such immense quantities
wherever the Roman armies have been, we shall be .con
vinced that most of the earths in question have been em
ployed in forming the varnish with which these pieces of
earihen-ware are covered.
   In fact, the greater part of these earthen-wares is covered
with a red coating which has nothing vitreous in           it,and
which may have been given, either with yellow ochre, or
with the reddish-brown kind, reduced         by bruising to fine
                                                            a
paste,   incorporated     with
                            a    mucilaginous,   gummy, or oily
body, and applied with      a     pencil.  M. d'Arcet, who has
written      very ingenious work on the Roman potteries,
                                                                  a is

dirty red colour, and the surface has been covered with the
coating above mentioned.           We observe in   it   the place
where the potter has left off covering it; and we perceive
on the bottom, which       is    not coated, red streaks, which
the workman had laid on, in order to clean his pencil, or
to try the colour.
  It   is   by
             no means rare to find other vases, the body of
                                                           which

which is of a different colour from that of the red coating
which covers the surface.
    Perhaps the Romans even made use of saline fluxes to
facilitate the baking of the coverings of their earthen- ware.
    M. d'Arcet has completely imitated the white covering
of the Etruscan vases by employing a shining white argil,
with which he mixes a^twentieth part of borax.
    It should seem that the Romans were not acquainted, in
the first century of the Christian aera, with the metallic
fluxes for fixing and vitrifying the coverings of their earth
en-ware : at least the analysis of the coverings of Etruscan
vases, and of red, white, or brown earthen -ware, gave no
indications of metal either to M. d'Arcet or myself.         It
was only in later periods that the sulphurets of copper and
of lead, as well as the oxides of this last metal, were em
ployed.     We sometimes indeed find, these metallic cover
ings on some vases that have been dug up, but their manu
facture does not seem to me to have been posterior to the
aera when the Romans occupied Gaul : for all those which.
I examined, and the origin of which is evidently prior to
these first periods, presented no trace of copper or lead on
analysis.
    Sometimes the black colour alone presents characters of
Titrification.   I have seen several specimens of ancient
earthen-ware, in which this is indubitable; and I have
 always thought that the vitreous lava formed the basis of
 these coverings, the fusion of which, naturally easy, was
 aided by the mixture of saline fluxes.       I published my
 work on this subject twenty-five years ago : M. Fourmy
 has made a successful application of my discoveries in his
 manufacture at Paris, and M. d'Arcei. has added his expe
 rience to mine.
    To conclude : the earthen-ware of 1"le Romans, particu
 larly their Etruscan vases, have been baked in a much lower
 heat than that which we now employ : we mav estimate
 the former at the seventh or eighth degree of Wedgwood's
 pyrometer: and at this degree of heat, as proved by M.
 d'Arcet, we cannot employ the oxides of lead, which pe
 netrate the clay, and leave the colour on the surface with
 out any brUliancy.
     We are, without doubt, far superior to the ancients in
 the art of the potter.    The numerous metallic oxides suc
 cessively discovered, have furnished us with the means of
 enriching our potteries with a variety of colours as brilliant
 as they are durable, at the same time that a better assorted
 mixture of the earths has admitted of our adding the greatest
                                                      hardness

hardness to an almost absolute infusibility : but the Etrus
can vases will always be in request, in consequence of the
beauty, elegance, and regularity of their forms ; and every
thing connected with the history and arts of the Roman
people must be interesting to the progress of industry.

The      pig hitherto employed was put into the glass vessel
 A,   which with the tube contained 60 cubic inches of at
mospheric air; 250 cubic inches of oxygen, containing
 3 per cent. of azote, were admitted into the gasometer
 communicating with B, and during a quarter4 of an hour
 were made to pass slowly through the vessel in which the
 animal was confined, to the empty gasometer communicating
 with C, where it measured exactly 250 cubic inches ; a
 portion was preserved in the mercurial bath for examina
 tion, and the gasometer B was replenished with 250 cubic
 inches of the same oxygen ; this was passed in about the
 same time as before, through A into gasometer C, when
 it measured 248 cubic inches.
     250 cubic inches more of the oxygen were now admitted
 into gasometer B, and passed in the same manner through
 A into C, where they measured 249.
    The gasometer B was for the fourth and last time sup
 plied with 250 cubic inches more of the oxygen, which were
 passed as before, through A into C, during about a quarter
  of an hour, and then measured 249.
    The pig had remained in the vessel one hour and twelve
  minutes ; it did not appear to have suffered in the least.;
  portions of the respired gas were saved from each of the
  gasometers, and examined as usual.

   In this experiment we employed a smaller pig, which oc
cupied the space of 33 cubic inches, and our object was to
keep him for the same length of time in a smaller quantity
of gas; we therefore only used 750 cubic inches of oxygen,
beside the common air contained in the glass A, and tube,
amounting to 66 cubic inches; the first 250 cubic inches
were passed through the glass A into C in 24 minutes,
where it appeared to have undergone no alteration of volume.
250 cubic inches more were passed during the next 23
minutes, and these measured 248 in C; the last 250 were
passed in 24 minutes, and the volume remained unaltered.
The animal did not appear to suffer the slightest incon
venience, except from the confinement.

 The quantity of       azote added, of oxygen missing, and of
  carbonic acid formed, were smaller than in the last experi
  ment ; but the animal in this instance was smaller, as well
  as the quantity of oxygen passed through in a given time.
     In this case, as in the human subject, the increase of
 azote takes place principallv in the early periods. The
 whole azote contained in the 66 cubic inches, confined
  with the pig, was only 52*14; but supposing, which per
 haps was not the case, that the 66 of common air were
 expelled by the first 250 cubic inches of oxygen, we
 should have 250
           less    66
                  1 84 of oxygen,
 containing    5  per cent. azote, or 9*20 cubic inches : these
 added to the 52*14, would make 6 1*34 of azote to be found
 in the first gasometer of respired gas, but we detected 75,
 so that even on this supposition 13*66 of azote were added
 in the first twenty-four minutes.
    The azote contained in the second gasometer before re
 spiration, was 12*50 cubic inches, but after it had been
 respired for twenty-three minutes, we found 23*75, or an
 increase of 11*25 azote.        The azote contained in the third
 gasometer,     before  respiration, was, as before, 12*50 cubic
 inches ; but after it had been respired for twenty-four
 minutes, we found 20, or an increase of 7*50 azote.
    The azote contained in the 66 cubic inches was 3*30,
 but we found 5-28, or an increase of 1*98 azote.
    From the results of these experiments, it seemed that
when the usual proportion of azote was not present in the
gas respired, there was a disposition in the blood to give
out a certain quantity in exchange for an equal veluroe of
oxygen, and we resolved to try, whether this circumstance
would occur when hydrogen was substituted for azote ; we
accordingly made a mixture containing 22 percent. oxygen
and 78 hydrogen.                        „
            Experiment 6.      Hydrogen and Oxygen.
    The pig employed in the last experiment was placed
upon the stand in the glass A, with 66 cubic inches of
common air as usual.
    250 cubic inches of the mixture were passed from the
gasometer communicating with B, through the glass A into
the gasometer communicating with C, during sixteen mi
nutes. The animal did not appear uneasy : a second quan
tity of 250 cubic inches was passed in seventeen minutes

and three quarters   : the animal did  not seem to be in the
least incommoded.
    A  third quantity of 250 cubic inches was passed, in about
sixteen minutes.
    And a fourth quantity of 250 cubic inches in eleven mi
 nutes and three quarters ; but during this time the animal
 became very sleepy, and towards the end of the experiment
kept his eyes constantly shut ; he, however, appeared to
 suffer nothing, and was easily roused for a short time by
 rapping at the side of the glass.    At the end of sixty-one
minutes and a half he was taken out, and we found that
 during this time he had produced 60*20 cubic inches of
 carbonic acid gas, or rather less than one cubic inch in a
minute.
    It appears, that less carbonic acid was evolved in this in
 stance in a given time, than when oxygen was respired,
 but some circumstances occurred to prevent us from dis
 covering what change the azote had experienced : thispoint
 was, i however, decided by the following experiment.
            Experiment       Hydrogen and Oxygen.
    Having mixed hydrogen and oxygen gases in such pro
 portion as that the oxygen should rather exceed the quan
 tity contained in atmospheric air, wc placed the same ani
 mal in the glass A with 66 cubic inches of atmospheric air.
 240 cubic inches of the mixture were admitted into gaso
 meter B, from the large water gasometer, and gradually
 passed through the glass A into gasometer C, during fifteen
 minutes.     The pig did not appear uneasy, and the respired
 gas measured 250 in C : a portion of this was preserved for
 examination, which we shall call No. 1.
     250 cubic inches more of the mixture were admitted in
 to B, and gradually passed, as before, during thirteen mi
 nutes ; it measured 250 in C; and a portion No. 2 was
 preserved for examination.
    The animal did not seem to suffer any inconvenience.
  250 cubic inches more of the mixture were admitted into B,
 and gradually passed, as before, through A into C during
  seventeen minutes.     The animal now became quite sleepy,
  but did not appear to-suffer any thing.   He was taken out
 at the end of forty minutes.
     At the close of the experiment, the remains of the mix
  ture, which had stood about an hour in the large water
  gasometer,   being examined, was found to contain 22 per
  cent. of oxygen and no carbonic acid; of the residual 78
  parts, 20 were mixed with 10 of oxygen, which had been
                                                     previously

previously found to contain 3 per cent. azote ; these 30
parts being detonated in Davy's improved Volta's eudiome
ter, by the electric spark, were reduced to 3 parts, and
these 3 parts being treated with the tests for oxygen, were
reduced to 2 parts, a proof that all the hydrogen had been
consumtd; but the 10 parts of oxygen contained 0-3 of
azote  ; this deducted from 2, leaves 1*7 for the azote con
tained in 20 parts of the residuum 78.

   100 parts, subjected to the action of lime water in Pepys's
eudiometer, were reduced to 93•5, and this by the tests for
oxygen was further diminished to 77 : 20 parts of this 77,
mixed with 10 of oxygen and detonated, the residuum
treated with the tests for oxygen,             left 12 parts which were

The 66 remaining with the animal         at the close    of the ex
periment,   may be considered        as very nearly    the same as
No. 3.
   In this, as in the former experiment, we observed that
the evolution of carbonic acid was greatest at the middle of
the time, but was considerably diminished toward the end,
as the pig became sleepy ; it is not improbable,           therefore,
that during sleep le3s carbonic acid is evolved than when
the animal is exercising all its faculties.
   When atmospheric air alone is respired, we have uni
formly found, that the carbonic acid evolved, added to the
oxygen remaining, exactly equalled the oxygen existing in
the air before it was respired, but in the present instance it
was one per cent. more, a circumstance           which we are at
present unable to account for, but it was constantly th«
case in all the three trials.

   From the foregoing statement we are enabled to ascer
tain the quantities of azote, both before and after the ex
periment.

proportion of azote evolved was greater in the early than in
theY later Vpffrioiii. and it becomes interesting to contrast them :

   The quantity of carbonic acid evolved in 45 minutes wa«
therefore 53*96 cubic inches, or at the rate of 1*19 cubic
inches per minute.
   The foregoing experiments seem to prove,
   1. That when atmospheric air alone is respired,       even by
an animal subsisting     wholly upon vegetables, no other
change takes place in                 it,
                            than the substitution of      certain                 a
portion of carbonic acid gas, for an equal volume of oxygen.
   2. That when nearly pure oxygen gas         respired,     por    is                a
tion of      missing at the end of the experiment, and its

                                 a
than in ihe later periods.
   3. That the same thing takes place when an animal                                         is
made to breathe      mixture of hvdrogen and oxygen, in
                             a

     These experiments have been conducted without refe
  rence to any particular theory, and indeed some of the re
  sults were so contrary to our preconceived opinions, that
  we have been induced to bestow more thpji ordinary atten-
s tion on the subject.      Confident, however, that all those
  who repeat the experiments with the same care will arrive
  at the same results, we shall rest satisfied with stating the
  facts, not without a hope that those brilliant discoveries of
  Professor Davy, which have already given us new views of
  the operations of nature, will in their progress furnish us
  with that explanation which it is in vain to expect at pre
  sent.              ,
     Azote or nitrogen, for instance, has been considered as a
  simple or elementary substance; it is recognised, however,
  principally by negative properties.     A very gaseous fluid
  which will not support life or combustion, which is not
  absorbed by water, nor acted upon by the tests for oxygen,
  nor capable of being detonated with oxygen gas, is generally
  pronounced    to be azote : it is the constant residuum in
  almost all our experiments upon gases, but who shall say
  whether this residuum is a simple substance or a com
  pound   ? ,
     The experiment of Professor Berzelius leads us to sus
  pect it of metallic properties ; and those of Davy make it
  probable that it is an oxidated body; the snoject is still un
  der discussion.     But we may fairly indulge more than a
  hope that the ardent zeal and well-directed labours of the
  philosophers just mentioned will throw a new and impor
  tant light upon this obscure and difficult subject.

  LXIII.   Description of certain Inventions for the Improve
    ment  of Naval Architecture, for increasing the Comforts
    of Mariners, and for facilitating Naval Enterprises. By
    Messrs. R. Trevithick and R. Dickinson.
                       [Continued from p. 391.]
 In our last   Number we gave the advantages proposed to be
 derived from Messrs. Trevithick and Dickinson's improved
 system of towing ships, 8tc, by employing for this pur
 pose the power of a steam engine, but without attempting
 to specify how they propose to apply this power. They men
tion two methods, both of them ingenious. — One of them
 is by employing a revolving wheel furnished with leaves
 to lay hold of the water, and worked by the steam engine.
At first sight there appears no novelty in this idea, but the
way in which they dispose of their wheel is perfectly diffe
rent from any thing we have hitherto met with. It is placed
in an air-tight receptacle open only at the bottom, in which
 the height that the water is permitted to rise (or, in other
 words, the depth of the dip of the wheel) is perfectly under
 the command of an air pump worked by the engine. Their
second method, and which we would prefer, is as follows:
    A wheel, or a sufficient portion of a wheel, to which an
arm of considerable length is attached, receives an alter
nating motion by being worked into by a rack on the pis
ton rod of the engine.         The arm just mentioned is em
ployed to give motion to a valve or valves included in a
hollow trunk or prism attached to, or actually contained
in, the vessel, placed longitudinally, and made of a size
suited to the effect that is desired.     The power of this ap
plication will be easily conceived from the following con
siderations :-»-When the stroke of an oar, or any similar
implement, is made against water for the purpose of ob
taining a reaction as nearly as may be similar to that of the
resistance of an immoveable body, part of the force is lost
in producing a lateral motion in the water, which escapes
sideways, and the blade of the oar is far from being sta
tionary.    If the oar were to pass in a channel or groove to
which it fitted, and of such a length as to present a long
prism of water before the oar which could no otherwise
move than by passing out of the channel, it is demonstra
ble that the mass of the said prism of water may be assumed
of such a magnitude as to render the actual motion of the
oar by a given force, and during a given time, less than
any assignable quantity.       Now this is precisely the princi-

             Improvement      in Naval Architecture, &c.                    427
pie of which Messrs. Trevithick and Dickinson have availed
themselves.         Their valve or valves are attached to a rod in
the hollow trunk, which rod being connected with the arm
of the steam engine receives a reciprocating motion like a
piston, and thus opens and shuts the valves alternately.                       If
the hollow trunk be of sufficient dimensions, it is evident
that its contents will have so much inertia or resistance as
to receive but little velocity from the piston, and that the
surplus power must carry the vessel forward in an opposite
direction.
     If the hollow trunk be made moveable and attached to
the rowing arm, and there be a stop within, of the nature
of    a valve,    to shut     against the stroke and open with the
return, the effect will        be the same as with the former ar
rangement, but the machinery would probably be more
cumbrous and apt to get out of repair.
 III.    Sliding    tubular Masts, made of Iron, and so con
    structed     that the upper ones slide into the lower, in a
    Manner somewhat like a Pocket Telescope.
    "   A hollow iron mast of the thickness of half an inch,
 and of the same height and diameter as a wooden mast,
 will be much lighter, considerably stronger, much more
 durable, less liable to be injured by shot, and can be easily
 repaired, even at sea.          It will weigh only 12 tons, and at
 45/. per ton will not cost more than 540/., while its
 strength will be nearly fifty per cent. over that of a wooden
 mast that weighs 23 tons, and costs nearly 1,200/.
     ** This mast is made to strike
                                              nearly as low as the deck,
 to ease the ship in a heavy sea — Wooden masts are, in
 such circumstances,           obliged to be cut away. Ships fur
 nished with these masts will not, like others, be exposed
 to the risk of receiving damage from lightning.                      The iron
 mast being itself an excellent conductor, by using an iron
 bolt from the bottom of the mast, through the kelson and
 the keel, the electric matter will be conducted throligh the
 bottom of the ship into the water, without injury to the
  ship.
      "  Yards and bowsprits may also be made of wrought
 iron,    at the same proportion of strength and expense as
 the mast.         Chain shrouds and stays made of iron * may
    * Since this prospectus was first circulated (Feb. 10, 1809,) "we hare
 learnt that the idea of employing iron rigging lias actually been carried into
 effect by a Lieut. Brown ; and a vessel rigged in this manner, but with wooden
  masts, 5s now to be seen in the West India Dock.      The first proposal, how
  ever, that we have heai d of for using metal in rigging was from Mr. Tilloch,
 in the year 1801. Phil. Ma;j, vol.    «i.   p. 108.

also be used with those masts, and will not cost half the ex
pense of rope, while they will also prove ten times more du
rable. For many other purposes in shipping, wrought iron,
employed as a substitute for the materials now in use, would
have as great advantages as in the articles above mentioned.
Even the whole hull may be made of wrought iron.
IV. Preparation of Ship       Timbers,    and improved   System
                          of Building.
   "  For a long period the only means employed to effect
the bending of ships' planks was by exposing them to the
heat of open fires, and in most parts of Europe this is still
the practice.    As hitherto conducted, it has been found to
be a tedious slovenly process, attended with a great expense
of fuel, and unequal in its effects, some parts being only
partially heated, while others are burnt.
   "  Another system was therefore resorted to, that of em
ploying steam ; and it must be allowed that this mode of
bending has been found to answer so far as the interest of
the ship-builder is concerned ; but the ship-owners have
suffered from its effects.   It is possible by means of steam
to give the required degree of flexibility to planks ; but steam
of a degree of temperature high enough to destroy the ve
getable sap cannot be confined in vessels of any reasonable
strength. Wood so treated has been found liable to sudden
decay : nor is this, which is an important objection, the
only one to which steaming is liable.          When planks be
yond a certain thickness are- bent in this way, they are
found to be injured from the temperature being too low to
give the required flexibility ; and, owing to the want of a
better method, the curving of strong timbers has hitherto
been impracticable.
   "  It is well known that the decay of a ship originates
and takes place in the timbers and inside the planks, by
their being precluded from a free circulation of air to eva
porate the natural vegetable sap of the wood.
   "  The process now recommended is for heating both
planks and timbers, without steam, and in such a manner
that they may be enveloped and equally surrounded on all
sides with hot air and smoke ; the coal tar contained in the
latter entering at the same time the pores of the wood, and
acting as a feeder.    This process is so conducted as to pre
vent the wood from being burnt by it : all the air that
reaches the timbers, while under process, being previously
fbliged to pass through the fire^ and being, by that means»
                                                        degrired

            Improvement   in Naval Architecture, &fc.        42Q
 deprived    of its oxygen, or that principle which maintains
 combustion, no burning can take place.
     " The means employed to effect this are horizontal cur
 vilinear flues, made or cast iron, adapted to the forms in
 tended to be given to the wood, and furnished with a
 powerful, but simple, apparatus for applying the force re
 quisite to bend the timbers into the required form.
      " By this process even timbers of large dimensions can
 be bent to almost any shape.      They are heated throughout
 their whole length and substance, without alternations of
 temperature in the different parts, as when exposed to open
 fires.                   /
      " By this process the necessity of procuring bent timbers
 is done away ; while, at the same time, that loss which is
 incurred by cutting; straight or ill-shaped timbers into pro
 per forms, is avoided, and that weakness which results
 from cutting cross the grain and from scarfing is obviated.
      " By this process also there will be a saving of that waste
 of time which is necessary, in the ordinary process of ship
 building, for seasoning, as it is called ; and, which is of
 great importance, much of the labour now bestowed on
 trimming and chipping, to give form both to straight and
 crooked timbers, will be avoided, while the natural strength
 of the pieces will be left unimpaired.
      " The preparation of ship timbers, as above described,
 applies to the system now in use, in which the framing
 consists of pieces of wood, bent by nature, and brought
 into form by sawing and chipping. The pieces to which
 we allude are known by the name of ribs, and much of the
 strength of the present structure of ships is attributed to
.them.
      " But strange as it must appear to those who have never
 once started a question on the subject, the ribs give but
  little strength, comparatively, and we propose to discard,
 almost entirely, from ship-building those pieces called ribs,
  and to present to our country a system infinitely preferable
 in point of strength, cheapness of construction, durability,
  and the facility with which the requisite materials may be
 obtained.
      "  We beg to premise, that the principal defect of the
  present method lies in this : —The ribs owe what stability
  they possess in the structure entirely to the connexion they
 have with the beams, planks, and lining, liaving but little
  of their own. Their stability depends on the structure of the
 planks with which they are covered, and which are attached
  to them within and without. They afford little or no direct
                                                          support

430         Improvements in Naval Architecture,      &c.
 support to enchl other ; and hence the facility with which
 the ship hreaks in two, when by any accident the middle is
 grounded, while the stem and stern are in deep water. The
reason is obvious : in such a case there is nothing to bear
 the strain but the keel, the planks, and lining. In fact, the
 ship receives a disposition to break from the moment she is
launched; for the middle of the ship displaces a greater
 quantity of water, foot for foot of the keel, than either of
 the ends, and, of course, performs the office of a floating
fulcrum, acted upon by the gravity of the ends. This evil
cannot be removed while the present form is retained ; but
the ship may be strengthened in her structure, to enable
her the better to resist that tendency.
    "  A ship, as at present constructed, consists of the ribs,
and of the inside and outside planks, the planks crossing
the ribs nearly at right angles.     It is a threefold structure,
in which, using round numbers, the outside planks occupy
 ith, the ribs §, and the inside planks |thof the thickness.
    "   Now it might be demonstrated, were that necessary,
that if the space now occupied by the ribs was supplied by
a double row of planks, bent into the required curves,
 placed in the same order as the ribs, and so disposed that
the joinings of each row respectively should be covered by
the solid parts of the other, that then a stronger structure
would be obtained than results from the present method of
 a single row of ribs.     In adopting the method just men
 tioned, straight-grained planks of the greatest lengths might
 be used, and consequently       the numerous scarvings and
joinings of the present system be almost entirely done away.
The advantages to be hence derived, in point of strength,
 and facility of obtaining proper materials, are obvious.
    " But though the above would be a great improvement,
 it falls infinitely short of the perfection to be obtained by
 employing the very same materials in a still more scientific
 manner.
    "   We have already proposed to substitute two rows of
 bent planks for the present ribs ; but there is no necessity
 that these should, as in the present system, be at right
 angles to the outside planks and the lining.      To obtain the
 greatest possible degree of strength from the same quantity
 of materials, the bent planks, employed as substitutes for
 ribs, should cross each other at the keel, and consequently
 up the sides of the ship, at such an angle as to form with
 each other, at the points of intersection,        a kind of lo
  zenge.     By such an arrangement, each row crossing the
 other at an angle — the one as it rises from the keel taking
                                                               an

an angle forward, (say of 50° or 55°) and the other a like
angle aft, they exert their strength in different directions,
and the whole are made to act as a combination of so many
diagonal spurs giving strength and solidity to the structure.
   " A slight examination will be sufficient to convince
any person, habituated in investigating       questions con
nected with the strength and ceconomy of materials in sci
entific mechanism,     that a ship so constructed must be,
at least, twice as strong as one built according to the plan
in common use. Nor is this all ! When a ship of the com
mon construction starts a plank, by labouring in a heavy
sea, nine times out of ten she founders; but one built on
this plan, in such an event would still be a safe bottom ;
the crossing of the rib-planks preventing the admission of
water in such quantity as to be beyond the power of mode
rate pumping to keep under.
   " To insist on the advantages in point of oeconomy, and
the diminished number of joinings, from being enabled to
employ straight-grained planks, at all times to be obtained
with comparative ease, and of considerable lengths, would
be to insult those to whose consideration our System of im
proved Ship-building is submitted. Were this adopted, there
would be no need to send persons abroad to buy timber ;
our own forests are sufficient to supply us with the straight
timbers for 100 years to come, and at half of the expense,
during which time more would be growing.

LXIV. Of   the Action of Vegetable Acids on Alcohol, both
  with and without the Intermedium of the Mineral Acids.
  By M. Thenard. Read at the Institute on the 23d of
   November 1807        *.
Scheele is the only chemist who has hitherto employed
himself on the question which is the subject of this paper.
At first he was convinced that neither the acetic, benzoic,
tartaric, citric, nor succinic acid formed ether with pure
alcohol : afterwards,  wishing to ascertain if those acids
were susceptible of producing              it,
                                   with alcohol and the mi
neral acids sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic, he made for
this purpose various experiments, from which he has con
cluded   t,
   1st. That the acetic acid and             alcohol       form, with one of

                                                                                 the

432      Of the Action of   Vegetable Acids on Alcohol.
the three preceding mineral acids, an ether which is easily-
decomposed by potash, and which contains acetic acid.
    2d. That the benzoic acid and alcohol produce with the
muriatic acid a kind of oil heavier than water, which may,
like the acetic ether, be decomposed by potash, and which
has the benzoic acid tor one or its principal ingredients.
    3d. Lastly, that he obtained no particular product by
treating the tartaiic, citric^ or succinic acid, dissolved in
alcohol, with either the sulphuric, nitric, or muriatic acid.
    Thus it was known to Schcele that the acetic ether con
tains acetic acid, and that the oil of benzoin contains ben
zoic acid ; but he was not acquainted with the other prin
ciples of which they are composed, nor did he understand
the action of alcohol and the mineral acids in the for
mation of these compound species. From that alone we
may conceive that, had he drawn some conclusions from
his experiments relative to the formation of these com
pounds, he would have admitted in the acetic ether and oil
of benzoin," a vegetable acid, as well as the mineral acid
and alcohol employed, or have considered them only as
new bodies derived from the alcohol decomposed by the
mineral acid; or as new bodies and the mineral acid itself.
   This triple hypothesis is sufficient proof that the experi
ments which gave birth to it are incomplete ; it was ne
cessary therefore to repeat them, which 1 have done with
so much the less trouble, as they are immediately connected
with those experiments I have been engaged in upon ethers,
which not only presented me with very singular results,
but also promise to be of great importance.
   In the division of my researches I have followed the ex
ample of Scheele, examining in succession the action of
the pure vegetable acids on good rectified alcohol, and of
the same acids mixed with the mineral ones.
   Almost all the vegetable acids dissolve in alcohol, and
separate again from it by distillation, without affording any
particular results, however often the same portion of al
cohol is distilled from the same portion of acid : this I
know to be the case with the tartaric, citric, malic, ben
zoic, oxalic, and gallic acids ; and I have not the least
doubt, although I have not made the experiments, .but that
the suberic, succinic, mucic, pyro- tartaric, moric, and
honigstic acid, are in this respect similar.    But it is very
different with the acetic acid.      Its action upon alcohol is
such, that by means of many distillations both bodies dis
appear and form a true ether : hence I conclude, that this
probably is the only one, of all the vegetable acids hitherto
                                                       kno wn,

          Of the Action of Vegetable Acids on Alcohol.     433
known, which can present us this or any analogous phe
nomenon.
    But when, instead of placing the vegetable acids in con
tact with the alcohol, they are put at the same time in con
tact with this liquid and one of the mineral acids, strong
and concentrated new combinations of very remarkable na
tures may be formed with all of them, as the following
experiments are intended to show.
    Experiment I. — I took 30 grammes of benzoic acid dis
solved in 60 grammes of alcohol, I introduced the solution
into a tubulated retort, and added 15 grammes of concen
trated muriatic acid; then having adapted a tubulated bal
loon to the neck of the retort, and a bent tube to the tu-
bulure of the balloon, I commenced the distillation, and
6topped it when nearly two-thirds over.
    Durinir, the whole experiment no gas, but common air
and slight traces of muriatic acid were disengaged.        The
first portions of the product distilled consisted solelv of al
cohol ; but the last contained a peculiar kind of matter se
parable from the alcohol by water : there was much of it
in the bottom of the retort, where it had been condensed
by the cold ; and as it was covered by a mixture of alcohol,
water, muriatic and benzoic acids, I purified it by de-
cantation, and by washing it with warm water, in which
it was very slightly soluble.      Thus purified, it was of a
yellowish colour, rather heavier than water, pungent, fu
sible from the temperature of 25 to 30, volatile nearly at
 80, acid, oily, almost insoluble in cold water, less in boil
ing water, from which it precipitated itself on cooling,
and very soluble in alcohol, from which water separated it.
It evidently contained the benzoic acid, for to this acid it
owed its property of reddening tincture of turnsole. Neu
tralized by an alkaline solution it was white, and always
sharp and odorous ; it constantly showed most of the pre
ceding properties, and was generally perfectly liquid at the
ordinary temperature : lastly, when long agitated in a so
lution of caustic potash, it disappeared without emitting any
gas ; and the solution examined, presented no traces of
muriatic acid, and nothing absolutely but benzoic acid and
alcohol could be recovered.
    This matter then which presents itself to us in an oily
 state, in which apparently there is no acid, is formed by
 a peculiar combination of alcohol and benzoic acid ; yet it
 can be obtained neither by repeatedly distilling together
 benzoic acid and alcohol, neither by precipitating by water
 the benzoic acid from its solution in alcohol, nor by
    Vol. 34. No. 140. Dec. 1809.           Ee          strongly

  strongly concentrating       this solution aod allowing it lo pur
  sue    its natural course.     Thus5 though muriatic acid is not
  one    of  the constituents   of this singular body, and although
  the two bodies which form it are in each other's presence,
  yet it cannot be produced without the assistance of the
  acid ; which result, extraordinary           as it may appear, is
  nevertheless of the greatest authenticity, as we shall pre
  sently endeavour to show : but first let us be satisfied
  whether the other vegetable acids are similar to the benzoic
  in their action on alcohol.
       Experiment II. — Having made a solution of 30 grammes
  of oxalic acid in 36 grains of alcohol, and added 10
  grammes of concentrated sulphuric acid, the mixture was
  distilled until sulphuric ether began to be formed; it passed
  into the receiver like alcohol slightly etherized, and it left
  in the retort a brownish liquor of great acidity, which, on
  cooling, subsided like crystals of oxalic acid i but when
   water was diffused over this liquid, a substance separated
'
   similar to that given by the benzoic acid, slightly soluble
   in water, produced in a pretty large quantity, and capable
   of being purified by washing with cold water, and by abs
   tracting, by means of a little alkali, the excess of acid re
   tained.     Treating in the same manner the citric and malic
   acids, results precisely similar were obtained.        The three
   substances procured from these three acids resemble each
   other in some of their properties : all are of a yellowish
   hue, rather heavier than water, destitute of smell, percep
   tibly soluble in water, and very soluble in alcohol, from
    which water precipitates them. In taste they differ : that
    procured from the oxalic acid is slightly astringent, that
   from the citric very bitter, but what taste the other has
    I  do not know.       The first is volatile; it is rather more
    so than water; by this means it is easily made white.           It
    was particularly interesting to acquire an intimate know
    ledge of the nature of all three. I was inclined to believe that
    their decomposition       might be effected by distillation in a
    solution of caustic pota.-h, and that the first would afford
    me oxalic acid, the second citric, and the third malic ; that
    all. would give me alcohol, and be free from sulphuric
    acid : the facts were according to my expectations.         Here
    then we possess new combinations of the vegetable acids
    and alcohol, in the formation of which the sulphuric acid
    has performed the same part as the muriatic did in the pre
    ceding experiments.
        After this, it became very probable that the other vege
     table acids acted towards alcohol in the same manner as
                                      1
                                                                  the

the preceding ; yet to be quite certain I resolved to submit
Some of them to a rigorous trial, and for the purpose t
made choice of the gallic, tartaric, and acetic acids, the other
acids being either difficult to procure or insoluble in alcohol.
    The experiment with the gallic acid had not that success
I  desired, because I operated on no more than 10 grammes
of acid : the combination was always produced; for, after
having distilled these 10 grammes of gallic acid with 12 of
alcohol and 4 of sulphuric acid until half the original quan
tity of the mixture remained, I found in the retort a liquor,
which, when covered with water and saturated with potash,
gave me, by a fresh distillation, all the free alcohol it con
tained, and which, when mixed with potash in excess,-
afforded me another portion : this last could alone be that
which was combined with the gallic acid.
    On the contrary, with the tartaric acid the experiment
completelv succeeded, and furnished some curious results.
Here, I employed as before with the oxalic acid 30 grammes
of the vegetable acid, 35 of pure alcohol, and 10 of con
centrated sulphuric acid.        The distillation was carried on
till a little ether began to be formed ; at this period the fire
was lowered in the furnace, and the retort allowed gradually
to cool. The liquor, whilst cooling, assumed the consist
ence of a thick syrup.       I poured water on              it,
                                                      but in vain,

                                      the preceding experiments,
the pecifliar combination of acid and alcohol          then, having
                                                               :
successively added to this liquor different quantities of pot
ash, a    large precipitate was formed of the acidulous tar
trate of potash and having saturated
                 ;                            without passing the

cold to strongly concentrated alcohol,          obtained,

                                              a
cool, became of the consistence of thick jelly, and even
with greater ease than before;         was treated with potash,
                                       it
and alcohol.
    This substance   is  of   abrownish colour, and           slightly is
bitter, nauseous, inodorous, free from acidity, and very
soluble in water and alcohol      ;   does not precipitate muriate

this substance   is another combination analogous to the pre
ceding ; but it is most remarkable for its syrupy consist
ence, and the property which it has of rendering solu
ble in the most concentrated alcohol, sulphate of potash,
 which alone is insoluble in weak alcohol.        Perhaps it was
the peculiarity which it has of not appearing oily, as the
 other combinations      of this kind do, to the sulphate of
 potash.
    Having concluded the experiments on the benzoic, oxa
lic, malic, citric, gallic,   and tartaric acids, those only on
the acetic remain to be made.        I adhered to these experi
 ments so much the more, as T concluded that, by varying
 them, light would be thrown on the true manner of the
action of the mineral acids in producing the new combina
tions wc are considering.       In all these experiments   I have
used alcohol of the specific gravity of 800 (temperature lO
degrees of the centigrade thermometer) and the acetic acid
 capable  of crystallization at O.
    Experiment I. — I subjected a mixture of 30 grammes of
alcohol and 20 of acetic acid to one distillation only : a
pretty intense heat was necessary to boil the liquor, and
some grammes of acetic ether were with difficulty formed.
    Experiment II. — I repeated the preceding experiment,
but with the addition of 5 grammes of sulphuric acid to the
mixture of alcohol and acetic acid ; 19 grammes of acetic
acid disappeared, ether was formed with singular facility,
and almost without any heat, I obtained 40 grammes.             It
follows then that the preceding process is an excellent one
for the manufacture of acetic ether, and far superior to that
in present use, both because a greater quantity of ether is
produced, and because many distillations are not requisite
to procure it. The rectification of it is always easy, nothing
more being necessary than to add a little potash and to de
cant, for the acetate of potash formed is collected at the
bottom of the vessel.
    Besides, an excellent ether may be oeconomically made,
 by adding to three parts of acetate of potash and two of
 strongly concentrated alcohol, two parts of the most highly-
 concentrated sulphuric acid; the mixture is to be introduced
into a tubulated retort, and to he distilled to perfect dryness ;
 then the product is to be mixed with one-fifth of its weight
 of the strongest sulphuric acid, and by a skilful distillation
 as much ether may be procured as there was alcohol em
 ployed. Any other acetate, and particularly that of lead, may
 be substituted for the acetate of potash : but then it is ne

 cessary to employ othcr proportions of alcohol and sul
 phuric acid, which will be presently pointed out.
   Experiment      III.
                    — When less than 3 grammes of con-
ccnirated sulphuric acid is used to convert 20 of acetic acid
into ether, the experiment does not perfectly succeed —
and only partially when sulphuric acid not cqneentrated
is employed ; but it fails entirely when the acid is much
diluted with water.
   Experiment IV. — When either the concentrated nitric
or muriatic acid is employed to convert acetic acid into ace
tic ether, more of either must be used than of the sulphu
ric, and their quantity must be increased according to the
water contained.
   Experiment V. —The phosphorous acid reduced to a sy
rupy consistence readily facilitates the formation of acetic
ether; but it is necessary that the quantity of this acid
should be at least equal to two-thirds of the acetic acid,
that the whole of the latter may disappear at the first di
stillation.
   Experiment VI. — Both the arsenic and oxalic acid con
tribute but in a slight degree to the formation of the acetic
ether.
   Experiment     VII. —The                 tartaric      acid is   of    no use what
ever in this process.
   Experiment     VIII.
                      —The sulphurous acid gas does not
favour the formation, though it is very soluble in alcohol,
and produces much heat during its solution.
   Experiment IX. — Lastly, the same takes place with the
phosphoric acid; but          because this acid
                                 it.   is         insoluble or           is
only slightly soluble     alcohol.
                                in
  It    evident, when we examine the result of these experi
       is
ments, that all the aeids which concentrate alcohol favour
the formation of acetic ether, and they contribute to      pro-                it
portionably to the power each has of concentrating alcohol.
On this account, the sulphuric acid has the greatest influ
ence, and the tartaric scarcely any; but when the sulphuric
acid is much diluted with water,       has the same effect as
                                                     it
the tartaric.     It   necessary therefore to suppose* that,
                        is is
                       thus condensed by an acid, the acetic
when the alcohol
acid seizes on    it,
                   and           by
                             peculiar combination forms ace
                                     a
tic ether. Now one Pan not refuse to admit an analogous
action on the part of the strong and concentrated acids,
either to generate the acetic ether, or to unite the other ve
getable acids with alcohol       consequently,
                                            :       the whole            in
series of combinations we have observed, w hich could not

  ral acid,  this mineral acid acts no other   part  than  that of
  condensing the alcohol, and of bringing it into a state ca
  pable of uniting with the vegetable acid.         The following
v principle may then be established,      to express in a general
  manner the facts I have presented in detail in this memoir.
     When     the vegetable acids are pure,   there are none    of
  them, excepting the acetic, which can in any way unite to
  alcohol and lose their acid properties : but on the contrary,
  •when mixed      with one of the mineral acids capable of
  strongly condensing alcohol, all theseacids form with al
  cohol combinations destitute of acid properties, and free
  from the mineral acid. This principle being granted, there
  is no reason for its not including the animal acids.        Pro
  bably it will lead uS to a knowledge of the secret nature of
  the mineral acids, and we shall thereby discover the means
  of easily combining them with alcohol ; and it will even
  perhaps enable us to combine all vegetable and animal sub
  stances, if not with all the acids, at least with the strongest
  and most concentrated.      This is certain, that it is fruitful
 'in results, since it increases our means of giving new com
  binations to matter.
      Be this as it may, searching in every direction to verify
  these ideas, L occupied myself on different objects, which
  I  have passed unnoticed in this memoir.       I endeavoured to
  ascertain whether the sweet oil of wine was not composed
  of alcohol and sulphurous acid, and whether that kind of
  oil procured by passing oxy- muriatic acid gas through
  alcohol, is not a compound of alcohol or another body, and
  muriatic acid.     I examined the properties of different com
  binations, of which I shall presently give an account.          I
  endeavoured to decompose them by different salts, and thus
  to combine, by means of double decompositions,           alcohol
  with all the mineral acids.      1 attempted   also to discover
  whether a perfect identity exists between those kinds of
   combinations, the formation of which is indirect, and the
  nitric and muriatic ethers, the formation of which is direct.
  Lastly, I endeavoured to determine if really, independent
   of the condensation, the mode of combination is the same,
   when the vegetable acid dissolves in alcohol retaining its
   acid properties, and when, on the contrary, it intimately
   combines with that body, with the loss of its properties.

  LXV.       On   the Combination        of Acids with Animal         and
             Vegetable Substances.         By M. Thenard.
  M y researches upon         the nitric, muriatic, and acetic ethers,
  and upon those obtained by treating alcohol with muriate
  of tin and oxy-muriatic acid *, have naturally led me to
  examine if it was possible to form them with the other
  acids. I have tried the action of these acids upon alcohol ;
  and it was in making and varying these experiments I ar
  rived at the singular result which I have had the honour to
  communicate        to the Institute     f;   a discovery,   that when
  the vegetable acids are pure, none of them, excepting the
  acetic, combine with alcohol with the loss of their acid
  properties : but on the contrary, when mixed with a mi
 neral acid capable of condensing alcohol strongly, they all
 form w ith that body a combination in which their ac^jd
  properties disappear, without the mineral acid taking any
 part in this combination.
      It is evident then, that whatever may be the mode of the
 combination of alcohol with a vegetable or mineral acid,
 the alcohol produces in these compounds the effect of a true
 saline base.
     Now the question is, whether the property of combining
 with acids, and also of neutralizing them, does not belong
 to all animal and vegetable substances.             It is very possible
 that this is the case; for, since alcohol possesses this pro
 perty, all these substances may also possess it.                 It was
 with a view to solve this question that the following experi
 ments were made.
     I passed over 300 grammes of alcohol, oxy-muriatic acid
 gas made from a mixture of 1750 grammes of muriate of
soda, of 450 grammes of black oxide of manganese, of 800
of concentrated sulphuric acid, and of 800 grammes of
water.
     Almost all the acid and the principal part of the alcohol
                                                                          '
were mutually decomposed, and either generated or libe-
rated a large quantity of water, of matter having an oily
appearance, of muriatic acid, and a small quantity of car
bonic acid, and a substance abounding in carbon ; a result
that agrees with what has already been published either by
M. Berthollet in the Memoirs of the Academy, or by my
self in the first volume of the Memoires d'Arcueil.                   All
these products have been separated with care, as I have
                   * Vol. i. del Memoires d'Arcueil.

solely to be attributed to the loss of oxygen, and hydrogen
being abstracted in sufficient quantity by the muriatic acid
to form water, and to a slight separation of carbon at the
same time: in fact, that the artificial camphor with a little
more carbon, and a certain quantity of oxygen and hydro
gen in the proportions to constitute water, would return to
?n essential oil.
   Gehlen rejected this theory for good reasons*.       Having
observed that in passing muriatic acid through the essential
oil of turpentine, no gas was disengaged; that only a cer
tain portion of the oil was converted into white crystals
having the appearance of camphor, and that the remainder
appeared as a brownish-black liquid of great acidity ; that
the crystals too as well as the liquid contained muriatic acid
in intimate combination, &c. he has concluded, that in
this operation the essential oil of turpentine is decomposed,
that the greatest part of its hydrogen combines with a small
quantity of its carbon, and with a certain portion of mu
riatic acid, to form concrete camphor, whilst the other prin
ciples of the oil combine with the remaining portion of
muriatic acid to form the brownish-black liquid ; therefore
that this liquid contains more carhon and less hydrogen
than the camphoric concretion ; and that, in the formation
of both, the muriatic acid acts only by the tendency it has
of uniting to them, and not, as the chemists above quoted
say, by forming a certain quantity of water at the expense
of the principles of the essential oil.
   I repeated and varied with great care the experiments on
the essence of turpentine and muriatic acid, made by Kind,
Trorosdorff, Sec, and above all by Gehlen. I obtained the
following results : loo grammes of essence of turpentine
purified by distillation, and plunged into a freezing mix
ture of ice and salt, absorbed 30 grammes of muriatic
acid gas; no gas but muriatic escapes, which perhaps
was not entirely absorbed at first, or passed through the
liquid when the operation was nearly finished. The es
sential oil is converted into a soft and crystalline mass, from
which, during its desiccation for three davs, may be sepa
rated 20 grammes of a liquid that contains many crystals and
nearly 100 grammes of a white substance, granular, crystal
line, volatile, and having a strong smell of camphor. This
substance quicklv loses, by exposure to the air, the property
which it at first fias of reddening turnsole paper, and after
wards only very minute quantities of acid can be separated

of an essential oil and vegetable acid alone. These views,
as they are founded on facts, at least deserve some atten
tion, and, if confirmed by experience, may probably be of
great advantage.
    I have likewise formed the combinations of the essence
of lemon and of lavender with muriatic acid. 32 grammes
of the essence of lavender require 22 of acid ; the resulting
compound is blackish, acid and liquid. 26 grammes of the
essence of lemon absorb 22 grammes of acid ; the essence
is of a brownish hue and solid.      Neither of these essences
had been purified ; but both were used in the state they are
generally found in commerce.
    The essential are not the only oils capable of combining
with acids. 1t has long been remarked that the fat oils
form with different acids peculiar kinds of soap. The sul
phuric acid when concentrated has this effect upon all of
them ; it produces with the oil of olives in particular a soapy
matter, of a thick and greenish appearance, which gradu
ally acquires consistence; when washed with water it be
comes white ; it is acid, but less so than if the acid was
uncombined, and it may be brought into the neutral state
by a proper quantity of potash.
    Tannin besides, which is a vegetable matter, contracts,
 as is well known, a strong union with acids ; for the con
 centrated sulphuric acid suddenly precipitates it from its
 solution in water, and I am convinced that, however often
 the precipitate may be washed, it is always acid. Nature
 itself has offered us a compound of this species.       In fact, I
 have treated 10 grammes of gallnuts with 2 litres of boil
 ing water, and although the residue -had been washed with
 two litres more of very warm water, it still strongly reddened
 tincture of turnsole: in the gallnuts therefore the gallic acid
 is retained by a true affinity.   But as the quantity of gallic
 acid abstracted by a spontaneous decomposition far ex
  ceeds the quantity of free acid existing in its natural slate,
 we must conclude that the greatest part of the acid is cer
 tainly neutralized by the tannin.       It is observed too, that
  if a decoction of gallnuts he allowed to follow its own
  course, as the tannin is destroyed, the liquor becomes more
  and more acid.     One may, indeed, attribute this phaeno-
  menon to the transformation of the tannin itself -into gallic
  acid ; hut numberless observations authorize us to believe
  that this is not the case.

 form no other acid but the acetic,

soluble, and which again dissolve, the acid being saturated
with ammonia, or with either of the other alkalis, and in
which albumen is nowise altered.           If on the contrary the
acid is very strong and concentrated, the precipitates formed
will always be acid, but will contain albumen in the state
in which it exists when concreted by fire: this has appeared
in treating the precipitates with a weak solution of am
monia.      In the first instance, the solution will be gradu
allv formed and complete ; in the second, the acid alone
will be taken up, and the albumen will remain undissolved
in the form of a thick magma.
     The combination of picromel with the acids took place
with the same facility as with the preceding. Almost as
soon as these substances conic in contact, an acid precipi
tate is formed, which rcdissolves when neutralized.           It is
principally with the sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acids
that picromel forms slightly soluble compounds.
     The concentrated nitric acid is the only one, according to
Messrs. Fourcroy and and Vauquelin, that precipitates urea
from its solution in water ; yet it is probable that the other
acids are capable of combining with it; and if thev do not
precipitate     it,   it
                      isbecause the compounds are soluble in
water.     I have observed that these combinations never form
when the temperature           below 40 or 50, particularly with
                                   is
the sulphuric and muriatic acids        and that otherwise there

     Lastly, gelatin itstlf may unite with some acids, and
principally with the oxy-muriatic acid. To effect this
combination      it   necessary to pass the gaseous acid through
                      is
a   solution of gelatin. In this operation the solution gradu
ally becomes turbid and precipitates flakes, which unite to
gether in the form of pearly filaments very clastic and flex
 ible. These flakes have been considered            M. Bouillon-

Sixty-three       measures of ammonia were exploded over
mercury with 33 of oxygen gas containing one of nitrogen.
The total, y6, when tired           by
                                 an electric spark, were di
minished to .*>7 measures, which were not contracted any
further   by successive agitation with water and with sul-
phuret or lime. The whole of the ammonia, therefore, waa
decomposed; and all the oxygen had entered into combina
tion with the hydrogen or the alkali.        The residuary 57
measures were mingled with 40 measures of the same oxv-
geu gas, and detonated         by
                              an electric spark   after which ;
 the total, 97, were reduced to 60. The diminution, there
 fore, was 37 measures     and as two-thirds of this number
                           ;
may be ascribed to the condensation of hydrogen gas, the
 residuary 57 must have been composed of Ot-Cfi hydrogen
 and 32*34 nitrogen.     The oxygen expended also was 32
 in the first combustion, + 12*33 in the second, = 44-33                         ;
 and this number, being doubled, gives 88*66 for the whole
 hydrogen saturated, supposing       to be in the state of hy
                                         it
 drogen gas.     But from the above quantity of nitrogen
  (32*34 measures) we arc to deduct one measure, with which
  the 33 measures of oxygen were contaminated          and the    ;
  remainder 1*31 shows the number of measures of nitro
               3
  gen resulting from 63 measures of ammonia.         The total
  amount of gases obtained        31*34 + 88*66 = ICO: and
                                    is
  the proportion of the hydrogen          by
                                       volume to that of the
  nitrogen, as 73*88 to 26*12.

  believe to be nearest the truth, and most precisely necessary
   for mutual saturation, is that resulting from the second
  experiment, viz. 67 } measures of oxygen gas to 100 of am
  monia, or 100 of the former to 148 of the latter.
      It may be observed, also, by comparing the numbers in
  the two last columns of the iable, that the hydrogen and
  nitrogen gases do not uniformly bear the same proportions
  to each other.       Notwithstanding all the labour I have be
  stowed on the subject, I have not been able to obtain a
  nearer correspondence, owing most probably to the imper
  fection of the mode of analysing a mixture of hydrogen .
  and nitrogen gases.             In the mixture of permanent gases,
  determined in this way, the hydrogen, it may be remarked,
  bears generally rather a less ratio than that of 74 to 26.                  I
  do not, however, consider this fact as contradicting the ac
  curacy of the proportions which you have assigned ; and it
  appears to me that a sufficient reason may be given for the
 want of a more perfect coincidence between results ob
 tained by such different methods of investigation. In the
 products of the electrization             of ammonia, the hydrogen
 composes nearly three-fourths of the mixture: and hence
 its combustion by oxygen gas is likely to be completely
 effected, and the whole of the hydrogen condensed into
 water.      But after the partial combustion of ammonia by
 oxygen gas, a residuum is left of hydrogen and nitrogen
 gases, of which the hydrogen usually composes less, and
 sometimes considerably less, than one-half the bulk.                       In
 this case, it may be suspected that a small quantity of hy
 drogen occasionally escapes being burned ; and whenever
                                                                                '
 this happens, its proportion to the nitrogen will appear to
 be less than the true one*.
     From the inflammability of a mixture of ammonia with
 oxygen gas, it was natural to expect that this alkali would
 prove susceptible of slow combustion.                 By means of a pe
 culiar apparatus (on a plan which I have described in the
 Philosophical Transactions             for 1808, Part II., but on a
 smaller scale, and with the substitution of mercury for
water), I have found that ammonia, expelled from the
orifice of a small steel burner, may be kindled by electricity
in a vessel-of oxygen gas ; and that it is slowly consumed
    * This consideration
                           suggests the propriety of using no more oxygen in
the first combustion of ammonia, than is barely buiTicic.it to inflame it ; or
if a larger quantity ha.5 been used than is reqi.'.rcd for this purpose, and a
residue consequently   obtained, of which the hydrogen forms only a fniall
proportion, it is proper to add a further quantity of hydrogen, before the
second combustion.     An allowance may afterwards be made for this ad
dition.

in the proportion of 75*4 to 24-6.         From the same facts it
may be deduced, that 100 measures of ammonia require for
saturation 130 of nitrous oxide = 67         j oxygen gas.  The
coincidence then, between the results of the combustion of
ammonia with nitrous oxide, and those with oxygen gas,
confirms the accuracy of both methods of analysis.
    Nitrous gas, which, it appears from your testimony*,
does not compose an inflammable mixture with hydrogen,
(nor, as I am assured by Mr. Dalton, with any of the va
rieties of carburelted hydrogen) may be employed, I find,
for the combustion of ammonia. The proportions required
for mutual saturation arc about 120 measures of nitrous gas
to 100 of ammonia.        An excess of the former gas does not
give accurate results ; since not only the hydrogen of the
ammonia, but some of its nitrogen is also condensed ; and
the mixture, after being fired, exhibits the cloudy ap
pearance usual in that case.
    Forty-eight measures of ammonia, being fired with 60
nitrous gas, (= 53 pure) both gases were completely de
composed ; and a residue left consisting of 61 nitrogen and
9 hvdrogett.       Sixty measures of ammonia and 41 nitrous
gas (=     36- 1  pure) gave, after firing, a mixture composed
 of 10 ammonia, 53i nitrogen, ana 30} hydrogen. But
 taking for granted that lOO measures of nitrous gas, ac
 cording to your analysis, hold in combination a quantity
 of oxygen equal to 57i measures of oxygen gas, and of
 nitrogen equal to 48' measures, and assummg the propor
 tions of the nitrogen and hydrogen in ammonia to be those
 established by your experiments and my own ; it will ap
 pear from an easy calculation, that the proportion of ni
 trogen, in the above residua, a little exceeds, and that of
 the hydrogen rather falls short of what might have been
 expected.      1 have not yet been able to reconcile these dif
 ferences, by the numerous trials required in a process of so
 much delicacy; and I reserve the mquiry for a season of
 more leisure. The foregoing statement I wish to be con
 sidered as merely announcing the general fact of the com
 bustibility of a mixture of ammonia and nitrous gas, a pro
 perty which chiefly derives importance from its being ca
 pable of application to a new method of analysing the fatter.
    Before concluding this letter, I shall briefly state the re

     From a portion of carbonic acid gas, carefully dried by

  obtained, after removing the undecomposcd gas by caustic
  potash, a residuum equal to about one half the whole gas
  which had been employed.             It was found on analysis to
 consist  of   oxygen      and    carbonic  oxide gases, in such pro.

 bonic oxide by the same operation, owing doubtless to
 the electricity having been conveyed by conductors of cop

 from being evolved in a separate form.
    Carbonic oxide, electrified with similar precautions, did
 not appear to undergo any change.                Eleven hundred dis

 the gas, equal to about one-tenth of a cubic mch.                     Its
 bulk, after this process, was unaltered ; no carbonic acid
 could be discovered in it; and there was no decided trace
 of oxvgen gas in the residuum. The carbon, it appears,
 therefore, which exists in carbonic oxide, must be held
 combined by an extremely strong affinity.

The     relations which serve to connect the different ori-
ginary crystals of one and the same substance with one
common primitive form* are founded, as we have seen, on
laws of structure whose effect is to determine the number
and arrangement of the planes which compose the surface
of each crystal. By a necessary consequence the naturalist,
who is familiar With the progress of these laws, frequently
finds it merely requisite to have before his eyes the primi
tive ftlrmi and the explanation of the decrements which itl
angles or its ridges undergo, in order to represent the poly
hedron- resulting from        it,
                              and to see        what manner, in
                                                         in
idea, we may effect the metamorphosis of the nucleus from
Which this polyhedron        derived.

   These considerations gave rise to an idea of translating
Into a  very concise language, similar to that used in Algebra,
the various laws which determine the secondary crvstals,
and thus to compose species of formal* representative of
these same crystals.        Itsufficient,
                                 is           order to attain this,

to designate      letters the angles and ridges of the primitive
                  by
form, and to accompany these letters           cyphers, which in
                                                     by
dicate the laws of decrements undergone               such angles by
and such ridges, and the result ot which                    certain    is   a
secondary form.       have endeavoured to confine the arrange

with that of the alphabet, so that this arrangement natu
rally presents itself to every one.
   By attention to this point and some others concerning
the manner of placing the cyphers,           requires, in my opi

substance,    will be equally easy to compare them, either

longer in the same situation, because the two planes which
unite upon one do n«t form between them the same angle
with those which have the other for the line of junction.
It between these same ridges and those which are diame
     is
trically opposite to them      tor instance, between

equality.
   By this we see why the four solid angles round the upper
base, as well as the four edges of this base and the two lon
gitudinal edges which are presented in front, are each of
them marked with         particular letter.
                                a              But as the laws of
decrement act with the greatest possible symmetry, at least
in general, erery thing which takes place on one of the
solid angles or of the edges designated,             repeated on the
                                                             is
angle   or the  edge diametrically  opposite,   among those which
have remained m vacuo.          According to this,          was only
                                                                  it
necessary    to  designate  the  number    of   solid   angles, or of
ridges  which     undergo   decrements    really  distinct,  because
these decrements contain implicitly those which take place
on the angles or the analogous edges.
    We are nevertheless sometimes obliged to indicate also
these last angles or these last edges. Then we shall make use
of small letters which bear the same names with the capital
letters employed in fig. 48: for example,           (fig. 50) will be
                                                             p

rarely necessary to make these small letters on the figure                         ;
it will be sufficient to make them enter into the sign of the
crystal, because in imagination we can easily refer each to
its proper place.
   To indicate the effects of decrements                     by
                                              one, two, three,
or more ranges,        breadth, we shall employ the cyphers
                               in
1,   2,3, 4, Sec, in the way to be immediately explamed;

and three ranges in height, we shall use the fractions
  The three letters    M, T, will serve to designate either
                                    P,
the form of the nucleus without any modification, when
they will compose of themselves the sign of the crystal, or
the faces which would be parallel to those of the nucleus,
in the case of the decrements not attaining their limits, and
then these lettters will be combined, in the sign of the
                                                      crystal,

 take place in one direction or another.
           2
    Thus D will express   a decrement    by two ranges, going
 from D towards C ; C     a decrement by three ranges,       coing
from C towards D ; D      a decrement by two ranges, descend
ing on the face M ; 'Ha decrement by three ranges, going
 from H towards G ; -G a decrement by four ranges, going
 from G towards the ridge opposite to H, &c.
    In the case in which we should be obliged to designate by
 means of a small letter such as d, a decrement on the iidge
 ur (dg. 50), opposite to that which bears the large letter
 D (fig. 48), we should suppose the crystal to be turned
                        2
 upside down.     Thus d would express      a decrement   by two
 ranges ascending above the inferior base p, as D would
express one which is ascending on the upper base P.            For
 the same reason c would express a decrement by three ranges
 proceeding from sp (fig. 50) towards EO.
    If the same solid angle or the same ridge undergoes se
veral successive decrements on the same side, or several
decrements which take place on different sides, we shall
 repeat the same number of times the index letter, varying
the cyphers conformably to the diversity of the decrements.
         2
Thus    D D will  designate   two decrements    on the ridge    D,
the one by two ranges ascending on the base P, the other
by three ranges descending on the face M.            *H, 4H will
designate two decrements, the one by two ranges, the other
 by four, to the left of the ridge H, &c.
    If there are mixed decrements, we shall indicate them ou
the same principles, by employing the fractions           £ , &c,
which represent them, and the numerator of which refers
to the decrement in breadth, and the denominator to the
decrement in height.
    It now remains to find a method of representing the in
termediate decrements.      An example will show that which
we have adopted.      Let  AE   O I i(lig. 51) be the same face
with fig. 48. Let us suppose a decrement by one range of
double molecules, following parallel lines x y, so that O y
measures double lines by one ridge of molecules, and O x
lines simply equal to this ridge.       We shall thus indicate
                    i
this decrement    (OD'F2).      The parenthesis    shows    in the
first place that the decrement    is intermediate;   0  indicates

language, already extremely concise, from every thing enig
matical, and because in the case particularly when the form
was composed of a great number of facets, which would
necessarily imply a proportional complication in the expres
sion of the sign, beginners would be embarrassed to make
the relation between one and the other.
     To obviate tliis difficulty, I thought it right to place un
der the different letters which compose the sign, those
 which correspond with them on the figure.            By means of
 this addition the sign of the bibinary feldspar is presented
 as  follows  : G1  MT
                     M
                           I P.  This  is the method which  I shall
                 1      T M Y
 use in the course     of this work, with respect to all the cry
 stalline forms, addmg to each sign a kind of guide, which '
 will serve for recovering its form, however complicated it
 may be.
     We shall pass to the parallelopipedons of a more regular
 form, and in the first place consider the cases in which they
  differ from the rhomboid.        We shall suppose ihat each of
 them is nothing else than that of fig. 48 ; the form of
 which has varied so as to become more symmetrical.              As
  a consequence of this variation, certain solid or salient an
  gles, which were different on the first parallelopipedon, have
  become equal.       All that takes place on one is repeated on
  the other, and they consequently ought to be marked with
  the same letter.     It is thus that, in algebra, certain general
  solutions are simplified in the particular cases where a
  quantity, which we had at first supposed different from an
  other law, becomes equal.
      Let us conceive, fur example, that the primitive form is
  a straight prism, which has for bases oblique-angled pa
  rallelograms, one side of which is longer than the other.
  We shall have (fig. 48.) 0 = A, I = E, &c. We shall
   substitute, therefore, on both occasions, the second letter
  for the first, as we see on fig. 53.
      By continuing to run over the various modifications of
   the parallejepipcdon, we shall see them pass by different
  degrees of simplicity, which will determine new equalities
   between the letters indicative of their angles and of their
   edges ; and we shall have successively,
      For the oblique prism with rhombic bases, the expres
   sion represented m fig. 54.
      For the straight prism with rectangular bases, that which
   we see m fig. 55.
       For the straight prism with rhombic bases, that of
   fig. 56.
                                                                 For

   In this sign ihe quantity 'G' indicates two distinct faces,
which are formed on both sides of each ridge G (fig. 56).
But it is n"t necessary to place two letters under this sigu,
because, all the laces situated in the same manner being de
signated by the same letter on the figure, it is sufficient that
the sign 'G: refers to the marked faces of the letter o, which
requires only that this letter should be written once under
the sign.
   We shall easily conclude from tbc same principles, that
the dodecahedron with rhombic planes originating from
the cube (fig. 56) is expressed by this single letter B      B, that
the octahedron originating from the same nucleus has              for
m          i
its sign  A 'A',     8ic,
   The rhomboid, by supposing it placed under the most
pal u ral aspect, i.e. in such a manner that the two solid
angles, composed of three equal plane angles, are on one and
the name vertical axis, has not properly bases, but merely
two summits, which are the extremities of the axis. We
shall designate its angles and ridges as in fig. 62. The let
ter e makes known that the angle which bears it is similar to
that marked with the larger letter; so that if all the lateral
angles had their indications expressed, the three nearest the
upper summits would bear the letter 11 ; and the three which
adjoin the lower summits, and which are diametrically op
posite to the first, would have fas their indicative letter.
   As the rhomboid has its six faces equal and similar, it is
enly necessary to consider the decrements relative to one
of the faces, as that which on the figure bears the letter P,
because all the rest arc merely the returns of this,           5i his
being   done  :  1 st, the   decrements     which set  out from the
tipper angle A or from the upper edge B will have their in
dicating cy]^ier placed below the letter A or B ; id, those
which set out from the Literal .meles E will have their cy
pher situated on one side, towards the top of the same let
ter; 3d, with regard to those which set out from the lower
angle e, or from the lower edge D, the cypher destined to
express them will be placed above the letter e or D.
   Let us suppose, for example, that fig. 63. represents ana-          S
logical carbonated lime already mentioned : we shall have
the following sign        e D B, the Interpretation of which        is
easy, from combining         the letters   which indicate the faces
with   those  which     express   the decrements of which these
tame faces are the result.

In order     to indicate, for example,    a  decrement by     three
ranges on all the edges, we shall take      B B  ; and in order to
designate one by two ranges on all the angles, we shall take
A A--, as in the case ot the regular octahedron.
 *
     A smgle glance at (ig. } 0. will be sufficient to give an idea
of the designation of the regular hexahedral prism in or
dinary cases ; and as to the manner of placing the cyphers,
we shall not detain our readers a moment, because it is easily
deduced from that which we have adopted with respect to
quadrangular prisms.
     But it sometimes happens tljat three of the solid angles
taken alternately are replaced by facets, while the interme
diate angles remain untouched.         In this case the expres
sion of the prism will be that which we see in fig. 71.
     In the rhomboidal dodecahedron (fig. 72, Plate VIII.)
each solid angle composed of three planes mav be assimi-
k ted -to an obtuse rhomboidal summit ; and thus we shall
confine ourselves to-decyphering a smgle face, as the figure
represents.
     Hitherto we have not been in the habit of employing the
 sign of the dodecahedron with isosceles triangular planes
because it is more natural to substitute in its stead, as a
primitive form, the rhomboid from which it is derived, and
 which gives still more simple laws of decrement.
     It remains to make known the method of representing a
particular circumstance which occurs in some crystals, in
 which the parts opposite to those .vliich undergo certain
 laws of decrement remain untouched, or are m> difitd by
different laws. This circumstance particularly applies to
 tourmalines, and it is then easy to mdicate the difference by
 means of zeros.       For example, in the eq mdifferent tour
 maline represented in fig. 74., and of which we see the
 rhomboidal nucleus (fig. 73.), the pri<m which is enneago-
 nous has six of its panes, viz. s, s (fig. 74.) produced by
 subtractions of one rangeon the ridges D, D (fig. 73.) ; an
 the three others, such as /, by subtractions of two ranges
 solely on the three angles e.      Moreover, the lower summit
 has simply three faces parallel to those of the nucleus,
 while on the upper summit the three ridges B are -replaced
 each by a facet n, n (fig. 74.) in virtue of a decrement
 which does not attain its limit. The following is the re
 presentative    sign of this form.    Dc-CPlib.      lnc i;uanti-

    Dec.     14, and 21. — In the third section of the Bake-
rian lecture, Mr. Davy detailed a nmliber of laborious and
minute experiments on the circumstance* under whicli ni
trous acid and ammonia are produced. I le showed that ni
trogen is not formed by the electrization of pure wa'er,
and that in most ot those casts m which it appear* it pre
exists in some compound employed in the process : — the
facts in favour of the composition of nitrogen arc those
derived from the electrical experiments upon the amalga
mation of ammonia, and those derived from the action of
potassium upon the same alkali.          Mr. Davy brounht for
ward various new tacts and reasonings in support of the
opinion that ammonia is an oxide.
    In the fourth section several experiments upon the earths
are detailed ; Mr. Davy has succeeded in decomposing si-
lex, alumine, and glucinc, by means of potassium and
iron, and has obtained amalgams of the metals of magne
sia aud lime by mere chemical agency.         Potassium Is sent
in vapour through the earths ignited to whiteness, and mer
curv is passed into the tube, which unites to the new metals.
     in the fifth section Mr. Davy compares the antiphlogis
 tic hypothesis ot the nature of metallic bodies, with a
 modi tied phlogistic hypothesis, that they m.iy be compounds
 of unknown bases with hydrogen ; and lie state* that the
decision upon there important points of dociriue cannot
be made, till perfectly correct notions upon the nature of
 ammonia, nitrogen, and hydrogen are acquired.
