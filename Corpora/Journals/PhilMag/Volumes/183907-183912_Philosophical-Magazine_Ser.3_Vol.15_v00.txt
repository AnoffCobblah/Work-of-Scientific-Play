         1.   Notice of an Analysis                     of the Sesquichloride of Carbon.
THIS   substance was formed in the usual way by passing
  a current of pure chlorine gas through the liquid of the
Dutch chemists, till a sufficient quantity was obtained for ana
lysis.         The crystalline substance obtained was at first well
washed with distilled water, and after repeated crystallization
from different solutions in alcohol, was considered pure.        In
this state it had  scarcely any taste, an odour similar to that of
camphor, and possessed, in short,          the characters      pure    all                                   of

diameter. . It is almost unnecessary to add, that the combus
tion must be very slowly conducted.
   During the whole of the analysis, a quantity of oxygen gas
is disengaged from the potash apparatus, which arises from
the great predisposition of the chromate of lead to be con
verted into a basic salt. This fact, with the great quantity
of oxygen which the salt contains, renders it very advanta
geous in the combustion of those bodies which contain a
large quantity of carbon, and are difficult to consume. With
this salt a much larger quantity of substance can be submitted
to analysis than with oxide of copper, arising from       greater                            its

the true spirit of research, that there must be some cause not
taken into account, such as the agency of heat, which should
produce, in the lower part of the atmosphere, the proper de
gree of rarefaction necessary to reconcile the theoretical with
the observed refractions.    Now, in the paper of 1823, the sole
intention of introducing the quantity ºf not noticed before by
any geometer, is to cause the heat at the earth's surface to de
crease in ascending at the same rate that actually prevails in
nature; which evidently has the effect of supplying the desi
deratum of Newton.
    The remarks that have just been made are not called for
 by anything which M. Biot has written in his dissertation on
 the refractions, inserted in the additions to the Conn, des

 V.   On the Boracic  Acid Lagoons of Tuscany. By John
                    Bow RING, LL.D.”
   HE borax lagoons of Tuscany are entitled to a detailed
    description.  They are unique in Europe, if not in the
world; and their produce is become an article of equal im
portance to Great Britain as an import, and to Tuscany as an
export. They are spread over a surface of about 30 miles,
and exhibit from the distance columns of vapour, more or
less according to the season of the year and state of the
weather, which rise in large volumes among the recesses of
the mountains.
   As you approach the lagoons, the earth seems to pour out
boiling water as if from volcanoes of various sizes, in a variety
of soil, but principally of chalk and sand. The heat in the
immediate adjacency is intolerable, and you are drenched by
the vapour, which impregnates the atmosphere with a strong
and somewhat sulphurous smell. The whole scene is one of
terrible violence and confusion—the noisy outbreak of the
boiling element—the rugged and agitated surface—the volumes
of vapour—the impregnated atmosphere—the rush of waters—
among bleak and solitary mountains.
   The ground, which burns and shakes beneath your feet, is
covered with beautiful crystallizations of sulphur and other
minerals.    Its character beneath the surface at Mount Cer
bole is that of a black marl streaked with chalk, giving                it,      at
                                                                                 a
 short distance, the appearance         of
                                     variegated inarble.
   Formerly the place was regarded                   by
                                             the peasants     the           as
 entrance    ofhell,a  superstition derived               no
                                                doubt from very
 ancient times, for the principal    the lagoons and the neigh
                                        of
bouring volcano still bear the name             of
                                          Monte Cerboli (Mons
 Cerberi). The peasantry never passed                by
                                             the spot without ter
 ror, counting their beads, and praying for the protection                        of
theVirgin.
  The borax lagoons have been brought into their present
profitable   action within a  very few years. Scattered over                      an
extensive   district, they are become the property           active    of
individual, M. Larderel,     towhom they are source       awealth,  of an
more valuable perhaps, and certainly less capricious, than any
mine  of  silver that Mexico       or
                                   Peru possesses.    The process
of manufacture     is simple, and    effected
                                        is                by
                                                those instruments
which the localities themselves present. The soffioni,          va          or
pours, break forth violently      different parts

with  a fierce explosion.     Inthese spots artificial lagoons are

nor is it less remarkable, that it was left for a man, whose
name and occupation are wholly disassociated from science, to
convert these fugitive vapours into substantial wealth.
   Though to the present proprietor (the Chevalier Larderel")
the merit attaches of having given to the boracic lagoons the
immense importance they now possess, a succession of ad
venturers had made many experiments, and had produced a
considerable quantity of boracic acid, but at a cost (from the
expenditure of combustible) which le<U+017F>t little profiti. The small
value that was attached to them may be seen in the fact, that
the largest and most productive district of the lagoons, that
of Monte Cerboli, was offered in perpetuity, so lately as 1818,
at an annual ground-rent of £T. 200l. or        13s. 4d. per an             6l.

   But it appears to me that the powers and riches of these
extraordinary    districts remain yet to be fully developed.
They exhibit an immense number of mighty steam-engines,
furnished by nature at no cost, and applicable to the produc
tion of an infinite variety of objects.  In the progress of time
this vast machinery    of heat and force will probably become
the moving   central point of extensive manufacturing establish
ments. The steam, which has been so ingeniously applied to
the concentration and evaporation of the boracic acid, will
probably hereafter, instead of wasting itself in the air, be em
ployed to move huge engines, which will be directed to the
infinite variety of production which engages the attention of
labouring and intelligent artisans; and thus, in the course of
time, there can be little doubt, that these lagoons, which were
fled from as objects of danger and terror by uninstructed
man, will gather round them a large intelligent population,
and become sources of prosperity to innumerable individuals
 through countless generations.

predecessor, he assigns them, with a degree of confidence but

   The late Mr. Harvey of Plymouth, gives a minute analysis
of the colours of the clouds”, which he considers only expli
cable on the theory of absorption, which office he assigns to
the particles of the clouds themselves, though he admits that
these often transmit pure white light.   He is even ready to
believe that the sun has sometimes been observed blue or
green, an observation which      think M. Arago has rightly        I
considered as an optical deception  arising from the contrasted
colour of an intensely red sky, such as that which occurred
in many parts of the world on the occasion of the dry fog of
 1831 +.
   Brandes's theory of the evening red is especially applicable
to the rich purple hue thrown over Mont Blanc and the higher
Alpst after the sun has set to the plains, and that kind of
redness is usually observed in cloudless skies, not like the
gorgeous colouring of our northern sunsets, to which         parti                                           I
cularly referred in my former paper.        In a communication
read to the British Association in 1837, M. De la Rive ac
counts ingeniously for a repetition of this phaenomenon which
is sometimes observed 10 or 15 minutes after the first disap
peared. This he plausibly attributes to a total reflection un
dergone by the rays of                              #.

flected and transmitted light. This is more or less com
pletely the opinion of Mariotte, Bouguer, Euler, Leslie, and
Brandes.
   (2.) That the colours of the sky are explicable by floating
vapours acting as thin plates do in reflecting and transmitting
complementary colours. This was Newton's theory, which has
been adopted in whole or in part by many later writers, and
especially by Nobili.
   (3.) On the principle of opalescence and of specific absorp
tion depending on the nature and unknown constitution of
floating particles.   To this theory in      various stages, we find    its
Fabri, Melvill, Delaval, Count Maistre, and Sir D. Brewster
attached.

 redness to be more or less distinctly perceived, though inge

 that the redness       is not  merely    apparent, but depends upon the

with more care, has detected a specific action of the earth's
atmosphere affecting every part of the spectrum by absorbing
or annihilating certain luminous rays of every colour. The
analogy which he has observed to exist between the deficient
lines of the atmospheric spectrum, and those of the common
solar spectrum, (which Sir David supposes to have been pro
duced in the transit of light through the sun's atmosphere),
and those developed in artificial light by the absorptive action
of nitrous acid gas, is truly remarkable, and has led him fur
ther to conclude, “that the same absorptive elements exist”
in all those media”. Now, since it is the strata of air nearest
to the earth whose effect is chiefly conspicuous in producing
the tints of evening, it is to be presumed that the elements
which produce this action, are within reach of chemical ana
lysis. The air, containing as it does the constituents of nitrous
acid gas, is naturally first looked to for their origin. But this
supposition, even if it be true, for the atmospheric lines of the
spectrum, cannot explain the extraordinary variety of absorp
tive action observed in hazy weather, when, as we have said,
the atmosphere at a thickness of but a few miles suffers only
the red rays to pass; a fact familiar to those who have at
tended to the subject of light-house illumination, and in con
sequence of which crimson signal-lights were proposed a few
years ago for adoption in hazy weather by Sir John Robisont,
on account of the persistence of such rays in a foggy atmo
sphere. The absorptive elements are clearly within our reach;
can they be nitrous gas, or what are they? The experiment
detailed in my last paper comes in to answer the question.
Vapour has hitherto been known (to philosophers at least)
under but two characters,              -a
                                 colourless gaseous body, and a
translucent pure white mass of particles generally called ve
sicularf. I have shown that it passes through a third or                                in
termediate state, in which it is very transparent, but having
a more or less intense colour graduating through the very
shades which nitrous acid gas assumes, that         tawny yellow,      is,
orange, deep orange-red, intense smoke-red, verging         black                 on

air is highly charged with moisture, is to the same purpose.
But a remark of Mr. Forster, in his “Researches about
 Atmospheric Phaenomena”,” is even more pointed, and is
valuable, because his work is pre-eminently descriptive, rather
than theoretical. “Sometimes the tints in the twilight haze
come on so suddenly and are so circumscribed, as to induce a
belief that very sudden and partial changes take place in the
atmosphere at eventide; which may perhaps be somehow con
nected with the formation of dew.”             He then records an ob
 servation made 2nd November 1822.                  “Being about four
o'clock in the    evening,    near  Croydon     in  Surrey,      observed                I
a very beautiful western sky, caused by the bright edge and
dependent fringes of a light bed of cloud being finely gilded by
the setting sun.         Some detached cirrocumuli also, which
formed the exterior boundaries of the aforesaid cloud, were
likewise of a fine golden-yellow, and the same colour appeared
in different clouds in other parts of the sky, while the scud
like remains of the nimbus floated along in the west wind
below. In the course of about a quarter of an hour, the lofty
gilded clouds         all
                       assumed       deep red appearance, and the
                                            a
change was effected              so
                             suddenly, that while looking           them,                     at

at   them  again,   the colour was totally changed.           Now, what
renders the phaenomenon remarkable                that     happened just
                                                                 is,         it

joinings being closed without solder, at least externally; the
inside is filled with fine dry sand to the height of 4} inches,
for the purpose of keeping the cylinder steady, and upon the
sand is placed a copper shelf soldered to the inner surface of
the cylinder; this shelf is meant to hold crystals of sulphate
of copper and communicates with the external surface of the
cylinder by means of a number of holes about #ths of an
inch apart, made in the circumference and on a level with
the shelf; by this arrangement there is a constant supply of
the salt of copper in solution to the fluid which lodges be
tween the external surface of the cylinder and the wooden
partition in which it stands; whereas, in the case of the open
cylinders, one of their greatest defects was, that the crystals, as
they were dissolved, were mixed with the internal solution
where they were not wanted (there being no zinc surface op
posed) in place of the external, where they were ; and thus,
not only was the solution unequal in strength, but it was
weakest in the very part where                        all
                                      the action existed, namely,

I employ    two copper cylinders of the same height as that in
the   larger battery, and two wooden ones standing between the
copper cylinders, a cylinder of zinc being placed between the
former, by which means both surfaces of the zinc are opposed
to surfaces of copper, and greatly increased power is obtained
in the same space. This mode of arrangement, however, being
somewhat more complicated and expensive, may not be ap
proved of so much for general use, nor be employed except in
cases where very powerful quantity effects are required.
                           I
   In conclusion, would add that 4th of the quantity of the
solutions used in other batteries of the same extent of surface
will suffice for those described, without any loss of power.
   In the next Number of the Philosophical Magazine, I hope
to be able to make some observations upon the proper pro
 portions of zinc and copper in voltaic combinations, and in
reference to the investigations of Mr. Binks upon the same
 subject, which have much interested me.

which is certainly curious.

52      Dr. G. Schweitzer's Analysis of Sea-water                       as      it     exists
alkali, and in a solution also containing bromides and chlo
rides.
    From experiment I have ascertained that a minute quan
tity of iodine in distilled water, equal to no more than
1,500,000th part of the whole, will be distinctly indicated
when mixed with starch, dilute sulphuric acid, and chlorine.
    For the production of such delicate reaction, add to every              I
500 grains of fluid one drop of diluted sulphuric acid, a small
quantity of paste of potato starch, and two drops of a weak
solution of chlorine, consisting of one part of a saturated
 solution diluted with 20 to 25 times its volume of distilled
water. The solution gives no indication of the presence of
iodine in the fluid until a sufficient time has been allowed for
the separation of the starch, when a decided pink hue will be
visible on the surface of the precipitate if iodine be present.
 It has been supposed that the substitution of pink for blue in
 the iodide of starch produced arises from the presence of
 bromine; but this            I
                           have ascertained is not correct, as it de
pends entirely on the minute quantity of the precipitate acted
 upon by free chlorine or bromine. The following experiment
will prove this fact. In order to ascertain the delicacy of
electrolytic tests of iodine, a current of electricity produced
by voltaic induction was passed through a suitable glass tube,
filled with 300 grains of distilled water containing rotºgoth
part of    itsweight          of
                          iodide             of

of   starch, but         no
                       action was observed until            few drops   a                            of
nitric acid were added, which assisting the electric current, de

                                              in                     iodide               of

also gave by the action of the electric current a slightly
pinkish deposit.
   It is always necessary, when we wish to detect by means of
chlorine minute quantities of an iodide, to employ the chlorine
in a very diluted state, as when in excess it forms a soluble
chloride of iodine which will not act on starch.
   The sulphates and chlorides present in salt waters do not
interfere with the delicacy of the starch test; on the contrary
a concentrated solution of the chlorides will show the presence
of one millionth part of iodide of potassium more distinctly
than an equal volume of distilled water. This appears to
arise from the iodide being a little soluble in pure water.
I thought at first that a trace of an iodide might be contained
in the common chloride of sodium, and thus cause a deeper
tinge of blue colour; but by employing a chloride of sodium
prepared from pure hydrochloric acid and pure soda,                             I
found the same degree of increased reaction. The iodide of
starch will likewise keep unchanged much longer in a solu
tion of chlorides exposed to light and air than in pure water.
   The bromides when present in large quantity interfere
with the delicate reaction upon traces of iodine, but when the

as a small proportion of free bromine will, like chlorine,
decompose the iodide, and produce the characteristic re
action.

Charles Daubeney likewise mentions, in his “Memoir on the
occurrence    of iodine and bromine in certain mineral waters
of South Britain, May 1888,” that he could not detect iodine
in the residuum of sea-water taken from the English Channel
near Cowes, after having reduced ten gallons to less than half
an Ounce.
    To proceed with my experiment, I freed three ounces as
 much as possible from the chlorides by crystallization, having
 first carefully neutralized the solution with hydrochloric acid.
 The residuum was then evaporated to dryness, ignited, and
 treated with anhydrous alcohol.          The alcoholic             #.
                                                                   was af

 terwards evaporated, and the dry residue dissolved in a few
 drams of water, when the before-mentioned test readily in
 dicated a slight trace of iodine.
     With respect to the quantity of iodine in sea-water, it is
 evidently very minute, 174 pounds troy not containing one
 grain. This is remarkable when we consider the compara
 tively large quantity of iodine and bromine present in sea
 plants and animals, hence we must conclude that these prin
 ciples are concentrated by vital action.
     Bromine when present in fluids is easily detected by chlo
 rine, which produces a yellow colour.               If present in very
 minute    quantity   the fluid must first be concentrated.            But
 when iodine is present we cannot apply this test, as bromides
 and iodides are both decomposed by                 it;
                                                     and we cannot se
 parate them, even          by
                             means         of

the solution will remain clear; but if the most minute particle
of an iodide be present, it will be rendered turbid.
   To the fluid under examination I added gradually, drop

time between each successive addition for the precipitate of
iodide of silver to subside. It is well when bromides are
present to keep the vessel closed during the process, other
wise it is of no importance.    The iodide of silver collected
upon a small filter was first washed with a little diluted am
monia, and afterwards with a few drops of diluted hydro
chloric acid to dissolve any earthy substance which the pre
cipitate might contain, and ultimately with pure water.
   The filter with the precipitate was dried and ignited. This

corresponding quantity of ammonia, which kept the chloride
of silver in solution, will be free and act upon the bromide of
silver; but by observing the before-mentioned precaution,
every error of that kind will be avoided.    Should a fluid con
tain iodides   and bromides without chlorides, and not in too
small a proportion, a very good method of ascertaining their
 respective quantities is to precipitate them at once with
nitrate of silver, and to heat the dry precipitate in an atmo
sphere of bromine.      I have found, when iodide of silver is
melted in an    atmosphere   of bromine, it is entirely changed
into a bromide;    and from the difference of the weight between
the mixture of iodide and bromide of silver, and that of the
whole bromide of silver, the respective quantities of iodine
and bromine may be ascertained.           Thus the quantity of
iodine (or bromine) stands in    proportion   to the difference of
the weight, as the atomic weight of iodine (or bromine) is to
the difference of their atomic weights.     Hence it would only
tº  required for the quantity of iodine to multiply the given
difference of the weight by 2,627, and for that of bromine to
multiply it by 1,627. Professor H. Rose, of Berlin, applies
a similar method for the separation of iodine from chlorine.—
 (Poggendorff’s Ann. 1834, No. 37, p. 583,584.)
  I  may appear to have dwelt long upon this subject, but the
importance into which brine springs have arisen on account
of their powerful components, iodine and bromine, has induced
me to examine the matter closely, as it may be of consequence
to the medical profession to know the exact quantity of these
valuable substances.
  I  have briefly to add, that the quantity of chlorine in sea
water was ascertained by means of nitrate of silver, deducting
from it that proportion of bromine which had been found
 according to the foregoing method. The quantity of sul
 phuric acid was found by chloride of barium, the water having
previously been mixed with a little nitric acid. Another
portion of the water was mixed with chloride of barium with
out the addition of an acid, when the difference of the weight
between this and the former precipitate gave the amount of
carbonate of barytes from which the proportionate quantity of
carbonic acid gas was computed;         or of
                                          quantity was likewise
                                        the acids amongst the
                                        of its

must have been united        carbonic acid. The quantity ob

quantity of chloride of ammonium.                 After the separation of
lime, magnesia was precipitated by the addition of ammonia
and phosphate of ammonia.
   The precipitate was washed with water containing 10 per
cent. of ammonia, whereby the solution of the precipitate was
prevented.       After the sea-water had been freed from the
earthy chlorides and sulphates by hydrate of barytes and
carbonate of ammonia, it was evaporated to dryness, and the
residue heated to redness, and weighed.                 The alkaline chlo
rides were dissolved in water mixed with perchloride of pla
tinum, and evaporated to dryness.                   The residue digested
with  spirits  of wine    containing    60  per   cent. alcohol, left potassio
chloride of      platinum,      which was      dried,  weighed, and com
puted as chloride of potassium.                 The surplus of the total
amount of the alkaline chlorides will give the precise quantity
of the chloride of sodium.
   The equivalent numbers have been computed according to
the Tables which H. Rose has affixed to his Handbuch de;
analytischen Chemie. 2 weiter Band.

   When these analyses are compared, it will be found that
the Channel water contains 9 times as much lime as the Me
diterranean, but this can be accounted for, as the water flows
over a bed of chalk.           The Mediterranean again has twice as
much magnesia and sulphuric acid.
   We also find that the English. Channel contains in 1000
grains water, 35-25628 grains of anhydrous ingredients;
which amount corresponds very nearly to 35 grains, or 35.1
grains, obtained from several experiments, when 1000 grains
were evaporated in a platina crucible, mixed with a little
chloride of ammonium, to prevent as much as possible the
decomposition of the earthy chlorides, and the residue care

 fully ignited, in order to volatilize the chloride of ammonium,
 where, however, a dissipation of hydrochloric acid had taken
 p lace.
     Sometimes I found faint traces of oxide of iron, when the
                                       W. I
 concentrated water was mixed with sulphocyanuret of potas
 sium, particularly after boisterous
in respect to organic matter.
                                                      found the same
                                   The sea-water taken on a fair
and calm day, when very transparent, did not yield the
slightest indication of extractive matter when evaporated and
ignited.   A   small quantity of free carbonic acid gas has been
likewise found; and also extremely minute traces of chloride
of ammonium were detected, when about 5 pounds of sea
water were evaporated in a water-bath to nearly half an ounce,
 which, mixed with caustic soda, produced fumes close to a
glass rod wetted with hydrochloric acid.
     Sea-water has been likewise examined for silica, alumina,
strontia, manganese, phosphoric acid, and nitric acid, none of
 which could be detected.
    The sea-water used for the occasion was taken on the 3rd
of June, from the surface six miles from the shore, at high
water. The weather was fair, the sea calm and extremely
transparent.     Its specific weight was at 60° Fahr. 1.0274.
Another portion obtained by a proper apparatus from the
very bottom of the sea, 10 fathoms deep, was of the same spe
cific gravity, and likewise that taken almost close to the shore.
In the month of July, after a previous rainy day, the sea
water taken four          ºft,
                             from the shore, had at 60° Fahr. a
specific gravity of 1:0274; at a distance of 2 miles, 1.0271;
and close to the shore, 1.0268.          It was examined several
times in  August,   the weather  being    fair and warm, when the
specific gravity amounted to 1:0274.         This appeared to be
the greatest weight.                                -
    When weighed in fair weather in December, it was almost
1.0271; after rain I found it to be 1-0267.        These variations
will of course depend entirely on the state of the weather.         If
the atmosphere be bright, and no heavy rain has lately fallen,
the water will have, even close to the shore, the same specific
weight as out at sea, but after rain it is obvious that the sea
water close to the shore will be most diluted.          It is therefore
indispensable that the sea-water for examination should be
taken at a distance of several miles, that        its  specific weight
should   be   ascertained,  and that the   analysis   should  be   per
formed from one and the same        dip.
 I    cannot conclude this paper without drawing the attention
of   medical men      the importance which the brine springs
                     to                                             on

above all, the springs of Kreugnach, which have been
found highly beneficial in scrophulous diseases when inter
nally administered, their action being dependent entirely on
the chlorides, iodides, and bromides they contain.       Sea-water
would afford similar advantages for bathing, and when evapo
rated to dryness, the residue might be kept in earthen vessels,
                                                                                  be its

are very soluble, sea-water       perfection might in  procured                                        at
any place. The evaporation          sea-water should    performed

with  care, and the   ingredients   kept     chemists.   One great  by
advantage would accrue from this method, viz. that sea-water

only three times immersed in the acid, and only for about two
seconds each time.     I tried the same battery at 268 feet, and
did not succeed. The plates were then well washed, and fresh
exciting liquor made : the experiment again failed; the plates
were quite inactive. The next day I tried the same plates
and the same exciting liquor, and succeeded at 268 feet.
From this it seems impossible to say how many pairs of plates
would be required to produce uniform effects at long distances.
I  suspect that the zinc plates do not act equally in producing
the electricity, which causes this variation.

     should have liked very much to have tried the conduct
ing properties of different sized wires, but had not an oppor
tunity of getting them here.
    Not having seen any notice of this novel and safe me
 thod of blasting in your excellent journal, induced me to
 send you these few remarks.

 battery instead of the fuze in blasting.

bability, in his opinion, of the existence of an error in the
commonly received combining number of carbon, I beg to
send you an account of some recent analyses of that substance,
and also of three other compounds of hydrogen and carbon,
made in the laboratory of the Middlesex Hospital Medical
School: I must leave it to you to decide whether these expe
riments are of a proper kind to occupy a page of your Journal
in the absence of more original and important matter.
   The subject of the composition of naphthalin has engaged
the attention of chemists ever since       discovery, and notwith

    In repeating         these experiments with great care by the aid                           of
Professor Liebig's process, results differing little from the
foregoing were obtained.
   The specimen of naphthaline employed was purified by very
slow sublimation in a Florence flask, by which means it was
obtained in large crystalline plates of the most brilliant
whiteness.    In this state it had very little odour when cold,
and melted on the application of heat to a colourless, trans.
parent fluid, which crystallized confusedly on cooling:

As the error of excess here to be observed exceeds the usual
limit of inaccuracy of the experiment, no other supposition re
mains but that of M. Dumas, that the equivalent of carbon
may be taken too high.

apparently a substance of very definite nature, it was thought
that some additional light might be obtained from an analysis
of this liquid. It was carefully prepared in the manner de

66      On a Leather-like Substance composed of Infusoria.
of this natural production, as you will observe, resembles soft
dressed glove-leather, or fine paper, is shining, smooth to the
touch, and of the toughness of common printing-paper*. On
the inner side, which was in contact with the water, it has a
lively green colour, and one can still distinguish green leaves,
which have formed the leather-like pellicle. I dare say a bo
tanist could still determine the species to which they belong.
   I have made the following experiments on the leather-like
substance, having separated it from the green inner coat.
   It catches fire very easily, burns with a wax-yellow flame,
leaving a pale-red rough light ash. When heated in a small
retort dense white fumes are evolved, an odour of burnt paper
is perceived, and simultaneously drops of a yellow empyreu
 matic     oil
             are deposited             on

patient industry; for as the analyses were chiefly made in foreign

                          which by deliquescence form an inky fluid, drying
  into a bister-coloured mass, capable of being used as a water-colour
 for drawings, and of a very indestructible nature by means of common
  agencies.”      By John Redman Coxe, M.D., formerly Professor of
  Materia Medica in the University of Pennsylvania.           Communicated
 by the Secretary.
      Dr. Coxe having gathered a Fungus and placed it on a sheet of
  white paper, leaving it until the next day, found several drops of an
  inky fluid, slowly trickling from the inner surface, which had as
  sumed a black appearance; by placing the Fungus in a glass, the
  whole except the outer skin liquefied.        The colour of the fluid was
  rather a deep bister than black, and being left in the glass, in a few
   hours it separated into a solid sediment, with a lighter coloured fluid
   swimming above. Having afterwards collected a considerable quan
   tity of fluid from the same species, he obtained by drying an extract
   of a pretty deep black colour of both parts conjoined, which would
   otherwise have separated. This on trial formed an admirable bister
   like water-colour, well adapted for drawing when mixed with a little
       In .
       Dr. Coxe used the “fresh inky fluid       as ink, and from such fresh
   fluid the accompanying drawings were made;” but it was soon found
   that its change was too rapid to think of depending on it for such a
   purpose, he therefore was led to dry it as quickly as possible by
   spontaneous evaporation, and then to use it diluted with water.
   Having exposed various portions of writing thus made to the direct
   rays of the sun for several months with little change, he tried the
   effects of chlorine and euchlorine gas, muriatic acid, and ammoniacal

 gases: from these but a trifling change ensued, except from the mu
 riatic acid gas, which destroyed very considerably the dark tint of
 the writings. He also placed some small and recent specimens of the
 Fungus in a solution of corrosive sublimate, which preserved them and
prevented any deliquescence: the same effect was produced by alcohol.
    The ink is fully formed and escapes in about three or four days.
When received into a phial, in a short time the heavier and blacker
matter was found to settle as a sediment; the lighter brownish amber

   April 2.—Mr. Owen read a Paper on a New Species of the genus
Lepidosiren of Fitzinger and Natterer.     The author commenced by
adverting to the first announcement of that anomalous animal, the
Lepidosiren paradora, as the type of a new genus of Perennibranchiate
Reptiles by Fitzinger at the meeting of the German naturalists at
Prague in 1837, and to                           its

branchial arches, and the bodies of the vertebrae : these, moreover, are
not separated to correspond with the neurapophyses and ribs, as in
Plagiostomous Cartilaginous Fishes, but retain their primitive con
fluent condition as a round continuous chord, extending from the oc
ciput to the end of the tail: this vertebral chord consists of an ex
ternal firm, elastic, yellowish capsule, enveloping a softer subgelati
nous material, as in the Cyclostomous Fishes.         The corresponding
parts or basilar elements of the cranial vertebrae were ossified: and
Mr. Owen then entered upon a detailed description of the skull.
     The ribs are thirty-six pairs, and consist of short, slightly curved,
slender styles, encompassing, with the spine, about one-sixth part of
the cavity of the abdomen.        The rudimental filiform pectoral and
ventral fins were    supported  each by a single cartilaginous ray com
posed of many joints.
     The muscles of the head, jaws, hyoid and branchial apparatus
were then described: the muscular system of the body consists of
subvertical layers of oblique fibres separated at brief intervals by
aponeurotic intersections.
     The following peculiarities of the Digestive system were then
pointed out;-two long, slightly curved, slender, sharp-pointed
 teeth project from the intermaxillary bones, which are moveable.
The upper maxillary bones support each a single dental plate divi
ded into three cutting lobes, by two oblique notches entering from
the outer side : the lower jaw is armed with a single dental plate       si
milarly modified, the produced cutting edges fitting into the notches
 above: these maxillary teeth somewhat resemble the dental plate of
 the extinct Ceratodus of Agassiz.      The fleshy and sensitive parts of
 the tongue are more developed than in fishes generally.        The jaws
 are adapted to minutely divide and comminute alimentary substances;
 the pharyngeal opening is contracted; the entrance to the pharynx
 guarded by a soft semicircular valvular process. Gullet short, straight,
 narrow, but longitudinally plicated. Stomach simple, straight, with
 thick walls, in capacity corresponding with the oesophagus; termi
  nating by a valvular pylorus projecting with a scalloped margin into
  the intestine.    No pancreas or spleen. Liver well-developed, partly
  divided into two lobes. A gall-bladder, and large ductus choledochus,
  opening by a valvular termination close to the pylorus.         Intestine
  round, straight, at first of equal diameter with the stomach, but gra
  dually contracting to the vent, with thick parietes; traversed inter
  nally by a spiral valve describing six gyrations; the first of which is
  the longest.
      The respiratory organs consist of branchise, and a double elon
  gated air-bladder, with the usual vascular and cellular structure of
  the lungs of a reptile.
      The branchie consist of elongated, sub-compressed, soft, pendu
  lous filaments, attached to cartilaginous branchial arches; these
   arches are not joined together, or to the os hyoides by an interme
   diate chain of cartilages or bones below, nor are they articulated to
   the cranium above. There are six branchial arches on each side,
   and five intervals for the passage of the water from the mouth to the

branchial sac.     All the branchial arches do not support branchial
filaments; but only the first, fourth, fifth, and sixth.
    The heart is situate below the oesophagus, in a strong pericardium;
it consists of a single auricle and ventricle and a contorted bulbus
arteriosus, with a longitudinal valvular process as in the Siren. The
two branchial arteries, which wind round the gill-less arches, after
wards unite together on each side, and give off branches which form
the pulmonary arteries, or those which go to the air-bladders.
    The apparatus for aerial respiration commences by a short, single,
wide and membranous trachea, or ductus pneumaticus, which com
mences by a longitudinal laryngeal slit, one line in extent, situated
three lines behind the orifice of the pharynx : a single plate of car
tilage is continued from this laryngeal opening forwards to that of
the pharynx: the plate is as broad as the floor of the pharynx, and
its office seems to be to prevent the collapse of the parietes of that
tube, and to keep a free passage for the air to the trachea. This tube
dilates at its lower end into a sac with verythin parietes, which com
municates directly with each division or lobe of the air-bladder.
These lobes or lungs are partially subdivided into small lobes at their
anterior and broadest part; and then continue simple and flattened,
 gradually diminishing to an obtuse point situated behind the poste
rior extremity of the cloaca. The whole of the parietes of the lungs
is honey-combed : the cells are largest, deepest and most vascular
and subdivided at the anterior and broader end of the lung.
    The two kidneys are quite distinct, very long and narrow, but
broadest towards the cloaca : the ureters communicate with the back
part of the common termination of the oviducts.
    The ovaria are two long, flattened bodies, with ovisacs and ova of
different sizes: many between 2 and 3 lines in diameter, scattered
among clusters of other ova of smaller size. The oviducts are distinct
tortuous tubes, which commence by a very wide and thin-coated
portion, opening by a slit, 3 lines wide at their anterior extremity,
and not communicating with each other before opening into the pe
 ritoneal cavity, as in the Plagiostomes.
    A small Allantois is situated between the oviduct and rectum.
The cloaca receives the above parts in the following order,-first, or
most anteriorly, the common opening of the peritoneal canals; se
condly, the anus; thirdly, the Allantoid bladder; fourthly, the ovi
ducts, with the ureters, which open into the back part of the oviducts.
    The brain consists of two elongated subcompressed distinct cere
bral hemispheres; a single elliptical optic lobe, or representative of
the bigeminal bodies; a simple transverse cerebellar fold, not cover
ing the widely-open fourth ventricle; largely developed pineal and
pituitary glands; and a single corpus mammillare.
    The nerves given off from the brain, were the olfactory; the optic,
which arose from the same point at the middle line between the
crura cerebri, and did not decussate; the fifth pair; the acoustic; the
pneumogastric; and lingual nerves: there were no traces of the third,
fourth, or sixth nerves; there being no muscles to the eyeballs.
    The eyes are very small, and adhere to the skin, which passes over

them without forming any projection; they have a small spherical
lens, and no choroid gland.
   The organ of hearing consists of a vestibule enclosed in a thick
cartilaginous case, without external communication except for the
foramina transmitting the portio mollis : it consists of two large
otolithic sacs, containing each a white chalky mass; the external one
being six times the size of the one next the brain: above these sacs
are three small semicircular canals.   No trace of tympanic cavity or
Eustachian tube.
    The organ of smell consists of two oval membranous sacs, pli
 cated internally, and having each a single external aperture upon
 the upper lip; but without any communication with the mouth,                      a
 structure which the author observed was                perhaps    the  only single
 character which unexceptionably proved the Lepidosiren to be a true
 fish. The remaining evidence of                              its
                                                ichthyic nature reposed rather

   In the  process   of making     the ELAST1c    tissues”,       the threads of
caoutchouc are first of all deprived of their elasticity, to prepare
them for receiving a sheath upon the braiding machine.                     For this
purpose they are stretched by hand, in the act of winding upon the
reel, to 7 or 8 times their natural length, and left two or three
weeks in that state of tension upon the reels. Thread thus inelastic
ated has a specific gravity of no less than 0-948732; but when it
has    its
         elasticity restored, and                  its

 ON     THE PREPAltation OF FULMINIC ACID.                                              B.Y.   M. FEHLING.

                                                                                                                     byto

the hydrochloric and hydrosulphuric acid, gave rise to new acids
containing chlorine or sulphur; oxalic and sulphuric acids decom
posed it with the disengagement of prussic acid. No compounds of
fulminic acid and the alkalis, potash and soda, or barytes, &c., have
been obtained.      In all the experiments performed with the inten
tion of preparing these compounds, double combinations have always
been obtained, such as that of barytes with oxide of silver or of
copper, and these soon decomposed when attempts were made to
 separate the oxide of silver or of copper.
    Sometime since, however, Mr. E. Davy described a method for
 the preparation of fulminic acid; according to his process it may be
 obtained in combination with water, though only for a short time.
 He prepares a pure solution of fulminic acid, by adding hydrate of
barytes to fulminate of zinc.      This addition is to separate the oxide
 of zinc, and to yield pure fulminate of barytes, which is readily de
 composed by the addition of dilute sulphuric acid.          By the invita
tion of M. Liebig, M. Fehlen undertook to repeat the experiments of
 Mr. Davy. For this purpose, fulminate of protoxide of mercury was
 digested for some time with an excess of metallic zinc.; by this a
 solution of pure fulminate of zinc was obtained, free from any trace
 of mercury. This solution treated with hydrochloric acid yielded a
 very strong smell of hydrocyanic acid, and at the same time that of
 cyanic acid was also perceptible.       The salts of silver precipitated
this solution: the white precipitate obtained in abundance was com
 pletely dissolved in boiling water; when dried it detonated strongly.
If  the solution of fulminate of zinc be cautiously evaporated by a
water bath, a yellow powder is obtained, but a small portion of
which is soluble in water; the aqueous solution gives a light white
precipitate with the salts of silver, which does not detonate.         The
 portion which is insoluble in water dissolves with effervescence in
acids, and hydrocyanic acid is evolved; if the yellow powder be
heated alone, it becomes white, oxide of zinc is obtained, and am
monia evolved. The substance, which gives a lemon yellow with
the oxide of zinc, was not more minutely examined.
    Solution of barytes was added to some recently prepared fulmi
nate of zinc, until the solution was strongly alkaline: a large quan
tity of oxide of zinc was separated; the excess of barytes was preci
pitated by carbonic acid. The solution separated by filtration from
the carbonate of barytes, acted with the salts of silver and with acid
like fulminate of zinc ; thus it yielded with the salts of silver fulmi
mate of silver, &c.    If sulphuric acid be added to the solution of the
fulminate,        to all
                the barytes    precipitated.

    BIRTH OF A GIRAFFE AT THE GARDEN OF THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY.
     The following particulars of the birth of the young Giraffe were
 communicated to the Zool. Soc. at the Meeting on Tuesday evening
     “The Giraffe brought forth a young male June 19th, after a
                                                                                     79
 gestation of 15 lunar months. The young animal was able to stand
 a few hours after birth, and could reach the height of six feet.                    He
 was capering about the day after he was born, and shows a remark
 able degree of development and strength, as might be expected from
 the long period of gestation. The mother, though not unkind to her
 offspring, refuses to suckle him; but there seems to be no difficulty
 in bringing him up by hand. Admeasurements of the different parts
 of the young animal were given, and the anatomy of the foetal mem
 branes and cotyledons described.              Drawings of the mother and her
 young, by Mr. Hills, the well-known animal painter, were exhibited
 to the meeting.”

XVII.      On the Inaction of Amalgamated 2inc in acidulated
          Water. By W. R. Grove, Esq., M.A., M.R.I."
IT is                                           of commerce,
           a well known fact, that the common zinc
    when immersed in water acidulated by sulphuric, phos
phoric, or muriatic acid, is rapidly dissolved, evolving tor
rents of hydrogen gas, while zinc with the surface amalga
mated, remains inactive, under similar circumstances, unless
touched by another metal placed in the same solution, in
which case hydrogen, amounting to the full equivalent of the
oxygen which unites with the zinc, is evolved from the surface
of the associated metal, and the zinc is tranquilly dissolved.
   M. De la Rive observed, that pure zinc is much less                                vi
gorously attacked by diluted acid than commercial zinc,
and has thence, after a careful experimental investigation,
concluded, that the evolution of gas by common zinc arises
from the circumstance of                 its
                                adulteration       other metals;    by
thus    aninfinity      of
                      minute voltaic circles    established,   the
                                                                is
particles    of
              zinc being oxidated, while those      the more ne      of
gative metals evolve hydrogen (Bib. Univ. 1830).        This ex
planation does not apply          inactivity amalgamated     zinc,

not mercury, which            by   its contact with zinc and acidulated
water must also form          a   voltaic combination, produce   similar       a
effect?”

 trode thus amalgamated with the positive one, the latter also
became frequently amalgamated. After several experiments                                                      I
 found that mercury which had acted                acidulated water      in   ne                         as

while a strip of amalgamated zinc immersed in the same liquid
communicated with the other extremity: at the instant of com
munication an energetic current was indicated, which how
ever immediately diminished in intensity, and at the end of a
few minutes the needle returned to zero; scarcely any gas was
evolved, and of the few bubbles which appeared, as much could
be detected on the surface of the zinc as of the mercury.
            .
   3. With the same arrangement I substituted for the mer
cury a strip of platinum well amalgamated. In this case, as
before, after a few minutes the current became null, or so feeble
as to require a delicate instrument to indicate       existence;                           its

for unamalgamated platinum, this latter evolved torrents                hy                                  of
drogen, and the needle indicated            violent current a          con                       in     a
trary direction.

many experiments with great care, the average ascent for de

    Ramond, in his Treatise on the Barometrical Formula, has
recorded the heights for depressing the centigrade thermome
ter 1°, in 42 different experiments.      Setting aside four of this
great number on account of their excessive irregularity, he
states the mean of the remaining 38 at 164*7.              A good
average may be expected from so many experiments, made
by observers of the greatest eminence, in different quarters of
the world, in every variety of height and temperature.         Now

It would     be a great omission in this research to leave out the
celebrated ascent of Gay-Lussac in a balloon.         According to
Laplace, the whole height ascended, or 2, is 69SO", the de

 It  is to be observed that, although experience and theory
 both concur in proving that z and r"—r increase together in
the same proportion to considerable elevations in the atmo
 sphere, yet, at very great elevations, there is no doubt that
                                                º,
 2 increases in a greater ratio than r"—r: so that when very
 great heights are used for computing                  the resulting
 value   will be greater than the true quantity.       What is said

Gay-Lussac's ascent, above the other values found from mo

The difference of these numbers from those used in the paper
of 1823, produces an increase in the refractions amounting
to 19° at the horizon, and to 2" at 2° of altitude.
   The irregular manner in which the heat decreases in such
experiments as have been used for finding f, evidently makes
them altogether unfit for determining the next coefficient                                                         f.
One remark respecting this quantity deserves to be noticed.
By expanding the formula (4.), we obtain,

                      Rocks   of North    Devon, &c.                  111
 appears to me but right to endeavour briefly to give some
further explanation of the grounds upon which I formed my
 own individual opinion, as expressed in the Memoir read be
 fore the Geological Society, referred to above, and to which           I
 still adhere; namely, that the Older Stratified Rocks of North
Devon, though distinguished by some peculiarities, belong to
the transition epoch.          These additional reasons will also
make manifest the        principles    upon which I differ from the
new    position  taken   by  Professor Sedgwick and Mr. Murchi
son.
     And first, as to gradation.       When two formations are in
juxta-position, gradation from one to the other may be con
 ceived as taking place in two ways; either by an alternation
 between the beds of the two formations on the line of their
 conjunction; or, where there is no such alternation, by an
 incorporation and interchange of their individual characters,
 as dependent on mineral composition and the remains of the
 organized bodies which they contain respectively.                 Now,
 I  have not found either of these cases applicable in North
 Devon to the line of junction of the Trilobite slates with the
 carboniferous strata. On the contrary, we pass at once from
 the Trilobite clayslates (partly glossy and finely laminated)
 and containing other peculiar organic remains, to coarse shales
 free from any such remains, and more or less indurated and
 siliceous, in connexion with the carboniferous limestone.
     Secondly, as to conformity.         It can scarcely be necessary
 to remind a    geologist  of extended practical experience, that in
 exploring the boundary lines of two conjoining formations of
 different aeras, the two may be found both in conformable and
 in unconformable position with each other in different portions
of their expanse; the extent of conformity or unconformity
in any one part depending on the form and direction of their
 respective stratification in that part.        But in determining the
 relative age   of the two  formations,    I consider unconformity (on
 however small a scale developed in a given district) as the
 rule for our guidance, (especially when supported by corro
 borative considerations,) the conformity in such case arising
 merely from coincidence in the stratification.              As an    in
 stance, I will refer to the position of the Old Red Sandstone of
  Gloucestershire in relation to the subjacent transition beds.
 In the environs of Tortworth, the strata of the two formations
 are in the eastern quarter of the field in conformable position,
 while in the western and north-western quarters they are for
 the greater part unconformably disposed”.             Similar relations
    • Geological Transactions, vol. i. second  series. Geological observa

112                   Mr. Weaver on                  the Older Stratified
appear also in the N.W. of Gloucestershire and adjacent parts
of Herefordshire *. Now, no one contends that these forma
tions are of the same epoch, but quite the contrary: the Old
Red Sandstone here also, be it observed, containing no fossils
of the transition aera, nor any other except some vestiges of
vegetable remains.       And if we refer to Ireland, similar ob
servations may be made: thus, for example, the same body
of Old Red Sandstone, which surrounds the Bilboa mountains,
lies near Newport unconformably, and at the outlet of the
Bilboa river conformably, on the subjacent clayslate; arising
in fact from the variable position of the clayslate strata, while
that of the Old Red Sandstone is more constant, being disposed
in extended overlying sheets +. It appears needless to multi
ply instances. In              all
                          such cases unconforinity must assuredly
 be                 governing   principle      deciding relative age.

the former case dipping 70° to the S.W. and in the latter 50°
to the N.E.    The immediate contact of these carboniferous
strata with the subjacent Trilobite slates is not visible, but in
the nearest adjoining portion of the latter formation exposed
to our view, namely, in the Bickington quarries on the east,
we find the dip of the beds to be 60° to the southward.                                             If
then we suppose, as we are justified in doing, that these beds
extend to the westward under the carboniferous strata near
Muddlebridge, the unconformity of the two formations be
comes      manifest.           The     nearest      Trilobite slates seen on the
north show also a southerly dip.            It was to illustrate these
relations that I constructed the diagrams of a plan and section
in the region of Muddlebridge, as laid before the Geological
Society.
   On the other hand, if we proceed to the southern side of
the Devonshire carboniferous trough, it is admitted that in
one case at least an unconformity is observable between the
carboniferous series and the subjacent schistose rocks”, al
though a general coincidence or parallelism in the strike of
their respective strata may be apparent adjacent to their
boundary line; but the culmiferous series in a part of               ex                   its
tent  is said    torest also upon granite.      Mr. Austen, however,
has repeatedly stated that the culmiferous measures               South              in
Devon rest unconformably upon series                deposits belonging

these doubts               I
                adverted in a note to the 38 S. of my Memoir
on the South of Ireland.      Analogous relations appear also
to exist in the transition countries adjacent to the Rhine, and
the works now in progress to illustrate the organic exuviae
found in those tracts may assist in throwing additional light
on this subjectif.
   This case, however, is not a singular one in geology, it be
ing well known that in the instance of any two systems fol
lowing one the other in the geological progression, although
distinguished respectively by peculiar organic remains, yet
certain species occur common to both systems.                  The partial
appearance therefore of certain species among the fossils of
transition strata which are common in the carboniferous series
also, does not appear a sufficient reason for including such
transition strata in the forination of the old red sandstone f.
Still less could any such inference be drawn from a considera
tion of the component rocks, for, taken as a whole, none can
be more dissimilar than the Older Stratified Rocks of North

1   16                 Mr. Weaver              on the Older Stratifted
Devon, and those which have hitherto been met with and de
scribed as constituting the Old Red Sandstone formation.       If
in attempting to remove this difficulty, namely, as arising from
the difference              of mineralogical character,
                                                we have recourse to
metamorphism,     what is there    gained  by  such an assumption?
We can      hardly   suppose   any   very  intense development of
heat in the present instance.      But supposing the highest state
of excitement, that of igneous action, could we expect other
than an intimate chemical combination of the constituents of
the rocky masses, and a new arrangement of the molecules ac
cording to the laws of their polarities? What evidence have
we of any such intensity of action in the present case? Not in
the mineral characters certainly, nor are the organic remains
which are distributed in the series obliterated ; on the con
trary, they are abundant, and in many cases well pronounced.
 And the rocks of which the group consists, and to which a ge
neral allusion has already been made, are analogous to such
as are to be found dispersed in other transition tracts.       Thus,
 if the Older Stratified Rocks of North Devon be           compared
 with those occurring in certain portions of the South of Ireland,
 such analogies doubtless present themselves.        There are these
 differences, however, between the two tracts; that a much
 greater diversity of rocks occurs in the broad expanse of the
 South of Ireland, than in the confined district of North De
 von, including various conglomerates among the number (and
 in this respect corresponding likewise with the relations in the
 N.W. of Gloucestershire, and adjacent parts of Hereford
 shire * :) while, on the other hand, the organic remains distri
 buted in the Old Stratified Rocks of North Devon appear to
 be much more abundant and in greater variety than I have
 noticed in any part of the South of Ireland. Now, admitting
                                                 it let
 such analogies to exist,           carry the comparison somewhat

                                 leads.   These rocks      the South       in

formed position prevails also in Scotland and in the North of England is
admitted by Prof. Sedgwick. (Proceedings of Geol. Society, May 1838,
pp. 676, 678.)
   All these instances prove a positive break in the geological succession
between the transition and the carboniferous epochs.
   How is this fact, based upon a wide field of observation, to be recon
ciled with that solitary example of gradation which is described by Mr.
Murchison as taking place from the Silurian system into the Old Red
Sandstone formation, and his consequent division of the latter into three
masses numbered in descending order, 1. conglomerate and sandstone,
2. cornstone, and marl, 3. tilestone 2 Perhaps the following view may
assist toward removing the seeming discrepancy.      Let us consider the
subject in reference to relative position, composition, and organic re
IIlains.
   With respect to position, if we look at the map we perceive at once
that this great deposit is flanked on both sides, on the E. and W., by

118                            Mr. Weaver                 on the Older Stratified
age; as to their being in fact both referable to an epoch ante
cedent to that of the Old Red Sandstone formation, and in
nowise connected with the latter as terms of the same series.
tilestone appears to be confined to the Western flank of the Old Red Sand
stone, serving as a base to the cornstone division: for on the Eastern side,
in the instances cited of flagstones between Mathon and Ledbury, and at
the N.E. suburb of Ledbury, it is not mentioned that these flagstones con
tain there any fossils; and hence they may prove to be mere modifica
tions of Old Red Sandstone in that quarter.                                       4.
                                                             continuity of the fossili
ferous tilestone    through    the  field, therefore, does not appear to be proved.
The observations made in the Clytha hills N. of Usk, (pp. 438, 439,)
seem to me to relate merely to modifications of the upper Ludlow beds;
a simple change of colour from gray to red being quite unimportant.
     Analogy thus pointing to the Silurian system rather than to the Old Red
sandstone, is it venturing too far to suggest that the fossiliferous tilestone
might have been more appropriately included in the Silurian system? For,
entering more into particulars, let it be considered that of the twenty
seven species of shells enumerated as being found in the fossiliferous tile
stone, seven species are marked as occurring in the upper Ludlow rock
 also (figured in Pl. 3, 5, and 19, and described in pp. 602–604. See also
 p. 183.) And to this statement I may add, (although I have not my Tort
 worth fossils lying before me, so as to speak with precision in             the cases)                         all

    And if such be the case, the same may be predicated of the
 Older Stratified Rocks of South Devon and Cornwall also,
 since similar relations are stated to exist in those districts as in
 North Devon.     And this conclusion will bring us back to the
 position formerly entertained, and I believe correctly; namely,
 that a large portion of the Older Stratified Rocks of South
 Devon and Cornwall belong to the transition system *.           But
 to what portion of that system? it may be asked.         The ques
 tion implies the impression of a determinate order of succes
sion in the transition series. , Does such a sequence strictly
prevail in nature, so as to admit of general application?                                                 I
do not conceive that an affirmative reply would be correct, if
we may judge by what we have hitherto learnt from the de
scription of our own and other countries. And in avowing this
persuasion, far be it from me to disparage in the slightest de
gree the assiduous and invaluable labours of Prof. Sedgwick
and Mr. Murchison.       The Silurian system of the latter can
not be too   highly appreciated,   as no doubt will also be the case
with the Cambrian system of the former, whenever the public
shall be gratified by the appearance of that work in             de                      all      its
tails. As    comprising       able           an

system will always maintain         high rank   geology. Yet,

carboniferous series.        But Mr. Murchison would now restrict the carboni
ferous     system   to  the carboniferous limestone and coal-measures merely.

dium in which they are enveloped, as being of an argillaceous,
calcareous, or siliceous nature, we can hardly expect to find
that the local arrangements of one country should strictly
correspond with those of another”. I am persuaded that many
general resemblances exist, but that a diversity prevails
in the details of different tracts, both with respect to the com
position and disposition of the mineral masses and the distri
bution of the remains of organized bodies.                     In this view we

   Again,       “Mr. J.  de C. Sowerby is of opinion that                the                   all

remark that, not exclusively would have been                 more correct       a
expression, several             of

     “Judging from the printed lists, Prof. Phillips also thinks
that the Cork limestone fossils are carboniferous.”                    And
“Mr. Sowerby agrees with me                      believing that the only

 124            Mr. Weaver    on the Older Stratified
    3rdly, But there are twenty-four species which occur both
 in the Cork band of limestone and other transition countries;
of these, three species are included in Mr. Murchison's List
 of Silurian Fossils, derived from the Wenlock limestone, viz.
 at Ledbury and Dudley; and two of these occur also at Ply
 mouth, and one in the Eifel and Gothland: they are, Nerita
 spirata, Spirifera radiata, and Spirifera octoplicata; and
 three others, also derived from the Wenlock limestone, viz.
at Dudley, but not included in Mr. Murchison's list; and one
 of these is found at Blankenheim: viz. Spirifera striata, Euom
phalus pentangularis, and E. catillus.         Sir other species in
 the Cork limestone are met with also in home transition lo
calities; namely, in the Isle of Man, at Ludlow, Plymouth,
and Newton Bushel; and three of them occur also in foreign
 transition countries, viz. in the Eifel, at Coblentz, and Blan
 kenheim : they are, Pileopsis vetusta ; Producta Scotica; Spiri
fera distans, S. cuspidata, S. rotundata ; Terebratula pugnus:
 twelve other species occur in foreign transition countries, viz.
 Orthoceras striatum ; Nautilus globatus, N. ovatus ; Spirifera
oblata, S. pinguis ; Terebratula crumena, T. sacculus, T. late
ralis, T. laevigata (Schlotheim), T. acuminata ; Amplerus co
 ralloides ; Actinocrinites 30-dactylus: these foreign localities
 being Norway and Sweden, Christiania, Malmoe, Gothland,
 Hof, Schleitz, Blankenheim, Eifel, Coblentz, Bensberg, Ems,
 Mont Chatou near Coutances, and the Catskill Mountains in
 the state of New York; countries admitted to be of protozoic
origin, and to which Mr. Murchison himself in a great mea
 sure refers, when giving an account of his Silurian corals,
 viz. Sweden, Gothland, Bensberg, Eifel, and the transition
 regions adjacent to the Rhine, both in Germany and Belgium;
as also to Lake Erie and Drummond           Island in North Ame
r1Ca.
    4thly, But there are seventeen species in the Cork band of
limestone, which have hitherto been noticed elsewhere only in
the carboniferous limestone; viz. Asaphus gemmuliferus ;       Or
thoceras Breynii, O..fusiforme; Nautilus multicarinatus, N. ca
riniferus, N. sulcatus ; Ampullaria helicoides; Producta Mar
 tini, P. concinna, P. lobata, P. punctata, P. antiquata, P.
plicatilis; Spirifera trigonalis; Terebratula resupinata, T.
cordiformis; Pleurorhynchus hibernicus.
    In further illustration of this subject, I also showed, in the
notes to $.33. of my Memoir on the South of Ireland, that
of the genera Producta, Spirifera, and Terebratula, no less
than eighteen other species had been observed, partly in other
portions of the British Isles and partly in foreign countries,
as common both to the transition and carboniferous systems;

 namely, Producta depressa, P. haemispherica, P. longispina,
 P. sulcata, P. anomala, P. sarcinulata, P. scabricula, Spiri
Jera glabra and obtusa, S. attenuata, S. ambigua, S. reticulata,
 S. decurrens, S. striatula ; Terebratula Mantiac, T. platyloba,
 T. plicatella, T. diodonta, T. affinis ; and the transition tracts
 to which these are referred are, at home, Dudley, New
 ton Bushel, Plymouth, and South of Ireland; and abroad,
 Christiania, Gothland, Eifel, Coblentz, Bensberg, Blanken
 heim, Ems; and Catskill Mountains, Albany, and Trenton
 Falls, in the State of New York.
     There is no gainsaying these facts, the lists having been
 prepared with great care; and                               I
                                           consider Mr. Murchison not
 at    all
        justified  when        applies    he this part      my memoir the
                                                                to                      of
 following remark: “Still less can we admit the validity                  ar                             of
                                                                                   or of
 guments founded, either upon mere lists                 fossils which may
 have often been erroneously identified,                  simply upon the
 names attached               to
                        formations         geologists       by

 died the whole sequence                the deposits   of    question.” (p.             in
 580.)
     With respect          the first part       this remark, bearing of                                       on
 the identification               of to
                            species, foreign naturalists may not re
 ceive      it    as
                any great compliment; but            confess      am not  I                     I             so
 sceptical myself                 as   to
                             undervalue their     discriminating    powers;
                                                                                            de be
 at  home, luckily, the identification will not                disputed, the
 principal authority referred             being Mr.                Sowerby.                         C.

  And with                        to

  which have I     already    enumerated.
  I    must also remark that Mr. Murchison does not correctly
  state the case when                     he
                               represents that some          the limestones                of
 in  the south of Ireland are loaded with carboniferous fossils.

   Drawing then a distinction between original formation and
contingent derangements, between primary construction and
subsequent upraisings and depressions, if we look to the
terms of the series exhibited to us in the existing relations of
the constituent masses of our Continents and Islands, the vast
body of cumulative evidence supplied by the extended re
searches of geological observers in general, among whom the
name of Lyell stands conspicuous, seem to leave little doubt
that the solid materials of the Shell of our Globe have under
gone oscillatory movements in elevation and depression in re
ference to the level of the sea.    In some cases, these move
ments  appear   to have been   gently  and slowly, in others vio
lently and rapidly progressive, while subject to alternating fits
of comparative repose and energy, differing greatly in degree
and extent; thus corresponding with the successive differences
which are observable also in the position, composition, and
structure of rocks, and in the remains of the organized beings
                                                                  -

 abstract science of form, just as             magnitude is sub
ject to the science of number.             the tree problem had
led me to consider combinatorial schemes for the arrange
ment of points, it was from conversation with Mr. Sylvester
that I was induced to attribute any importance to the study
of the symmetrical combinations which the notation of geo
metrical theorems of position presents, and to suppose it pos
sible that, more generally, the study of functional forms might
produce a method suggestive of new geometrical theorems.
 It would probably be well for the theories both of geometry
and functions, if an expressive symbolic analogy could be con
trived between geometrical and functional form.          In the                             or
dinary Cartesian equations of curves, the symbols of mere
magnitude precede and almost wholly constitute the formulae
which, to a practised eye, disclose relations of curvature.                                  I

Having of         late      made some researches with the view                                      of dis
covering the true cause of the polar state which the electrodes
acquire within electrolytic fluids during the passage of a cur
rent, I was led to observe a striking analogy between metallic
peroxides on one side, and chlorine and bromine on the other,
with regard to the electromotive power of those substances, all
of them being highly what is called electro-negative. First let
us consider the way in which the two substances last men
tioned give rise to currents.                             If

a similar relation to the hydrogen of water that distilled or amal
gamated zinc does to the oxygen of (acidulated) water: in either
case there is no apparent chemical action, i. e. no decom
position of water previously to a circuit being formed or a
path opened for a current. But no sooner has the circuit been
completed in our two cases, than both the decomposition
of water, and the formation either of muriatic acid or oxide of
zinc, begins to take place, and a current makes               appearance.                    its

 state seems to have no voltaic action at all upon water*.
 Extraordinary as the matter in question may appear to be at
 the first sight, it appears less so, in my opinion at least, on a
 closer inspection of the case.           Dumas has shown, and as far
 as I can understand the subject, in a very satisfactory man
 ner, that chlorine is capable of losing altogether                ordinary                  its

we may take it as a certain fact that one portion of the      oxy
gen    of the peroxides,   that chlorine, and bromine are bodies
which act in the same manner upon water, we do not know
for all that the way in which they excite a current; or ra
ther we do not know why any of the three substances first
named acquire, under certain circumstances, the power of
decomposing water.          According to the views of De la
Rive and some other electricians, the cause of the currents
produced by hydro-electric circles is chemical action. Con
vinced as I am of the general truth of the principle laid
down by the philosopher of Geneva, I cannot help doubting
 the correctness of that doctrine of his according to which
 chemical action must always precede the appearance of a cur
 rent.    As far as I understand the chemical theory of galvan
 ism alluded to, it cannot account for the disturbance of the
 electric equilibrium which takes place within a voltaic circle
 formed out of such substances as do not chemically act upon
 each other under ordinary circumstances.        Amalgamated or
 distilled zinc not being attacked by acidulated water, perox
 ide of lead not being acted upon by nitric acid, bromine or
 chlorine not decomposing water, ought not, according to
 De la Rive's hypothesis, to excite any current if arranged
 so as to constitute with platina a voltaic circle.    In asserting
 that the    theory in question  cannot account for the currents
 which are excited by the last-mentioned arrangements, I am
 well aware of what Mr. De la Rive has brought forward
 with the intention of vindicating the correctness of his views.
  He maintains, that in the cases above stated there is some
  feeble chemical action taking place, and that it is this action
  which must be considered as the cause of the initial current.
  This current being the effect of a chemical action, becomes,
  according to the opinion of Dela Rive, itself the cause of an ad
 ditional current by effecting electrolyzation, &c. (Récherches sur
  la cause de l’Electricité Voltaique, 1836, p. 128.) Ingenious
  as these views may be, I cannot convince myself of their
  truth until Mr. De la Rive has given proofs more decisive than
  those are which he has hitherto offered in favour of his as
   sertion, made either explicitly or implicitly, that it is only a
   film of hydrogen which protects amalgamated zinc against the
   action of acidulated water; that peroxide of lead and nitric
   acid do chemically act upon each other; that chlorine is ca
   pable of decomposing water in darkness, &c. But if no such
   chemical actions take place in the cases mentioned, and if
   nevertheless chemical action be the real cause of hydro-elec
   tric currents, how are we to account for the excited currents
   in question ? We know as yet very little indeed of the na

whatever may be the degree of dilution of either fluid made
use of. As #. as I know, chemists do not allow pure zinc
to be in the least chemically affected by an aqueous solution
of chemically pure potash, whilst copper is readily dissolved
by nitric acid. Now according to the views of De la Rive,
the copper wire in the arrangement before mentioned ought
to be positive with regard to the zinc, which is immersed in
the alkaline fluid. The philosopher of Geneva has tried to
reconcile some similar facts disagreeing with this theory by
asserting, that the largest portion of electricities separated
from each other by the action of nitric acid upon some metal
reunites upon the surface of the latter, on account of the great
conductive force of the nitric acid (see the above-mentioned
Memoir, p. 39.). But it appears to me that such an explica

circumstances       which occasion a modification of the surfaces
of the metals employed. Having above ventured to start
the idea, that many substances, being under ordinary circum
stances altogether chemically indifferent to each other, might
become capable of acting upon one another when arranged
together in a peculiar manner, and presuming that such a
conjecture will be considered by the majority of chemical
philosophers as very extravagant and wild, I am desirous to
say a few words more on the subject. We know now-a-days
a series of chemical phaenomena called forth not by what we
term “affinity,” but by the mere presence of certain bodies,
by what the French call “action de présence,” Berzelius,
 “force catalytique.” The decomposition of peroxide of hydro
 gen caused by the precious metals and by their oxides; the
 transformation of alcohol into acetal, aldehyde, and acetic acid
 brought about by the joint action of platina and oxygen; the
 well-known union of oxygen with hydrogen effected by pla
 tina”, are instances of chemical actions occasioned by a force
 which is altogether unknown to us, and widely different from
 what we conceive common affinity to be.             Now if a substance
 can cause either the union of bodies with one another, or the
 decomposition of compounds, without entering into any com
 bination with them, why, I ask, should the case be impossible,
                             º;
 that certain substances do only chemically act upon each other,
 in consequence of their            put in contact with one other in a
 peculiar way? For myself, I do not see any reason why such a
 thing should be impossible; at any rate, the fact that in many
 instances bodies do chemically act upon each other, merely as
 far as they are arranged in the shape of a circuit, cannot be
 denied any longer.        The question is only how the fact is to
 be interpreted.      Now if we consider the current excited in
 such cases as being due to chemical action, it seems to
 me that we cannot avoid arriving at a conclusion like that              I
 have come to.

   * I have reasons to doubt the correctness of the very ingenious account
 which Dr. Faraday has given of the phaenomena in question, and shall not
 be long in making them known.       I also consider the view taken by Mr.
 De la Rive on the subject as erroneous.

XXVI.        On the Equivalents       of the Cambrian and Silurian
   Systems   in  Belgium,     embodied in a “Report on the Progress
   of the   Geological    Map    of Belgium, during the year 1838.”
    By A. H. DuMont, Member of the Royal Academy of
   Sciences   of Brussels.”
THE        ancient tracts of Belgium are beyond contradiction the
       most important, whether viewed in a scientific light, that
is to say, as regards the divisions which mineralogy and pa
lacontology enable us to establish, or commercially, on account
of the riches in combustibles and metalliferous ores which
they contain.
     From these considerations the Academy will doubtless
find that it was desirable not only to make known the dif
ferent modifications which these tracts present, but also their
 relations to the other analogous districts in neighbouring
COuntries.
    In  1837 and 1838,        I called the attention of the Academy
 to the agreement which exists between the formations of
the Eifel and the two lower systems of the anthraxiferous
districts of Belgium.
                 I
    This year have endeavoured to make the same compari
 sons between our systems and those which Mr. Murchison
has recently established in Great Britain.
    For this purpose, I undertook, along with our learned col
league M. d’Omalius d'Halloy, and M. de Verneuil, a distin
guished palaeontologist, a special journey into Wales, and I
              I
think that have succeeded in establishing a complete paral
lelism between the English formations and our own.
    The west of Great Britain completely reminds us of the
south-east of Belgium.           We find there the cultivated hills of
 Condros, and the barren plains of the Ardennes, which agree
in the composition of their rocks with the divisions established
by Messrs. Murchison and Sedgwick, under the name of the
Silurian and Cambrian systems, corresponding exactly to those
which M. d’Omalius designated, in 1808, by the names of
slaty and anthraxiferous (ardoisier et anthra.rifere).
    If  we survey the Cambrian district, it is easy to recognise
two systems there, distinct, as much by their relative position
as by their mineralogical composition.               The first which I
observed      amongst    others in the      neighbourhood        of Dinas
 Mowddwy, forms the central mass of Wales, and presents a
number of rocks which may be considered as true slate, and
which in a great many places are worked.                   This mass an

     swers to the middle system, which I established in 1836, in
     the slate district of Belgium.
        Our excursions did not allow us to observe whether the
     lower slate system exists in Wales, which, moreover, must be
     difficult to ascertain, on account of the changes which must
     have been produced by the porphyroid rocks of Snowdon and
      Cader Idris.
           Tothe east of the middle Cambrian district, there is an
      assemblage of rocks quite analogous to that which forms our
      upper slate system in Belgium, which may be proved by
      traversing the mass situated between Mallwyd and Garth
      bibio.
         Further eastward successively appear superposed with re
      markable simplicity, the different divisions which Mr. Mur
      chison has distinguished in the Silurian system, and which
      correspond to the three lower divisions of the anthraxiferous
      system.
         As        I
               should deviate from the purpose of this report by
      giving in detail the observations which I had an opportunity
      of making in Wales,                         I
                               shall limit myself to pointing out the
      correspondence between the different members of the Silurian
      and anthraxiferous formations, in the following table:

Wenlock limestone is found to occupy but a very small space,
to narrow progressively towards the south-west, so as to be re
duced near Ludlow, to a breadth of six miles, and further
on to lose itself in the schist.
   But if the calcareous rocks are much more developed in
Belgium than in Great Britain, the schistose and psammitic
rocks are on the other hand much more prevalent in the
latter country.
     I
     have yet to speak of a very considerable deposit, which
prevails principally in the counties of Hereford and Brecon,
and to which the name of old red sandstone has been given. It
is doubtful whether this formation has a representative in Bel

     I ought however to observe,  that we also found there Pro
ductus, and other shells which are generally met with in the
upper calcareous system.                                   - -
   The schist and the red psammite, No. 7, occupy the position
of the lower quartzo-schistous system, of which it has more
over all the mineralogical characters.                -
   Lastly, the grayish schist, No. 8, may be considered as
belonging to the upper part of the slate district.
   Such are the approximations which my foreign journeys
have enabled me to make; we will now review the observa
tions I have made in our own country.
     I
     commenced by determining the boundaries of the slate
and anthraxiferous districts of Brabant, and of the northern
part of the province of Hainault, which led me to ascertain
that at the farm of Hongrée, near Ronquières, the conglome
rates, the schist, and the red psammites of the lower quartzo
schistous system repose in unconformable stratification upon
the truncated beds of the slate formation.     Now it is to be
remarked, that in the north of Belgium the upper slate sy
stem is generally very little developed or entirely wanting,
which explains this fact which is contrary to what        have                  I
hitherto observed on the northern edge of the Ardennes,
where the slate and anthraxiferous formations are not merely
stratified in a perfectly conformable manner, but also pass so
insensibly from one to the other, that it is impossible to trace
a line of demarcation between the two formations.
     Ialso discovered several undescribed beds of porphyry,
namely, at a quarter of a league north of Henamyeres; to the
south of Audimont, to the south and south-west of Fauqué,
in the road from Monstreux to Grand Abay, and near the road
from Monstreux to Nivelles.           These beds hardly deviate
from a straight line drawn from Enghien to Nivelles.
   The porphyries vary in texture, and have produced some
slight alterations in the schistose rocks near Monstreux, which
will be noticed in detail, when we have examined the slate
formation of the north of Belgium in                 all
                                                  extent.  its

modern chalk formations.          have made
                                   I            great  many excur

                                        the different modifications
which they present; and        have thus laid down the outlines
of operations, the details    of I

   The forest of Aix is composed of sand and of freestone be

originally covered the whole country, and would still conceal
 the subjacent rocks, but for the numerous valleys which furrow
it, and whose origin         consequently posterior       the last ter             to

chalk.
    These modifications being observed along a line running
from N.W., to the S.E., and terminating at Borcette, we may
conclude with great probability that the changes which the
cretaceous rocks have undergone were the effect of some
plutonian agencies connected with the phaenomena of the
mineral and hot springs of this town.
      Ishall conclude this report with some remarks on the mo
dern deposit of Flanders.
    It consists for the most part of a clay more or less plastic,
grayish, calcariferous, sometimes sandy, and containing pro
ducts of art, and some shells analogous to those which live
upon our coasts at the present period. This clay forms a
horizontal bed which in some localities is three metres thick.
    Under the clay in a great many places is found a layer of
 turf, which sometimes attains the thickness of five metres, and
 which is composed, according to the observations of M. Bel
 paire (Memoir on the changes which the coast from Antwerp
 to Boulogne has undergone), of two distinct parts, namely, the
 upper part of terrestrial, and the lower of aquatic plants. Be
 neath the turf clay is also sometimes found, but more gene
 rally there is nothing but sand, in which shells analogous to
 those now found in the sea are met with.
    The modern deposit forms a band bounded on the sea side
 by the Dunes, and on the land side by a sinuous line traced
 on the map which accompanies the Report*.              It is easy to
 distinguish this deposit from the neighbouring formations by
 its clayey nature, the fossils      contains, and
                                           it           perfect hori         its

        SEPARATION OF MAGNESIA FROM LIME AND ALUMINA.
     According to M. Anthon, when tungstate of soda is added to a
  solution containing the above-mentioned earths, the lime and alumina
  are precipitated together in the state of tungstates, even should the
  solution be rather acid : the magnesia is left in solution, and tartaric
  acid prevents the precipitation of the alumina.         Tungstic acid can
  not be substituted for the    tungstate   of soda.

              UReA   : MODE   IN WHICH       IT ExISTS IN URINE.
     According to MM. Cap and Henry, Urea does not exist in
 urine uncombined, but united with different acids in different beings
 —in man combined principally with lactic acid; in ruminating
 animals with hippuric acid; in serpents and birds with lithic acid,
 or at least with the peculiar acid which according to M. Liebig is
  its radical.
     The natural lactate of urea obtained from the urine of man is
 identical with the same salt artificially prepared; the salts of urea
 are easily obtained by double decomposition.

                             LACTATE OF UREA,
     According to MM. Cap and Henry, when urine is evaporated,
 there is deposited a considerable quantity of crystalline salts, formed
 principally of chlorides, alkaline sulphates, calcareous and am
 moniaco-magnesian phosphates.           If this saline mass be separated by
 filtration, a brown very acid liquor is obtained, on the addition of
 alcohol to which, crystalline and hygrometric grains are formed,
 which when purified by charcoal become prismatic deliquescent
 crystals, of a sharp taste and which redden litmus paper.            If these
 crystals are treated with hydrate of zinc and with alcohol, there is
 obtained a lactate of zinc, which is insoluble in the alcoholic liquid,
 but soluble in water; and also by evaporation of the alcohol very
pure urea, which is not hygrometric, and possessed of all the
characteristic properties of that substance.           It is then evident that
the    crystalline  grains obtained  by   the   simple  concentration of the
urine freed from the chlorides and other salts, are principally con
stituted of lactate of urea.
    Artificial lactate of urea is obtained by first preparing lactate of
lime by adding slacked lime or chalk to sour milk; this salt is then
decomposed by dissolving 100 parts of it which have been dried at
248°, in 200 parts of hot water and 41 parts of crystals of oxalic
acid; this solution contains 75 parts of lactic acid as contained in
salts, and there are to be added to it 73 parts of pure dry urea; the
solution is to be filtered, evaporated with a gentle heat, and set to
crystallize.
    It is however preferable to prepare lactate of urea by double
decomposition, either by treating the oxalate of urea with lactate of

lime, or by sulphate of urea and lactate of oarytes. The oxalate of
urea has been described by Berzelius;     it is composed of 37.44
oxalic acid + 62-56 urea; it is prepared by direct combination; by
solution in water and evaporating with care, the salt is obtained
either in a mass of interlaced prismatic needles, or in pearly laminae.
  The natural and artificial lactate of urea crystallize in elongated
six-sided prisms, the summits of which are inclined.             These
crystals are white, hygrometric, and very deliquescent; their taste is
cooling and sharp;     they are very soluble in water and in alcohol
and aetherized alcohol,  but much less so in pure ather. When
moderately heated they first fuse, then volatilize without decom
position and sublime. If the heat be too great the salt decomposes,
leaving a black coaly residue.

   ACTION OF CHLORIDE OF TIN ON SULPHURO US ACID.               BY
                              M. HERING.
   It is well known that sulphurous acid, although one of the most
powerful reducing bodies, is nevertheless inferior to chloride of tin
in this respect, for a solution of sulphurous acid is completely re
duced by this chloride; it is on this energetic reducing property
 that is founded the known method of trying whether the muriatic
 acid of commerce contains sulphurous acid. In fact, if to a solution
 of sulphurous acid, mixed with a large quantity of hydrochloric acid,
 a small quantity of solution of chloride of tin be added, the liquor
 though at first perfectly clear becomes turbid after some time, and
 then assumes, at first a sulphur yellow colour, and afterwards a
 deeper one.     This action of chloride of tin is almost instantaneous
 when the mixed liquors are slightly heated, and then the odour of
sulphurous also ceases.
    The yellow precipitate has usually been considered as a mixture
of oxide of tin and sulphur; according to this opinion, an equivalent
of chlorine must be displaced by two equivalents of oxygen; and
there would occur at the same time the separation of an equivalent
of sulphur and the formation of chloride of tin.
    It was nevertheless natural to presume that the precipitate in
question might also be a peculiar sulphuret of tin.         In order to
determine this, a portion of a solution of sulphurous acid was mixed
with hydrochloric acid, and reduced in the manner stated by
chloride of tin, with the aid of heat. The precipitate obtained, after
being well washed and dried at a gentle heat, was subjected to the
following experiments.
   Put into caustic potash, it completely dissolved after some time,
 and the solution assumed a yellow colour; the acetic and hydro
 chloric acids produced in it a yellow precipitate without any
evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen; after remaining some time in
ammonia it was completely dissolved, with the exception of a slight
 trace, and the solution was of a deep yellow colour; the solution
was decomposed by the addition of acetic or hydrochloric acid: when
agitated and left for a long time in contact with sulphuret of carbon,
no change occurred either in colour or bulk; the solution, which
was separated by filtration, left but slight traces of sulphur by spon
taneous evaporation; the precipitate dissolved readily and without
residue in sulphuret of ammonia; acids precipitated yellow sulphuret
of tin and sulphur, accompanied with the disengagement of sulphur
etted hydrogen.
    Hydrochloric acid dissolved it gradually with the assistance of
heat, and gave out a great quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen, but
slight traces of sulphur were separated; the solution with potash
and ammonia yielded white precipitates, soluble in an excess of these
alkalis.
   According to these researches, the substance produced      by the   re
action of chloride of tin on sulphurous acid is a sulphuret   of tin. M.

of itscomposition   by combustion, heated 228 parts  in the   air small

porcelain capsule; the mean of two experiments left 182 parts of
white powder; and the atomic weight of sulphuret of tin being
1137-63 and that of oxide of tin 935:29, the sulphuret in question
left a quantity of oxide nearly corresponding to that of the sulphuret.
   The result of the reaction of chloride of tin on sulphurous acid,
consists then in the precipitation of sulphuret of tin on one hand, and
                                                                                          2 at.

added chloride of barium to the tincture made with boiling water; it
formed an abundant blue precipitate, and the liquor was entirely de
colorated at the expiration of 24 hours.
    The washed precipitate was of a deep blue colour, and it had in
part the properties of a compound of the blue colour of the litmus
with barytes. To examine whether the dried precipitate contained
any sulphate of barytes, it was heated to redness in a platina cru
 cible, and moistened with hydrochloric acid, which disengaged sul
phuretted hydrogen gas. Besides this I evaporated the tincture of
litmus to dryness, and then heated the residue to redness; the ashes,
besides carbonate of potash and chloride of potassium, contained
 some sulphate of potash.
    The gradual decomposition of sulphate of potash by the organic
matter, and especially the sulphuretted hydrogen which results from
it,  appears then       to the principal cause

France, in the section of mineralogy.
   The Academy of France has also awarded the sum of 3000 francs
to Professor Doyere of the College of Henry IV. for his translation
of Dr. Buckland's Bridgewater Treatise, and has placed this work on
the list of prize books to be distributed in the Colleges of France.
   M. Villemain, in his report to the French Academy (Journal des
Debats, 31 May 1839), states that this prize is awarded to M.
Doyere for having published “la meilleure Traduction d'un ouvrage
de Morale,” that has appeared        during the last year. A similar
reward has also been given to M. Thurot for his translation of
Epictetus into French.

of presenting his “second series” of “Researches in Embryology”
to the Royal Society (of which an abstract was given in our sup

that the fact regarding spermatozoa reaching the surface of the ovary
had been previously discovered by Dr. Bischoff, of Heidelberg.

ITbours, a fortunate
       is some time since, that during my electro-magnetic
                        accident conducted me to the discovery
                                                                         la
that we might by voltaic action make copies in relief of an en
graved copper plate, and that a new inverted copy of those in
relief might be obtained by the same process, so that the power
was obtained of multiplying the copper copies to any extent.
By this voltaic process the most delicate and even microscopic
lines are reproduced, and the copies are so identical with the
original that the most rigorous examination cannot find the
least difference.  I send you in the accompanying packet two
specimens of such plates, which I hope you will accept with
kindness.    The one which is in relief is the copy of an ori
ginal engraved with the burin; the second is the copy of that
in relief, and consequently identical with the original. The
third is the original plate, but covered with reduced copper.
I  had the intention of making a second copy, but unfortu
nately, the plates adhere so strongly at times that it is im
possible to separate them.            I
                                 cannot tell the cause of this           in
timate union which occasionally occurs, but it appears to be
the case only when the copper at the surface of which the re
duction is effected is brittle, and consequently is lamellar and
porous. I may dispense with describing more at large the
apparatus that I make use                 of.

162               Dr. Jacobi   on various subjects   of
d cloison where the engraved plate is used in the place of the
ordinary copper plate, being plunged in the solution of sulphate
of copper.    I    have found it necessary that a galvanometer
with short wires should always make part of the circuit, so
that one may judge of the force of the current and direct the
action; the latter being effected by separating the electro
motive plates more or    f     from each other or modifying the
length of the conjunctive wire, or finally, diminishing more
or less the conducting power of the liquid on the zinc side;
but for the success of the operation it is of great importance
that the solution of copper should be always perfectly satu
rated.    The action should not be too rapid : from 50 to 60
grains of copper should be reduced on each square inch in
24 hours. The accompanying plates have been formed, one in
two days, the other in one day only, and that is the reason why
their state of aggregation is not so solid and compact as that of
the small piece, No. 4, which has been reduced more slowly.
   It is to be understood that we may reduce the sulphate of
copper by making the current of a single voltaic pair pass
through the solution by copper electrodes; as the anode is
oxidized the cathode becomes covered with reduced copper,
and the supply of concentrated solution may then be dis
pensed with. According to theory one might expect that ex
actly the same quantity of copper oxidized on one side would
                                 I
be reduced on the other, but have always found a difference
more or less great, so that the anode loses more than the cath
 ode gains.      The difference appears to be nearly constant,
for it does not augment after a certain time, if the experiment be
prolonged.      A thoroughly concentrated solution of sulphate
of copper   is not decomposable by electrodes of the same metal,
even on employing a battery of three or four pairs of plates.
The needle is certainly strongly affected as soon as the cir
cuit is completed, but the deviation visibly diminishes and
verv soon returns almost to zero.          If
                                           the solution be diluted
with water to which a few drops of sulphuric acid have been
added, the current becomes very strong and constant, the
decomposition goes on very regularly, and the engraved cath
ode becomes covered with copper of a fine pink red co
lour.   If   we replace the solution of sulphate of copper by
                                                          ãº
pure water acidulated with sulphuric acid, there is a strong
decomposition of water even on employing a single voltaic
couple.     The anode is oxidized, and hydrogen is
at the cathode.        At the commencement the reduction of
copper does not take place; it begins as soon as the liquid
acquires a blue colour, but          its
                                     state      of
                                               aggregation  is   al
ways incoherent.   I    have continued this  experiment   for three

                         conclude from this experiment that in
 secondary voltaic actions there is neither that simultaneity
 of effect, nor that necessity of entering into combination or
                                                                                                         163

 electrolytic actions.
    During my experiments many anomalies respecting these
 secondary actions have presented themselves which                    would                    it
 be too     embarrassing        describe here:
                                      to               fact there       in

 a  void which      will be difficult
                       it                 fill, because molecular forces

 portant part.
     With respect         the technical importance
                                 to                          these voltaic        of
 copies,I    would observe that we may use the engraved cathode,
 not only         of
                 metals more negative than copper, but also                                               of
 positive metals and their alloys, (excepting brass,) notwith

certainly a beautiful application of the voltaic battery.
   In the application of electro-magnetism to the movement
of machines, the most important obstacle always has been the
embarrassment and difficult manipulation of the battery. This
obstacle exists no longer.       During the past autumn and at a
season already too advanced,          I made, as you may perhaps
have learned by the gazettes, the first experiments in naviga
tion on the Neva, with a ten-oared shallop furnished with
 paddle-wheels, which were put into motion by an electro
 magnetic machine.        Although we journeyed during entire
 days, and usually with 10 or 12 persons on board,           I  was not
 well satisfied with this first trial, for there were so many faults
 of construction and want of insulation in the machines and
 battery which could not be repaired on the spot, that I was
 terribly annoyed. All these repairs and important changes
 being accomplished the experiments will shortly be recom
 menced. The experience of the past year combined with the
 recent improvements of the battery give as the result, that to
 produce the force of one horse (steam-engine estimation) it
 will require a battery of 20 square feet of platina distributed
                                  I
 in a convenient manner, but hope that from 8 to 10 square
 feet will produce the effect.     If  heaven preserves my health,
 which is a little affected     by   continual labours, I hope that
 within a  year   of this time,  I shall have equipped an electro
 magnetic vessel of from 40 to 50 horse power.
     In my paper, “On the application, &c.” have spoken I
 of the influence which those magneto-electric currents which
 you had discovered a short time before, would exert on the
 progress of electro-magnetic machines. They are properly
 the cause that the expectations which have been entertained
 regarding these machines have not as yet been fulfilled.            But
 if one examines them more nearly these currents are not so
 disadvantageous as have been supposed.             Experiments which
I   have made     by interposing   a  galvanometer      or a voltameter
 have taught me that during the action of the machine the
 electrolytic action of the battery is much less, and sometimes
 not more than half that which takes place when the machine
 is stopped, the current still passing by the helices which sur
 round the bars of iron. Thus if on the one part the magneto
 electric currents diminish the force of the machine, on the
 other the electrolytic dissolution of the zinc, which makes the
 greatest part of the current expense, is at the same time con
 siderably diminished.       I have not as yet succeeded in com

memoir of myself and M. Lenz is that the attraction of electro
magnets is as the square of the force of the current, or as the
square of the electrolytic action of the battery. It appears that
this  important   law holds   good   for machines in motion; at
least the experiments                  I
                           have made on that point do not de
part from it more than may be admitted as the error of ob
servation or the result of accidental circumstances.

  with the number and importance of the desiderata in physical and
meteorological science, which may wholly or in part be supplied by
observations made under such highly favourable and encouraging cir
cumstances as those afforded by the liberality of Her Majesty's Go
vernment on this occasion.       While they wish therefore to omit no
thing in their enumeration of those objects which appear to them
deserving of attentive inquiry on sound scientific grounds, and from
which consequences may be drawn of real importance, either for the
settlement of disputed questions, or for the advancement of knowledge
in any of        its
             branches, they deem        equally their duty     omit it pass                                 to             or

178                      Instructions            for      the Scientific Expedition
tions. The first comprehends the actual distribution of the magnetic
 influence over the globe, at the present epoch, in its mean or average
 state, when the effects of temporary fluctuations are either neglected
 or eliminated by extending the observations over a sufficient time to
 neutralize their effects. The other comprises the history of all that
 is not permanent in the phenomena, whether it appear in the form
 of momentary, daily, monthly, or annual change and restoration, or
 in progressive changes not compensated by counter changes, but
 going on continually accumulating in one direction, so as in the
 course of many years to alter the mean amount of the quantities ob
 served. These last-mentioned changes hold the same place, in the
 analogy above alluded to, with respect to the mean quantities and
 temporary fluctuations, that the secular variations in the planetary
 movements must be regarded as holding, with respect to their mean
 orbits on the one hand, and their perturbations of brief period on the
other.

180           Instructions   for      the Scientific Expedition
vations made on terra firma, or on ice, the opportunity should be
seized of going through the regular series on ship-board with more
than usual diligence and care, so as to establish by actual expe
riment in the only unexceptionable manner the nature and amount
of the corrections due to the ship's action for that particular geo
graphical position, and by the assemblage of all such observations
to afford data for concluding them in general.
   Fourthly. No change possible to be avoided should be made in the
disposition of considerable masses of iron in the ships during the
whole voyage; but if such change be necessary, it should be noted.
   Fifthly. When crossing the magnetic line of no dip it would be
desirable to go through the observation for the dip with the instru
ment successively placed in a series of different magnetic azimuths,
by which the influence of the ship's magnetism in a vertical direc
tion will be placed in evidence.
   On land, or on ice.—As the completeness and excellence of the                                    in
 struments with which the Expedition will be furnished will author
 ise the utmost confidence in the results obtained by Captain Ross's
 well-known scrupulosity and exactness in their use, the redeter
 mination of the magnetic elements at points where they are                                         al
 ready considered as ascertained, will be scarcely less desirable than
 their original determination at stations where they have never before
 been observed.     This is the more to be insisted on, as lapse of time
 changes these elements in some cases with considerable rapidity;
 and it is therefore of great consequence that observations to be com
 pared should be as nearly cotemporary as possible, and that data
 should be obtained for eliminating the effects of secular variations
 during short intervals of time, so as to enable us to reduce the ob
 servations of a series to a common epoch.
    On the other hand it cannot be too strongly recommended, stu
 diously to seek every opportunity of landing on points (magnetically
 speaking) unknown, and determining the elements of those points
 with  all possible precision.     Nor should          neglected, whenever
                                                             it   be
the slightest room for doubt subsists,            to
                                                determine      the same time
                                                                        at

                                  the stations       observation
 and longitude.     When the observations are made             ice,     onneed              is
less  to remark that this will        be
                                      universally necessary.
    With this general recommendation will              unnecessarybe       enu                to

        It   is not to be supposed that Captain Ross, having already signal
ized himself by attaining the northern magnetic pole, should require
any exhortation to induce him to use his endeavours to reach the
southern.    On the contrary, it might better become us to suggest
for his consideration, that no scientific datum of this description, nor
any attempt to attain very high southern latitudes, can be deemed
 important enough to be made a ground for exposing to ertraordinary
 risk the lives of brave and valuable men. The magnetic pole, though
 not attained, will yet be pointed to by distinct and unequivocal indi
 cations; viz. by the approximation of the dip to 90°; and by the con
 vergence of the magnetic meridians on               sides towards              suchall                                 it.    If

   To pursue this phenomenon successfully, and to promote in other
directions the theory of terrestrial magnetism, it was necessary to
extend and vary the stations of observation, and to adopt at                                                         all  a

186                   Instructions               for    the Scientific Expedition
    It remains to say a few words of the instrumental means which
 have been adopted for the attainment of these ends.
    The magnetic instruments belonging to each observatory and in
 constant use, are, 1. a declination instrument; 2. a horizontal force
 magnetometer; 3. a vertical force magnetometer.                     These instru
 ments are constructed after the plan adopted by Professor Lloyd in
 the Magnetic Observatory of Dublin. The magnet, in the two
 former, is a heavy bar, fifteen inches long, and upwards of a pound
 in weight. In the declination instrument the magnet rests in the
 magnetic meridian, being suspended by fibres of silk without torsion.
 In the horizontal force magnetometer, the magnet is supported by
 two parallel wires, and maintained in a position at right angles to
 the magnetic meridian by the torsion of their upper extremities.
 In both instruments the changes of position of the magnet are read
 off by means of an attached collimater having a divided scale in                                                         its
 focus.    The magnetometer for the vertical force                   bar resting by            is   a

shortly after the establishment of the Van Diemen's Land observatory.
The observations there will have especial interest, since, taken in con
junction with those simultaneously making in Van Diemen's Land,
 they will decide the important question, how far that exact cor
 respondence of the momentary magnetic perturbations which has
been observed in Europe, obtains in so remote a region, between
 places separated by a distance equal to that between the most widely
distant European stations.
   In the interval between quitting Van Diemen's Land and return
ing to it again, opportunities will no doubt occur of performing
more than one other series of magnetometer observations, the lo
cality of which may be conveniently left to the judgement of Cap
tain Ross, bearing in mind the advantage of observing at stations
as remote as possible from both Van Diemen's Land and New Zea
land.
  The research for the southern magnetic pole and the exploration
of the antarctic seas will afford, it may be presumed, many oppor
tunities of instituting on land hitherto unknown, or on firm ice when
the vessel may be for a time blockaded, observations of this descrip
tion; and in the progress of the circumnavigation, the line of coast
observed or supposed to exist under the name of Graham's Land, or
those of the islands in that vicinity, South Shetland, Sandwich Land,
and finally on the homeward voyage the Island of Tristan d'Acunha,
will afford stations each of                    its
                                     own particular interest.

188                  Instructions      for the Scientific Expedition
if any, should be noticed, though it is at present believed that they
have no influence.
   During an earthquake in Siberia in 1829, the direction of the
horizontal needle, carefully watched by M. Erman, was uninflu
enced; should a similar opportunity occur, and circumstances per
mit, it should not be neglected.
   Should land or secure ice be found in the neighbourhood of the
magnetic pole, every attention will of course be paid to the procuring
a complete and extensive series of magnetometric observations, which
in sucha locality would form one of the most remarkable results of
the Expedition.
                                 2. FIGURE         of   THE EARTH.
   The Expedition being provided with invariable pendulums, with all
the necessary apparatus for determining the length of the seconds
pendulum, it will be highly desirable to have this important observa
tion made at several points, especially in high southern latitudes,
and generally speaking at points as remote as possible from those
at which it has already been determined.       The selection of these
must depend on local circumstances, as regards convenience for
landing the instruments and executing the operations, as well as on
the times of arrival at the several points.
   It would also be desirable, if a convenient opportunity occurs, to
swing the pendulums on the top of some high mountain; in which
case they should also be swung at the foot of the same mountain, in
order to determine the difference produced by the elevation, or other
effect of the high land.
   Another experiment which it would be desirable to make, is to
swing the pendulum on a large field of fixed ice, as far from the
land as possible; and likewise on the nearest shore to such position.
In    all
        these cases more than one pendulum should            used; and                 be
at  least three knife edges  should      employed,      be

190                  Instructions            for        the Scientific Expedition
standards, whenever the ships are in company, will become checks
on each other through the medium of the register.                 Nor should the
opportunity be lost of comparing these standard barometers (by the
intervention of portable ones) with the standard barometer of the
Cape Observatory, and with that used at Port Arthur, Van Diemen's
Land, in the meteorological register kept by Sir                Franklin's orders      J.
by Mr. Lempriere, as well as with the standard at the observatory
at Paramatta, and with any other instrument likely to be referred to
as a standard or employed in research elsewhere.
    The general fact that the barometer at the level of the sea does
not indicate a mean atmospheric pressure of equal amount in all
parts of the earth, but, on the contrary, that the equatorial pressure
is uniformly less in its mean amount than that at and beyond the
tropics,    was first noticed by Von Humboldt, and has since been de
monstrated by the assemblage of many observations made during
voyages and on land by Schouw, as well as by other observations,
an account of which will be found in the Reports of the Meteoro
logical Committee of the South African Philosophical Society for
 1836 and 1837. This inequality of mean pressure is a meteorolo
gical phenomenon of the greatest and most universal influence, as it
is,     fact,

menon; as well     as   for ascertaining, also apart from those influences,
the existence or non-existence of that difference between the diurnal
and nocturnal maxima and minima, which has         been proved to exist
in  some localities, and surmised to be general *.
    Connected with the equatorial barometric depression, and the
ascensional current of heated air which produces that depression, is
a phenomenon which may serve to elucidate the mechanism of this
current in its origin, as well as to illustrate the mode in which as
cending currents occasionally produce rain. It cannot be supposed
that the whole body of the equatorial atmosphere rises en masse, or
with any regularity or steadiness. Such a movement would be out
of analogy with what we know of the movements of fluids in general.
Its tendency to rise is general, but this tendency is diverted by a
thousand local influences, and concentred on particular points, where
it results in ascending columns and sheets, between which wind
flaws, capricious in their direction and intensity, and often amount
ing to sharp squalls, mark out the course of their feeders and of the
 indraft of cooler air from a distance to supply their void. Now the
 existence of such ascending columns is rendered frequently visible
in a very unequivocal way, by vast piled-up masses of cloud of that
peculiar form which has been called cumulostratus, the bottom being
flat and ill-defined, the upper parts towering to an immense height,
and ragged with great protuberances.         From the bases of these
great cumular piles are almost constantly seen to descend those vio
 lent showers so common in the calm latitudes.
    It would be interesting on many accounts to obtain measures, even
if somewhat vague, of the altitudes at which the bases of these clouds
rest, as well as of the height of their summits, and to measure the
 temperature of the rain which falls from them at successive periods,
 as they pass over the ship, so as to ascertain whether the rain which
falls along their axis be not colder (from coming at least in part
from a greater elevation) than that from their skirts.     The vapour
 plane, in such circumstances being nearly or precisely uniform over
vast tracts of sea, the altitude of the base of such cloud vertically
overhead may be considered the same as that of any other favour
ably situated for measure. In fact the determination of the mean
height of the vapour plane at and near the equator is one of high me
teorological import, and is connected by no circuitous steps with all
the most interesting questions regarding the distribution of aqueous
vapour over the globe and the irrigation of the continents.
     5. DISTRIBUTION           of TEMPERATURE IN THE SEA                   AND LAND.
   Connected as this subject is with meteorology, it requires in some
points of view to be considered apart. As the currents in the atmo
sphere are produced by the difference of temperature in     polar and           its
equatorial regions,      may                                                                 by

                           it    contended are those    the ocean          of
differences   temperature due
             of                  the same geographical causes. Such

 192              Instructions             for    the Scientific Expedition
  is the view taken by M. Arago in his elaborate instructions for the
  voyage of the Bonite, and it would appear undoubtedly more just than
  that which attributes them wholly to the friction and pressure of the
  winds. Nevertheless it must not be forgotten that there is an essen
  tial difference in the modes of action in the two cases. The sun's
 heat is effective in heating the air mainly from below, where it is in
  contact with the earth or water which absorb the rays and commu
  nicate them to the air above. In the sea the case is otherwise.
  The sun's rays are totally absorbed at the surface, and no ray reaches
 the bottom of any sea deserving the name. No deep stratum of
 water, therefore, can be permanently maintained by the sun's direct
  heat at a temperature greatly above what it would have independ
  ently of its direct action.       Hence the motive power in a system of
  currents so    originating   must be sought, not in the ascensional force
 at the   equator,   but in a descensional one in the polar regions, or rather
 in that one    polar   region in which winter prevails.       The order of the
 phenomena then is precisely the reverse of what obtains in the
 atmosphere; moreover the seat of the efficient agency is not only
 much less extensive than in the case of the atmospheric currents, but
 also subject to a semiannual shifting from one to the other extremity
 of the earth's axis, both which causes must tend greatly to diminish
 the average energy of the effect.
     Practically speaking, the question resolves itself into one of fact,
  which observation only can decide.            Is there in the whole column
 of water between the surface of the ocean and its bed at the poles,
 as compared with a column of equal depth at the equator and in free
 communication with             it,
                               descensional power          not and what     or   its                 of is

194           Instructions   for  the Scientific Expedition
bourhood of the Lagullas Bank, will, of course, not be lost sight of
as the ships approach to and leave the Cape.
   The distribution of temperature over the globe must greatly depend
on the intensity which the solar rays possess on attaining the surface
of the earth after traversing the atmosphere in different latitudes. To
subject this point to direct inquiry in a mode which after many years'
trial has been found to give very satisfactory results, Actinometers are
provided, and accompanied with very precise directions for their
use. They should be observed only when the sky in the immediate
neighbourhood of the sun is perfectly free from visible cloud. On the
other hand, depression of temperature caused by diurnal and nocturnal
radiation by the only means we at present possess for that purpose,_
viz. that of thermometers blackened and exposed in reflectors to the
sky,_will form a useful and valuable supplement to the actinometric
researches.    With a view to the collection of facts illustrative of the
distribution of temperature on land, wherever the ships may touch
with a prospect of remaining some days, no time should be lost, on
landing, in burying in the earth one or more bottles (filled with spi
rits, if there should be danger of water freezing), well packed in
cases, or boxes stuffed with non-conducting matter, such as woollen
cloth, pounded charcoal, &c., but so as to leave easy access to the
neck, which should be wide enough to introduce the bulb and stem
of a good thermometer, so as to take the temperature of the con
tained liquid rapidly, before it can have become altered by exposure
in the air on taking up the bottle. Bottles so arranged should be
buried at depths of three, six, nine, twelve, &c. feet”, according to
the facilities of penetrating the soil, and abandoned till the time of
departure, so as to ensure their acquiring the precise temperature of
the soil; and when taken up should immediately have the tempera
ture of the included liquids ascertained.         In case of very prolonged
sojourn, monthly readings should be taken. The temperatures of all
springs and wells should also be diligently noted and registered.
   Connected with the transcalescence of the air, is the transpa
rency of the sea. The stimulus of the solar light no doubt affects
the surface of mollusca at great depths, and numerous points of phy
sical inquiry would be elucidated if we knew the co-efficients of ex
tinction of the solar rays by pure sea water. As far as the luminous
rays are concerned (or at least the chemical), the actual intensity of
these rays at various depths might be very easily ascertained, both
for direct sunshine and that of cloudy daylight, by the aid of Mr.
Talbot's sensitive paper; which, duly guarded from wet by varnish
and interposition between glass plates, might be sunk, face upwards
in a small frame, while a portion of the same paper, cut from the
same sheet, should be similarly exposed on deck, and partially shaded,
inch by inch, from minute to minute, (or for a smaller interval accord
ing to the sensitiveness of the paper) with a view to immediate com
parison, between decks by a light not strong enough to alter the tint.
   A simple and convenient mode of photometric measurement is also
       * These are the depths adopted in Mr. Forbes's recent experiments.

   The determination of refractions near the horizon, both of celes
tial and terrestrial objects in high southern latitudes, will form a
very interesting subject of study.  They may be pursued in various
modes,         of which perhaps the        easiest is to note the disappearance of
particular stars behind the horizontal edge of                 a board, erected at
some considerable               distance from a fixed point of observation, and
then to ascertain, with all precision, the altitude of the line of dis
appearance, accompanying such observation with the height of the
barometer and thermometer. Vertical diameters of the sun or moon,
when very near the horizon, with the corresponding altitudes, will
also be of use, as well as measurements of the distances of two con
siderable stars on the same vertical, and direct measures of the alti
tudes of one and the same star in the progress of         diurnal course        its
when near the horizon.      The curve      terrestrial refraction might

The Council of the Royal Society, while they have been occupied
in preparing instructions for making meteorological observations at
the fixed magnetic observatories about to be established by the Go
vernment at Montreal, St. Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, Van
Diemen's Land, and the different stations to be visited by the Ant
arctic Expedition under Captain James Clark Ross, and in reporting
on various references made to them of applications for instructions
for similar observations by the Secretary of State for the Colonies,
the Honourable Court of Directors of the East India Company, and
the Corporation of the Trinity House, have availed themselves of
this opportunity for proposing a plan of extensive co-operation, the
general adoption of which by observers cannot fail to produce the
most advantageous results to meteorological science.
   After maturely considering the subject, they do not presume to
anticipate that what they may suggest will not beliable to objections,
for their object will be to include within their compass many excel
lent series of observations which are already in progress, rather than
to propose a degree of theoretical perfection, the attainment of which
the present state of the science may not perhaps admit of Systematic
co-operation is the essential point to which at present every thing
else should be sacrificed; and co-operation on almost any plan would
most certainly be followed by more beneficial results than any number
of independent observations, however perfect they might be in
themselves.
   The plan of co-operation should, in fact, be regarded at present as
merely temporary and preparatory; but if steadily adhered to for a
few years, it would certainly furnish the most perfect data for               own                    its
correction, which could then from time                time      applied with fa

                                 1.   BARoMETERs.
    Times of observation.—The purposes of meteorological observa
tions would be most perfectly and most expeditiously obtained by
hourly observations throughout the year; but as at present such a
course of unremitting labour cannot be hoped for, it is necessary to
select periods, at longer intervals, calculated to embrace the extremes
of the periodical oscillations to which the pressure of the atmosphere
is subject, and to ensure that uniformity of system at different sta
tions on which the value of such observations so much depends.
It is probable that the hours of 3 A.M., 9 A.M., 3 P.M., and 9 P.M.,
nearly coincide with the daily maxima and minima of the barometric
column at the level of the sea, over a large portion of the globe; and
it is desirable that as extensive a comparison as possible should be
instituted at these hours.
   It is not, however, too much to expect that in regular observatories
hourly observations should be made, for 24 hours, once in every
month; and when this cannot be effected, it is of the utmost im
portance that they should be made at least four times in the year,
namely, at the summer and winter solstices, and at the spring and
autumn equinoxes.       One of the results of these hourly observations
would probably be the indication of the exact times of the daily
maxima and minima of pressure at different stations, which, if not
found to coincide with the hours provisionally adopted, might ulti
mately be substituted for them under future directions.
   Hourly observations at the equinoxes and solstices have been al
 ready instituted at numerous points both of Europe and America,
at the suggestion of Sir John Herschel, whose directions should be
strictly attended     to.
                       They are    follows:–

used  to  obtain the time, and, when practicable, by some observation

202            Instructions          for   the Scientific       Erpedition
 of an astronomical nature by which the time can be ascertained
 within a minute or two.
   The Council now propose to extend            these observations in regular
  series to the 21st of         every month, with the same reservation with
  regard to Sundays.
     It is to be hoped that in regular meteorological observations the
 six-hourly observations may not be found to be impracticable through
 out the year; but in any case where it may be impossible to observe
  regularly at 3 A.M., an effort should be made to include the hour on
 the days of the new and full moon, and quadratures, or at least on
 the days of the new and full moon;–as it must be borne in mind,
 that in what concerns the great meteorological questions on which
 the most interesting features of the subject depend, the night is quite
 as important as the day, and has been hitherto far too much neglected.
     Whatever hours, however, may be selected for the regular series
 of observations, the greatest care should be taken not to substitute
 or interpolate in an irregular manner observations at any other hours.
     It is much to be wished that occasional observations may be made
 under remarkable circumstances, such as during great rises or great
 falls of the barometer, at the period of great storms, earthquakes,
 &c.; but such observations should be registered apart.
     The barometer should be placed in an apartment subject to as
 little variation of temperature as possible, and in a good light; and
 to facilitate night observations, an arrangement should be made for
 placing behind it a light screened by a sheet of white paper, or other
 diaphanous substance. Great care should be taken to fix it in a
 perpendicular position by the plumb-line.         Its height must be care
 fully ascertained above some permanent and easily-recoverable mark,
 either in the building in which it is situated, or in some more per
 manent building, or rock, in its immediate vicinity; and no pains
should be spared to ascertain the relation which such mark may bear
to the level of high and of low water at spring tides, and ultimately
to the mean level of the sea.
     Changes in the adjustments of meteorological instruments should
be most carefully avoided; but whenever any alteration may be ab
solutely necessary, they should be made with                     all
                                                         deliberation, scru

thence arising   in   the reading          of

                                             unavoidable circumstances                  of
absence,  or    from other causes, blanks occur, no attempts        fill them to

height 30-500 inches, the difference is 0.5 inch, which divided by
50 gives 0-01 inch to be added to the observed height, producing
30:51, the corrected height; or if the observed height be 29 inches,
the difference, 1 inch, divided by 50, gives 02 inch to be sub
tracted from the observed height, giving 28'980 inches for the cor
rected height.
   The second correction required is for the capillary action of the
tube, the effect of which is constantly to depress the mercury in the
tube by a certain quantity inversely proportioned to the diameter of
the tube. In the instruments furnished to the fixed observatories
the amount has been experimentally determined during their con
struction, and marked upon the instrument; the quantity is always
to be added to the height of the mercurial column, previously cor
rected as before.   For the convenience of those who may have ba
rometers, the capillary action of which has not been so determined,
a table of the corrections for tubes of different diameters is placed
in the appendix.
   The marine barometers furnished to the Antarctic Expedition differ
in nothing from the other portable barometers but in the mode of
their suspension, and the necessary contraction of the tubes to pre
vent oscillation from the motion of the ship, and require the same
corrections.
   When these two corrections have been made in the first reading
of the portable barometer, it should agree with the direct observa
tion of the standard barometer; and it is very desirable that frequent
comparative observations should be made of the two instruments, in
order to ascertain whether there may be any permanent difference
between them. Should this be the case, the amount may be marked
upon the instrument, and allowed for as an index error, in order that,
if an accident should happen to one, the other may be substituted
for it without detriment to the regular series of observations.
   It is to be presumed that the portable barometer will frequently
be employed in ascertaining the altitude of remarkable points in the
vicinity of the observatories, or of the more permanent stations of
the Expedition.
   The instruments furnished to the observatories have been all                             in
dependently graduated and compared with the standard of the Royal
Society; and in        all

where n is the number of sun observations, the time corresponding
being the middle of the middle shade observation.
      A complete actinometer observation cannot consist of less than
 three sun and two shade observations intermediate; but the more
 there are taken the better, and in a very clear sunny day it is highly
 desirable to continue the alternate observations for a long time, even
 from sunrise to sunset, so as to deduce by a graphical projection the
 law of diurnal increase and diminution of the solar radiation, which
 will thus readily become apparent, provided the perfect clearness of
 the sky continue,       an indispensable condition in these observations,
 the slightest cloud or haze over the sun being at once marked by a
 diminution of resulting radiation.
    To detect such haze or cirrus, a brown glass applied before the
 eye is useful, and by the help of such a glass it may here be noticed
 that solar halos are very frequently to be seen when the glare of
 light is such as to allow nothing of the sort to be perceived by the
 unguarded eye.

212                  Instructions                  for   the Scientific            Expedition
   Every series of actinometer observations should be accompanied
with notices in the column of remarks of the state of the wind and
sky generally, the approach of any cloud (as seen in the coloured
glass) near to the sun; the barometer and thermometers, dry and
wet, should especially be read off more than once during the series,
if a long one, and, if kept up during several hours, hourly. The
times should be correct to the nearest minute, at least as serving to
calculate the sun's altitude; but if this be taken (to the nearest
minute or two) with a pocket sextant, or even by a style and shadow,
frequently (at intervals of an hour or less) when the sun is rising or
setting, it will add much to the immediate interest of the observa
tions.   When the sun is near the horizon, its reflection from the sea,
or any neighbouring water, must be prevented from striking on the
instrument; and similarly of snow in cold regions, or on great ele
vations in alpine countries.
    Every actinometer should be provided with a spare glass, and                                                           all

  Though out of the question in the circumstances immediately un
der contemplation, it may not be amiss to remind aeronauts, that
observations of the actinometer may, no doubt, be made with con
siderable ease and precision in the car of a balloon, and if accom
panied with good barometric and hygrometric simultaneous obser
vations aloft and below, would in every point of view be most pre
cious, thus adding one to the many useful subjects of inquiry in
those hitherto almost useless adventures.
                          4. RADIATING THERMoMETERs.
   As, however, the actinometer can only be observed at intervals
in perfectly clear weather, additional information with regard to solar
 radiation, of much interest, though not of so precise a nature, may
 be obtained, by the daily register of the maximum temperature of a
 register thermometer, with a blackened bulb exposed to the full ac
tion of the sun's rays. It may be placed about an inch above the
 bare soil, and screened from currents of air. The maximum tem
perature indicated by such a thermometer, even in cloudy weather,
 will generally be considerably above that of the air, and the maxima
                                       of its
 and mean daily maxima of              indications will, after        long series      a
of   observations, afford data         the utmost value           the history    to                     of
 climates.    The bulb of the thermometer should be about half an
 inch  in  diameter,    and   it may       uniformly blackened with lamp
                                                be
black and varnish.        The   graduation    should                    be
                                                          made upon the glass
 stem,  to prevent any inconvenience from the expansion and warping
 of the scale.

one experiment only can be made, the most advantageous hour should
be selected for the purpose. Now it is probable that the minimum
temperature of the air in the 24 hours may correspond with the
minimum temperature of the dew-point; and for the attainment of
a mean result, the time of the highest dew-point should be selected,
which would not differ much from 3 P.M., at which hour the obser
vation should on no account be omitted. The hygrometer should
also be observed, if possible, at 9 A.M. and 9 P.M., but the minimum
temperature might probably be substituted for the 3 A.M. observa
tion without any material error.
    Occasional observations of the dew-point under peculiar circum
stances, as for instance in the inhabited apartments of houses or be
tween the decks of the ships when laid up in their winter quarters in
the polar regions, could not but afford information of high practical
importance.
    All the ether of the dew-point hygrometer should be driven by
 the warmth of the hand from the covered ball into the uncovered,
 previously to an observation, and the ether should be dropped from
 a dropping-bottle very slowly upon the former. The temperature of
 the interior thermometer should be carefully noted upon the first ap
 pearance of the ring of dew upon the black bulb, and also            tem                           its

 9 P.M.
    The tenth compartment is appropriated to remarks on the clouds,
 and weather generally; and in the eleventh is to be noted, at noon,
 the longitude and latitude at sea.
    On a careful review of the month's observations, the maxima
 and minima results should have the algebraic signs + and — respec
 tively affixed.
     The second form is devoted to the corrected results of the obser
 vations, and to the optical comparison together of some of them, by
 their projection upon a scale of equal parts.
    The upper half of the sheet is vertically divided into two equal
parts, each prepared for half the month's observations, and accord
ingly ruled across into sixteen spaces for the daily observations, and
two for the sums and means of the quantities.           Each half is also
divided into five compartments.
    The first is for the date of the month and the phases of the moon.
    The second for the corrected height of the barometer at 32°Fahr.
    The third is appropriated to the elastic force of the aqueous vapour
corresponding to the dew-point, and which may be taken from
Table 5. in the Appendix B.
    The fourth is for the maximum and minimum of temperature, and
the mean of the two.
    And the fifth for occasional remarks.
   The lower half of the sheet is also vertically divided into two equal
parts, each of which is similarly divided into 31 columns for the daily
observations of a month; and these again subdivided into four, for
the six-hourly observations of each day. The vertical lines thus
formed are divided into 6 inches; and each inch into tenths of an
inch, and half-tenths, by horizontal lines.
   The left-hand compartment thus ruled, is intended for the projec
tion of curves of temperature; for this purpose each tenth of an
inch upon the scale must be reckoned a degree, which will be divided
by the faint line into halves.
   The value of the degree may be arbitrarily fixed, and inserted in
the margin according to convenience.       Towards the upper part of
the scale the results of the six-hourly observations should each be
marked by a dot in            its
                         appropriate space, and the dots may          after           be

     On either the scale of temperature or of pressure, occasional
comparisons    may be made with results obtained at other stations,
which,  if judiciously  selected, cannot fail to prove of high interest
and  importance.     They   should, however, be laid down in pencil, or
marked   by  a fainter line.
   At the bottom of the first skeleton form will be found a space pre
pared for the 24 hourly observations of the twenty-first day of the
month, both in their uncorrected and their corrected state. It is
divided into four compartments for 6 hours each. The instruments
which can with most facility be observed in this manner, are the ba
rometer with       attached thermometer, and the dry- and wet-bulb
                           its
thermometers; and columns are appropriated             each      these.      to                of                It

   MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT.
The elements on which the determination of the earth's magnetic
force is usually based are, the declination, the inclination, and the
intensity.   If a vertical plane be conceived to pass through the                                                         di
rection of the force, that direction will be determined when its                                                          in
clination to the horizon is given, as well as the angle which the
plane itself forms with the meridian; and               addition     these             if,   in                  to

that the force      completely
                           is    determined.
   For many purposes, however, and especially             the delicate                          in                        re

being thus found, the true declination changes are deduced from the
apparent, by multiplying them by the coefficient

   In order to obtain an exact result by the mode of experiment above
described, it is necessary that the actual changes of the declination
which may occur in the interval of the two readings, should be eli
minated.    The obvious method of accomplishing this, is to observe
the declination changes simultaneously with a second apparatus. If
such means, however, should not be at hand, the object may be at
tained by making a series of readings with the vernier of the torsion
circle alternately in two fixed positions (for example + 90° and
–  90°); the mean result will be independent of the declination
changes, provided the progress of these changes has been gradual
in the interval of the experiment.
   For the purpose of determining the absolute intensity of the hori
zontal component of the earth's magnetic force, the declination                                                 in

round their middle point, the magnet is maintained in a position at
right angles to the magnetic meridian.
   It is manifest from the nature of this suspension, that the weight
of the suspended body will tend to bring it into the position in which
the two portions of the wire are in the same plane throughout.    The
moment of the directive force is G sin v;—v denoting the angle
formed by the lines joining the bearing points above and below, or
the deviation from the plane of detorsion; and G being expressed by
the formula
                                             =   wº:

in which      w denotes the weight  of the suspended body, a half the                                    in
terval of the wires, and l their length.   The earth's magnetic force, on
the other  hand, tends to   bring  the  magnetic axis of the bar into the
magnetic meridian, with the force F sinu; in which u is the deviation
of the magnetic axis from the meridian, and F is the product of the
horizontal part of the earth's magnetic force into the moment of free
magnetism of the bar. The magnet being thus acted on by two
forces, will rest in the position in which their moments are equal.
When the instrument is so adjusted that u = 90°, or the magnet at
right angles to the magnetic meridian,
                                         F=      G sin v;
 and the ratio of the forces is known, when we know the angle v.
 But as one of these forces is constant, and the other variable, it is
 evident that the place of the magnet will vary around     mean po                           its

                       VERTICAL Force MAGNEToMETER.
    The instrument used in determining the changes of the vertical
component    of the magnetic force is a magnetic needle resting on
agate planes, by knife-edges, and brought to the horizontal position
by weights. From the changes of position of such a needle, the
changes of the vertical force may be inferred, when we know the
mean inclination at the place of observation, the azimuth of the plane
in which the needle moves, and the angle which the line connecting
the centre of gravity and centre of motion makes with the magnetic
axis. As, however, the determination of this latter constant would
involve the necessity of considerable additions to the apparatus, the
 plan adopted has been to adjust the needle so that the angle in
 question shall be nothing. The centre of gravity being thus brought
 to some point of the magnetic axis, the changes of the vertical force
 are connected with the changes of position of the needle by the
formula
                            # = cosa.cotan.                  0d:;
d : denoting the change of angle in parts of radius,          a the azimuth of
the plane in which the needle moves, and 6 the inclination.
    Construction.—The      magnetic needle is 12 inches in length. It
has a cross of wires at each extremity, attached by means of a small
ring of copper; the interval of the crosses being 13 inches. The
axis of the needle is formed at one part into a knife edge, and at the
opposite into a portion of a cylinder, having this edge for its axis,
the edge being adjusted to pass as nearly as possible through the
centre of gravity of the unloaded instrument.                The weights by
which the other adjustments are effected are small brass screws
moving in fixed nuts, one on each arm; the axis of one of the
 screws being parallel to the magnetic axis of the needle, and that
 of the other perpendicular to           it.
    The agate planes upon which the needle rests are attached                                   to
                                                                                                 a

                                         isa        for raising the needle off
 the planes, the contrivance for effecting this object being similar                             to

where t denotes the actual temperature (in degrees of Fahrenheit) at
the time of observation, and q the relative change of the magnetic
moment of the needle corresponding to one degree. As in the case
of the other instruments, however, it is not in general necessary to
apply these reductions to the individual results.
                         Times of Observation.
   The objects of inquiry in terrestrial magnetism may be naturally
classed under two heads, according as they relate, 1. to the absolute
values of the magnetic elements at a given epoch, or their mean va
lues for a given period; or 2. to the variations which these elements
undergo from one epoch to another.          It will be convenient to con
sider separately the observations relating to these two branches of
the subject.
                       Absolute DETERMINATIONs.
   By the method of observation which has been suggested for the
absolute declination, every determination of the position of the decli
nation bar is rendered absolute.       We have only to consider the va
rying angle between the magnetic axis of the bar and the line of col
limation of the fixed telescope, as a correction to be applied to the
constant angle (already determined) between the latter line and the
meridian.      It is manifest that if the firity of the line of collimation
of the telescope could be depended on, a single determination of the
latter angle would be sufficient.       But this is not to be trusted for
any considerable period; and it will be therefore necessary, from
time to time, to refer the line of collimation of the telescope to the
meridian, by means of the transit instrument.             This observation
may be repeated once a month, or more frequently if any change in
the position of the telescope be suspected.
    In the case of the intensity, there is another source of error (be
sides that due to a change in the position of the instruments) which
can only be guarded against by a repetition of absolute measure
 ments. The magnetic moment of the magnet itself may alter; and
 the observations of intensity changes afford no means of separating
 this portion of the effect from that due to a change in the earth's
 magnetism.      This separation can only be effected by means analo
 gous to those employed in the determination of the absolute value of
 the horizontal intensity; and accordingly one or other (or both) of
 the methods proposed for this determination should be occasionally
 resorted to. It is desirable that this observation should be repeated
 once in every month; and more frequently, whenever the changes ob
 served with the horizontal force magnetometer indicate, by their
progressive character, a change in the magnetic moment of the sus
pended bar.
    It would be easy, in theory, to devise a method by which the ver
tical force magnetometer might be made to serve in determining the
 absolute value of the vertical intensity.      The means which at pre
 sent offer themselves appear, however, to be surrounded with prac

 determined in absolute measure, the vertical intensity Y is inferred.
      For the purpose of observing the element 0, each observatory is
 furnished with an inclination instrument, the circle of which is
 9% inches       in diameter. The observation should be made in an open
 space, sufficiently remote from the magnets of the observatory, and
 from other disturbing influences; and a series of measures should
 be taken simultaneously with the two intensity magnetometers, for
  the purpose of eliminating the changes of the inclination which may
  occur in the course of the observation. As to the mode of observa
  tion, the best seems to be the usual one, the plane of the circle coin
  ciding with the magnetic meridian; but for the purpose of testing
  the axles of the needles, and the divided limb of the instrument, it
  is desirable that some observations should be made in various azimuths,
   —for example, every 30° of the azimuth circle commencing with the
   magnetic meridian.          The inclination is then inferred, from each
   pair of corresponding results, by the formula
                          cotan? 6  =  cotanº   &  + cotanº 2';
   & and    "being the observed angles of inclination in two planes at right
   angles to one another.         Where the inclination is great (as at Mon
   treal), this method will serve to test only a limited portion of the
   circumference of the axle and limb.              In this case the best course
   appears to be that pointed out by Major Sabine”, namely, to con
   vert one of the needles, temporarily, into a needle on Mayer's prin
    ciple, by loading it with sealing-wax; and to deduce the inclination,
    from the angles of position of the loaded needle, by the known for
    mula of Mayer. The observations here suggested having been very
    carefully made, and the inclination changes eliminated in the manner
    above explained, the observed difference between the mean and the
    result obtained in the magnetic meridian, should be applied as a cor
    rection for the errors of axle and limb to all future observations made
     in the meridian.
         These observations should be made at the same periods as those of
     the absolute horizontal intensity.
                             VARIATION     of THE ELEMENTs.
         The variations of the magnetic elements are, 1. Those variations
     whose amountis a function of the hour angle of the sun, or of his
     longitude; and which return to their original values at the same
      hour in successive days, or the same season in successive years.
      These, from their analogy to the corresponding planetary inequal
      ities, may be denominated periodical.           2. The variations, which are
      either  continually    progressive,    or else return to their former values
      in long and unknown periods; these may in like manner be deno
      minated secular. 3. The irregular variations, whose amount changes

triple observation, the position of the magnets being noted five mi
nutes before and after the regular hour.     The time of this triple ob
servation will be 2 P.M., Göttingen mean time.
   The barometer, and the wet and dry thermometers, will be regis
tered at each of the twelve magnetic hours.        No observation will
be taken on Sunday.
   No distinct series of observations is required for the determination
of the secular variations. In the case of the declination, the yearly
change will be obtained by a comparison of the monthly mean re
sults (for the same month and same hour) in successive years. The
observations of two years only will thus furnish 144 separate results,
from which both the periodical and the irregular changes are elimi
nated; so that great precision may be expected in the final result,
notwithstanding the limited period of observation.      The same mode
of reduction will apply to the two components of the intensity, pro
vided that no change shall have taken place in the magnetic moment
of the bars employed. In the latter event, recourse must be had to
the absolute determinations for a knowledge of the secular changes.
   The subject of the irregular movements has acquired a prominent,
and almost absorbing interest, from the recent discoveries of Gauss.
It has been ascertained that the resultant direction of the forces, by
which the horizontal needle is actuated at a given place, is incessantly
varying, the oscillations being sometimes small, sometimes very con
siderable;—that similar fluctuations occur at the most distant parts
of the earth's surface, at which corresponding observations have been
as yet made;—and that the instant of their occurrence is the same
everywhere.     The intensity of the horizontal force has been found
subject to analogous perturbations.
   For the full elucidation of the laws of these most interesting phe
nomena, it is of the first importance that the stations of observation
should be separated as widely as possible over the earth's surface,
and that their positions should be chosen near the points of maxima
and minima of the magnetic elements. This has been in a great mea
sure accomplished as regards the observatories about to be founded
by Her Majesty's Government.         The stations are wide asunder in
geographical position, and they are in the neighbourhood of points
of prominent interest in reference to the isodynamic lines. The re
sults of observation at these stations will soon testify whether the
shocks to which the magnetic needle is subject, are of a local or of
a universal character as regards the globe; and in either event we
may expect that they will furnish information of great value (in re
ference to a physical cause) as to the magnitude of the phenomena
in different places, and the elements on which it depends.
   In the observations destined to illustrate these phenomena, it is
proposed to follow, as nearly as possible, the plan laid down by
Gauss. One day in each month, namely, the last Saturday, will be
devoted to simultaneous observations on this system.*; the observa
tions commencing at 10 P.M. of the preceding eve (Göttingen mean
time), and continuing through the 24 hours.

         E
         called the attention of our readers to the first number of
       this work at the time of its publication. The work is now
brought to a close; but more abruptly than was originally intended,
owing to the increase of materials pointing out to the editor the ne
cessity of a different plan. He has, therefore, resolved upon publish
ing a history of early English mathematics, by which means he
will be better able to classify the subjects; whilst he prints the ma
nuscripts themselves, or such parts of them as are relevant to the
subject, in the form of illustrations.    This, indeed, appears to us
to be, upon the whole, a better plan than that which he first adopted,
and we look forward with considerable interest to the completion
of his arduous undertaking. That there are ample materials amongst
the manuscripts in our private and public libraries, we can entertain
no doubt; and we think it a matter of great advantage that these
treasures of the science of the middle ages should be investigated
by one who is at the same time a mathematician and an antiquary.
This combination of tastes and talents in the same mind is a rare

the intensity of heat and light that Bourne had to contend with, and
the then prevalent idea that heat and light (so far as the sun was
concerned) were necessarily in the same ratio, and essentially coin
cident in their place of action, we cannot but wonder at the opinion
being hazarded by a man of so sensible and modest a character: and
we are obliged to consider him an extraordinary person, even though
he mistakes (probably an error of the hand rather than the mind)
the side of the focus of light on which the focus of heat falls.

    VI. Two tables, one showing the time of high water at London
Bridge, the other the duration of moonlight.
    An extract from the first of these tables was given by Mr. Lub
bock in the Phil. Trans. for 1837, p. 103, of which the editor of
this collection was ignorant at the time his MS. was sent to press
(Rara, Corrections). It is a very curious document, showing, as Mr.
Lubbock remarks, that the time of high water at London Bridge was
then “more than an hour later than at present;” and, therefore,
that immense interruption to the progress of the tide in the River
Thames has been removed in the course of six centuries.         We
ought not, however, to forget that great difficulties then existed
in determining the actual time of high water, though there can be
little doubt that the approximation was as correct as such circum
stances would allow, and that at most the error could not be more
than three or four minutes.
     VII. A  treatise on the Mensuration        of   heights and distances   ; from
a   MS. of the 14th century.
    This treatise contains several ingenious methods of mensuration,
or rather of right-angled trigonometry, and is very curious as ex
planatory of the practice of the times. The quadrant had then the
form of a square, and the unknowns were all determined by means of
similar triangles. Though the MS. is of the 14th century, it is too
full of methods adapted to different exigencies to indicate the ge
neral matter of it being then of a recent date. The methods them
selves are all independent of any function of the angle observed;
and hence most probably this MS. is only a copy of one of a much
older date, and antecedent to the introduction of the Arabian tri
gonometry into Europe.      Being in English, it shows at least that
Englishmen then understood the doctrine of similar triangles.

    “This   notice,” remarks Mr. Halliwell, “ of the introduction     of
 Euclid's Elements into England, if correct, invalidates the claim of
 Adelard of Bath, who has always been considered the first that
brought them from abroad into this country, and who flourished full
 two centuries after the good kyng Adelstone.”
    We would also refer to the curious fact that the celebrated trans
lation of Campanus is nothing more than Adelard's with a com
 mentary; and it is curious that this should not have been noticed
till very recently, and then by three persons independently of each
other;-Tiraboschi; the anonymous author of “Geometry,” in the
Penny Cyclopaedia; and by the late Mr. Charles Butler of Cheam.
For reasons given by Mr. Halliwell, it would almost seem that the
commentary as well as the translation attributed to Campanus, is
also due to Adelard.
   VIII. An    account  table for the use of merchants : from a manu
script  of the  14th century.
   This table will probably be a puzzle to most of our readers; and
it is doubtful whether, from the editor's remark on the subject, he
has not himself mistaken its exact character. It is, however, neither
more nor less than a picture of a merchant's abacus or counting
board. The ciphers in the several squares represent holes bored
to receive pegs or pins, which mark the numbers of poundes, schil
lynges, penyes, and ferthynges in any sum of money. There are
holes for 1, 2, 3 ferthynges at the upper part of the right side of
the board; for 1, 2,      ....  11 penyes from right to left along the
top; below and parallel to these for 1,2.... 11 shillynges, and ver
tically down the left side for 12.... 19 shyllynges; whilst in the
other part of the board is a table for poundes, which proceeds accord
ing to the decimal scale to 1010, with nine horizontal columns, of
holes for inserting pegs to express any one of the nine digits as the
coefficient of any one of the powers of 10. This table would there
fore express any number less than 10".          The vertical columns are
headed in Roman letters as annexed, and below them we put their
values in modern notation :
             x     M    C     x     M   C     X     M     C    X
            1010  100  103   107   106 105   104   103 - 10°  101
and it is remarkable that 10° or the units’ column is left without any
heading at all. We may add also that the numbers 1,2,.... 19 in
the fractional part of the table are written in the manuscript in the
common figures of the time, whilst the decimal places are expressed
by Roman letters.                                            -
   This is perhaps one of the most curious MSS. yet discovered for
the purposes of arithmetical history, as it shows, what has never been
suspected by inquirers into the subject, that the abacus was used in
a form very nearly resembling the common method of modern calcu

     In respect of the first of these, it is sufficient to say, that Mr. Halli
well offers reasons for believing that                             the passage itself in Boetius is
an interpolation, and therefore of no                               higher authority than the age
of the oldest MS. in which it is found.    It also corrects an opinion
given by M. Chasles, that the sipos of the earlier MSS. was the
same with the celentis, both signifying either the figure or the num
ber nine.     Chasles has since found other MSS. which show the
correctness of Mr. Halliwell's view, viz. that celentis was alone
used to designate nine and sipos the cipher. Into this subject we
cannot here enter further, but merely refer to the work itself, and to
two notices by Chasles in the Comptes Rendus, May 1838, and Jan.
1839, as well as to Vincent's paper in Liouville's Journal de Math.
June 1839. These writers offer strong reasons for believing that
both the figures used and their local values, had an origin different
from, and quite independent                        of,
                                    that commonly assigned         them.                             to

   Mode in WHICH SOME SALTS ACT IN HYDROGEN GAS.                                                           BY

     Some researches on the peculiar mode of composition of mellitic
 acid, have caused me to observe that the salt of silver of this acid, ex
 posed to pure hydrogen gas at 202°, very quickly changed from
 its white colour to black, and was afterwards soluble in water and
 imparted a deep red colour to                During this reaction little water

black after drying; by pressure it becomes of a deep metallic lustre,

   Cubebin is white, insipid, inodorous. It occurs in groups of small
acicular crystals. At 39.2° in vacuo, it loses no weight.       It is not
volatile, and is scarcely soluble in water; cold alcohol dissolves but
a small quantity of it; at 53°, 100 parts of absolute alcohol dis
solved but 1.31 part: alcohol of 82" dissolved 0.70, but when boiling
both dissolved so much that on cooling the liquor became a mass.
At 53°, 100 parts of aether dissolve 3.73 of cubebin; it is more
soluble in it when hot; it is also soluble in acetic acid, in the
volatile and fixed oils.
   Concentrated sulphuric acid renders it of a deep red colour. This
substance was analysed by means of oxide of copper, it being pre
viously dried in a dry vacuum at 322°; it was found to consist of

          ANALYSIS OF HAILSTONES,       BY M. GIRARDIN.
   In a letter addressed to M. Arago, and read at the Academy of
Sciences, on the 22nd of April last, M. Girardin gives the results
of the analysis which he has made of hailstones collected in the
month of February preceding; the following details are extracted
from the latter.
   The hailstones, collected with the requisite precautions, were                                  in
troduced into a bottle washed with distilled water, they weighed
about 500 grains; the hail readily melted, and the liquid had the
appearance of water into which a few drops of milk had been suf
fered to fall; it was turbid and whitish. Gradually there were
formed in it a considerable abundance of white and very light flocks,
which soon formed into one cloudy mass, and deposited at the bot
tom of the vessel.    The next morning, the liquid was perfectly
limpid.
      fportion of the water, whilst it was still whitish and milky, was
put into a glass, and a few drops of nitrate of silver were added to
it.   The glass, stopped with paper, was placed          the dark and al

      Several chemists have directed their attention to the existence
 of    an organic substance and saline matters in the atmosphere.
  Their experiments have unquestionably proved, that rain water in
  falling through the atmosphere carries with it in solution into the
  earth, ammoniacal salts, calcareous salts, and a flocky matter, which
  is without doubt the origin of the deleterious principles which are
  designated by the term miasmata.                Hitherto, however, no one has
  stated the existence of this        organic   matter in hailstones.—Journal

                   GAUSS ON THE THEORY OF MAGNETISM.
  In our theory it is assumed that every determinate magnetized
particle of the earth contains precisely equal quantities of positive
and negative fluid.  Supposing the magnetic fluids to have no real
ity, but to be merely  a fictitious substitute for galvanic currents in
the smallest particles of the earth, this equality is necessarily part
of the substitution; but if we attribute to the magnetic fluids an
actual existence, there might without absurdity be a doubt as to the
perfect equality of the quantities of the two fluids.
   In regard to detached magnetic bodies (natural or artificial mag
nets), the question as to whether they do or do not contain a sen
sible excess of either magnetic fluid might easily be decided by very
exact and delicate experiments.
   In case of the existence of any such excess in a body of this na
ture, a plumb-line to which it should be attached should deviate
from the true vertical position in the direction of the magnetic me
ridian.
 , If experiments of this kind, made with a great number of artificial
magnets and in a locality sufficiently distant from iron, never showed
the slightest deviation, (which we should rather expect,) the equal
ity of the two fluids might with the highest degree of probability be
inferred for the whole earth; though without wholly excluding the
possibility of some inequality.—Taylor's Scientific Memoirs, vol.           ii.

XXXV.     On the tubular Cavities filled with Gravel and Sand

TH:
  wich,
           white chalk with flints in the neighbourhood of Nor
              is covered with a mass of variable thickness of
irony sand and gravel, with some intermixture of red clay,
the sand passing occasionally into a ferruginous sandstone.
The surface of the chalk when the gravel is removed is ex
tremely uneven, presenting sharp ridges, deep furrows, and
pits, and some protuberances which are larger at the summit
than the base.      In a word, it is impossible to conceive that
so soft a rock as chalk could have acquired such an outline
 simply by ordinary denudation, or could have retained it if
 once acquired during the accumulation of the mechanical de
 posit now superimposed. . It is equally difficult to refer to
 any known mode of denudation those deep and narrow hol
 lows, filled with sand and gravel, which are the same as those
 called in France “puits naturels,” and which will form the
 subject of the present communication.
    Form of the Sand-pipes at Eaton.—I was indebted to Mr.
  Ewing for first calling my attention to some fine example:
 of these phaenomena which he had accurately observed on his
 property at Eaton, about two miles west of Norwich, where
  the chalk has been extensively excavated for the manufacture
  of lime. Cylindrical hollows filled with loose materials, evi
  dently derived from the overlying tertiary formation, are here
  called “Sand-pipes” by the workmen.        They resemble those
  which occur in     many other districts in England, where the
  chalk is covered   by sand and gravel.

  These deep and narrow pipes are very symmetrical at Eaton,
having the form of inverted cones, which at their upper ex
tremity vary in width from a few inches to more than four
yards, while at their lower they taper down to a fine point:
see fig. 1. The smaller ones, which are usually about a foot

                Sand-pipes   in the Chalk at Eaton near Norwich.
 in diameter, seldom penetrate to the depth of more than twelve
 feet, while the larger are sometimes more than, sixty feet
 deep. They are for the most part perpendicular in their di
 rection, and nearly circular in shape, although they often ap
 pear of an oval form when cut through in the precipices sur
 rounding the Eaton quarries, because the plane of intersection
  is there in reality oblique, and inclined at an angle of about
 80° with the horizon.           Several sand-pipes often approach
 very near to each other without any tendency to unite.                In
 proof of this general fact, Mr. Ewing pointed out to me three
 pipes close to each other, which we explored from top to bot
 tom by digging.        The depth of one proved to be twelve feet,
 that of another nine feet, and that of the pipe placed between
 the other two six feet.        Although they         all

     Contents      the Sand-pipes.—The materials filling the sand
 pipes are     ofthree kinds: 1st, sand and pebbles; 2ndly, loose
 unrounded chalk flints; 3rdly, fine ochreous sandy clay, not
 impervious     to  water. The rounded pebbles           the first consist
                                                            in

Eaton is about twenty feet thick. The clay is also similar to
the finer portion of that found in the gravel above. As a
general rule, admitting of few exceptions, the sand and peb
bles occupy the central parts of the pipe, while the sides and
bottom are lined with clay. In the clay, at the bottom of one
small pipe, which was only six inches wide at the top and a
                  I
yard deep, found some black carbonaceous matter, probably
derived from the roots of trees which had penetrated from
above.                               -
    Not a particle of calcareous matter, whether organic or
inorganic, occurs in any part of the pipes, either in the mid

ginal form and white coating, (b b) are dispersed singly, and
at various depths, in those larger pipes which exceed one foot
or one foot and a half in diameter. The smaller pipes, in
which these loose flints never occur, are frequently crossed b
horizontal layers of siliceous nodules, as at c, d, e, fig. 1,
still remain in situ, not having been removed together with
the chalk in which they must have been originally imbedded.
Single flints, forming part of these continuous layers, some
times appear in the middle                of a small pipe,             as at d, fig. 1,             sur
rounded and supported by sand, so that at first sight it is not
easy to imagine how it can have retained           position during     its

 downwards, and the percolation for ages                      acidulous waters        of

   As to the sandy clay found at the bottom and round the

passage through the gravel and loam has become charged
with fine particles          mud and iron, and has parted with these

chalk covered         by

directly traced either to a disturbance at the place of genera

270           Dr. Draper        on the Use      of a Secondary Wire                      as   a
 same vertical straight line, through whatever arc the micro
 meter may have moved.            Now it would be very difficult to
 accomplish this by any system of adjustments.
     Whether the instrument is arranged with one or several
 needles, or whether it has a coil or merely a single strap, the
 vertical distance from the coil or strap, when the index is
 brought to zero, ought under no circumstances to vary.
     In a climate as hot as that in which the following experi
 ments were made, one of the most unpleasant deviations de
 pends on the thread wrenching in the wax, which is used to
 fasten it to the needles at one end, and to the micrometer at
 the other; when the wax softens, and the thread is moved
 through several degrees, it is not the free part alone that un
 dergoes torsion, but also that which is in the wax, hence
 arises an error as respects the zero point.              This I have                              al
 ways avoided, by ascertaining the zero at the beginning and
 close of each experiment.

 who are not accustomed to the torsion balance to execute
 measures very easily, which they might otherwise ineffectually
 attempt.

   We have now to examine the foregoing proposition more
minutely.    Let us call the primary wire, being that which is
in connexion with the electromotoric source, A.; and the se
condary or resisting wire, B. Now how does B act towards
currents when they are of variable character? There is no
current, no matter how low                            its
                                   tension may be, that will not
pass along            B    to

changed.     Sir Humphry    Davy's  experiments  lead      the same                       to
conclusion, (Phil. Mag. Dec. 1821) nor does there appear

   Currents of very low tension give proofs of the same fact.
A thermal pair of platina and palladium passed 44 through
the primary, and 19:50 through the secondary wire; and
when by increasing the temperature 236 passed through the
primary, 115 went through the secondary wire.        In a pair of
palladium and silver, 165 and 1130 being passed successively
through the primary, 43 and 313 went through the second
ary wire. . In a pair of iron and platina, 170 and 249 being
successively sent through the primary, 79 and 112 respectively
passed through the secondary wire.

wire $, and a third, in which a wire           #  of an inch in diameter,
 were used, gave analogous results. In neither of these cases,
 however, did the tension rise so high as in the former ; it was
 lower as the diameter of the wire was greater.
    This increase of tension follows the increase of the length
 of the wire,  as the following      measures show.

 Thus, by successively increasing the aggregate length of the
 discharging wire, the tension continually increased, com
 mencing at 4177, and finally becoming 83.33.                   Similar ex
   eriments with other wires gave similar results.
     Now is this remarkable rise of tension due to a momentum
 which the current acquires on the wire? Or does it arise
from the fact, that the wire acts simply as an obstacle, react
 ing thereby on the electromotoric plates, the increase of ten
sion being due to them, not it? This is easily determined; for
 if the rise of tension be due to the plates and not to the wire,
a short wire, slender enough to obstruct the current to the
 same extent, ought to act equally as well as the long wire.
    This experiment, the result of which leads to the true
 theory of voltaic combinations, I shall carefully describe.
    I took a copper wire, 46 feet long and tº inch in diameter,
and found that it stopped a certain portion of the current
coming from a single pair of plates. The micrometer of the
balance was now turned, and the needle brought accurately
 to zero. Then I cut off from another slender copper wire,
such a length (2 feet 10 inches) as to obstruct the current to
the same extent as the long wire, the needle being brought
when it was interposed in the path of the current to zero.
The secondary coil was now introduced; it of course stopped
off a certain portion of the current; but the micrometer was
again adjusted, until the needle was brought to zero. And
now the long wire being introduced, and the slender one taken
away, the needle came again to zero.                But I suppose, if the
long wire had impressed more tension on the current than
the slender, one, either by momentum or otherwise, more
electricity should have passed the secondary wire when it
was used, which is not the case.

         Measure   of the relative Tension of Electric Currents.                               277
    Again, I took a copper wire, 242 feet long and <U+017F>º inch in
 diameter, and adjusted to it a fine iron wire as before: the
 extremities of this wire were tinned; it was 12} inches long.
 Either of these wires being used as a discharger, brought the
 needle to the same point of the scale. On using the secondary
 wire and the long wire together, I adjusted the needle accu
 rately to zero, and then passing the current through the fine
 wire and secondary wire, it came again to zero. And this was
 repeated often, and so near was the adjustment, that when an
assistant turned first one and then the other wire on, it could
 not be told which was in action, or whether the current had
 come along the long or the short wire.     A long wire there
fore impresses no sort of change on a current, but merely
serves as an obstacle; for in the first case we had one wire
sixteen times longer than the other, and in this we have a
wire more than 230 longer than the one with which it is
compared, yet the tension has increased only to the same
amount in both.
    And the same results were obtained by the voltameter.
   The current that flows in a simple closed voltaic circle may
be resisted in two ways: 1st, the length of the wire connect
ing the plates may be increased, as in the foregoing experi
ments; 2nd, the connecting wire remaining of constant length,
the distance of the plates may be increased: the result is the
same in both cases, a rise of tension.

citing cells; batteries charged with nitrosulphuric acid or sul
phate of copper are examples.”
   A single pair of plates, under the influence of a long wire,
or the spiral coil, presents a remarkable analogy to Volta's
pairs arranged in reduplicated series. . In point of fact, they
may be considered as scarcely differing from each other either
in mode of action, or in effect. The study of the single pair
under this condition, reveals at once the theory of the voltaic
battery.
     If
      we inspect tables B, C, D, we are at once furnished with
the fundamental fact which is the basis of explanation. When
we compare together the tension and quantity of the electri
city flowing in the primary wire, we are struck with the fact,
that whenever the one has increased the other has diminished.
No   matter what the other conditions may be, whether the com
munication is made by a long wire or a short one, whether the
plates are near or far apart, whenever the quantity is                  di
minished the tension increases, and whenever the quantity               in
creases the tension is diminished.
     The remarkable analogy of the ponderable elastic fluids,
which when their volume is diminished,           or in other words
condensation takes   place,   experience  an increase of tension or
elastic force, is here too broadly indicated to be mistaken.
   When I first saw that removing the plates to a greater               di
stance apart determined a given rise in the elastic force of
the current, for a time it appeared to me that Dr. Faraday’s
theory of the tension being due to the affinity of the zinc for
oxygen must certainly be incorrect.           A more extensive ac
quaintance with the facts has reversed that opinion.               If
                                                                   the
tension be determined by the affinity of the metal for oxygen,
which must be a constant force, how comes it to pass that
moving the plates to a greater distance apart can cause it to
increase? This apparent paradox when properly understood
forms a fine illustration of the truth of the doctrine advanced
in the 5th, 7th, and 8th series of that philosopher's researches.
                      I
In what follows shall therefore regard those doctrines as
established.
   Let us take a given pair of plates, and connect them to
gether by a slender wire. . We find that the quantity that the
plates generate is diminished, and          its
                                              tension      increased;

continually increase the tension, and when it became infi
nitely great, the tension would be so too.           But what is the
true action of a slender wire, connecting in this way a pair of
plates? A certain amount of electricity passes along               but                          it,
not the whole quantity that the plates could generate

given time: yet we cannot but suppose that all that does pass
comes from the whole surface exposed, and not from               frac                           a
tional  portion   thereof. The water and zinc are        ready     ge                               to
nerate, and           were attempting

electricity through the wire; and accordingly,           the quantity            as
that  actually   passes  becomes    greater  and  greater
                                                     a      portion                                      of

becomes less and less.       The tension would therefore become
zero,  if the whole circle wires, plates, and electrolyte could
carry      all
           that the zinc and water could generate.          The limit

and the absolute     quantity  which the   system   could  generate                                      is
doubled, yet the quantity that passes both the primary and
secondary           wire       is   also doubled: the ratio                  +        therefore the

the   plates,  increases the quantity only, and not the tension.

       GENTLEMEN,

      byearlier correspondents, they are   your service for             at                               in

280        .   The Rev. E. Craig                 on the Con<U+017F>iguration      of the     Scales
   There are several notices in the writings of Sir David Brew
ster, Dr. Goring, and Mr. Pritchard on the lines upon the
scales of butterflies’ wings which appeared to me to leave the
subject still in an unsatisfactory state. They speak of longi
tudinal lines, of cross striae, and of two sets of diagonal lines
besides, visible on each scale of the P. Brassica.               It is ad
mitted that the     longitudinal   and cross lines   may   be discovered
with tolerable facility; but as to the diagonal lines, notwith
standing the distinct averments of Dr. Goring and Mr.                                          Prit
chard, a doubt still exists as to their actual existence. Dr.
Goring observes that they may be seen as distinctly as the
ruled lines in a copy-book, yet admits that there is “an                                        in
explicable mystery about them.” Sir David Brewster expresses
with some hesitation, in opposition to such authority, his con
viction that the diagonal lines are an optical illusion. He
states of the whole linear appearances of the scales, that they
are none of them lines, but a succession of teeth arranged in
lines, and from the great number of lines forming the sides
of the teeth they appear dark. Each fibre has teeth on each
side of             it,
             and the teeth        one fibre lock into the spaces be
                                             of
tween the teeth        the      of
                           adjacent   fibres: “the (longitudinal) lines
therefore are only apparent lines, being composed                     suc            or ofa
cession      interlocking teeth;” and “the diagonal
                    of                                            oblique
lines are optical illusions, from the accidental alliguements

end of the scale.             I
                      conceive that the dark longitudinal striae
are not formed by a close combination of interlocked teeth,
              I
because have observed many lacerated scales, which invari
ably split and tear up the middle of the dark line, and in
every such case exhibit a smooth edge without any appear
ance of teeth.     The scales tear down these dark ribs in the
       way  as some leaves tear easily down the nerves.  More

longitudinal ribs or striae in the same way as through the
nerves of a leaf.    That the cross striae are thinner than the
longitudinal is evident, because when the instrument has been
arranged for the most distinct vision of the longitudinal lines,

          and delicate adjustment of the object nearer to the
lens throws the longitudinal lines out of the focus and brings
out the cross striae distinctly.   Now it is between these two
adjustments that the range exists for accurate investigation of
the whole phaenomena. The cross ribs or striae may thus be
traced running up into the longitudinal, and rising with a
curve out of the interstitial furrow.
     Iwould observe also that in consequence of this cross
ribbing of the scale, the longitudinal lines are not the same

of the    scale, because there the cross striaelie much closer to
each other.     But if they are examined with more powerful
instruments, and the forms adjusted so as to see the rising and
sloping portion of the cross striae, then instead of the diagonal
line appearing, the ordinary longitudinal lines will appear
“like short hairs or spines in a diagonal direction.”      In this
way they appeared to Mr. Pritchard “through his best instru
ments.” The varieties of appearance seem to me to arise from the
instrument commanding at different times the different heights
of an uneven surface, and the difference depends upon the                                             di
stinct vision of the hill, the valley, or the intermediate slope,
in a distance which between each longitudinal rib is only the
20,000dth of an inch. The cross striae are about the 60,000dth
of an inch apart, and near the end of the scale still less.

   Mr. Marsh             on distinguishing                 Arsenic from Antimony.                         283
Thompson, and which was inserted in the L. and E. Philosophi
cal Magazine, vol. x. p. 353, has rendered the process in some
measure more difficult than was at first supposed, by the dis
covery of that gentleman, of a compound in which antimony
combines with hydrogen to form a gas (antimoniuretted hydro
gen). This gas gives off by the process employed, metallic
crusts, which much resemble, to the inexperienced eye, the
metallic substance obtained from arsenical solutions by the
same arrangements. It becomes necessary therefore to find a
means of distinguishing these metallic crusts from each other.
 Many processes which are well known to the experienced
 chemist may be employed for this purpose; but the misfortune
 is that   all   these arrangements suppose               previous chemical a
 acquaintance with the subject; for instance, good process for                  a

out of their course from the coast of Spain, and reaching                                                 di

 from this in utilizing both sides of the zinc, and of which the

 trough of stone ware or glass, with partitions E, E, E, dividing it
 into four acid proof cells. * The dotted lines (I have omitted
 letters to prevent crowding the figure) represent four porous
 vessels   of a                      shape, so much narrower than the

could be dispensed with. I have constructed a constant battery ºzinc and
copper on the same principle; it is inapplicable to that described in the
text, as in it each pair is able to decompose water.
   As in many districts it may be difficult to obtain a trough of stone-ware,
I ought to state that my present one is of wood well lined with cement;
the only difference from that above described is that the porous vessels are
of less width, so as to contain half as much liquid as the spaces around them,
and the position of the metals reversed, the platina being placed within
the porous vessels and the zinc without.

 the plates can be so easily renewed that it is not worth while
to use stouter. On the zinc side, or into the porous vessels,
is poured a solution of either muriatic acid diluted with from
2 to 24 water, or, if the battery be intended to remain a long
time in action, of sulphuric acid diluted with 4 to 5 water”,
and on the platinum side concentrated nitro-sulphuric acid
 (say specific gravity 1-55) formed by previous mixture of
equal measures of the two acids.           The apparatus should be
provided with a cover containing lime to absorb the nitrous
gas.       I
         have not given dimensions, as this is a matter of choice:
the  proportions     of the diagram are nearly correct, and taking
it at a scale of half an inch to an inch will be found a conve
nient size, the width to be the same as the depth.
       I
      would now say a few words upon the theory of the bat
tery, assuming as a postulate that the power of voltaic com
binations               is,

             Mr. Grove            on a new Voltaic Battery, and
 the negative metal, and a powerful opposed force created; in
 the constant combination copper is precipitated, and the op
 position is lessened; in this there is no precipitation, and
 consequently no counteraction.           There is still, however, an
 other    imaginary     voltaic circle (I am tired of iterating the
 word combination), which would be superior to any of these:
 it is one of three elements; two metals, or substances having
 the electrical properties of the metals, and an electrolyte; of
 these two substances, the positive should be analogous to zinc,
 but the negative should possess a strong affinity for the cation
 of the electrolyte, and unite energetically with                       sepa   it,      as  it
 rates in   a  nascent state, or rather should            itself be ableof                          to

294     Rev.    D. Williams               on the Geological Position                  of the
where Mr. Weaver observed them dipping south, proves no
thing by inference even; for the latter very commonly dip
towards the S.W.; and the Floriferous Beds being almost
everywhere arched and inflected, as are the Trilobite Slates
                       #.
along their southern terms, the ascending plane of undulation
or inflexion would place them at Muddlebridge in true paral
lelism with the            Slates, supposing them to dip S.W.
and to have deviated half a mile out of their mean line of
bearing. . The other instance cited of Rumson Lane S. of
Barnstaple, is not only high up among the Passage Beds of
No. 8, (and if not within the very
sures  certainly in the neutral ground) but altogether

utterly inconclusive evidence for almost any purpose: ,                                          Ad
mitting then these instances to be anbiguous, what evidences
have we along the north and south borders of the trough to
explain them one way or the other? I must here observe,
that when I use the term “Coddon Hill grits,”                     mean a              I
band of rock almost inorganic, but of peculiar and strongly
characterized mineral type, which everywhere includes the
little trumpery insulatic and elliptical bunches of limestone,
which       I
          term the “Possidonia,” and Mr. Weaver the “Car
boniferous.”     These grits are admitted on               hands      con all               to
stitute the base, and            to  integral part

and from the culm-field to the granite of Caradon Down,
N. and S. of the parallel of Launceston, we have constant
and repeated alternations, on a great and small scale, of
Cornish clay slate or killas, lenticular limestones, carbonaceous
slates, Coddon Hill grits, and floriferous shales and sandstones;
while on the east of Dartmoor, at Doddiscomb Leigh, five
miles north of Chudleigh, we discover the Possidonia lime
stones underlying a long series of alternations extending to
the mouth of the Dart, severally occupying miles of surface
on the maps, oftener so minute that they cannot be correctly
represented there at all. A cross section of this long line of
country exhibits repeated interchanges, at reciprocally vary
ing levels of the Floriferous, Coddon Hill grits, coral lime
stones, Cornish killas, conformable and unconformable trap
rocks, and volcanic ash and grit, each and all, except the
Elvans, characterized by plants, glance flakes of anthracite, and
carbonaceous matter; the limestones, with the exception of
the included carbonaceous beds and clay slate, being masses
of coral architecture, of which, from the many that have been
submitted to him, Mr. Lonsdale pronounces that not one
is a mountain limestone species. In other localities, both in the
slate and limestone, we have chambered and bivalve testacea,
almost none of which (except certain ones from the Plymouth
limestone, which is higher up in the series) are of carboni
ferous species; some of the Pethernwin and Landlake fossils
being identical with certain ones from the Trilobite slates of
Exmoor, others probably belonging to an independent forma
tion not yet determined.
   We hope soon, however, to learn more on this head from
the critical knowledge of Prof. Phillips, Mr. Sowerby, and
 Mr. Lonsdale;       .#    know enough now to assert, without
doubt or hesitation, that the Possidonia limestones and the
plant- and culm-bearing series of Devon and Cornwall, is a
perfectly independent formation far below the carboniferous
limestone and      its
                   coal-field. This                   all

       inches, and sometimes more, in diameter.                       In shape,
 they are more or less round, but seldom completely cylin
 drical. In direction, they are most commonly perpendicular
 to the surface of the ice. . After a thaw, they may be readily
 seen in the sheets of melting ice that float down a river, or on
 the sea-shore near            mouth.  its   They occur not only            very                              in

306                 Mr.    Ferguson on the Cause                 of the Holes
    As none of the circumstances attending the formation of ice
seemed to account for the appearance of the holes in question,
attention was next given to ice during the process of melting.
After the formation of ice, indeed, and while hard frost con
tinued, nothing rudimental of a hole could ever be observed.
Thus the question came to be, What circumstance in the
melting gave rise to the holes?
   Their frequent occurrence in ice at the mouths of rivers
might suggest the idea of their being dependent on salt water
—a conjecture supported by the well-known effect of salt in
lowering the freezing point of water, and            consequent power its
of melting ice. The holes, however, occur                 inland pools,       in
and   inrivers              at
                        distance                of
                                      several miles from the sea.                                      I
froze sea-water          by a
                       exposing       during very cold night
                                                it              a                                 to   ra
diation—the natural freezing agent. When the ice thus pro
duced was melted,           almost every natural manner, none                                          in of

these and similar considerations,          inferred that the formation
of the round holes        little dependent

melt the ice      that part, and thus produce

same depth during the whole time           melting. Hence, of      such                      in
circumstances, the ice probably received the heat            fast   the             as            as
Water.
     After having thus far failed                  account for the appearance
                                                     to
in question,   madeI               an   observation that indicated what seems
to be the real cause.
     In
      the course              of
                     my observations     ice melting       the   on                           on
sides     of
        rivers,  frequently saw holes not entirely perforated

                 that occur perforating Sheets                        of melting          Ice.               307
   through the ice.       In the bottoms of these, always observed              I
   solid bodies—stones, dust, sand, bark of trees, or the like.
   In one instance, of which I had taken particular notice,                                                     I
   subsequently observed that the imperfect hole had been ren
   dered complete, and corresponded in size to those, the cause
   of whose formation I had been attempting to discover. I
   then placed a stone above a piece of ice during sunshine, and
   examined it on the following day, when a complete hole,
   bigger than the stone, was found in the ice below the place
  where it had rested. I confirmed these observations by ex
  periments repeated under varied circumstances, always with
  like results. Thus, having placed upon ice almost                        such                     all
  small bodies        are usually found

ruption, appeared from the possibility of melting a hole in
the most transparent ice by the same lens.    Hence it appears
that  heat,  radiated from the sun, will pass through ice with
little interruption to any opake foreign body, by which it will
be absorbed, and by which it will be communicated, by con
duction, to the contiguous ice.
    The sun is evidently not the only source of the radiated
heat absorbable by such foreign body. Thus, we can scarcely
suppose that             all
                       the sun's heat        intercepted       the clouds,    by

equal width throughout, being sometimes wider above than
 below,       other times the reverse. The foreign body that
             at
forms the hole has originally descended, when the hole                                              is
wider above—the first formed part                the hole being widened

 below the    ice,  and has ascended.

    Before the breaking up of ice by a thaw, the holes most
usually are to be observed at the sides of rivers.           Indeed, I
have scarce ever seen them in the middle.             After the break
ing up of ice by a thaw, several circumstances serve to                               in
crease the number of holes.          On the sides of rivers, there is
generally a collection of small round stones.             Upon these,
sheets of ice, when floated up by the rise of the tide, are left,
and, during the thaw, soon become perforated with holes up
wards.    If   such holes should not be complete at the time,
they are rendered so by subsequent melting.             As the stones,
in such situations, frequently rise an inch above the surround
ing level, they may perforate holes in ice an inch thick. The
holes in ice of greater thickness, are commonly produced by
 bodies lying above the ice, such as the small stones that are
washed upon the ice by the agitation of the water, or bits of
 bark, or of brown wood. Such light bodies, when they float,
 sometimes produce holes upwards, by being placed below the
ice.    Holes break out, also, wherever light bodies have been
 frozen into ice, as occurs in almost every situation.          Collec
 tions of sand, earth, or clay, constitute another very usual
 cause of holes.
    Standing waters afford peculiar occasions for foreign solids
 to produce holes in           its

       GENTLEMEN,
ITof   has hitherto been generally supposed that our ignorance
          the law of the decrease of heat in the upper regions of
the   atmosphere    has prevented our obtaining an accurate for
mula for the determination of heights by barometrical ob
servations.      I apprehend, however, that this has arisen from
an   oversight  in the analytical calculation; which, if corrected,
would eliminate the effect of the diminution of temperature
altogether.

it had been exposed for many hours to a bright midsummer's sun.
The rays, when reflected from an imperfect parabolic metallic mir
ror in a lantern, and collected into a focus by a glass lens, readily
burned a hole in a paper at a distance of many feet from their source.
The heat was quite intolerable to the hand held near the lantern.

substance result.   A variety of experiments    are detailed and tabu
lated; the first series of which contains those   made on solutions of
compounds, such as sugar, honey and extract of malt, showing that
in each the amount of spontaneous decomposition is in proportion
to the quantity of nitrogen it contains. This law is found to       ex
tend to those parts of plants which are not in solution in water, but
which remain in their natural state of elaboration, only having their
texture broken down.
    The author is led to infer from his experiments that the chemical
action to which any vegetable matter is naturally disposed, may, to
a certain extent, be changed into some other, differing both in its
kind and in its products; and that in order to effect such a change
nothing more is required than to excite in other vegetable matter
 mixed with the former, some action which shall preponderate over
 the rest, so that the whole mass may obey this new and predomi
 nant influence.     The vapour which is disengaged during the rapid
 decomposition of vegetable matter he finds to be highly noxious;
 and thence draws the inference that the Author of the universe has
 wisely ordained, that, when young plants, containing large quantities
 of nitrogen, are by any means checked in their growth, they shall
 be consumed by certain insects; which insects may be conceived to
 form one of the links of that harmonious chain which binds together
 all the parts of the universe.
    The relation between the decomposition of vegetable matter and
 the growth of plants is apparent from the similarity of the influence
 of nitrogen on both these processes: this double function which
 nitrogen performs in favouring chemical decomposition by the roots
 of plants at the same time that it assimilates the matter thus formed
 in their other parts, is regarded by the author as another link in the
 same chain.    In support of this view, he adduces the different che
 mical constitutions of the roots of the same plants when very young,
 and when fully grown.      He finds that when plants have to perform
 the important offices of providing nourishment for the rapid growth
 of their young and tender shoots, they contain a quantity of nitro
 gen two or three times greater than that which they possess when
 fully grown; and he concludes by showing that, in accordance with
these views, the seeds, roots and plants when placed in highly de
 composing or decomposed matter, cease to grow, and under these
 circumstances, their germinating or vegetating power being super
 seded by the chemical action established in the matter which sur
rounds them, the whole becomes one mass of contaminated and          in
fectious matter.

    The special object of this paper is to show, first, that sugar is not
constituted of carbon and water only; secondly, that during the
vinous fermentation water is decomposed; thirdly, that neither pure
carbonic acid nor alcohol  is,    the common acceptation

liquors owe some of their valuable qualities to peculiar products
formed during fermentation.
   In order to trace the various chemical changes which occur in
this part of his research, the author has had recourse to numerous
experiments, the details of which are recorded in tabular forms.
The first table exhibits the analysis of different kinds of sugar, honey,
treacle, grape-juice and extract of malt and hops, the general result
of which is that                         all
                       these compounds contain oxygen            excess above                                     in

has recourse to the ultimate analysis of the charcoal obtained from
alcohol and olefiant gas, a mode of experimenting which he con
ceives is less liable to error.
    He states that the views thus sought to be established are con
firmed, not merely by these direct experiments, but likewise by other
changes which fermented liquors undergo on being kept under cir
cumstances favourable for further chemical action; and that having
proved the existence of such a compound as one constituted of car
bon, hydrogen and nitrogen, and shown that water is decomposed
during its formation, he thinks we are enabled to account for many
other changes which occur during the decomposition of vegetable
matter and the growth of plants: whence he proceeds to show that
evidence of the presence of such a compound as the above in fer
mented liquors is afforded by the changes which take place in con
sequence of keeping them.
    On subjecting to ultimate analysis the semi-fluids obtained by ex
posing fermented liquors to a temperature of 110°Fahr., the author
found a decided difference between the chemical constitution of
those procured from old, and those from new vinous fluids; and on
searching for the law by which these differences are regulated, he
found that the spirituous part entered into such combination with
the excess of oxygen before referred to, and the undecomposed ve
getable matter, so as to form with them new compounds.
    After experiencing some difficulty in effecting a separation of
these newly formed bodies, he found that while rectified pyroxylic
spirit, of the specific gravity from 830 to 835, scarcely dissolved an
appreciable quantity of the extract of malt and hops, considerable
portions of the semi-fluids obtained from old ale and old porter were,
 by agitating, dissolved therein. By using this spirit as a solvent he
 effected such a separation as enabled him to discover decided differ
ences between the proximate chemical constitution of the semi
 fluids obtained from old ale and old porter, and those from liquors
 of the same description when new.
    In accounting for many of the phenomena which accompany
the vinous fermentation, the author observes that the small excess
of oxygen found in all these compounds, which undergo this chemi
cal action, is an essential and indispensable circumstance; a con
 clusion which is corroborated both by the formation of these new
 compounds which have been described, and by the generation of the
 acetic, tartaric, or malic acid, which is found in fermented liquors at
 all times, and   inquantities varying according  to  the situations un
 der which these fluids have been kept.

   In this memoir the author investigates the question, how far the
mean water, that is the height                       of the tide midway between high and
low water, is permanent during the changes which high and low
water undergo.         That it is so approximately at Plymouth having
been already ascertained by short series of observations, it was de
sirable to determine the real amount of this permanency by induc
tion from longer series of observations. A period of six years was
chosen for that purpose; and the method of discussing these obser
vations was the same, with slight modifications, as in former re
searches.
    The height of low water, cleared from the effects of lunar parallax,
and very nearly so from those of lunar declination, and compared
with the height of high water, similarly cleared, enabled the author
to ascertain whether the mean water also was affected by the semi
menstrual inequality.        The results of the calculation show that the
height of mean water                     is,
                                within two                     or

obtained ; namely, that one fourth of an equivalent of sulphuric
acid passes from the platinode to the zincode for every single equiva

By James Blake, Esq. Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec.
R.S.
  In this paper the author examines more particularly the action of
those poisons which appear to produce death by affecting the nervous
system.
   After reviewing the evidence adduced in support of the opinion,
that the effects of some poisons are owing to an impression made on
the nerves of the part to which they are directly applied, he proceeds
to relate a series of experiments undertaken in order to show with
what rapidity the blood is circulated through the body, and tending
to prove, that a substance may be generally diffused through the
system in nine seconds after                            its
                                        introduction into the veins.

Mr. W. S. Harris                    on the Elementary                       Laws of Electricity.                            821
provements   in his hydrostatic electrometer, an instrument already
mentioned in his first paper, which, although not available for the
measurement of such minute forces as those to which the balance of
torsion is applicable, is still peculiarly delicate and well adapted to
researches in statical electricity.    Its indications depending on the
force between two opposed planes operating on each other under
given conditions, are reducible to simple laws, and are hence                                                                  in
variable and certain; the attractive force between the discs is not
subject to any oblique action, is referable to any given distance, and
may be estimated in terms of a known standard of weight.                           The
author next proceeds to the further consideration of the subject of
his former papers, viz. the elementary laws of electrical action. He
proves, by the following experiments, that induction invariably pre
cedes, or at least accompanies attraction and repulsion.
   A circular disc of gilded wood, about six inches in diameter, is sus
pended by an insulating thread of varnished silk from a delicate ba
lance; a delicate electroscope is attached to this disc, and the whole
is counterpoised by a weight.            A similar disc insulated on a glass
rod, and having also an electroscope attached to                      placed       any           it,   is              at
convenient distance immediately under the former. One                      the lower                         of
discs being charged with either electricity and the other remaining                                                            in
sulated and neutral, the electroscope                 the neutral disc begins
                                                                        of                                                     to

treats, with the view of obviating what is obscure and exceptionable
in the investigation usually given of                                it.

known by the name of Botany-bay resin, or yellow gum ; and finds
its formula to be Clo Hoo Os, showing that it contains more oxygen
than any other resinous substance hitherto analyzed.
    The general conclusions drawn by the author from these researches
are the following.
     1. Many of the resins may be represented by formulae exhibiting
their elementary constitution, and the weight of their equivalents,
 in which 40 C is a constant quantity.
     2. There appear to be groups, in which the equivalents, both of
 carbon and the hydrogen, are constant, the oxygen only varying;
 and others, in which the hydrogen alone varies, the two other ele
 ments being constant.
     In the third part of the same series of investigations, the author
 examines the constitution of the resin of Sandarach of commerce,
 which he finds to consist of three different kinds of resin, all of
 which possess acid properties.       In like manner he finds that the
 resin of the Pinus abies, or spruce fir, commonly called Thus, or or
 dinary Frankincense, consists of two acid resins; the one easily so
 luble in alcohol, the other sparingly soluble in that menstruum. The
  gum resin olibanum, of commerce, was found to consist of a mix
 ture of at least two gum resins, the resinous ingredient of each of
 which differs from that of the other in composition and properties.

  common in Scotland;” in a letter to P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
  By W. Macdonald, M.D., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians
  of Edinburgh, F.R.S. Ed., F.L.S., &c. Communicated by Dr.
  Roget.
     The author states some observations which he has made on the
  coloured marks apparent in a variety of the horse, common in Scot
  land, and there called the Eel-back Dun, and which afford grounds
  for doubting the accuracy of the conclusions deduced in a paper, by
  the late Earl of Morton, published in the Philosophical Transactions
  for 1820. The title of the paper referred to is “A Communication
  of a singular fact in Natural History,” namely, that a young chestnut
  mare of seven-eighths Arabian blood, after producing a female hybrid
  by a male quagga, had subsequently produced, by a fine black Ara
  bian horse, a filly and a colt, both of which had the character of the
  Arabian breed as decidedly as could be expected where fifteen
  sixteenths of the blood are Arabian, but in colour, in the hair of
  their manes, and the markings of the back and legs, bore a striking
  resemblance to the quagga.
     The author, finding that similar markings are very commonly met
  with on the Eel-back dun ponies of Scotland, suggests, that as the
  breed of the mare in question was not pure she may have inherited
 the tendency to those peculiar markings.        He moreover observes,
 that the cross-bar markings on the legs are not found in the quagga,
 but only in the zebra, which is a species quite distinct from the
 quagga; a fact which he considers as completely overturning the
 reasoning by which the conclusions stated in Lord Morton's paper

                                            Royal Society.                                      323
were deduced. The facts, he thinks, admit of a more natural ex
planation, and one more consistent with the known physiological
laws of developement, by supposing the stain in the purity of the
mare's Arab blood to have arisen from the circumstance of an early
progenitor of the mare having belonged to the Eel-backed dun va
riety, the peculiarities of which re-appeared in a later generation.
   8. “On the Structure and Functions of the Spleen.”      By Thomas
Gordon Hake, M.D.         Communicated by Francis Kiernan, Esq.,
F.R.S.
   The author, passing in review the various opinions which have
been advanced by anatomists respecting the intimate structure of
the spleen, arrives at the conclusion that hitherto only vague and
premature inductions have been made. It is generally admitted that
the fibrous envelope of this organ is formed of the external fibres of
the splenic vein; and that from the internal surface of this envelope
fibrous prolongations are continued into the interior of its substance,
giving support to a fine cellular membrane, which is continuous with
their edges, and variously reflected so as to constitute cells. The
parenchyma, or solid structure of the spleen, everywhere accom
panies these membranous productions, and forms the exterior walls
of the cells; being composed of branches of the splenic arteries, of
the granular terminations of those arteries constituting the splenic
grains of Malpighi, of venules, which ramify around the splenic
grains, and of cellules, into which the venules open, and from which
the splenic veins take their rise. The author concludes, as the re
sult of his inquiries, that a dilatable cellular tissue exists, containing
venous blood, between the granules within which the arteries ter
 minate, and the venules on the outer side of the splenic grains: that
the venous membrane, which is continued from the cells to the
cellules, as well as to the venules, becoming more and more atte
nuated, but without changing                       its
                                       essential structure, gradually loses
its tubular   form,   and resumes its primitive character            cellular         of
tissue; and that the artery,         like manner,                     distri              its
                                                 byin  limited            is         in

                   of                  cellular structure, which becomes

vicarious        and determines the function

 were made in silver, others in china, and others in glass apparatus,
 after the vinous fermentation had gone on during five days, the
 quantity of ashes obtained was, in the silver apparatus eighteen, in
the china nineteen, and in the glass fifteen times greater than the
 previous quantity.      A further examination of these ashes showed
that they consisted of potass, soda, lime, and a residue not acted
upon by muriatic acid.        The author states that, however irrecon
cilable to our  present   chemical knowledge this important conclusion
may at first  sight    appear, yet when it is taken in connexion with
the decomposition of other vegetable matter, and with the pheno
mena which accompany the growth of plants, it may not excite sur
prise; and may be regarded as in harmony with the phenomena of
natural science.     He concludes by offering suggestions towards ex
tending the   inquiry    into the subject of the formation of bones of
animals by the action of the powers inherent in their organization.

of Animals.” By James Alderson,       M.A., M.D.,  late Fellow of Pem
broke College, Cambridge.        Communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D.,
Sec. R.S., &c.
   The hypothesis advanced by the author in explanation of the well
known partial absence of the coloured pigment or rete mucosum, in dif
ferent parts of the human body, and that of other animals, is that it
is due to the union or adhesion of the epidermis and the true skin,
so as to exclude the rete mucosum.       He supports this hypothesis by
the analogy of a cicatrix, which is the result of an organization of a
certain portion of lymph, poured out from the cut surfaces of a wound,
as part of the process of nutrition, or as the consequence of a small
amount of inflammation, induced either from mechanical irritation,
or other accidental circumstance.       This hypothesis was suggested
by the colourless appearance of the cicatrix from the section of the
umbilical cord in the negro, and also of that seen by the author at
the umbilicus of the bottle-nosed whale, the Hyperoodon bidentatus.

              ON THE MOULTING PROCESS IN THE CRAY FISH.
   We   have extracted the  following interesting notice from the elegant
and valuable work of Prof. Rymer Jones”.        “The phaenomena which
attend the renovation of the external skeleton are so unimaginable
that it is really extraordinary how little is accurately known con
cerning the nature of the operation. The first question which pre
sents itself is, how are the limbs liberated from their confinement 2
for, wonderful as it may appear, the joints even of the massive chelae
of the lobster do not separate from each other, but notwithstanding
the great size of some of the segments of the claw, and the slender
dimensions of the joints that connect the different pieces, the cast
off skeleton of the limb presents exactly the same appearance as if
it still encased the living member. The only way of explaining the
circumstance, is to suppose that the individual pieces of the skeleton,
as well as the soft articulations connecting them, split in a longitu
dinal direction, and that, after the abstraction of the limb, the fis
sured parts close again with so much accuracy that even the traces
of the division are imperceptible.       But this is not the only part of
the  process   which is calculated to excite our astonishment: the     in
ternal calcareous septa from which the muscles derive their origins,
and the tendons whereby they are inserted into the moveable por
tions of the outer shell, are likewise stated to be found attached to
the exuviae; even the singular dental apparatus situated in the sto
mach, of which we shall speak hereafter, is cast off and re-formed !

               ACTION OF AFTHER ON                            INDIGO.-BY M. WOGEL.
     I had  more than once remarked by chance that when the vapour
of   aether is passed into a solution of indigo in sulphuric acid largely
diluted with water, it was decolorated.            This effect is produced
more   readily  when the aether is heated to ebullition in a matrass
furnished with a bent tube which is immersed in the solution of
indigo ; and if the matrass be suddenly cooled, so that the solution
 of indigo rises in the tube and passes into the matrass by the
pressure of the air.     When I attempted on another occasion to de
colorate   indigo  by  means of aether which had been rectified over pot
ash, I could not so readily effect           which induced me  it,     believe                              to
that the impure aether, which contained sweet oil             wine,      pro                 of                  or
bably aldehyd, was more                           fit
                                    for the decoloration        indigo than                   of

 proximation when a 3 y is not a small fraction of r"; and this
 may account for De Moivre not having noticed a rule which
 would, it might be            present itself for trial at least, to
 any one who was considering the subject for the first time.
    A much more satisfactory account of this rule can be given
 from the expression for the law of human mortality which was
 given to the Royal Society, by Mr. Benjamin
 1825.   That law is as follows: The number living at r years
                                                                  in                           &m.

                 ºr
        Ag"           where      Ag      is the number living at the given age.
The constants do not retain their value during the whole of
life; Mr. Gompertz, for instance, finds one set of values re
 presenting the Carlisle tables very nearly from 10 to 60, and
another from 60 to 100. The closeness with which this theory
represents the Northampton, Sweden, Carlisle, and Depar
cieux's tables may be seen in the paper cited; and it adds
not a little to the speculative value of the formula, that                                                          its
author has deduced        from     simpleit  principle    so

    Here we have an exemplification of the converse of the
fact already so much insisted on. As the quantity developed
from the same surface gradually became greater and greater,
the tension became less and less, due to the increased con
ducting powers of the fluid medium.                         It is the same effect
that would have been produced by constantly shortening the
conecting wire.
    Such is the action of increasing doses of sulphuric acid :
let us now see how Nitric Acid will act.                       The copper plate
being repolished, and the zinc reamalgamated, and every
thing else being as at the commencement of the former trial,
the latter acid was now added to the cell, in the same way
that the former had been used.

    These measures are effected with some difficulty as the acid
acts somewhat irregularly, and keeps the needle vibrating.

    These measures were procured with difficulty, owing to the
flocculent deposit which settled on the zinc, more rapidly as
the solution was made stronger.
    In the general discussion of the measures, given by tables
E, F, G, H, I, we still see the operation of the same general
law, that the tension rapidly diminishes as the acid is added,
and that when the same quantity of electricity developed from
the same amount of surface by these different acids is pre
sented to the secondary wire, the quantities that can pass that
wire are very different; and on making use of these different
agents it would appear that they can give rise to currents
from the same metalline surface, equal in point of quantity, but
differing greatly in point of tension, in the following order,
 beginning with the most powerful:
                       Sulphate of copper,
                       Nitric acid,
                       Nitrosulphuric acid,
                       Muriatic acid,
                       Sulphuric acid.
    Of these  bodies the muriatic acid acts probably in the way
 that Dr.  Faraday    has pointed out, but the immediate cause of
 the rise of tension in the others, is to be traced to the circum
 stance, that they furnish oxygen to the nascent hydrogen; and
 if the tension of the ordinary current is made to depend on
 the tendency of the zinc and oxygen to unite, it is reasonable to
 suppose that that tension will increase if a new affinity be    in

troduced, the action of which should correspond with, and
abet that of the zinc for oxygen. This takes place when nitric
acid or an oxysalt of easy decomposibility is added to the so
lution. The tension of the current is not then determined by
the affinity of the zinc for oxygen only, but by all the affinities
that can take place, among all the bodies in the exciting cell.
 We are therefore here led to expand Dr. Faraday's theory,
and to regard what follows as directly opposed to the theory
of contact.                   -
    Upon these principles, in an ordinary arrangement of cop
per, zinc, and sulphuric acid, the tension of the current is
 determined; by the sum of the affinities of zinc for oxygen,
 and hydrogen for copper, diminished by the sum of the affi
 nities of copper for oxygen, oxygen for hydrogen, and hydro
gen for zinc.

assume, that the electromotive power of the generating pair

understood leads to        most remarkable result.

  The current here experimented with                                     was generated by a
pair of wires of copper and tinned iron tº inch in diameter,

    As respects electricity of high tension, a law extremely ana
 logous to that here indicated may be traced. The striking                                              di
stance varies directly as the quantity accumulates.            a given                   If
jar be successively charged with quantities of electricity, as
the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, &c., the intervals of        through which          air
 the  spark  can pass,  vary  directly    those numbers. as    This                                       is

                          the experiments       Lane, Harris, and    of
 other philosophers.
    Now upon what does this striking distance depend? Plainly
 upon the elastic force                  of
                              the coerced fluid, and therefore the
 striking distance will measure the elastic force             tension.                  or

   How far the experiments given in this memoir bear upon
that part of Dr. Faraday's researches in which he has de
termined the relation of common and voltaic electricity by
measure, would form a most important subject of investi
gation.  The results at which he arrives, are in themselves
very astonishing, and are fully borne out by his decisive ex
periments; but when we come to reflect that these results
were obtained by the magnetic needle, and electro-chemical
action, we may perhaps pause. We may ask, whether it is
possible to determine by either of these means, the absolute
quantity of electricity that passes? Both measure, so to speak,
the volume that flows, the one in an indivisible portion of
time, the other that which has flowed at the end of a finite
time; but do either of them measure the true absolute quantity?
Can we tell the absolute amount of a gas, without first know
ing      its                               Can we know how much

       “    MY DEAR SIR,
46
           AVING    seen a notice from Mr. Jacobi sent by you
          to the London and Edinburgh Philosophical Maga
zinet, regarding the success of his experiments on the produc
tion of a moving power by electro-magnetism, I am sure it
will give you pleasure to know that a countryman of our own,
Mr. Robert Davidson, of this place, has been eminently suc
cessful in his labours in the same field of discovery.                in        }.
the first place, he has an arrangement by which with only
two electro-magnets and less than one square foot of zinc
surface (the negative metal being copper) a lathe is driven
with such velocity as to be capable of turning small articles.
Secondly, he has another arrangement, by which, with the
same small extent of galvanic power, a small carriage is driven
on which two persons were carried along a very coarse wooden
floor of a room. And he has a third arrangement, not yet
completed, by which, from the imperfect experiments he has
made, he expects to gain very considerably more force from the
same extent of galvanic power than from either of the other two.
   “The first two of these arrangements were seen in opera
tion by Dr. Fleming, Professor of Natural Philosophy in this
University, and myself, some days ago; and there remains no
doubt on our minds that Mr. Davidson's arrangements will,
when finished, be found available as a highly useful, efficient,
and exceedingly simple moving power.             He has been busily
employed for the last two years in his attempts to perfect his
machines, during           all
                         which time       have been acquainted with

 he has shown    in overcoming the numberless difficulties           has        he
had    toencounter.     So far         know, he was the first who
                                               as

   The question is to show that the equations (B) and (C)
may be satisfied simultaneously by real values of the nine
           a, b, &c., and to determine them. The proof of
this proposition  is now, in consequence of the signification
which I have here assigned to the quantities D, E, F, D', E, F,
word for word the same as that which M. Poisson has given
of the existence of three principal axes of rotation in the Mé
moires de l'Académie, vol. xiv. p. 320, and which of course it is
undesirable here to repeat.
  The kind of motion here supposed to take place, the
etherial molecule vibrating in a straight line in a plane touch
ing the wave-surface, and making with the coordinate axes
the constant angles X, Y, 2, is that, contemplated by Fresnel in
the reasoning which led him to the equation of the wave-surface.
   Suppose the axis a to coincide in direction with the ray,
and the vibrations to be performed in planes at right angles
to that direction, then A : = 0; and suppose

 March 1838; was brought to the Gallery on the 15th of
 August, but did not <U+017F>eed from the time of      capture                     its                     up     to

  The one sort consisted each             copper rod fifteen inches

 these the states        particular parts        the fish whilst of   the                        in

     1758. The other kind of collectors were intended               meet                       to
 the difficulty presented             by
                                the complete immersion           the fish                 of

                               of   eight inches long        two inches
and  a  half wide, was bent into       saddle shape, that

sheet caoutchouc was put over the saddle, the edges project
ing  at  the bottom and the ends; the ends were made                con                        to

   1759. These conductors being put over the fish, collected
power sufficient to produce many electric effects; but when,
as in obtaining the spark, every possible advantage was need
ful, then glass plates were placed at the bottom of the water,
and the fish being over them, the conductors were put over it
until the lower caoutchouc edges rested on the glass, so that
the part of the animal within the caoutchouc was thus almost
as well insulated as if the Gymnotus had been in the air.
   1760. Shock. The shock of this animal was very powerful
when the hands were placed in a favourable position, i.e. one
on the body near the head, and the other near the tail; the
nearer the hands were together within certain limits the less
powerful was the shock.     The disc conductors (1757.) con
veyed the shock very well when the hands were wetted and
applied in close contact with the cylindrical handles ; but
scarcely at      all
                  the handles were held
                   if                      the dry hands        in                     in   an
ordinary way.
   1761. Galvanometer. Using the saddle conductors (1758.)
applied  to the anterior and posterior parts          the Gymnotus,    of
a galvanometer was readily affected.            was not particularly

                                               the upper and lower
surface  of the tongue did not cause        permanent deflection
                                                       a                                    of
more than    25°;  yet   when the fish   gave     powerful discharge
the deflection was        much as   30°,    as
                                          and                   in a
                                                   one case even 40°.
The deflection was constantly          given direction, the electric
                                             in  a
current being always from the anterior parts               the animal       of
through the galvanometer wire            the  posterior
                                                  to      parts.   The
former were therefore for the time externally positive, and
the latter negative.

solution    of
             iodide         of
                          potassium   was easily obtained.       Three
or four folds     of

meter   belonging       Mr.
                          to Gassiot,  we thought we were able                                                in
one   case,  namely,  that when the deflection        the galvanome             of

which are electric, like the Torpedo”.     Dr. Wilson Philip
considers that the agent in certain nerves is electricity modi
fied by vital actiont. Matteucci thinks that the nervous fluid or
energy, in the nerves belonging to the electric organ at least,
is electricity f. M.M. Prevost and Dumas are of opinion that
electricity moves in the nerves belonging to the muscles; and
 M. Prevost adduces a beautiful experiment, in which steel
was magnetized, in proof of this view; which, if it should
be confirmed by further observation, and by other philoso
phers, is of the utmost consequence to the progress of this high
branch of knowledge S.        Now though       am not as yet con            I
vinced by the facts that the nervous fluid is only electricity,
still I think that the agent in the nervous system may be an
inorganic force; and if there be reasons for supposing that
magnetism is a higher relation of force than electricity (1664.
1731. 1734.), so it may well be imagined, that the nervous
power may be of a still more exalted character, and yet within
the reach of experiment.
   1792. The kind of experiment I am bold enough to sug
gest is as follows.               If
                          a Gymnotus or Torpedo has been #
tigued by frequent exertion of the electric organs, would the
sending of currents of similar force to those he emits, or of
other degrees of force, either continuously or intermittingly
in the same direction as those he sends forth, restore him his
powers and strength more rapidly than if he were left to his
natural repose 2

excite the organ on the other side into action? or if sent
through in the contrary direction, will it produce the same or
any effect on that organ?     Will it do so if the nerves                      pro
ceeding to the organ or organs be tied? and will it do so
after the animal has been so far exhausted by previous shocks
as to be unable to throw the organ into action in any, or in
a similar, degree of his own will P
    1795. Such are some of the experiments which the con
formation and relation of the electric organs of these fishes
suggest, as being rational in their performance, and promising
in anticipation.    Others may not think of them as I do ; but
I  can only  say for myself, that were the means in my power,

LV.       Observations of Shooting Stars made on the Night                      of
           August 10, 1839.   By Edward Cooper, Esq.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,                      Birmingham, Aug. 31, 1839.
       insertion of my letter to Dr. Robinson last year, in
YoUR
  the London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine,
giving an account of observations on shooting stars made on
the 10th of August at Geneva, induces me to trouble you
with the present communication.
     Iwas stationed at Brandsbury House, about three miles
N.W. of London, on the night of the last 10th of August, and
was assisted in my observations by two friends of mine, Messrs.
Jones and Fenton.     We confined our range to the Via Lactea,
and expanse of sky to the north of                it,
                                              had requested Sir
                                             London,
                                                        ofas
                                                          I
James South, and the Messrs. Gwielt                        direct         to
their attention         to
                    the south.   During  the preceding   day  the
wind was pretty fresh from the S.W. and S.S.W. with
flying clouds. An almost perfect lull         wind and   of clear          a
sky succeeded          at
                   about  7", and continued till about 11° 45".
At about 12' 30"       was cloudy towards the N.W., and 2m
                             it
    or   3"
        later also towards N.E.         12" 50"  At   was again     all
 clear, and the stars appeared         set  to   be
                                                 perfectly on
                                                           blacka
 ground. These favourable circumstances continued until
 13° 35", when the wind began       stir, and seemed northing
                                            to                                  a
 little, and several clouds          of
                              dark hue rose from the N. and
 N.E. horizon. These however partially passed away, but                         in
  10" more the N.W. horizon showed symptoms           spreadin      of
a   more formidable veil. This gradually extended itself, with
 occasional openings, over the entire heavens, till  14° 15m        at          all
    was shut out, and after waiting some time without any change

                                 made on the                      Night of August 10, 1839.                                                      373
for the better we retired to rest. The dew was very heavy
until 12", but after 13" it entirely disappeared. During 3%
22", actual observation, we noted 152 shooting stars, of which
I have registered     the times of apparition, the directions, the
 estimated  duration,   and magnitudes of 138. Of the remainder
merely the time of apparition was taken down, in consequence
of the rapid succession of the phaenomena, and the impossi
 bility of keeping in mind          their directions, &c.       Three        all                                                                  or

 10th     August 1838,

                                                 at
 fully establishes the fact that the nights        the 10th        11th                                   of                or                    of

tated whether to analyse and expose the partial statements
which I am sorry to say that paper contains; but reflection
convinces me that I need not on this occasion deviate from
my general rule of avoiding scientific controversy. This letter,
which I request you will have the goodness to insert in the
Philosophical Magazine, and also in the succeeding Number
of the Scientific Memoirs, is intended simply to request those
persons who may feel an interest in this branch of science not
to take Mr. Melloni’s statement of the evidence upon which
my conclusions were founded, but to consult the papers
themselves, viz.
    On the Refraction and Polarization of Heat. Edinburgh
      Trans., vol. xiii. and London and Edin. Phil. Mag.,
      vol. vi. 1835.

    What has principally determined me to enter into no con
troversy on the matter is this, that however faulty or unsatis
factory   my methods of research may have appeared to the
Italian  philosopher,   he has, with but a single exception, con
firmed   precisely  and unequivocally the results which       I was
the first to announce.     That exception is the fact of the vari
able polarizability of heat from different sources, which is so
ingeniously combated in the paper translated in the Scientific

 examined anew and with every care this curious question,
which is considered at length in the third of my papers quoted
above, I have not only demonstrated the accuracy of my first
                 I
assertion, but have there explained (I believe satisfactorily)
 the cause of the apparently contrary conclusions obtained by
 Mr. Melloni.               I am, my dear Sir, yours truly,

   To the  Editors of the Philosophical   Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
     HE    universal interest which the discoveries of Daguerreo
      type and the photographic art have excited, will, I hope,
 excuse my soliciting a space in the pages of your scientific
 Journal, for the purpose of explaining an important fact

382   Mr. Towson                on the proper Focus            for the Daguerreotype.
which has hitherto escaped observation.        It appears from a
note   appended  to page  37 of the  English translation of “Da
guerre's description,” that he does not use an achromatic lens;
and from p. 62, that the focus he uses is obtained by advancing
or withdrawing the frame of the obscured glass until he ob
tains the outlines of the subject with the greatest neatness.
This method would be most correct if the chemical rays were
identical with the luminous rays.                         If
                                          such were the case the
effect  produced   on his  plate would be precisely that which
had appeared on his obscured glass.        But it is a well-known
fact, that the chemical rays are more susceptible of refraction
than the luminous rays; it is therefore necessary, in order
to obtain the neatest effect, that the camera should - be adjusted
to the focus of the chemical rays.
   M. Frauenhofer, by his investigation of the phaenomena of
 the prismatic spectrum, has shown that the index of refraction
of each ray is as follows:
                                                                                         |

the importance of obtaining the chemical focus of a lens,                        I
have inclosed two street views taken on the “improved photo
graphic paper” sold by Mr. Richards of this town. This
preparation produces lights which correspond with lights
and shades with shades, consequently the effect of a correct
focus is more perceptible than would be the case on papers
that reverse the tints. The subject of both views is the same;
the paper of each is from the same piece; and the times and
the lights employed in taking them were as similar as possible,
the difference of effect being solely produced by No. 2 having
been placed in the mean Tuminous focus, but No. 1 in the
mean chemical focus, discovered by the above formula.           On
observing the very great difference between the two views,
the question immediately occurs, how then does Daguerre
produce such clear pictures if he uses the wrong focus f
 When however we observe the imperfect view, No. 2, we are
 not to conclude that the luminous focus always produces so
 little distinctness. During the summer months I have, together
 with Mr. Hunt of this town, devoted considerable attention
 to the practice of the photographic art, and have succeeded
 in obtaining many very tolerably distinct views, although we
 used the luminous focus of the lens.      This we effected by re
 ducing the diameter of the lens or stop to a considerable ex
 tent, but by so doing we delayed the process of taking the
 view. This is also the mode by which Daguerre in a great
  measure neutralizes the effect of the imperfect focus which
 it appears he is in the habit of using. By thus reducing the
 size of the lens of a camera, that aberration of the glass which
  arises from the use of a wrong focus is diminished in direct
 proportion to the squares of the diameter of the lens or stop,
  but the number of rays transmitted is thereby reduced in the
  same proportion.       The diameter of the stop of the camera
  employed in drawing the inclosed views was equal to one
  sixth of the focal length of the lens, whereas it appears from
  the description of Daguerre's camera that his lens is of less
  diameter than T'ath of        its
                                 focal length, and the engraving
  which   represents  his camera shows      stop

                                                   one half that
  diameter.     This being the case the aberration arising from
  the incorrect focus     reduced

Mr. Ivory        on the Theory           of the Astronomical Refractions.                          385
sensitive character of his preparation is lost, and the value of
less sensitive modes is reduced in a still greater proportion.
   Daguerre informs us, that under very favourable circum
stances a drawing may be obtained by exposing his plates in
the camera during from three to five minutes.          then, by                         If
correcting his focus, he were enabled to use a lens of equal
power to the one by which the inclosed drawings were pro
duced, he would be enabled to make the necessary impression
in from ten to twelve seconds.
   During the discussion which took place at the Institute,
after M. Arago had publicly announced the process of Da
guerreotype, it was allowed to be a great desideratum that the
art might be applied to taking portraits from life. The use
of large lenses, which the correction of the focus enables us to
 adopt, would, I should imagine, render such an application
of the art practicable; and the value of each use to which this
important invention is applied, must also be increased by a
knowledge of the means of obtaining the best possible effect
 in the least possible time.

The three quantities a, q, u are severally equal to zero at the
surface of the earth: so that, by the same procedure as before,
we shall obtain these formulas,

 But it is to be observed that, in these expressions, the coeffi
 cients,f, f', &c., are not exactly the same as in an atmosphere
of dry air: for the quantities mentioned, although they have
 determinate values in the same quiescent                depend
upon the manner in which the temperature q, or the height 2,

     Ifwe suppose that the height z is not very great, so that

like value in the case of dry air, we must resolve the complex

                or Grauwacke system as is exposed in the counties
of Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall,” by the Rev. David Williams,
F.G.S.
    The author commences by stating, that his views of the general
structure and arrangement of the country are original and independ
ent, but that he does not in the least impugn the originality of the
observations and inferences of other geologists.        He mentions, that
in a communication read before the British Association at Dublin
 (1835), he used the following expression in remarking on the
broad outline of the structure of Devonshire with respect to the
relative position of the strata containing plants and culm: “the
clay slate (without the intervention of gneiss or mica-slate) dips
away from the granite of Lundy on the one hand, and from the
      ite of Dartmoor towards it on the other; ” and that in a paper
sent to the Meeting of the British Association at Bristol (1836), but
received too late to be read, was inserted this passage: “the same
beds being brought up to the surface at either extremity” (Exmoor
and the north of Cornwall) “contain in their great intermediate
trough    all the strangely contorted rocks and carbonaceous shales
we there witness.”
    Mr. Williams then alludes           error whichto   anmade    the paper   he         in
read at   Dublin, by considering the mineral axis          Dartmoor            of                  to   be

another error which             he

                 did not discover till the spring and summer          1838,                   of
when     he  perceived that “the two superior members            the North           of
Devon group, Nos.         and 7.  are brought 8.         the south       up

of Linton; 2. Foreland and Dunkerry sandstone; 1. Cannington
Park limestone.      Only 9. 8. and 7. are described in the paper; the
other six, confined, the author believes, to the north of Devonshire
and the south of Somersetshire, being reserved for future consi
deration.
    9. Floriferous slates and sandstones.—This term is proposed for the
series of beds containing culm, to avoid the ambiguity of the word
“carbonaceous,” and as preferable, in the author's opinion, to
“culmiferous,” plants being very generally distributed, and culm
confined to a small area. The sandstones are finely micaceous,
tough, externally of a rusty or dull purple colour, and internally of a
dull olive, and they are stated to be totally distinct from any others
in the country. The shales or slates are commonly dark-coloured
and friable, but at Forrabury and Bos Castle they constitute roofing
slates, resembling those of the inferior groups, though much dete
riorated by a combination of pyritous anthracite. One variety, called
Adder Limestone, is a fine hone slate. The culm forms great insu
lated elliptical “bunches,” sometimes gradually thinning out, and
sometimes being suddenly nipped off.           The strata are strangely
contorted, and these disturbances have entailed on the country its
physical features of rapidly succeeding hills and valleys; but Mr.
Williams conceives, that the curvatures are confined to No. 9.
and the two upper divisions of No. 8. and that they are due to
lateral pressure produced by the upheaval of the granite of Dart
moor.      The area occupied by the “floriferous deposit” is stated
to be 50 miles in a west and east direction, and 25 in a north and
south.
    8. Coddon Hill Grits.-On the confines of this formation the
 floriferous sandstones become thin-bedded and coarsely laminated,
 and after a series of alternations and gradual transitions, are finally
 succeeded by the well-characterized Coddon Hill grits.       This series
 is divided by the author into grits, limestones, and dark slates, con
 necting the floriferous sandstones (9.) with the trilobite slates (7.);
 and Mr. Williams asserts, that more regular passages from one
 system of beds to another cannot exist, there being no want of
 conformity, and that as the constituents of one deposit gradually
 decrease those of the other gradually increase. The grits are stated
 to be lithologically distinct from any other in the country.      They
 are  slightly calcareous, fine-grained, flinty, thin-bedded, and dark
 coloured, but often striped of different tints; and from containing
 a varying proportion of felspar, occasionally assume, on decompo
 sition, a resemblance to some of the harder chalks.        The wavelite
 of Devonshire occurs in these grits. The following localities are
 mentioned where the passage from the floriferous strata into the
 Coddon grits, and thence into the trilobite slates, may be advan
 tageously examined: the neighbourhood of Bampton, Morebath,
 where the turnpike road to Hatchet intersects the grits—the back of
  Swimbridge, four miles east of Barnstaple—Rumson Lane, a mile
 south of Barnstaple, and Fremington Pill, below Pen-hill, on the
 west of Barnstaple.       Organic remains are very rare in the grits,

Mr. Williams having found only         a few fragments of Crinoidea and
a chambered univalve.
    The grits are associated, about the middle of the series, with
large insulated lenticular masses composed of beds of dark lime
stones alternating with strata of black shale, containing plants and
flakes of anthracite; also Goniatites and Posidonia.            These len
ticular masses    may  be  traced,  in the north of    Devon,   from Barn
staple to Bampton, and in the south from Launceston to Drew
steignton.      To the east of Bampton and Drewsteignton the shales
not only thin out, and the whole mass becomes calcareous, but the
author says, that there is an upper suite of thick-bedded coral lime
stones. These changes are stated to take place at Hockworthy,
Holcomb Rogus, Westleigh, Chudleigh, and Ashburton, emerging
at each locality except the last, from below the floriferous slates,
and accompanied by the Coddon Hill grits.             At Ashburton, how
ever, he states, that a fault brings the limestone abruptly in contact
 with the trilobite slates, the passage beds not being exhibited.
     The Coddon Hill limestones are succeeded by the lowest division of
No. 8, consisting of the series of slaty beds which forms the passage
into the trilobite slates (No. 7.).
     7. Trilobite Slates.—This group is characterized, in some locali
 ties, by an abundance of trilobites, particularly in the north of
 Devon, and at Landlake in the south.              It constitutes the low
 southern flank of Exmoor, ranging from Baggy and Diamond Points
 on the British Channel eastward to Shawley; and Mr. Williams
 conceives that it constitutes the south of Devonshire and the whole
 of Cornwall, with the exception of the granitic and other igneous
 masses.      The limestones of Trenalt, Petherwin, Landlake, Ply
 mouth, Newton Bushell, Denbury, and Torbay, are placed in it by
 the author; but in the north of Devon he knows only two localities
 at which limestone has been observed in this division.            Organic
 remains are abundant in the calcareous      beds,  and are well preserved.
 The author estimates the thickness of the group to be 84 miles.
     The strata in the north of Devon and south of Somerset inferior
 to No. 7, Mr. Williams proposes to describe in another paper.
     April 24.- A paper was first read “On the Climate of the newer
  pliocene tertiary period,” by James Smith, Esq., F.G.S.
     During an examination of the fossils contained in the marine
 beds which indicate the latest changes in the relative level of sea
 and land in the west of Scotland, Mr. Smith observed, that many of
 the most common shells in the raised beds of the basin of the Clyde
 are identical with species found by Mr. Lyell at Uddevalla in
 Sweden”; and he has been induced to conclude from the arctic
 character of the testacea, that the climate of Scotland during the
 accumulation of these beds was colder than it is at present.
     On showing some of the fossils, which are apparently extinct, to
 Mr. Gray, that naturalist noticed their great resemblance to arctic
 species. The shells still living, though not known on the coasts
 of Great Britain, but found in the raised deposits of the Clyde,

  have hastened to place their reasons for doing so upon record, before
  the Geological Society.       On three out of four of the essential
  points in their former communication, the authors' views remain
  unchanged; they adhere to the belief, which they were the first to
  put forth, that the greater portion of Devonshire belongs to the true
  carboniferous system, and that the succession and lithological cha
  racters of the different mineral masses in North and South Devon,
  which they then pointed out, remain unaltered.         In proof of this
  there were suspended, during the reading of the paper, the same
  sections as were exhibited at Bristol in 1836. The change, there
  fore, which they propose, is to remove the lowest rocks from the
  Cambrian and Silurian systems to the old red; and their reason for
  making this alteration is founded on zoological evidence recently
  obtained, which shows that the organic remains of these deposits
  are of a peculiar character, approaching in the upper division, the
  fossils of the carboniferous strata, and in the lower, those of the Si
  lurian system; as well as upon the previously ascertained regular
  sequence or passage from the carboniferous strata, through all the
  subjacent series of deposits.
     The fossil plants of the culm basin having been formerly deter
 mined to be, as far as recognizable, true coal measures remains, and
 the deposit having been therefore assigned to the era of the carbo
 niferous system, the order of superposition being also clear, the
 strata underlying the coal basin might naturally be referred to
 the old red sandstone, if the organic remains found in them, belonged
 to a natural group, intermediate between the fossils of the carboni
 ferous and Silurian systems.      Subsequent examination has proved
 that such is the case; but this distinction could not have been ascer
 tained had not Mr. Murchison published his work on the Silurian
system.
     In the order of sequence there is now no difference of opinion
 between the authors and Mr. De la Beche and Mr. Williams, the
 only point on which the agreement is not common, being the class
 to which the formations should be assigned.
     The authors then explained that their sections both in S. Devon
 and N. Cornwall indicate, with some limited exceptions, a passage
 downwards, the transition being stratigraphically true, whether the
 beds be examined along the banks of the Taw, near Barnstaple, on
 the north, or to the west of Launceston, on the south of the great
trough.
    The authors next gave an approximate list of the fossils, collected
 by themselves or placed at their disposal by the Rev. R. Hennah,
 Major Harding, and the Rev. D. Williams, referring them to the
 great mineral groups to which they belong, both in North and
South Devon.
    Descending order in North Devon.—The shells in the uppermost
 group, beneath the culm, as at Barnstaple, in the North of Devon,
 and South Petherwin, near Launceston in the south, approach ge
 nerally forms of the carboniferous system, consisting of Goniatites
of new species, and of spined Producti and Spirifers, entirely unlike

the   species found       in the Silurian system, but resembling those ob
tained in the mountain limestone.          The same group contains also
new   species of Trilobites and Crinoidea.
    In the next underlying formation in the north, or the sandstone
group, ranging from Baggy Point by Marwood and Sloly, occur new
species of Cucullaea, Avicula 2 Cypricardia, and Orthocera; one cast
also has been obtained, undistinguishable from Bellerophon globatus
of the Silurian system. In the same series are found casts of plants.
of considerable size, but in Professor Henslow's opinion, quite
distinct from any known coal measures remains.
   In the third descending group, but few fossils have yet been
found, yet it has been ascertained to contain one of the varieties of
Producta common in the overlying groups, and similar to the spi
nous species of the mountain limestone; also a coral (Favosites po
lymorpha,) previously found in England only in the Upper Silurian
rocks.
   The next descending series of beds, or the arenaceous deposits of
Linton, contains few fossils, except towards           lower part, whereits
calcareous matter re-appears, and        that portion
                                                  in     Spirifer has beena

of age, and the term greywacke being lithologically applicable
to beds of every class of rocks, and as Devonshire affords the
best type of the fossils of this intermediate system, the authors
propose to substitute the term Devonian for old red sandstone;
and they hope that the organic remains, discovered in that county,
will enable continental geologists to detect in their own country,
a system of strata hitherto supposed to be almost peculiar to the
British Isles.
   The authors acknowledge the assistance they have received from
 Mr. J. Sowerby; and that Mr. Lonsdale first suggested, from their
fossil contents, that the limestones of S. Devonshire might prove to
 be the representatives of the old red sandstone.
    A paper was afterwards read on the structure of South Devon, by
 Robert A. C. Austen, Esq., F.G.S.
    This communication is supplementary to a memoir read in 1837*,
 and its object is to show the general relations of the various bands
 of slates, limestones, and sandstones in South Devon.

and slaty structure.         It
                             contains much carbonaceous matter, thin
seams of anthracite,     also corals and Brachiopoda.      It is associated
with  irregular  beds of contemporaneous trap. The band is stated to
range from Staple Hill on the east, through Bickington, Ashburton,
Buckfastleigh, and Dean, near which the limestone ends; but the
calcareous slate and limestone of the south of Cornwall, Mr. Austen
considers to be of the same age.      These beds dip south.

Dunwell, Shilstone, Ugborough, Fowley-cumber, North Huish, Sto
verton, Great and Little Hampston, &c.
   5th. An arenaceous deposit, often coarse and resembling old
red sandstone; but sometimes conglomeratic, and then not distin
guishable from the new red of Devonshire.        Its upper conglomeratic
portion ranges from Plymouth Sound and Bigbury Bay, to Modbury
and Blackdown; its lower portion cuts the Dart a little below Tot
ness, and rises into lofty hills, east of a line passing through Berry
Pomeroy, Marldon, Cockington, and Barton.            It contains limestone
south of Yealmpton, and at Sequers Bridge; also several thin
bands on the Dart, and beds at Berry, Marldon, Collaton, and Yal
berton.     Organic remains are not uncommon in this arenaceous di
vision.    Only the fine-grained beds show a slaty cleavage. The
limestone is confined to           its

Modbury presents many undulations, Mr. Austen suggests that the
slate beds of the south may be the equivalents of the limestone on
the north; in which case the passage downwards into the mica slate
and gneiss of the Prawle Point may be the equivalents of No. 4, in a
metamorphic     condition.

the newest deposits of the series, not being covered by any formation

    The carbonaceous rocks of central Devon are stated by Mr. Austen
to form no part of the above system, but to rest upon it uncon
formably.
    May 8.    An extract from      a letter addressed to           Mr. Murchison by
Mr. Miller of    Cromartie,   was read.
   The fish beds in the old red sandstone of the neighbourhood of
Cromartie, are very extensive. They are overlaid, where not denu
dated, by a thick stratum of soft yellow sandstone; and are under
laid by a deposit consisting of red sandstone, containing in the middle
a chocolate-coloured conglomerate, similar to that of the Findhorn.
The bold cliffs of the Moray Frith present fine sections of the old
red, including the fish beds. The letter is accompanied by illustra
tive drawings exhibiting the succession, range, and dip of the strata.
Mr. Miller gives also an account of a series of faults in the Burn of
Ethie, one of which, he conceives, may be traced nearly north to the
town of Cromartie.
   A paper was read, On the London and Plastic Clay formations
of the Isle of Wight, by Mr. Bowerbank, F.G.S.
   The object of this communication is to show that there are no
zoological distinctions between the London and Plastic Clays. Mr.
Bowerbank first examined closely the strata of White Cliff Bay, and
found the ascending order of the beds to be as follows:—

    The above section proves, in Mr. Bowerbank's opinion, that in
 White Cliff Bay there is an alternation of London and plastic clays
 throughout 525 paces, and that London clay fossils not only occur
 abundantly in the part which corresponds with the great mass of
that formation in Alum Bay, but are likewise found in the beds,
Nos. 8. and 6, which occur below it.
   Mr. Bowerbank then described the strata in Alum Bay, taking
Mr. Webster's section as the base of his observations; and he
pointed out, that in the beds of greenish gray sand and clay marked
d in that section, and below the variegated sand and clays which
underlie the London clay, he found the following shells, charac
teristic of that formation:–Venericardia planicosta, Cardita marga
ritacea, Mya intermedia, Cardium semigranulatum, Nucula similis,
N. amygdaloides, Turritella conoidea, T. elongata, T. edita, Murer
innerus, (Brander) Buccinum desertum, and Cancer Leachii.                             In the
variegated sands and clays no fossils were found.
    An extract from a letter, dated Newcastle, 14th February, 1839,
and addressed to Dr. Buckland, by Mr. Atkinson, was then read.
   This letter accompanied a series of slabs of fissile or slaty mica
ceous sandstone, presenting the tortuous casts of vermiform bodies,
either impressed in the stone or in relief.                   The more perfect casts
are marked by a longitudinal line, and closely-set transverse fine
striae. The bed from which the slabs were procured, belongs to the
carboniferous formation near Haltwhistle in Northumberland.

     Mr. Atkinson is of opinion that the impressions are principally
  due to worm-tracks.
     A paper was afterwards read, “On the relative ages of the ter
  tiary deposits commonly called Crag, in Norfolk and Suffolk,” by
  Charles Lyell, Esq., V.P.G.S.
     This paper contains the results of Mr. Lyell's examination of the
 crag, with reference to the three following points:—First, The
 direct superposition of the red to the coralline crag, as originally
 pointed out by Mr. Charlesworth in 1835 : Secondly, Whether the
 remains of mammalia are really imbedded in regular and undis
 turbed marine strata in the Norwich crag : Thirdly, Whether the
 proportion of recent shells, as compared to the extinct, is decidedly
 larger in the crag of Norwich, so as to indicate a posteriority in age
 relatively to the Suffolk crag.
     1. Of the superposition of the red on the coralline crag, the
 author found distinct proofs in the sections at Ramsholt and Tat
tingstone, as previously indicated by Mr. Charlesworth, and in
 quarries near Sudburne pointed out to him by Mr. Bunbury. At
Tattingstone the coralline crag consists chiefly of greenish marl,
with discontinuous layers of stone, and the number of corals is
very small; but both at that locality and Ramsholt, the red crag
rests on denuded beds of the coralline.       At Sutton, near Wood
bridge, Mr. Lyell was enabled to ascertain, by the assistance of
Mr. W. Colchester, that the red crag in some places abuts against
a vertical face of the coralline, as well as overlies it; and that
in consequence of the irregularities in the outline of the face, the
two deposits have a deceptive appearance of alternating.        He also
ascertained, in addition to the above evidence, that the older or
lower strata must have acquired a certain consistency before the
newer were accumulated, because the calcareous sand or comminuted
shells and zoophytes, of which the former are composed, is perfo
rated to the depth of 6 or 8 feet from the surface by the tortuous
borings of pholades, the shells of which are frequently found at the
bottom of the tubes, the remainder of the perforations being filled
with the sand of the superjacent red crag. The most northern
point to which the coralline crag has been traced, is Sizewell Gap,
several miles north of Thorpe.
    2. With respect to remains of mammalia being imbedded in
undisturbed marine beds in the Norwich crag, Mr. Lyell stated,
that an examination of this crag in the neighbourhood of Southwold
and Norwich had convinced him, that instead of the deposit being
purely marine, it is fluvio-marine, containing every where an inter
mixture of land, freshwater, and sea-shells, with the bones of
mammalia and fishes.       The formation is exposed along the coast,
at   Thorpe,  near Aldborough,    where it may be seen at low-water
resting on the coralline crag ; but it is most largely developed in the
neighbourhood of Southwold, where the author examined it accom
panied by Capt. Alexander.       In that district, it varies greatly in
character, consisting of irregular beds of sand, shingle, loam, and

408                         Geological Society.
laminated clay; but it appears to have been in some places tran
quilly accumulated, as specimens of Nucula Cobboldiae, Tellina obliqua,
and Mya arenaria, occur with the valves united, and not worn by
attrition.    In the same beds, however, are procured rolled fish
 bones, and remains of the elephant, rhinoceros, horse, and deer.
 Capt. Alexander found at the base of the cliff, in a bed about 6
 inches thick and rich in marine shells, the tooth of a horse within a
 large Fusus striatus.     That gentleman also possesses a tooth of a
 mastodon, washed out of the cliffs between Dunwich and Size
  well.
     In tracing the Norwich crag from Easter Bavant northward to
 wards Kessingland, Mr. Lyell found in it layers of flinty shingle;
  and he consequently refers to this formation, those strata of sand
  and shingle, on the coast, which resemble the sandy portions of
  the plastic clay of the London and Hampshire basins.
      In some of the inland pits of Norwich crag near Southwold, the
  author found mammiferous remains associated with a variety of
  Cyrena trigonalis, a shell common in the freshwater deposit of Grays,
  and elsewhere.
      In the neighbourhood of Norwich the deposit forms patches of
  very variable thickness, resting upon chalk, and covered by a dense
  bed of gravel.     It is best displayed at Bramerton, Whitlingham,
  Thorpe, and Postwick, and consists of sand, loam, and gravel, en
  closing marine, land, and freshwater shells, with ichthyolites and
  bones of mammalia; and Mr. Lyell says, it was evidently accumulated
  near the mouth of a river.       The late Mr. Woodward describes the
  chalk of Postwick as      having  been drilled by marine animals before
  the deposition of the   crag,  and the Rev. Mr. Clowes found in a per
  foration in the chalk at   Whitlingham    the shell of a Pholas crispatus,
  the remainder of the perforation being filled with crag.           Among
  other proofs that the strata were       gradually  deposited,  the author
   mentioned Capt. Alexander's discovery of an elephant's tusk, with
  many serpulac attached to it; and he infers from this fossil, that the
  remains of the mammalia were really washed into the sea of the
   Norwich crag, and were not subsequently introduced by diluvial
   action, as some observers have suspected. The freshwater shells,
   although most diligently searched for, are less abundant than
   marine, and the terrestrial are still more rare; but Mr. Wigham has
   found in one bed at Thorpe, a great predominance of fluviatile tes
   tacea. In the same pits he obtained a mastodon’s tooth at the bottom
   of the deposit, near the chalk, associated with pectens and other
   marine shells.    In the beds at Postwick, he also discovered, in
   1835, part of the left side of the upper jaw of a mastodon, con
   taining the second true molar. This fragment Mr. Owen has been
   able to identify with the Mastodon longirostris of Eppelsheim.         In
  the same    bed, Mr.  Wigham     also  obtained  the teeth  and  jaw  of a
  field-mouse, larger than those of the common species; likewise
  remains of birds, and several species of fishes. The horns of stags,
  bones and teeth of the horse, pig, elephant, and other quadrupeds,
  have been obtained at Postwick, Thorpe, Bramerton, &c., near

              Mr. Lyell   on the relative ages   of Crag.           409
Norwich;     and this association of remains of the mastodon and
horse, both in Norfolk and on the continents of Europe and America,
Mr. Owen considers as a subject not without interest.
    Mr. Lyell examined also the crag north of Norwich at several
pits between that city and Horstead, and ascertained that it was
of the same kind, resting upon chalk, and overlaid by gravel. He
found in it Fusus striatus, Turritella terebra, Cerithium punctatum,
Pectunculus variabilis, Tellina obliqua, T. calcarea, Cardium edule,
and Cyprina vulgaris.
    3. On the third point, the relative antiquity of the Norwich to
the Suffolk crag, and the degree of resemblance of its shells to those
of existing series, the memoir contains much very valuable inform
ation.    The author acknowledges his obligations for assistance
during his researches, to Mr. J. B. Wigham, who has nearly
doubled the number of Norwich species of testacea; to Mr. Searles
Wood, who gave Mr. Lyell free access to his fine collection of crag
fossils; and to Mr. G. Sowerby, for the careful comparison and de
termination of the recent species; he also acknowledges the aid
afforded him by Mr. Fitch of Norwich, and Capt. Alexander of
 Southwold.
    The total number of species in the Norwich crag, rejecting those
varieties formerly considered to be distinct species, is 111, of which
 19 belong to land or freshwater genera. This comparatively small
 number of species, whether compared with the testacea of the Bri
 tish seas or the Fauna of the Suffolk crag, and not due to want of
 activity on the part of collectors, or a paucity of specimens, Mr.
 Lyell explained by showing, that in seas, the water of which is
 only brackish, as that of the Baltic, or any great estuary, species are
 far less numerous than in the salt sea, latitude, climate, and other
 conditions being the same.     A similar scarcity of species exists also
 in the fluvio-marine deposits along the Rhine, between Basle and
 Mayence.
     Of the 92 marine shells of the Norwich crag, Mr. Wood has
 recognised 73 species found in the red crag, and therefore it might
 be inferred that the two formations are nearly of the same age; but
 on applying the test of the proportions of recent species, Mr. Lyell
 ascertained that the Norwich crag, both with respect to the marine
 and the freshwater shells, contains between 50 and 60 per cent.,
 whereas in the red crag there are only 30 per cent., and in the
 coralline but 19.
     Mr. Charlesworth had previously implied that the Norwich beds
  were the most recent, by stating his belief that shells had been
  washed out of the red crag into the Norwich; and both he and
  Mr. S. Wood had recognised in the Norwich beds a nearer approach
  to the existing British Fauna.
     The only known freshwater testacea of the red crag of Suffolk
  were collected by Mr. S. Wood at Sutton, and consist of three
  specimens of Auricula myosetis and one of the variety of Planorbis
  marginatus, with a slightly prominent keel: both of these shells occur
  in the Norwich crag. Among the other freshwater species of the

   410                       Geological Society.
   Norwich crag is the Cyrena trigonalis, found also at Southwold
   and Crostwick. The land shells consist of Helia hispida, H. ple
   bium, and a species found at Southwold     by Capt. Alexander, bearing
   a  strong  resemblance to Helix  Touronensis,  so common in the faluns
   of Touraine. All the 92 marine species, except two or three, are
   found either in the red crag or living, so that a very small number
   were peculiar to this period.    It is important to notice, that a large
   proportion of the recent shells in the coralline crag have not been
   met with in red or Norwich; but this absence Mr. Lyell attributes
   to the fragile nature of many of these shells, and in some cases to
   their having been peculiar to deep or tranquil seas.
       In determining the above results, the utmost care was taken to
   exclude all those shells which might have been washed out of the
   red crag into the Norfolk, or did not live in the waters by which the
  latter was deposited.
       Should these numerical conclusions hereafter require some mo
  dification, still the Norwich crag will be referable to the older
  Pliocene period, and the red and coralline to different parts of the
  Miocene.
      From an equally careful examination by the author, Mr. Wood,
  and Mr. G. Sowerby, of the testacea obtained in the superficial
  lacustrine or fluviatile deposits at Cromer and Mundesley in Norfolk,
  Stutton, Grays, Ilford, and other places near London, it appears,
  that the proportion of recent shells in those accumulations is still
  greater than in the Norwich crag, exceeding 90 per cent., and, con
  sequently, that they must be placed among the newer Pliocene
  strata.
      In a paper communicated to the British Association at Bristol in
  1835, Mr. Charlesworth adopted a similar chronological arrange
  ment of the formations above the London clay in the eastern coun
 ties, placing the coralline crag at the bottom of the series, the red
 crag next in ascending order, then the Norwich (mammaliferous)
 crag, and, highest, the lacustrine strata. In that paper Mr. Charles
 worth states, that the proportion of recent to extinct species had
 not then been determined; and Mr. Lyell remarks, it is satisfactory
 to find, that the palaeontological test of age, derived from the relative
 approach to the recent Fauna, is perfectly in accordance with the
 independent evidence drawn from superposition and the included
 fragments of older beds.
     The memoir contains also a general comparison of the fossils of the
 crag with those of the faluns of Touraine. When M. Desnoyers, in
 1825, assigned a contemporaneous origin to both these formations,
 Mr. Lyell dissented from the conclusion, 1st. because the per-centage
of recent species then ascribed to the crag, and determined chiefly
from fossils of the Norwich beds, was greater than that of the Tou
raine deposit; and, 2ndly, because the fossils are not only almost
entirely of distinct species, though only 300 miles distant from each
other, but that the Fauna of the crag has a northern aspect, and
that of Touraine an almost tropical character.         A recent examina
tion, by Mr. S. Wood, of a series of Touraine shells procured from

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                   411
M.   Desjardin by Mr. Lyell, has proved, that there are not 10 per
cent. of species identical with shells of the crag, but an examination
of the same series by Mr. G. Sowerby and the author has led to the
conclusion, that the recent species are in the proportion of 26 per
cent.    Mr. Lyell, therefore, now accedes to the opinion of M. Des
noyers, that the red and coralline crag may correspond in age, ge
nerally, with the faluns of Touraine; and he is of opinion that the
difference in the character of the two Faunas may be explained by
there having existed at that epoch, a more equable climate, similar
to the one experienced at present on the east coast of South
America, where, in lat. 39°, occur, in a living state, a large Oliva, a
Voluta, and a Terebra; and that a geographical barrier, like that of
the Isthmus of Suez, which separates the widely different Faunas of
the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, may have intervened between
the region of the crag and the faluns of Touraine.
   The paper concludes with a list of the testacea of the Norwich
crag, determined by the author, Mr. S. Wood, and Mr. G. Sowerby".

           PRESENCE OF IODINE IN COAL FORMATIONS.
M      e
         BUSSY     states that on examining some mineral specimens ob
          tained from a coal mine in a state of combustion at Commen
try (Allier), he ascertained the presence of ammonia and iodine. Ha
ving at first observed indications of iodine in some of the specimens, he
was afterwards unable to detect it. The iodine was in the state of
hydriodate of ammonia, and the acid had left the alkali. As to the
origin of this element, M. Bussy supposes that it exists in the bowels
of the earth in the state of iodide of potassium, and that it is disen
gaged in the state of vapour by subterraneous heat. It is well known
that ammonia is one of the constant products of the distillation of
coal; but the presence of iodine in coal formations is a new fact,
worthy of being noticed.—L'Institut, July, 1839.
         PREPARATION         OF CHLOROSALTS.         BY M. FILHOL,
    When chloride of iodine and an alkaline chloride are mixed, a
chlorosalt is formed ; this is proved by the following reactions:—
    1st. If a mixture of iodide of potassium and chlorate of potash be
treated with hydro-chloric acid, the chlorine, iodine, and potassium,
simultaneously come into contact; and when the solution is finished,
the potassium chlorosalt is obtained on cooling; it may however
happen that an excess of chlorine may prevent regular crystalliza
tion; very beautiful specimens of the salt may however be obtained.

                                CHLORO-STANNITE OF MERCURY.
   M. Capitaine gives this name to the white matter which sublimes
when chloride of tin is formed, by the combination of the protochlo
rides of tin and of mercury.
    The best process for preparing it is the following: take 24 parts
of protochloride of mercury, and 3 parts of tin amalgamated with a
portion of the mercury.            These quantities correspond to rather less
than two       equivalents      of the protochloride to one equivalent of
tin. These substances after being thoroughly mixed are to be put
into a retort capable of holding four times the quantity, on account
of the swelling up which occurs when the action begins; when the
retort is heated by a few coals, the action soon takes place with a
slight noise, the cessation of which shows that the action is complete.
When the retort is cold it is to be broken, and it is found to contain
a grey substance, which is frequently spongy; and beneath this there
is some mercury, which separates during the action. This grey matter
is to be pulverized and put into a flat-bottomed matrass, which is to
be heated to about the boiling point of mercury.                   Bichloride of tin
is vaporized, and the chloro-stannite                 of mercury sublimes, and
there remain in the matrass anhydrous protochloride of tin, and some
 mercury.
     When white vapours cease to arise in notable quantity, the opera
 tion is to be stopped; when the matrass has cooled, it is to be cut at
 about an inch from the bottom, and the upper part will be found
 studded with white dendritic crystals of chloro-stannite of mercury;
 these are to be removed with feather, and kept in a well-stopped
 bottle, for they attract moisture from the air.
     The properties of this substance are, that it is perfectly white. It
 is volatile, but        point  its             of
                                     volatilization       simultaneous with that
                                                                          is                                 of
 its  point     decomposition,                               volatilized unchanged.
                                                                               be

                                                 cannot        it
 When       it  heated       portion only sublimes, the remainder
                                      a                                         decom              is

LXII.    On the Combinations of Carbon with Silicon and Iron
  and other metals, forming the different species of Cast Iron,
  Steel, and Malleable Iron.   By Dr. C. SchAFHAEUtL, of
  Munich *.                                            -
THE  opinions of the generality of chemists, concerning the
  chemical constitution of carbon, are briefly as follows:
   The diamond is carbon in                    itshighest state  purity.  Dr.
                                                                           of
Thomson considers next                   to   the diamond the carbon obtained
from decomposed coal-gas.

                             considered graphite      plumbago, an        or
thracite, coke from stone-coal, charcoal, pit-coal, and animal
coal.
    Sir Humphry Davy considers the difference between the
diamond and common charcoal             consist onlyto    the form             in                of
aggregation        of
                  their  molecules;   but     has             he

4.18      Dr.   Schafhaeutl on the Different Species   of
 that the difference between the diamond and charcoal consisted
 only in their form of aggregation.
    Dr. S. Brown closed his highly interesting paper, read at
 the late Birmingham Meeting, “On the Crystallization of Car
 burets,” with the following remarks: “Char wood with suffi
 cient care, and you will obtain, not charcoal, but crystallized
 carbon, or in other words, diamonds.”
    When Scheele first burnt graphite or plumbago, which
 had hitherto always been confounded with molybdena, oxide
 of iron remained on the hearth, and graphite was declared to
 be a carburet of iron. Berthier first showed that the iron
in the graphite might be extracted by means of acids without
 any evolution of hydrogen; Bouesnel and Karsten, burning
 graphite in the muffle of an assay furnace, observed, that seve
 ral of the natural graphites, such as that from Bareros, in the
 Brazils, left an extremely small quantity of ashes.    Graphite
was therefore declared to be   only another modification of pure
carbon.
    The greatest support the above theory received was from
the fact, first observed by Gahn, that some pieces of charcoal,
 which had descended unconsumed through a blast furnace,
and fallen into the twyers, had totally changed their nature,
and when taken out, immediately became extinguished; and
being before extremely porous, became very dense, and from
one of the worst conductors of caloric, they had become nearly
one of the best.
    In order to investigate and elucidate the before-mentioned
facts, I prepared carbon in as pure a state as possible, first,
by decomposing dry carbonic acid gas by means of po
tassium; secondly, by imperfect or partial combustion of alco
hol; and thirdly, by distilling white crystallized sugar in a re
tort.   The three charcoals thus obtained were inclosed in as
many tubes of platinum, the ends of which were, after bein
first ignited to a white heat, then hermetically welded,    .#
afterwards placed in a tube made of Stourbridge clay, filled
also with charcoal, and heated in a blast furnace of Se<U+017F>stroem
till the tubes began to melt. After refrigeration, these differ
ent samples of charcoal were found perfectly unaltered, both
in their physical and chemical properties.       The same expe
riment was repeated by including the same descriptions of char
coals in crucibles made of Stourbridge clay; and during a re
petition of these experiments for sixteen times, in two      in
stances only did the charcoal alter    its nature.   By burning
these two  samples  inoxygen        as well as with alkaline car
bonates,a   large quantity of   #.
                             silica and alumina,   with tracesof
iron, remained, and showed that the charcoal had extracted

              Cast Iron, Steel, and Malleable Iron.                                  419
these substances in the process from the clay of the melting
pots.
   These pure charcoals, which I analysed, I found, both be
fore and after their exposure to the highest degree of tem
perature, invariably to consist as follows:
    1st, Of carbon, hydrogen, and traces of potassium not                            ex
tractable by acids.
   2ndly, Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen; and these charcoals
never parted from their hydrogen, &c., unless they had the
opportunity of combining with silicon or aluminum or iron
instead.
   Graphite or plumbago is sometimes an artificial product,
and separated from the iron on the hearth of the blast furnace
in the process of making gray kishy cast iron, that is to say,
by using a very easily fusible mixture of limestone and iron
ore, and keeping up a great heat in the furnace. This arti
ficial plumbago is called by the workmen kish *. Good white
charcoal iron, which is for sometime kept in a high degree of
temperature, and afterwards very slowly cooled, is invariably
converted into gray iron; so, in like manner, gray charcoal
iron may be converted by sudden cooling into white.
   As the generation of kish and gray iron never takes place,
except during the hot working of the blast furnace, the con
clusion was drawn by Karsten that graphite or kish could
only be generated in the highest degrees of temperature; and
he was led by this circumstance to infer, that by treating iron
ores in small crucibles with charcoal, white iron was always
obtained, and very seldom gray iron.
   I shall, however, show that the generation of graphite com
mences at 1500 degrees Fahr., measured with Daniell’s pyro
meter, a degree in which even brass remains in            rigid              its
State.
   In  some works where gray cast iron                  or
                                                  pig iron     imme         is

 itself.   The pellicle was near the bottom about the thickness
      common letter-paper, but gradually becoming thinner, until
 its of
      trace became lost               on
                                the surface. The surface             the slag,           of

where the graphite pellicle originated, was likewise altered;
the surface of the common puddling or balling slag is of a dull
blueish or of a somewhat slaty appearance, originating in the
closely interwoven angles of the crystals, which constitute the
mass of the slag.    But in this case the whole space of the slag
covered with the pellicle of graphite, presented a glassy
shining appearance, resembling dark green bottle glass; and
viewed through a microscope had a velvety appearance, that
is to say, was formed of small points with circular intervals,
which caused an interference of the rays of light, and was
therefore coloured with the usual bands originating under
such circumstances.
   The manner in which this graphite pellicle was formed,
shows distinctly that not only carbonaceous matters are re
quired for generating graphite, but that a silicate of iron and
manganese is indispensably necessary; for the reason, that no
other substance is capable of forming graphite with coaly
matter; and secondly, principally because the pellicle was
not only mechanically an interlayer of crystallized carbon be
tween the two slags, but it actually rose out of the surface of
the slag, had taken up a portion of the surface, and finally lost
and immerged itself entirely in the surface: but at the same
time highly bituminous coal is necessary.
   The coal of Rive de Gier, near Lyons, in France, produces
readily and plentifully pellicles of graphite; the coals of
Alais, Pont du Gard, on the foot of the Cevennes, which
contain very little bitumen, produced only an inseparable
powdery or scaly layer of plumbago or graphite.
   The graphite produced by the before-mentioned means must
be divided into two different species.
   Graphite (a), generated about the thickness of paper, always
consists of elastic leaves of a rather dull blueish appearance,
similar to that of annealed sheets of iron.
    Graphite (b), about the thickness of gold-leaf, is shiny,
extremely light, and to the touch similar to natural plum
bago.
  ‘Ail species of plumbago are considered unalterable in              all
kinds of  acids; but     found that concentrated hydrofluoric
                           I

servation, into    flocky light dull carbonaceous mass, during

tremely light silica.
    Nitrate of potash is likewise not to be recommended for de
composing plumbago, as the deflagration is so violent, that not

only much of the mass is liable to be lost, but a great deal of
it remains undecomposed; and the silver                  very fre
quently melts.        I
                      found carbonate of potash or soda decom
posing plumbago quietly and perfectly, even in a dull red
heat.      If
            a white heat be used, the evolution of carbonic acid
gas is very violent; so much so, that drops of the liquid mass
are thrown up against the lid of the crucible, and the crucible
itself is very much attacked. In order to ascertain the vola
tile parts of plumbago, it must be mixed with chromate of
lead and chlorate of potassa in a glass tube heated over a coal
fire, and the gas collected after the well-known methods of
Berzelius and Liebig.
    Before ascertaining the proximate chemical components of
black lead, I digested the well-washed and cleansed material in
nitromuriatic acid for several days in a sand bath; the solution
was then separated from the black lead, evaporated to dry
ness, afterwards dissolved in hydrochloric acid, the remaining
silica collected on a filter, and the oxide of iron thrown down
by ammonia; the well-washed residuum of black lead was
then, still wet, heated with a strong lye of caustic potash, or
better, soda, the filtered lye neutralized with hydrochloric
acid, evaporated to dryness, and the silica separated in the
well-known manner.
    Graphite (a) in paper-like leaves or scales, appeared after
this treatment, to have perhaps increased slightly in bright
ness, but graphite (b) remained quite unaltered in         appear     its

                                   this manner from      mechani
 cal admixtures, was then mixed with five times          weight             of
 carbonate       of
                soda,  and  kept for  half   houran     bright

    As it was impossible to extract the silica with caustic and
carbonaceous lyes, even after a week's digestion, and as the
silicon cannot be considered as silica without our obtaining an
improbable surplus in weight, we may safely conclude, that sili
con existed as such, in the graphite, and in chemical combina

the silicates of the slag by depositing a great quantity of finely
divided coal, as is sometimes the case in gas retorts.
     Ifwe assume the puddling slag to consist of a mixture of dif
ferent silicates, from which the sesquisilicate of iron very often
separates itself during the process of cooling, we may easily con
sider that one atom of the silica of the sesquisilicate is reduced
to silicon, combining with the superabundant carbonaceous
matter, in the nascent state, into a carburet of silicon, which
with the other three atoms of protoxide of iron and one atom
of silica, remains mechanically mixed; and, indeed, when we
consider the before-mentioned parts of graphite        extractable                           (b)

rangement in nodal aggregations begins to be developed in
tilted but softened best cast steel and in white cast iron; but in
their most perfectly equal division throughout the whole mass
of the iron, without any certain relative position of their sur
faces, they appear in tilted but hardened cast steel of the high

large masses fibrous arrangements, are the different species of
malleable iron, the fairest specimens.
    Some time since graphite was considered mechanically
mixed with the mass of steel; and in consequence of this
theory, it was asserted by many writers on the subject, that
the graphite scales might be seen in the fractures of steel and
intimately intermixed with                    it,

rth degree, (r being supposed less than m and n ", and the co
efficients being rational functions of the coefficients of the
equations of coexistence.)
    There will be an indefinite number in general of such de
 rivatives, and the form involving arbitrary quantities which
 includes them all is called “the general derivative of the                                                          rth

integral, numerically                    as   well          as   literally speaking,  called         is
“Integral derivative.”
  That “Integral Derivative”                               which of    any given degree                   in

                     is                    the prime derivative              in

436     Sir D. Brewster's Observations                         on    Prof. Plateau's
truth will not be compromised by a further analysis of those
phaenomena of our visual sensations respecting which these
differences of opinion have arisen.
   Although I have devoted much time to the study of the
phaenomena of accidental colours, yet my observations have
 been made at distant intervals, and recorded from time to
 time without any design of establishing a particular theory.
  At one time I believed in the theory of the diminution of
  sensibility, till a series of specific observations led me to a
                                   I
 new theory, which, as shall afterwards show, differs very little,
  if it differ at all, from that of M. Plateau in                          its
                                                             leading aspect.
      To this    general  theory    M. Plateau has added two distinct
 propositions respecting the combination                             of
                                                          accidental colours,
 and their law         of
                        succession; and                             on
                                                         these points that
                                                          it   is                                           I
 have the misfortune              of
                                differing with him         opinion.      in
      On the first     of
                       these points M. Plateau maintains, that while
“    the combination              of
                              real colours produces white, the com
 bination     of  accidental colours produces the contrary              white,                to
or    black.” That          is,
                           “whereas two real complementary colours
 produce together white, two accidental complementary colours
 produce together black *.”
      With respect        this proposition,
                         to                      have stated
                                                          I         the Edin             in
 burgh Review, that we cannot, with any propriety                         lan                    of
 guage, consider one accidental colour               added      as   combined      to,   or
 with another; that the proposition itself                   verbal illusion;
                                                                     is   a
 and that the physical fact which                expresses has been long
                                                          it
 known       to philosophers,     and      indeed the necessary result
                                                     is                                                     of

 our    previous   knowledge           the subject.
     After endeavouring            controvert this opinion, M. Plateau
 does not conclude that                in is
                                     erroneous;                     he
                                                       concludes only, and
 he    puts his conclusion                      on
                                     italics, that        has not merely er

pressed what has been long known.               The ground upon which
 he rests this conclusion             thatis, did not seem
                                                      I             be aware         to
 that his    proposition   included the new      fact,   that accidental co

  following manner: “The retina returns to                     primitive state      its

 that even the oscillations, when they do occur, are generall

                           or
    Now, Prof. Plateau admits, that the most frequent result,
 namely, the disappearance and reappearance                 the accidental    of
 colour, was observed                 by
                                 many authors, and particularly                                     by
 Scherffer and Darwin. This              perfectly true, and indeed
                                                      is                                       I
 cannot conceive how       any  person   could have studied the sub
ject experimentally without observing                With regard  it.   the                   to
 rarer phaenomenon which Prof. Plateau and                        Quetelet
 have each seen, and which represents the theory,                have fre           I
quently observed the one colour succeed the other, but never
 the whole phaenomenon; and since have read Prof. Plateau's I
 writings,  I have endeavoured          vain       in
                                                 see             to       it.
    Here then we have two classes            facts; one     of which, viz.         of
the rarer class, leads       one theory, and the other, viz. the more
common class, leads              to to
                               another theory; and Prof. Plateau
adopts the theory least supported                           by
                                             facts, solely, we presume,
because      appears more beautiful, and more consistent with
            it

    Regarding the subject         not ripe for generalization,
                                           as                          have              I
ventured       explain the phaenomena
                to                                           of
                                               the disappearances and
reappearances             of
                       the accidental colour, and the occasional
succession           of
                   the negative and positive impressions,               the               by
operation        of
                certain disturbing causes, which must undoubtedly
exercise        an

                                      such phaenomena.          Prof. Pla
teau answers these arguments             stating, that by     such causes      if
had presented themselves, “he must have been                     very un            a
skilful observer not            to
                            have noticed their      influence,   nor have
secured himself against them.”            But observers not very un

believe that the results                 of
                                 all such experiments are affected
even       by

    Before concluding these observations,             must beg leave

            a                  no
                            doubt accidentally made             Prof. Pla          by

                                          accidental colours with his
own.       “In    certain point
                     a               view,    of
                                               may        seen, Sir David
                                                             as           be

440       Sir D. Brewster      on the Theory          of Accidental                  Colours.
in the first place, they have that in common, that they con
sider the accidental colour as owing to an impression of a
peculiar nature which is spontaneously generated in the or
gans, and not as the result of a relative insensibility to certain
rays.   On the other hand, according to Sir David Brewster,
the accidental colour unfolds itself on the retina during the
contemplation of the direct colour, and combines itself with
this latter; and according to me, the opposite effort of the re
tina, whence results the negative sensation, as soon as that
effort ceases to be counteracted, likewise unfolds itself during
the contemplation of the direct colour, and combines itself, in
some respect, with this latter, neutralizing it partially.              But
only Sir David Brewster maintains that the combination of the
two sensations produces whiteness, whereas I have shown that
upon an object insulated from every lateral influence the
result is on the contrary blackness”.”
   Now it is not the case, that I maintain “that the combina
tion of the two sensations produces whiteness.” My words
are: “ The effect of this vision of the green (the accidental
colour seen when looking at a red seal,) is to make the RED
appear much paler by           its
                               admirture with          The red and green

dominates over the accidental green, the result               always pale      is
red.”     Now        as
                     the   original  seal was       bright  red, and                             as

example, that the liveliest     joy is often followed by a sentiment

Have we not here oscillations decreasing from pleasure to pain,
from pain to pleasure; and from pleasure to the normal state
of the mind?” Our ingenious author employs the same prin
ciple to explain the effects of moral contrast; but we shall
pursue the subject no further, lest we should be accused of
prejudicing our readers against our author's optics, by dwelling
upon the singularities of his metaphysics.              We must warn
our   young     readers, however,   against  being   led away from the
path of sober inquiry by the pursuit of such ingenious ana
logies.      It may be amusing to fanciful minds, for it certainly
is  poetical,   to regard pleasure and pain, joys and sorrows, as the
lights and shadows of our being,<-as the positive and negative
tints which colour in succession the livid perspective of life;
but the principle, if once encouraged, would soon be pushed
to a more hazardous extent, and the ever-varying phases of
our moral nature would soon be represented by the abscisses
and ordinates of a mathematical curve.

 LXV.       Observations of Shooting Stars on the nights of the 10th

        GENTLEMEN,
 A REQUEST              having been made that any notice relative
          to the August periodical shooting stars should be com
 municated to the Philosophical Magazine, I have transmitted
 the following observations made by me on the 10th and 11th
 of August inst. Brief and imperfect though these observa
 tions may be, yet perhaps, as facts bearing upon a hitherto
 little explored subject, they may not be wholly devoid of              in
 terest.
     I  must be permitted to premise, that my observations were
 confined to a limited portion of the heavens, the aspect of my
 apartment being N.N.W. and that I was without an assistant.
  On the night of the 10th I was prevented from commencing
 any observations until twenty minutes past eleven, and at
 thirty minutes past twelve the sky became overcast, and
 the observations were discontinued.             During this time (with,

  of the latter left luminous trains, usually visible for some se
  conds, and in most instances characterized by sparks.            The
  wind was at the time blowing very fresh from the south-west,
  and the direction of the shooting stars was uniformly quite

 the opposite quarter         the sky.   Oneof    the more brilliant          of
 shooting stars was apparently lost behind            cloud.      faint            a                  A

geological debate.      shall confine I my  present   letter      two                                 to

             Neighbourhood                of Killarney and Dublin.                             443
districts, the immediate neighbourhood of Killarney, and the
environs of Dublin, both of them attractive and easily access
ible to English visitors.
   Any geologist, in glancing over the southern portion of Mr.
Griffith's map, would be struck by some novelties and many
apparent incongruities in the arrangement of the strata. The
greatest portion of the S.W. district is described as belonging
to those older rocks which have been noticed by Mr. Weaver
and others as underlying unconformably the old red sand
stone of the Gaulty Mountains, &c.
   In direct junction with these slaty rocks we see the coal
field at Calurbarna, the mountain limestone at Killarney, and
the old red sandstone generally.
   Under the title of old red sandstone we have included the
coarse and uniform conglomerate of the Gaulty Mountains
and the roofing slates of the Vale of Middleton; but while
these are so thrown together, we perceive a regular and uni
form band intervening between the old red sandstone and the
mountain limestone, which Mr. Griffith has thought worthy of
being separated into a distinct formation, and has designated
the “yellow sandstone.” This yellow sandstone appears as if
invariably found immediately over the old red sandstone,
and is surmounted in                byall
                              places north                    of
                                                    line drawn froma
Dunmanway            to
                   Cove     the mountain     limestone,   but south                                of
this line we have another new formation, which takes the
place   of the limestone, and which           designates he  “carbo
niferous slate.” The scale         rocks    of the head  at  the map
                                                                                 of as
        us
leads   to   suppose either that these two formations alternate
with each other,          or
                      that there     some doubt
                                              is          which     theas   to                is
oldest; into that doubt        can  fully
                                    I     enter,  for the   only junc
tions   Ihave seen are very obscure.

                                       had shown him my reasons for
believing that the roofing slates there quarried were newer
than the old red sandstone, and in the map published this
year, he has adopted the correction.          The section implied in
the present map differs totally from that which I made in
 1836, from Tralee to Kenmare (Journal of the Dublin Geol.
 Soc. vol. i.        pt.
                  4.). He has represented the old red sandstone
 as merely      cap upon Magillicuddy's Reeks, (Pl.            2.) and        I.   f.

   Between these latter and the mountain limestone there occur
occasionally         a      few alternations             of

his “yellow sandstone” formation. Now must differ from                    I
him, and think that they really mark nothing but the gradual
transition from circumstances involving        purely arenaceous          a

             those    which the calcareous matter originated;

 Kenmare's cottage. As we cross the strike of the strata from
thence towards Mucruss, we find exactly the same purple
and greenish compact sandstones which occur in the neigh
bourhood of Cork, Middleton, &c. These, as we ascend in
the series, pass into purple slates, and at the Old Weir Bridge
the mountain limestone is supported by about 50 feet thick of
alternating shales and sandstones, containing the fossils of the
limestone, and identical with those of Goat Island, &c.       we                              If
follow the limestone to the southern extremity of Turc Lake,
we find it again lying conformably upon the same series that
I  have described as occurring at Glena.          followed these    I
along the course of the stream which runs into Turc Lake
from the summit of Mangerton; and although the want of a
good map and the extreme degree of contortion of the beds
prevented me from accurately comparing them,           could not                I
mistake the order of superposition, or doubt for a moment the
identity of the strata upon the summit of Mangerton.        The
very upper-beds of the old red sandstone rise from under
neath, but as we proceed to the south these are quickly again
covered by newer rocks (Devonian), which pass through                                              all
the before-described changes, until       the river Roughty the

intervention      of
                 any yellow sandstones.
I    am therefore      opinion that the mountains lying between
                            of
Caranthuel and      Kenmare,     and between Loch Gutane and
the river Roughty, belong                  to

     The             names alone are almost sufficient to show that the
origin of these numerals is Eastern, if not from the Arabic;
but it appears to me that sufficient attention has not been paid
to the variations of the forms of the figures in different manu
scripts. Now, in the tract de ratione abaci, we have invariably
two lists of forms, and these again vary in MSS. of different
ages.    Let us make a brief comparison of a few of them.

            the manuscripts   which  have referred, igin        to           I                                        is
the same, and agrees with the common middle-Arabic form.

lently improbable as to induce one to reject it on the grounds
of no immediate evidence *.
   Boetius immediately precedes the passage de ratione abaci
by definitions of numbers, digiti, articuli, and compositi,                             -a
division which, I may observe, could only have been subser
vient to the use of the Abacus, and the very same which
Alexander de Villa Dei and others, expressly using the Arabic
calculus, have employed in their works F. This is a strong
argument; and in MS. Trin. Coll. Cantab. R. xv. 16, we find
the Boetian digital forms identical with the middle-Arabic
with the exception of a very slight deviation in ornus, and
having arbas written on one side.
     I
     venture to exhibit the following conclusions, which  hope                    I
will not be considered too premature.
   1. That the Boetian contractions are wholly independent
of   the middle-Arabic in their introduction into Europe.
     2.That the Boetian contractions formed a distinct system
of decimal numeration, borrowed from the East, and intro
duced through the Latins into Eastern Europe.
    3. That the Boetian notation was anterior to the introduc
tion of the middle-Arabic numerals through Spain.
    Professor Davies, in a key to the new edition of Hutton's
 Course of Mathematics, now on the eve of publication, has
given some entirely new views relative to the period of change
between the abacal and concentrated modes of operation, and
it is on that account that I defer entering into that part of
the subject, because his arguments are so forcible, so con
clusive, and agree so well with an examination of early
manuscripts, that an abridgement would sensibly deteriorate
their value; moreover, as the work itself will ere long be so
accessible to every one, there can be no necessity.

 To    theEditors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
AT xiv.
   the conclusion of my last paper (L. & E. Phil. Mag. vol.
        p. 323.) I said that I expected to be able to show
that our formulae were adequate to explain the cause of the
absorption of light. This expectation was founded on the cir
cumstance that the quantity which we have denoted by k, has,
without any reason, been tacitly assumed to be entirely real;
while it is obvious that, if k be partly imaginary, the formulae
require to be transformed into others which will indicate an
absorption depending on k and r. The values of k depend
on the nature of the medium; and it is well known that every
medium absorbs more or less of the light which falls on                                                                 it.
Hence we infer that these values cannot      entirely real.                       be                                  In
deed,   they were so, the formulae which we have previously
        if
deduced would show that                          no
                              absorption could take place.
   To effect the required transformation        our formulae,                          of                              I
have had recourse       method
                                to
                                a  investigation  more general, of
and,   think, more easy, than any which we have previously
       I
used. This method       now proceed
                                I         develop; setting out               to

   Since we suppose a to be normal to the wave surface, and,
consequently, the general expressions for the displacements
n and & to be functions of w and t, we may conceive each of
these expressions to be developed in a series of the powers and
products of e” and e : where e is the number whose hyper
bolical logarithm is unity. Every term of the developments
will be     of the form              a   e” +**:                   where a,              y, x,    are constant           quan

Now, by (23.), e is connected with k; hence it follows that the
diminution of the intensity of the light, in traversing any me
dium, depends on the thickness of the medium and the length
of the wave.
   This inference agrees with what we learn by experiment;
therefore we may say that our formulae afford, so far, an ex
planation of the cause of the absorption of light.   The cause
subsists in the values of x given by the equation (13.).  In all
media for which these values are, severally, partly real and
partly imaginary, absorption must take place.
   It is my intention to pursue this subject further in another
paper.

LXIX.    Observations on Mr. Lyell’s Paper, entitled, “On the
  tubular Cavities filled with Gravel and Sand, called Sand
  pipes, in the Chalk near Norwich.”    By WILLIAM STARK,
   F.G.S.
  To   theEditors of the Philosophical             Magazine and Journal.
       DEAR SIRs,
      Magazine of the present month contains a paper
YoUR
  by Mr. Lyell on the “Sand-pipes in the chalk near
Norwich,” upon which I beg to offer a few remarks.
  In the first place allow me to observe that the description
which Mr. Lyell has given of the forms of the chalk pits and
sand-pipes in this neighbourhood is very accurate, and the
engravings by which it is illustrated are excellent representa
tions of the originals.     The hypothesis, however, that he ad
vances relative to the origin of their formation,                my  is,   in
opinion, far from being satisfactory.         The order    arrange  of
ment which        he
                   has adopted does not appear                to
                                                       me the most
suitable: nevertheless will take         as    stands.

    He says,  “  For the distance        several inches,    even    or          in
some places four        or
                        five feet from      junction with the sand

                                  is
friable when   dried, and       discoloured by containing
                                 is                           slight     a

    This does not correspond with the result             my experi
                                                               of
ments   upon   the same   chalk,  however remote from the sand
pipes.  I  did not find      it  quite pure”;

soluble   in acids”; for both with hydro-chloric and acetic acids
it left   a residuum     which proved to be silica and alumina.
I  notice this fact as being of importance to a theory                     am                 I
about to advance relative to the chalk formation.
    As to the origin of the sand-pipes, Mr. Lyell observes:
“We have now to consider in what manner these cylindrical
hollows have been first formed and then filled with gravel
and sand.       If  no pipes but those of the smallest size had oc
curred, we might have imagined that the top roots of large
trees had first pierced the chalk, and then after growing to
their full size and decaying had left a vacant space into which
loam and gravel fell. But when we reflect on the dimensions
of some of the pipes, we at once perceive that more powerful
causes must be appealed to.”
    “On consideration of the facts we can scarcely hesitate
                                           all
 to  admit the following conclusions:—That the chalk has
been removed         bythe corroding action                     of
                                                    water charged with
acid,      which the siliceous nodules being insoluble were left
          in
in   situ  inthe smaller pipes after the calcareous matrix had
 been dissolved.”
    It   appears     to me that              all
                                        this may         satisfactorily ac

 counted for without       presuming     that the “water was charged
 with acid.” The         appearance         every massof      chalk which  of

 tables, are deposited dark-coloured particles, principally com
 posed     of siliceous and argillaceous matter,                  they were    as   if
 precipitated from        an  upper stratum                 of

  the aggregate formed the immense calcareous masses we now
 Witness.
     Admitting this hypothesis, (and think the facts   I            the case         of
  warrant such an admission) there must have occurred                       the               in
  course   ofsolidification considerable fissures          these deposits;in

for every chemist knows, that during the process of drying
precipitates of this nature, there are always fissures produced
in the precipitated substance as the fluid evaporates or filters
away.     Such effects must have been a necessary consequence
in the chalk as it approximated to dryness, and hence the
primary cause of the cavities we are investigating.        The dif
ference of size in the cavities          conceive,              is,
                                                       consequenceI                      a
that would inevitably result, not only from some parts                                                     of

various circumstances which would cause partial drying          the                                    of
chalk; and above                    all
                            the failure   support
                                          to        from the under    of
strata, from subterraneous springs, &c.        Indeed there seems
reason      believe that the largest sand-pipes have been formed
             to
to by
    the complete division          mass            of
                                            chalk from the bottom

   the  top   arising from the above-named causes.
   Mr. Lyell further observes that “Large unrounded no
dules    of
          flints, found     the sand-pipes, still preserve the ori
                                          in
ginal form and white coating.”          And      the smaller pipes          in
“horizontal layers                    of
                           siliceous nodules still remain      situ,                                 in
not having been removed, together with the chalk             which                                in
they must have been originally imbedded.”
  If  these cavities were formed            the action       “water   by                        of

                         action must have been       great       upon                 as             as

hundreds of feet.     For as the age of the chalk is undoubtedly
great, indeed beyond that of the superimposed strata, there
must have been a continued wearing away of the sides of the
cavities by the action of water, and a consequent transit of
the upper to the lower parts of the hollow, ages before the
clay, sand, and gravel were produced.
   The most remarkable part of Mr. Lyell’s paper is the fol
lowing: he says,             “It
                          only remains for us to inquire how
waters   charged  with acid may most naturally be conceived to
have  produced   such hollows.                      If
                                     some of the largest pipes of
which the bottom has not yet been reached be prolonged in
definitely downwards and connected with deep fissures, we
may suppose that springs charged with carbonic acid rose up
at some former period through the chalk and crag while they
were still submerged, as we know that in many parts of the
bed of the sea such springs do break forth.        In proportion
as the chalk was corroded, the incumbent substances would
subside into the hollow thus formed and the water would freely
percolate the matter thus intruding itself, dissolving any cal
careous ingredients which may be associated with          and still               it,
continue widening the tube        corroding    by
                                                walls.”               its
   Had this been the case, we may presume that the form                                       of
the sand-pipes would have been exactly the reverse           what                       of
they now are; they would have assumed the form          cones, but               of
not inverted cones; for the action                        of
                                         such waters must have

462             Mr. Snow Harris           on    Lightning Conductors
powerful lateral explosions, not only on near bodies, but on
bodies at very great distances.      This effect, he thinks,
in the case of a   lightning  rod, is a very fearful circum
Stan Ce.
   2.   If
         this deduction be worth anything, it is altogether sub
versive of the use of such rods as a means of protection from
lightning. I have thought it right, therefore, to examine
carefully the experiments and reasonings, which have led the
author to this conclusion; and since the inquiry bears mate
rially on a question of great public interest, and contains
many new phaenomena of electrical action,       hope it may              I
not be considered unworthy a place in your very valuable
Journal.          -
   3. Although Mr. Sturgeon has spoken in a slighting way
of me and my experiments, and has laboured hard to invali
date them, I still feel, that any personal consideration is
comparatively of minor consequence.           will not therefore I
trouble your readers on the subject.                        I
                                            merely wish to have
it understood, that this is not a reply to that large part of the
memoir levelled at myself, but is simply an investigation of
the author’s “Theoretical and Experimental Researches,” and
of his claims to our confidence as a writer on Electrical Sci
ence.
  4. So long since as the years 1728 and 1729, Mr. Grey ob
served the phaenomena of electrical conduction and insulation.
   (a). Thus a metallic ball, J, fig. 1, (Plate II.) supported on
the glass rod g, is said to be insulated, and if electrified, will
cause a spark in the opening between the metallic body B
and the ball J.
   (b).    If
           we connect the ball                 J
                                    with any distant body c, by
means of a metallic wire as in   fig. 2, and electrify it as before,
the spark will still occur in the opening at the distant body
c, the electricity being conducted by the intermediate wire.
   (c). The distance at which this effect may ensue, is very
considerable.     Mr. Grey succeeded in making it sensible at
a distance of 765 feet”.
   (d). The effect is most sensible when the body B is con
nected with the ground, which places              law      it,   by
                                                           electricala       of
action,    the most favourable state for receiving the spark.

   5. I  am desirous     call especial attention
                              to                      these results,  to
notwithstanding their elementary character, because,               we             as
shall presently see, they are really nothing more          less than         or
                                                                                       of he

    6. When we attempt to charge an electrical jar,     fig. 3,                                        J,
it is observable, that as the charge accumulates on the inner
surface, a corresponding quantity of electricity is forced off
from the outer, and without this double effect takes place we
fail to accumulate a charge.
    (e).   To
           render this evident, we have only to place the jar
on an insulator, as in fig. 3; we shall then find, that for every
spark we send into the jar, a similar spark will leave       out                                            its
side, either from the coating directly,        from any distant                 or
body connected with
         c                      fig.           it   as   in         4.

                               therefore, and distant body               may                          c,           be

body B with the ground, and diminished to a certain extent

have produced the spark, he says, between cc, and the

  “By this kind of lateral discharge,” he observes, “a dense
spark may be produced when the bodies B and c c, fig. 3, are

ample a small jar of a quart capacity were charging from a
very powerful machine, and the discharge produced at the
time of charging, either by a spontaneous explosion between
the balls, m c, fig. 3, or by an insulated discharger, then, as
is evident, not only would the outer coating and                     append                 its

Sturgeon's experiments.
   Exp. (k)(1)—show, that the electricity of the spark varies
with that of the coatings.
   Exp. (m)—proves that the spark is readily obtained after
the discharge has taken place; it is not therefore any lateral
explosion caused by the discharging rod.  .
  Exp. (o)—proves that the spark is merely                               a   residuary       ac
cumulation.
  Exp. (p) (q)—prove that the spark is of different                                    degrees
of force, when the electricity is discharged from a greater or
less extent of surface, whilst double, treble, &c., quantities,
 when discharged from double, treble, &c., surfaces, give the
 same spark.     Now as no one can doubt but that the effect of
 a double, &c. quantity should be greater than a single, &c.
 quantity, it is again evident that the spark is not caused by
 any lateral explosion from the discharging rod; it being a
 well-established law, that the same quantity has the same
 heating effect on wires, whether discharged from a great
 surface or a small one, from thick glass or thin; some little
 allowance being made for the greater number of rods, &c.,
 when the surface is increased by an additional number of
jars ”. The effect therefore depending on the jar, Mr. Stur
 geon had a greater chance with a small jar than with a large
 one.
    Exp. (r)—proves that the degree of tension in the rod is
 not of any consequence.
   Exp.      (t)—show, that
                (s)             kind       no            of
                                           lateral action arises
during the passage        of
                      the charge.

Earl       of

from     Lord Mahon; he obtains still less from Priestley, who,
without any compromise,       sweeps away his whole theory.
Lord   Stanhope  and Dr.   Priestley, eminent amongst the phi
losophers of their day, will be doubtless admitted to be as
good authority as Mr. Sturgeon.

          In                    tells            he
                                           (see 191.) “that      uspos                                  it   is

   18.     the next place,
            In                                       he
                                 says, (202.) that the “lateral dis
charge will always take place when the vicinal bodies are ca
pacious, and near the principal conductor               any         me                   or           of     its
tallic appendages.” This was the case,                says, when only               he
his small jar was used, and with this small jar     could pro                                    he
duce lateral discharges    distance   fifty “feet from the di

 rect discharge.”
    19. Thirdly,       tells   he(203.) that “the magnitude and
                                                     us

 anything which can          produced artificially, the lateral dis
 charges must                 be
                     proportionally greater,” that             say                               is   to            in
Jinitely great.
    20. Taking these data            true then,      follows that any
                                                          as                     it

 of the shrouds,” and to be united by “broad straps of cop
 per to the sheathing,” that is to say, by conductors with
 edges, which he says throw off the charge into neighbouring
 bodies; this too after having told us, that the most spacious
 conductor may become red-hot, and that lateral discharges
always take place when the vicinal bodies are capacious, and
near the principal conductor or any of     metallic appendages.          its
Under such circumstances what           become       the rigging,

    22. Either his “theoretical and experimental researches”
are true, and his system                  of
                                 conductors fatal and absurd,                                                  or

He should          at

the spark determined, both in relation to the quantity and
surface over which it was distributed (p). The form and
dimensions of the discharging conductor should have been
varied (r). The final electrical state of his apparatus, as also
the electricity of the spark, should in common prudence have
been examined (k), together with other manipulations quite
inexcusable to neglect on such an occasion.              He has, how
ever, failed in everything calculated to give value to his                                             in
quiries, as I think has been fully shown. They are hence
not entitled to the smallest confidence, and it is not a little
extraordinary that he should have done so, whilst taking
credit to himself for superior sagacity, and an acquaintance
with facts of which he says                       I
                                    did “not seem to be aware,”
e.g. the most common-place facts in electricity.
   24. In conclusion, I have no hesitation in giving it as my
confirmed opinion, after a long and severe examination of
the laws of electrical action, and of cases of ships and buildings
struck by lightning;—that a lightning rod is purely passive,
that it operates simply in carrying off the lightning which
falls on    it,
            without any lateral explosive action whatever.                                        I     do
not deny the general inductive effect mentioned                    Lord                      by

tion of the objects to which different learned bodies are devoted, and the absence
of societies specially instituted for the cultivation of some branches of science.
The cooperation of individuals is more practicable in some cases than in others,
and the publication of valuable papers on some technical subjects, not of general
interest, would be much curtailed if the expense were always left to fall upon the
authors.
   “It is more difficult to offer satisfactory reasons for the absence of method, and
for the disproportionate attention given to some subjects in many schemes of ele
mentary education.      In the great public schools of England the time of the stu
dent is still almost entirely confined to the study of the Greek and Latin writers;
and the difficulties which stand in the way of the introduction of other branches
of knowledge have yet to be surmounted.         Still, as in the days of Milton, “We
spend seven or eight years merely in scraping together so much Latin and Greek,
as might be learned otherwise easily and delightfully in one year; and that which
casts our proficiency therein so much behind, is our time lost, partly in too oft
idle vacancies given both to schools and universities; partly in forcing the empty
wits of children to compose themes, verses, and orations.’ It appears to me that
some general motions respecting the different branches of human knowledge, em
bracing at least their definitions, should form a chapter in                       all
                                                                    elementary educa
tion.”

 with the elevation which the moon would produce in the ocean if
 the earth and moon were both at rest. But the general motion of
 the waters of the ocean does not countenance this theory, or allow
 us to suppose that a fluid elevation resembling that of the equilibrium
 spheroid follows the moon from east to west; for the Pacific, the
 largest ocean, has no tide in its central parts; and at                eastern              its
 shore, near Cape Horn, the tide wave runs from west                   east, al         to
 though there       nothing
                      is         prevent its following
                                     to                                     its

    The new    theory  which was offered was this:—The tide                 each                   of
 large ocean may           be            nearly independent                                                 of
                                                   of as
                        considered                                 the tides           of
 other waters. The central area           each ocean      occupied by lunar
                                                                       is                          a
wave, which oscillates, keeping time with the moon's returns, and
 having    its
             motion kept             up
                                 by the moon's attraction acting            each                   at
 return. From the skirts           this oscillating central area, tides are
                                      of
 carried    on all sides by free waves, the velocity            which depends   of
upon the depth and local circumstances                the  sea;  of
                                                                  and thus the
litoral tides may travel        any direction, while the oceanic tides near
                                 in
the centre        the oscillating area may
                 of                                small        be
                                                               may vanish    or                             al
together.
    This theory was confirmed by reference          a                 to
                                                        tide observations on
the eastern and western sides            the Pacific, and by mathematical
                                               of
calculations tending            to
                             show that such          motion     amechanically     is
possible.       was remarked that single observations can
                 It                                                       small             be   of
use  in  deciding upon such         theory; and that
                                          a                  can     judgedit           be                  of
only when we have observations numerous enough
                                                                                                    of us
                                                                  enable          to                        to
draw the systems         cotidal lines which belong

Pacific. With this view              very desirable
                                     it   is                          to

   Memorandum on the Intensity of Reflected Light and Heat. By Prof.
Forbes”. “At the meeting of the Society on the 4th February, I re
marked, on the occasion of Professor Kelland's paper on the intensity
of reflected light, that it was almost without a parallel in science,
that a quantitative physical law like that of the intensity of the reflec
tion of light at different angles, should have first been divined by the
rare sagacity of Fresnel, and confirmed by the very different but
elaborate mathematical investigations which Mr. Green of Cam
bridge and Professor Kelland have applied to the subject, whilst
scarcely any attempt has been made towards               verification by di
                                                                        its
rect experiment.
   “Some critical cases for polarized light were indeed assumed

               or of
the basis
it   byone      two intermediate photometrical experiments; but the
chief evidence for the truth of this remarkable law rests on the                                       in
direct observation         the change
                             of            the plane

heat and light,         not identical for both, would

                                  of                           of   Edinburgh, March 18, 1839.

pears to me, from those observations, that the quantity of heat re
flected from different transparent bodies is independent, or nearly
so, of the nature of the source of heat, and the diathermancy of the
reflecting body, and that at 55° of incidence the intensity of reflected
heat is nearly that which Fresnel's theory gives. The substances,
however, were not all prepared so as wholly to exclude the action
of second surfaces.
     “I have this winter resumed the subject.              I have had an appa
ratus constructed for securing sufficient accuracy in determining the
angle of incidence, and I have used reflecting surfaces, both trans
parent and metallic: the former are wedges of plate-glass, by means
of which reflection from the first surface only may be observed, and
the latter are plane specula of steel and silver.              The prosecution,
however, of these apparently simple experiments has been attended
with unforeseen difficulties; and although the relative proportions
of heat at different angles of incidence are now pretty well deter
mined for glass in several cases, I am not prepared to say whether
the absolute amount is exactly the same as Fresnel's formula would
give, assigning to heat                      its
                                    proper refractive index.              satisfac            It   is

                          to                                       much greater    to   it   is
than direct photometrical measures have yet given, with the single
exception       two experiments
                 of                       M. Arago already referred to; and
                                                    of
that I   have reason           believe that the experimental law which
                                     to
Mr. Potter has       given  from direct observation            the case      light,in                   of

Fresnel.

I  have not obtained decisive results. The quantity                 heat reflected           of

                                   to
small, which would nearly account for their deviation from Fresnel's
law.

M      •
          VOGEL     employed the method adopted by Berzelius for the
           preparation of this substance, which consists in isolating
from milk by dilute acids.
    As the great quantity of fatty substances contained in milk occa
 sions many difficulties in the washing and purification of caseum,
 M. Vogel made use of buttermilk, which is more completely de
prived of the greater part of the butter than mere skimmed milk.
    The buttermilk was treated with dilute sulphuric acid; with this
 the caseum combined, and was afterwards precipitated from it in the
 state of a white magma: the serum was separated by straining; the
 compound of sulphuric acid and caseum was agitated and digested
 with distilled water, and then washed on a filter. This manipula
 tion was repeated, until the washings evaporated on platina foil left
 no residue.
    After the washing, the compound was diffused in distilled water,
 agitated, and digested with carbonate of barytes, in order to combine
 the barytes with the sulphuric acid, and dissolve the caseum in
 water. The liquor was filtered, and the aqueous solution evaporated
 to dryness in a water-bath.      The residue of the evaporation was a
                                                                                                    of its

 nitric acid drop      by
                      drop; the ashes amounted        the enormous quan

have been cited, lead to the important conclusion already drawn by
M. Mulder respecting albumen and fibrin, namely, that albumen,
fibrin, and caseum have in the animal kingdom, the same intimate
relation that sugar, starch, and gum have in the vegetable kingdom;
this observation if followed out, promises to give the most interest

44,489 or 10 x 4.489. This result agrees well with the experiments,
when it is considered that in this compound 23 volumes are con
densed into 10.       Each atom of the compound corresponds to 10
volumes of vapour.
    M. Walter has proposed to consider the chromate of chloride of
chromium as a chromic acid, in which an atom of oxygen is replaced
by an equivalent of chlorine. If this view be applied to the sulphate
of chloride of sulphur, it would also be a sulphuric acid, in which
half an atom of oxygen is replaced by half a double atom of chlo
rine.    In this case the compound would contain } a volume of sul
phur, 1 volume of chlorine, and 2% volumes of oxygen, and the
calculated density of             its

    M. Capitaine considers it as composed of two equivalents of each
of its elements; reckoning, however, chlorine, mercury, and arsenic
respectively as 36, 202 and 38, it will appear to be a compound of
                      1 eq. of Chlorine    36
                      l eq. of Mercury 202
                      2 eqs, of Arsenic 76
This substance is very readily acted upon by light, especially when
powdered; when exposed to the action of the solar rays it becomes
in a few seconds of a greenish colour, and passing gradually through
deeper tints, it becomes eventually quite black.        Neither the air
nor the water which the crystals contain has any effect in producing
these phaenomena; for when exposed to light in a dry vacuum,
it becomes brown as rapidly as in the air. The effects in both cases
are produced more readily by the direct rays of the sun, than in a
diffused light.
    The crystals of a hyacinthine red colour are not so constant in
their composition as the foregoing, and the results of analysis were not
so satisfactory.      The quantity of chlorine varied from 12 to 14 per
cent., and that of the mercury varied from 68, 70, 71, 73, and even
 75 per cent., the remainder being arsenic.
    The compound was probably composed of
                      1  eq. of Chlorine 36
                       1 eq. of Mercury 202
                       1 eq. of Arsenic    38    276
    If this be the case, the first compound, called by  M. Capitaine ar
 seniuretted chloride of mercury, is bi-arseniuretted chloride, and this
 which he terms sub-arseniuretted, is in fact the arseniuretted. These
 compounds resemble each other in the decomposition which they
 both undergo by the action of water and of heat. When treated
 with water, especially at a boiling heat, they are completely de
 composed into mercury, arsenic, arsenious and hydrochloric acids.
 When acted upon by heat, a portion is volatilized without under
 going any alteration; while another portion is decomposed yielding
 mercury, arsenic, and chloride of arsenic.—Journal de Pharmacie,
 September, 1839.
                           ANALYSIS OF ALBUMEN.
     In order to verify the late analysis of albumen by M. Mulder,
 M. Vogel employed the white of hens' eggs coagulated by heat,
 because in this state the foreign salts which it contains are more
 readily removed by washing with water than when in the liquid
 state.
     The white of egg hardened by ebullition was carefully separated
 from the exterior pellicle and from every adhering portion of yelk; it
  was then cut into pieces and washed for several days with distilled
  water, till it ceased to dissolve anything. It was then dried between
  folds of blotting-paper at the ordinary temperature of the room; after
  some days it became hard, brittle, of a pale yellow, translucent and

 almost transparent, and had in fact the appearance of gum arabic;
 it was gritty between the teeth, and softened but slowly in water; it
 had lost 90 per cent. of its weight in drying. It was then reduced
 to fine powder and again dried at the temperature of 212°; this
 drying was repeated previously to every analysis, in order to get rid
 of the hygrometric moisture.
    The white of egg in this state was repeatedly digested in aether
 to remove the fatty matter.
    To determine the amount of inorganic matter, a portion of the dry
 substance was incinerated in a platina crucible; the residue amount
 ed to exactly 24 per cent. ; it consisted principally of phosphate of
 lime and a little sulphate of lime.      Berzelius found 1.8 per cent.,
 and Mulder 4'12 per cent.,      the proportion does not appear therefore
 to be always equal.
    M. Vogel recommends those who would repeat these experiments,
 not to incinerate in a platina crucible, on account of the action which
 the phosphorus separated from the acid may have on the metal.          He
 recommends a porcelain crucible, and the use of a little nitric acid
 or nitrate of ammonia to expedite the process.             -
    The white of egg, prepared as has been described, was analysed
 by oxide of copper and chromate of lead, while a third analysis was
                                                       ***
 performed on a portion which had been dissolved in potash and pre
 cipitated by sulphuric acid. The results were

    These results, excepting the azote, agree very nearly with those
 obtained by M. Mulder, viz.
                             Carbon      52'43

    M.  Vogel  obtained,  as M. Mulder had    done, a greenish blue salt of
copper, by treating a solution of white of egg in distilled water with
one of sulphate of copper; and he considers it also as an albumenate
of copper; and he ascertained by analysis that the albumen under
goes no alteration in this combination.—Journal de Pharmacie, Sep
tember, 1839.
                         ANALYSIS OF FIBRIN.
   M. Vogel obtained fibrin from ox blood. The blood was stirred;
the small filaments of fibrin were washed with water till it came
away colourless; when thus purified the fibrin has a bluish white
colour like skimmed milk. It was dried first at the temperature of

the air, between folds of blotting-paper, then at 212°, reduced to fine
powder, repeatedly treated with aether, and then again dried.
   By being burnt in a porcelain crucible, with the addition of nitric
acid, it left 2.66 per cent. of ashes; these consisted of phosphate and
sulphate of lime, with a rather considerable proportion of oxide of
iron.
   Analysed by means of chromate of lead, it yielded

    The opinion which                  I
                              am obliged to entertain of an individual ca
 pable of this groundless assertion, would cause me to consider him
 unworthy of notice, had not his misstatement been made before an
 assemblage which I most highly esteem, and had he not been ho
 noured by a premium for his pretended invention by a respectable
 British Society.
    The blowpipe which is thus falsely alleged to have been used by
 me, differs immaterially from one of which I published an engraving
 and description in the American Journal of Science for 1820, vol.                                                               ii.

   The basic purpurate of silver is obtained by adding ammonia to
nitrate of silver until the precipitate is redissolved, and with this solu
tion purpurate of ammonia is to be precipitated.        The author could
not effect the analysis of this salt, for having exposed it to a tem
perature of 392” Fahr. in an oil-bath, the whole mass was decom
posed.
                         PURPU tº ATE OF POTASH.
   This salt was obtained by Prout, who recommends it to be pre
pared by decomposing a boiling solution of purpurate of ammonia
by means of a solution of bicarbonate of potash; but as it is in
this method impossible to avoid a disengagement of ammonia, which
when heated acts upon the purpurate, it is better to employ nitrate
of potash. The purpurate of potash is difficultly soluble in water,
but not insoluble ; it is much less soluble in saline solutions: on
this account it is proper to employ great excess of nitre in prepar
ing   it. This purpurate       pulverulent, and consists
                                           is                   very small                      of

made, that a large quantity of purpurate of ammonia may be formed
by the action of ammonia on pure alloxane; when a concentrated
and boiling solution of alloxane is gradually added to a solution of
carbonate of ammonia, carbonic acid is disengaged with strong
effervescence; the solution on each addition assumes a deeper purple
tint, and at last it becomes turbid and precipitates a great quantity
of reddish powder, which consists of pure anhydrous purpurate of
ammonia.      Instead of using pure alloxane, concentrated but not
fuming nitrate of uric acid may be employed, taking care to adopt
the precautions given by Liebig and Wöhler for the preparation of
alloxane.   Purpurate of ammonia is not the only product of the
operation, but as the composition of the others produced is not
known, it would be difficult to give a plausible explanation of the
formation of this salt. The analysis of purpurate of ammonia dried
at 212°Fahr. yielded M. Fritzche results which differed from those
obtained by MM. Liebig and Wöhler.         These successive experi

The crystals of purpurate of ammonia contain water of crystalliza
tion, amounting according to Liebig and Wöhler to 3 or 4 per cent.,
whereas M. Fritzche found as the mean of eight experiments on
very pure crystals 6:06 per cent.
                     PURPURATE OF BARYTES.
   This salt is obtained by mixing a solution of barytes with a mo
derately concentrated solution of purpurate of ammonia; the liquor
becomes turbid, and a blackish green powder is deposited, which
by friction becomes of deep purplish red.      M. Kodweis has given

       ACTION OF ANTIMONY                    ON     BICHLORIDE OF MERCURY.
   M. Capitaine has examined the action of these substances on each
other.    When one part of commercial antimony and three parts of
bichloride of mercury are heated together in a retort with its pro
per appendages, the first portions of chloride of antimony which
distil are of a reddish brown colour; and the adopter is lined with the
same substance which discolours the first products; soon afterwards
the chloride of antimony distils colourless and perfectly pure. When
the operation is finished, there is found in the retort on the revived
mercury, a blackish substance; if this be heated, it yields mercury,
a little butter of antimony, and towards the end it yields reddish
yellow vapours, which condense into a solid of the same colour, and
which it is impossible not to recognise as arseniuretted chloride of
mercury.      It has the appearance and all the chemical characters of
this  compound    : when treated with boiling water, it yields a liquor
containing hydrochloric and arsenious acid, and leaves a black residue,
which put on a red-hot coal is volatilized, emitting an alliaceous smell.
    If the chloride of antimony obtained be kept in fusion for some
time,   allthe brown matter which discolours              deposited and readily

                     BLOOD CORPUSCLES                    IN THE MAMMALIA.
   We hope soon to publish an account of Mr. Gulliver's observa
tions (in which he has    been long engaged) on the blood disks of the
mammalia.       In the meantime we may mention that in five Austra
lasian animals the corpuscles have the form and size most common
in mammals, their diameters varying from Tºoth to stºoth of an
inch. These Australasian animals are the Perameles lagotis, Petau
rus Sciurus, Macropus Bennettii, Dasyurus Ursinus, and D. Viverrinus.
   In reference to the interesting discovery by M. Mandl of the oval
blood corpuscles of the Dromedary, Mr. Gulliver has found the blood
disks of the Auchenia Vicugna, A. Paco, and A. Glama, also very                                      di
stinctly elliptical.   In the Vicugna they are rather smaller than in
the other species.
   In the Musk Deer (Tragalus Javanicus) Mr. Gulliver observes
that the blood disks are smaller than those, hitherto described, of
any other mammal whatever. In the Tragalus, the disks, though very
distinct in form, measure on an average Tahonth of an inch only;
but many variations in size are to be seen, from Tsºng th to gºrgth
of an inch in diameter.

      GENT LEMEN,
A YEAR            having now elapsed since you conferred upon me the
      highly honourable office of your President, it becomes my duty,
in accordance with the example of my predecessors, to address you.
The first and most agreeable part of my task is to express my feelings of
gratitude to those Gentlemen whom you were pleased to select as my
Council. I am most highly indebted to them for the zealous co-ope
ration and hearty assistance which I have ever received at their
hands. It is to them that I have looked to aid my inexperience, and
                                             I
to supply my manifold deficiencies, and have not been disappointed.
To those who are the more permanent officers of the Society, the
Treasurer and the Secretaries, my obligations are particularly great,
and I will venture to add, that to them, as well as to the other mem
bers   of the Council, your thanks are due       as well as mine.

 ject of the Expedition will be accomplished by additional light
  thrown on the obscure problems which still attend the magnetism
 of the earth, and that by such discoveries Captain James Clark
  Ross may not only add to his own reputation and his country's
 glory, but also give to the adventurous mariner increased facility
 and security in traversing the pathways of the ocean.
    The Antarctic Expedition was not the only measure recommended
 by the Royal Society and the British Association to Her Majesty's
 Government.     Another important recommendation, which had pre
 viously been brought forward by Baron Humboldt, was the establish
 ment of fixed magnetic observatories for the purpose of making si
 multaneous observations in different parts of our colonial possessions.
 These recommendations have been readily acceded                         both      the                 to,          by

chief officers of the society are officially members of each of the
scientific committees.
   The Council have derived a further assistance from these Com
mittees in the adjudication of our medals. In naming these Com
mittees, the Council has had both a difficult and a delicate task.
Convinced that bodies, when too numerous, are little adapted for
business, they have also felt that the power of giving their attend
ance might be more important than absolute superiority of scien
tific attainments. Some members have, however, been selected,
though really non-resident, because it was believed that their col
leagues might wish to consult them by letter. With these objects
and views, the Council have done their best; but they have little
doubt that some gentlemen have been overlooked and omitted,
whose presence in the Committees might have been very desirable.
The Society must consider this as in some degree a new system, to
be perfected and improved by experience alone.
    Another question has occupied a share of the time of the Coun
cil  during the last year. We have felt that the testimonial              re                          of
commendation for new Fellows has scarcely been sufficiently defi
nite and precise         stating the grounds
                               in                    which the candidate   on
was recommended          the body
                                to      the Society.  of
                                                       We have therefore
thought      desirable
            it              draw    toforms          up              of

  bestowing a medal on one who is an honour to the Royal Society
  and pre-eminently distinguished for his mathematical attainments.

 to require any eulogium from me, and                          I
                                               consider that in this tribute
  to your paper on astronomical refraction, we are rather doing an
  honour to ourselves than to you".
    Mr. Brown—in conferring the Copley Medal on you for your
 valuable discoveries in vegetable impregnation to I am quite sure
 that the voice of scientific Europe will respond to the decision of
 the Council of the Royal Society.           The Académie des Sciences
 has  already   pronounced    on  your   merits,   as also on those of Mr.
 Ivory, by electing you as well as that gentleman to a seat among
 their foreign members; and the University of Oxford has also, by
 an honorary degree, given you a similar testimonial.           That you are
 one of our fellows is to    myself  a circumstance    peculiarly  agreeable,
 as it must be to the whole body over whom I have the honour to
 preside. Your discoveries in the particular botanical question, for
 which I have to give you the Copley Medal, are so important, not
 only in a botanical, but also in a general scientific point of view, by
 showing the close analogies of animal and vegetable life, that the
 Committee of Zoology have felt it as much their province as that of
 the Committee of Botany, to recommend that the Copley Medal
 should be bestowed upon you; and the Council have come to an
 unanimous resolution to give         though  it, the same time other gen

profession, which he followed, during a great part of his life, with
no inconsiderable reputation.   He became a medical student of
Caius College in 1787, and was elected to a fellowship in 1793 and
to the mastership in 1803, the late illustrious Dr. Wollaston being
one   of his             One of the first acts of his administration
                 competitors.
was to open his College to a more large and liberal competition, by
the abolition of some mischievous and unstatutable restrictions,
which had been sanctioned by long custom, and also by making acade
mical merit and honours the sole avenue to college preferment: and
he lived to witness the complete success of this wise and liberal
measure, in the rapid increase of the number of high academical
honours which were gained by members of his College, and by
the subsequent advancement of many of them to the highest pro
fessional rank and eminence.
   Some years after his accession to the mastership, he took holy
orders and commuted the degree of Doctor in Medicine for that of
Theology, and in later life he was collated to some considerable ec
clesiastical preferments.   Dr. Davy had no great acquaintance with
the details of accurate science, but he was remarkable for the extent
and variety of his attainments in classical and general literature;
his conversation was eminently lively and original, and not less agree
able from            its
                occasional tendency    somewhat paradoxical, though

illness, deeply lamented         large circle   by

ciety, and various other subjects of political and theological contro
versy.     In 1816 he was appointed Bishop of Llandaff; and three
years afterwards he was translated to the see of Peterborough. In
the course of a few years from this time, his health, which had been
already undermined by his sedentary habits and severe studies, be
gan rapidly to decline, and he was compelled to abstain from the
active duties of his professorship and from the exciting labours of
controversy; and though his infirmities continued to increase both
in number and severity, yet his life was prolonged to a mature old
age by the vigilant and anxious care and nursing of one of the most
exemplary and affectionate of wives.
   Dr. Marsh was a man of great learning and very uncommon vigour
of mind, and as a writer, remarkable for the great precision of his
language and his singular clearness in the state<U+017F>hent of his argument.
His lectures on Divinity are a most valuable contribution to the
theological student, and his “Comparative View of the Churches of
 England and Rome” presents one of the most masterly views of the
great principles which distinguish those churches, which has ever
appeared from the pen of a Protestant writer. His controversial
writings, though generally full of acuteness and ability, must be ex
pected to share the fate of all productions which are not kept from
perishing by the permanent existence of the interests, of whatever
nature, which gave rise to them: and we may justly lament that
learning and powers of reasoning of so extraordinary a character,
were not more exclusively and steadily devoted to the completion of
more durable and systematic theological labours.
   The father of the late Professor Rigaud had the care of the
 King's Observatory at Kew, an appointment which probably influ
enced the early tastes and predilections of his son. He was ad
mitted a member of Exeter College, Oxford, in 1791, at the early
age of sixteen, and continued to reside there as fellow and tutor
until 1810, when he was appointed Savilian Professor of Geometry.
He afterwards succeeded to the care of the Radcliffe Observatory,
and the noble suite of instruments by Bird, with which it is fur
nished, was augmented, on his recommendation, by a new transit
and circle, so as to
                             fit

bridge, where he rebuilt Corpus Christi and King's colleges, and
made extensive additions to Trinity College: he was likewise the
author of the magnificent portico of London University College,
the National Gallery, and of other important edifices in London.
He was latterly compelled by the declining state of his health and
by repeated attacks of the gout, to retire from his professional en
gagements, though he did not abandon those studies which had formed
his delight and occupation from his earliest years.              In 1837, he
published his “Prolusiones Architectonicae, or Essays on subjects
connected with Grecian and Roman Architecture,” which were
designed, in some degree, as a substitute for those lectures, which,
under other circumstances, he would have been called upon to
deliver, as Professor of Architecture, to the students of the Royal
Academy.         During the last year of his life, though constantly
confined to his bed, and extremely weakened and emaciated by dis
ease, he still continued his favourite pursuits until within a few
days of his death, which took place on the last day of August last.
    The Rev. Archibald Alison, senior Minister of St. Paul's Chapel,
 Edinburgh, was born in 1757, became a member of the University
of Glasgow in 1772, and of Baliol College, Oxford, in 1775, and
 took the degree of B.C.L. in 1784: he soon afterwards took holy
 orders in the English Church, and was presented to several eccle
 siastical preferments by Sir William Pulteney, Lord Chancellor
 Loughborough, and Bishop Douglas of Salisbury.              In 1784 he mar
 ried the daughter of the celebrated Dr. John Gregory of Edinburgh,
 with whom he lived in uninterrupted happiness for forty years of his
 life. His celebrated Essay “on the Nature and Principles of Taste"
 was first published in 1790, and speedily became incorporated into
 the standard literature of Great Britain. Towards the close of the
 last century, he became a permanent resident in his native city as
 minister of the Episcopal chapel, Cowgate, and afterwards of                                    St.
 Paul's, where     hewas connected          by

appointment of Master of the Crown Office.     He was an intimate
friend of Wollaston and Tennant; and though withdrawn by his
pursuits from the active cultivation    of science, he continued

 of the Cadastre, or great territorial and numerical survey of France,
 —a gigantic undertaking, the subsequent execution of which, during
 the revolutionary government, combined with the establishment of
 the bases of the decimal metrical system, gave employment and de
 velopement to so many and such important scientific labours and
 discoveries: among many other laborious duties, the formation of
 the extensive tables devolved upon M. de Prony, who, in the course
 of two years, organized and instructed a numerous body of calcula
 tors, and completed the immense Tables du Cadastre, which are
 still preserved in MSS. at the library of the Observatory in seven
 teen enormous folio volumes.
     M. de Prony became Directeur-Général des Ponts et Chaussées in
  1794, and was nominated the first Professor of Mechanics to the
  Ecole Polytechnique;—an appointment, which led to the publication
  of many very important memoirs on mechanical and hydraulical
  subjects, and on various problems of engineering, which appeared in
  the Journal of that celebrated school.           He declined the invitation
 of Napoleon to become a member of the Institute of Egypt, a re
 fusal which was never entirely forgotten or pardoned. In the beginning
 of the present century he was engaged in the execution of very exten
 sive works connected with the embankments towards the embouchure
 of the Po, and in the ports of Genoa, Ancona, Pola, Venice, and the
 Gulf of Spezzia; and in 1810, he was appointed, in conjunction with
 the celebrated Count Fossombroni of Florence, the head of the Com
 missione de l'Agro Romano, for the more effectual drainage and im
 provement of the Pontine Marshes.               The result of his labours in
 this  very   important    task, which he    prosecuted     with extraordinary
 zeal and success, was embodied in his Déscription Hydrographique
 et Historique des Marais Pontins, which appeared in 1822, which
 contains a very detailed description of the past, present and pro
 spective condition of these pestilential regions, and a very elaborate
 scientific discussion of the general principles which should guide us,
 in this and        all
                   similar cases,     effecting their permanent restoration

and character of his scientific attainments, or the great variety of
important practical and useful labours in which his life was spent.*
   Pierre Prevost was born in 1751, and was originally destined to
follow the profession of his father, who was one of the pastors of
Geneva: at the age of twenty, however, he abandoned the study of
theology for that of law, the steady pursuit of which, in time, gave
way to his ardent passion for literature and philosophy: at the age
of twenty-two, he became private tutor in a Dutch family, and after
wards accepted a similar situation in the family of M. Delessert,
first at Lyons, and afterwards at Paris. It was in this latter city
that he commenced the publication of his translation of Euripides,
beginning with the tragedy of Orestes;–a work which made him
advantageously known to some of the leading men in that great me
tropolis of literature, and led to his appointment, in 1780, to the
professorship         of philosophy in the college of Nobles, and also to a
place in the Academy of Berlin, on the invitation of Frederick
the Great. Being thus established in a position where the cultiva
tion of literature and philosophy became as much a professional
duty as the natural accomplishment of his own wishes and tastes,
he commenced a life of more than ordinary literary activity and
productiveness.     In the course of the four years which he passed at
Berlin, he published Observations sur                                les
                                                  méthodes employees pour

    This variation the author conceives, is partly due to the uneven
 mess in the surface of the chalk ; but in some instances to the un
 dulatory nature of the country, the difference in the depth of the
 wells agreeing with the increase in the rise of the ground. When
this is the case, the bed in which the water is found is the same in
the adjacent wells, and consequently the variation in the outline of
the surface is due to denudation, and not to unequal elevation.
Thus, in the two wells close to the turnpike at Romford, water was
found at the depth of 100 feet, but half-way up the hill between
Hare-street and Havering Ate Bower at the depth of 250 feet; at
Bocking it was obtained at 370, but at higher ground, at Braintree,
close adjoining, at 420. Again, at the union workhouse in Rochford,
the well is 330 feet deep, and at Stroud Green, on the road to Rug
leigh, where the surface is higher, it was necessary to sink 390 feet.
 At North Fambridge is a well 388 feet deep, the water rising to
within 10 feet of the top : but at another well in the same parish,
dug in lower ground, there is a constantly flowing stream.
   In the New River Company's well at the end of Tottenham Court
Road, chalk was found at the depth of 150 feet; but in that near
Pond-street, at Hampstead, the main spring in the bed of sand

between      the London clay and the chalk, was 330 feet from the
surface.
    The London clay in Essex varies greatly in colour, being in some
 places yellow or red in the lower part, but in many localities it is
blue to the bottom.        It is sometimes uniform in composition through
 out, but more frequently, even when only 100 feet in depth, divided
into two or three portions by beds of sand. In the well at the site
of Fairlop Fair it was 398 feet thick, and uniform throughout.                 In
the Dengey and Rochford hundreds, where the clay is from 300 to
400 feet in thickness, it is divided by beds of sand into three or
four parts. A bed of sand also usually occurs between the clay and
the chalk.      These alternations Dr. Mitchell is of opinion, indicate
successive periods of turbulence and tranquillity.
    A sufficient supply of water is sometimes obtained in the first bed
of sand, but it is more often necessary to sink to that resting imme
diately on the chalk, on reaching which a vast volume of water
rushes up, and compels the well-digger to ascend precipitately to
the surface. Cement-stones are sources of great impediment, par
ticularly to well-borers, a week or fortnight being occasionally spent
in punching through a single mass. At the bottom of the clay a
layer frequently occurs, and is technically called the water-rock,
because, being penetrated, a powerful spring rushes up.                  "
    The water is sometimes, but not very often, combined with a saline
 substance, probably sulphate of magnesia, as that salt is abundant in
the waters of the London clay in Surrey, and solid magnesia occurs
 at Stamford Hill, near London.             Foul air is not unknown in the
 wells, though it has done little harm in Essex.             Its nature has not
 been ascertained, but Dr. Mitchell conceives, that it is probably
 sulphuretted hydrogen, as in Middlesex and Hertfordshire that gas
 has been most destructive. In the chalk of Surrey carbonic acid gas
 is very troublesome, and has sometimes produced fatal effects.

 of a higher class are beginning to reside on the island.    Wallisea,
 Mersea, and other islands have profited in a similar manner.
    A great addition is made annually to the land along the coast of
 Essex, and valuable districts, one amounting to five hundred acres,
 and another to between one hundred and two hundred, have been
 recently protected by embankments.      Outside of these inclosures
 are tracts of sand, estimated equal to 33,000 acres, not yet covered
 with vegetable mould, but dry eight hours out of every tide. To
 wards the close of 1837, preparatory steps were taken for forming
 a company to inclose these sands, but Dr. Mitchell is of opinion that
 they would not yield in 300 years a rental of 300 pence.
    To this paper was appended a notice, by the same author, of con
 stant and occasional outbursts of water from the chalk.
    The localities of constant outbursts are, the Bourne Mill, near
Farnham; the head of the river Mole, near the church at Merstham;
(this river flows south of Ryegate to Dorking, below which town
the bed of the river is dry in summer, but an abundant stream passes
under the chalk, and reappears lower down;) Leatherhead, close to .
the Guildford road; the powerful spring near the church below
Croydon; Orpington; the Holy-well at Kempering, on the south
side of the North Downs; the spring a quarter of a mile west of
Sittingbourne; Birchington, in the Isle of Thanet; the Lyddon
Spout in the cliffs between Folkstone and Dover; the Holy-well, at
the foot of the cliffs forming Beachy Head, one mile from East
bourne; the spring which is the source of the Chadwell, and the
main spring of the Amwell.
    Occasional Outbursts.-The     Bourne, near Birchwood House.
During the last outburst, which was in the spring of 1837, the
water flowed in great volume to Croydon, and continued to do so
for six weeks. Later in the same year, another rivulet burst forth
in Gatton Park, between Merstham and Ryegate; and a third in
Nonsuch Park, near Ewell.

   The Isopods in the bed No. 16 often occur in clusters.                      Lenses
 of the eye are sometimes detectable in the limestone, and more
rarely attached to the head; traces of legs have also been observed,
but no antennae.      In the same bed the elytron of a coleopterous
insect was discovered.
   Among the heaps of debris, consisting of grits and limestones,
derived apparently from beds subjacent to No. 18, but not visible,
Mr. Brodie found fragments of a limestone different from the varie
ties in the preceding section, being generally coarser, softer, and
less compact, and often white on the edges, but blue in the centre.
It passes into a grit, in which he procured oysters, numerous bones
and palates of fishes, and a tooth of a saurian. The limestone is full
of a large distinct species of cypris; it contains also traces of car
bonized wood, impressions of small plants, some of which resemble
grasses; likewise remains of Isopods, a few bivalves, apparently
cyclades, one fragment of a univalve, and, dispersed throughout its
substance, insects and small fishes, sometimes microscopic.                        The
insects discovered by the author consist chiefly of coleoptera, but he
procured a beetle with the antennae attached, about half an inch in
length; remains of a Homopterous insect, and probably of several
species of Dipterus, presenting distinctly, in some specimens, the
wings, legs, and striae of the abdomen; also a wing of a Libellula.
Mr. Brodie believes that this is the first instance of the discovery
of insects in a Wealden formation; and he observes, that for abun
dance and variety of specimens, the beds of the quarry resemble
more a tertiary (Aix and CEningen) than a secondary deposit.

536                         Geological Society.
     Mr. Brodie infers, from the occurrence of oysters in some of the
layers, that the beds were accumulated in an estuary which afforded
considerable variations in the nature of the sediment accumulated,
and of the animals by which it was frequented.
     In conclusion, the author states, that he is indebted to Mr. Owen
for determining the characters of the fossil Isopod.
     A letter was afterwards read, addressed to the Rev. Dr. Buck
land, President of the Society, by R. Griffith, Esq., P.G.S. of
Dublin, respecting the geological relations of the several rocks of
 the South of Ireland.
     This communication was accompanied by a copy of Mr. Griffith's
 Geological Map of Ireland; and its principal object is to explain why
 he has coloured, as old red sandstone and carboniferous limestone,
 extensive districts of the counties of Kerry, Cork, and Waterford,
 which had been previously considered to be transition.
      The geological base of these counties is clay slate passing into
  quartzose slate, quartz rock, and occasionally conglomerates.         This
 is particularly the case in the peninsula of Corkaguinny or Dingle
  in the county of Kerry; and as the succession of rocks forming the
  south of Ireland is well exposed in that district within a short dis
  tance, Mr. Griffith selected it for the purpose of explaining his views.
      The lowest formation on the sea-shore at Brandon Bay consists of
  black and red clay slate, and gray quartz rock. The beds are nearly
  vertical, but occasionally dip 70° or 80° to the south.        In some lo
  calities near the Bay, the slates alternate with red and gray quartzose
  conglomerates; and on the western coast of the peninsula, at Doon
  guin, Ferriter's Cove, and Filaturrio, S.E. of Dingle, the slate con
   tains Orthis, Terebratulae, corals, &c. This series is succeeded, un
  conformably, by beds composed of rolled masses of quartz and mica
   slate, in an arenaceous base, and it is assigned by Mr. Griffith to the
   old red sandstone. On the summit of Cahirconree mountains, this
   conglomerate, associated with beds of fine-grained red sandstone, dips
  to the east at an angle of 10°. Proceeding eastward, in ascending
   order, the conglomerate disappears, and the formation consists of red
  and reddish-brown quartzose sandstone, alternating with coarse-red
   slate, flagstone, and occasionally green slates.         These strata are
   succeeded, conformably, by a fine, yellowish-gray sandstone, forming
   the commencement of the carboniferous series. The sandstone con
  tains Calamites, and at Gortaclay, 2 miles west of Curreen's Bridge,
  indistinct bivalves. Its upper beds alternate with coarse and fine
  dark-gray clay slate, abounding with Productae, Spiriferae, Tere
   bratulae, Encrinites, corals, and other fossils.     Continuing to ascend
   in the series, beds of carboniferous limestone, containing the same
   organic remains, alternate with the fossiliferous slate; then appear
   strata of gray, fine-grained, indurated sandstone, alternating in the
   upper part with slate; next, a series of strata of limestone and greenish
   clay slate, containing the same fossils; beyond which the slate gra
   dually disappears, and the whole mass is composed of limestone. In
   the flat central space between Curreen's Bridge and Castle Island, are
   probably shale and limestone.      Near Castle Island occurs the upper

         Mr. Griffith          on the Rocks             of the     South     of Ireland.                 537
limestone, abounding in nearly every known fossil of the carboni
ferous limestone of Ireland; and eastward of Castle Island is dis
played, in conformable position, the millstone grit, the lower shales
of which contain, in considerable quantity, Encrinites, Posidoniae,
Spiriferae, Productae, Ammonites, Orthocera, &c.
     The change effected by Mr. Griffith in this district, consists in
removing the dark-gray and greenish-gray fossiliferous slate at
Curreen's Bridge from the transition series to the lower part of the
carboniferous limestone system, in consequence of                       resting con   its
formably       onthe sandstone, and dipping regularly under the lime
stone,    as  well as on account             of
                                        its fossils.
     Mr. Griffith then describes            line  a    country between Mount

  reversed order of succession prevails south of the valley; but as the
  strata dip southward 80°, they apparently overlie the limestone,
  the deceptive character being due to the contortions of the form
  ations.
     It is not possible to follow the author throughout his details, but
  he shows, as before stated, that there is a regular sequence of form
  ation throughout the country to Cork Harbour, the only variations
  being in the direction and amount of the dips due to undulations in
  the formations, and in the strata themselves. The localities de
  scribed in greatest detail are the valleys of the Bride and the vicinity
  of Cork.
     Mr. Griffith is of opinion, that the bands of carboniferous lime
  stone in the valleys of the south of Ireland are only patches of a
  vast deposit which once covered the old red sandstone and transition
  districts.
     The memoir was accompanied by an extensive collection of fossils
 illustrative of the different formations of the country, but more
  particularly of the Cork limestone.       This collection was presented
 by Mr. Griffith to the Society.
     June 5,-A paper was read, “On bones of Mammoths found in
 the deep sea of the English Channel and German Ocean,” by Capt.
  J. B. Martin, Harbour-Master, Ramsgate, and communicated by Sir
  John Rennie, F.G.S.
     The Ramsgate fishermen employed in trawling in the North Sea
  and English Channel, frequently bring up in their gear, fragments
 of fossil bones.         These remains being generally charged with
 worms, and covered with fetid marine substances, are seldom ca
 pable of being preserved; but specimens in a good condition are
 sometimes procured, and of the greater part of these, Capt. Martin
 has been the fortunate purchaser.        The following is a list of the
 principal specimens:–
     1. A tusk, 9 feet long, and 8 inches in diameter at the lower
 end; but the part containing the alveolar cavity is wanting, and
 therefore its length or greatest diameter, when perfect, cannot
 be ascertained.        The outside consists of very thin laminae, and
 the interior of a soft substance resembling putty. The specimen
 was found in 1827, and is in the possession of Mr. Forster of
 Ramsgate.
     2. In 1835, a very large decayed bone, and a tusk 11 feet long,
 but so soft as to be cut through with a knife, the centre being of
 the consistence of pipe-clay, were dredged up between Boulogne

   The fossils described in this communication, were found about
three years since in the excavations on the line of the Birmingham
Railway, between Euston Square and Kilburn. They occurred at
depths varying from 12 to 40 feet, and generally in small hard
nodular masses of a pale-brown colour.       Some of the specimens,
when cleared from the matrix, are oval or spindle-shaped; others
are cylindrical and branched, varying in diameter from half an inch
to less than a tenth, and in length from 2 to 5 inches; and several
are flabelliform, with a more or less rugose surface, the width of the
largest being 4 inches and three quarters, the length about 5
inches, and the thickness half an inch.       The whole of the speci
mens are more or less covered with small oviform grains, occasion
ally furrowed down the middle, and generally distributed without
any definite arrangement, but in some instances are disposed in
rows, the grains being chiefly placed parallel to their longer axis.
Besides the above more regular-shaped masses, Mr. Wetherell has
obtained a vast quantity of others, which present no definite form,
but are composed of small rough angular bodies, generally amor
phous internally, but occasionally composed of concentric lamellae.
These specimens are likewise often more or less covered with the
 oviform grains, some of which may also be discovered in the sub
stance of the specimen. The author referred to a description by
 Mr. Richardson, of branched bodies, in the London clay near Herne
 Bay, but which are not covered by the oviform grains”.
    Mr. Wetherell offers no opinion relative to the true nature of
 these fossils, leaving their determination open to the result of future
 researches.
    Lastly, a paper was read “On the relations of the different parts
 of the Old Red Sandstone, in which organic remains have recently
 been discovered, in the counties of Murray, Nairn, Banff, and          In
 verness,” by J. G. Malcolmson, M.D., F.G.S.
    The author commences by stating, that in a paper read before
 this Society in April 1838t, he announced, that Mr. Martin had
 discovered fossil scales and bones in the old red sandstone under
the cornstone four miles to the south of Elgin, and that he had him
self ascertained that many of the specimens belonged to fishes from
Clashbinnie, since figured in Mr. Murchison's Silurian System;
under the name of Holoptychus Nobilissimus.        A careful exami
nation of the Ichthyolite beds discovered by Mr. Miller on both
sides of the south Sutor of Cromarty, convinced the author, that
they also belong to the old red sandstone; and he has identified
several of the fishes found there with those of Gamrie, Caithness,
and Orkney; and this identification M. Agassiz confirmed with
reference to the Cromarty species of Cheiracanthus, Diplopterus, and
the remarkable fossil called by that naturalist Coccosteus; the
Gamrie species of Acanthodes, M. Agassiz likewise recognised

  among the Cromarty specimens.          Mr. Murchison has given further
  proof of the age of the Caithness beds by showing that the Dipterus
  macrolepidotus so common in them, is found also in the tilestone or
  lowest member of the old red sandstone of England.
      Dr. Malcolmson then proceeds to describe the discoveries recently
  made by himself, the Rev. G. Gordon, and Mr. Staples, of fossil
  fishes in a district of old red sandstone, extending from the village
  of Buckie, near Cullen, to Culloden Moor, 6 miles south of Inver
  ness. The southern parts of this tract are occupied by primary
  rocks, which send off spurs and transverse ridges into the sandstone
  country, and they are likewise exposed in different places within
  its area.     Wherever the contact of the two classes of rocks is
  exhibited, the old red sandstone rests on the edges of the older
  formations, dipping 8° or 12° a little west of north.     The granite
  series also terminate at the junction with the sandstones. The old
 red sandstone Dr. Malcolmson divides into three portions, the lowest
 of which he calls the Inferior or Great Conglomerate; the middle,
 the Central or Cornstone division; and the uppermost, the Fine
  Grain Sandstone and Quartzose Conglomerate.
     The lowest division is shown to belong to the great conglomerate
 at the base of the old red sandstone of Sutherland and Ross.        The
 beds of which it consists are exposed in ravines on the     right  bank
 of the Nairn to the east of Inverness, also in the ravines above
 Cawdor Castle; but at Rait Castle they thin out, or were denu
 dated, according to the author's view, before the deposition of the
 upper beds. On the east side of the hill of Rait they reappear,
 and extend along the Burn of Lethen for several miles. They occur
 also at Binnie in the vale of Rothes, south of Elgin, and along the
 Spey.     The division consists of partially-rounded fragments of the
 primary rocks of the neighbourhood, cemented by a calcareous and
 ferruginous sandstone.
     The Cornstone division consists of sandstones, calciferous concre
 tions, conglomerates, and marls, and contains scales of the Holopty
 chus Nobilissimus and other fishes; also teeth and ichthyodorulites
 of new genera. This fossiliferous rock is exposed for a short distance
 at Scot-craig near Elgin, resting on the great conglomerate, and it
 passes below the cornstone    of Elgin.
     Resting on the Elgin cornstones is a series of very beautiful
white and yellow siliceous sandstones, containing pebbles of quartz,
gneiss, and granite.      It may be traced from Quarry Hill near Elgin,
to   Burge,   3% miles east of Forres, extending over a considerable
part of the north-eastern district of Murray.
     Dr. Malcolmson next describes, in detail, the cornstone series as
it is displayed on the banks of the Findhorn, particularly where it
is exposed between the gneiss and the Cothall limestone”, various
remains of fish having been found there; and at Altyn, where he
obtained scales of Holoptychus Nobilissimus, and abundance of

on this district for other information respecting the Cothall limestone,

Ichthyolites identical with those at Scot-craig near Elgin; also
a section through the middle and inferior sandstones on the Burn
of Lethen. Along this burn, from Earlsmill to Cald Hame, fine
sections of sandstones, calciferous conglomerates, and marls similar
to those of the Findhorn beds, are laid open, and the same organic
remains are found in considerable numbers, with the addition of
buckler-shaped bones allied to Cephalaspis.        These beds rest at
Cald Hame on a deposit of thin-bedded red sandstones and hard
conglomerates,     which are succeeded by a considerable thickness of
haematitic red schistose sandstone, resting apparently on the Clunes
limestone, containing Ichthyolites.      These slaty beds resemble the
upper red sandstones of Cromarty and Ross. In a small quarry in
the grounds of Lethen, thin seams of shale and clay dip under the
red sandstones, and contain nodules resembling those of Gamrie,
and bituminous layers and remains of the species of Cheiracanthus
common at Clunes; also plants resembling Fuci.             Beneath the
shales are a few feet of soft white sandstone, succeeded by the great
inferior conglomerate.
     The finest fish, often of a plum-blue colour, have been obtained
from an excavation on the farm of Lethen-bar, in large nodules
enclosed in a soft, reddish-brown schist, probably a prolongation
of the shales. At Clunes, a mile to the eastward, similar remains
occur in a stratum of clay and decomposed shale. The author
has ascertained, by careful comparisons, that the known species
obtained at the above localities are the same as those found in
Orkney, Caithness, Cromarty, and Gamrie, and belong to the
genera Dipterus, Diplopterus, Cheiracanthus, Cheirolepis, Osteole
pis, Coccosteus, and another singular creature, which he proposes
to describe hereafter. The plants above noticed, and fish scales, are
 also found near the hill of Raitin a ridge of red schistose sandstone.
     The fossils of the valley of the Nairn are then described. Frag
 ments and casts of tuberculated scales and bones, resembling some
 of those of Lethen-bar, occur at Balfreish in a compact light-blue
 limestone, containing angular fragments of gneiss, porphyry, &c., and
 an overlying conglomerate.        At the S.E. extremity of Culloden
 Moor, and opposite the Druidical temples of Clova, are beds of
 bituminous shale, and a black calcareous rock, similar to the Caith
 ness pavement, some of which contain nodules, often very small,
 enclosing fish scales and vegetable impressions.      The bituminous
 rock, Dr. Malcolmson is of opinion, is continuous with that at
  Inches, 4 miles to the west, and 2 south-west of Inverness, described
  by Prof. Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison, and shown by them to be a
  prolongation of the bituminous schists of Caithness and Strath
  P effer.
     The banks of the Spey, the Burn of Tynat, and the strata at
  Buckie in Banffshire, have been discovered by Dr. Malcolmson and
   the Rev. G. Gordon, to contain the same remains.       The localities
  mentioned are the beds of shale and red sandstone opposite Dipple,
   where remains of the Coccosteus, Dipterus, and Osteolepis magus,
   occur. These beds are overlaid by others resembling those which
   cover the Ichthyolites of Lethen and Cromarty.

544                                 Žoological Society.
   Following the strike of the Dipple beds into Banffshire, the
author and the Rev. G. Gordon discovered, at the Burn of Tynas,
4 miles E. of Fochabers, a similar series of shales and sandstones
containing Ichthyolites, enclosed, as usual, in flattened nodules.
Many fine specimens of species common to Lethen, Cromarty, &c.,
were procured in the highest stratum.       At Buckie, the inferior
conglomerate is partially covered by patches of a red schistose sand
stone, in which a tuberculated bone, similar to those in the Burn of
Tynat, was found. The shore near this point is said to exhibit fine
 examples of a raised beach.
   From the facts contained in the paper, the author concludes,
    1. The primary strata were thrown into highly-inclined positions
before the deposition of the old red sandstone.         The elevation of
the secondary strata to their present position, he conceives may have
been produced by elevation in the line of the Grampians, or of the
Great Caledonian Canal, subsequent to the accumulation of the
Purbeck beds at Linksfield.
   2. The great conglomerate and red sandstones containing Dipteri,
Cheiracanthi, &c., represent the Orkney, Caithness, and Gamrie
strata in Scotland, and the inferior beds of the old red sandstone
 of England.
   3. The superimposed marly conglomerates, sandstones, and marl
stones, with a distinct series of fossils, are equivalents of the central
division of the old red sandstone system to the south of the Gram
pians, and in England.
   Lastly, That there are no indications of the coal strata.
   Dr. Malcolmson terminates his memoir by stating, that the Gam
rie Ichthyolites clearly belong to the old red sandstone, and not to
the coal measures.

at the conclusion of                its

   The average number of malformations, according to Mr. Buck
nell's experience, was not more than five in a thousand; though in
Egypt, it was stated, malformations were extremely common in the
artificial process of incubation. He attributed this circumstance to
an excess of heat, and generally found it to affect the toes and ex
tremities; sometimes also the muscles of the neck.
   A general conversation afterwards took place on this subject,
during which much interesting and valuable information was ex
tracted, with regard to the period and circumstances of the incuba
tion.
  June 25.—Mr. Waterhouse read a paper on a new species of Ro
dent which had been sent from the island of Luzon, one of the
Philippines, by Hugh Cuming, Esq., Corresponding Member.
   In general appearance this Rodent might be mistaken for a species
of Capromys; in size it is about equal to the C. Fournieri; the gene
ral characters of the skull and dentition, however, indicate that its
affinity is with the Muridae.
   “The skull, compared with that of the common Rat, differs in
being of a more ovate form, the occipital portion being somewhat
elongated, and considerably contracted;             the width between the     or
bits is comparatively great; and behind the orbits the frontal bones
are expanded, and join with the temporal to form a distinct post
orbital process. The interparietal bone, instead of being transverse,
is almost circular. The auditory bullae are very small. The inter
dental portion of the palate is slightly contracted in front, so that
the molares diverge posteriorly; the rami of the lower jaw are less
deeply emarginated behind, the coronoid portion is smaller, and the
descending   ramus is broader and rounded;                  the symphysis   menti
is of considerable extent. The incisor teeth are less compressed and
less deep from front to back. The molar teeth are of a more simple
structure; the anterior molar of the upper jaw consists of three
transverse lobes, and the second and third consist each of two
transverse lobes.      In the lower jaw the anterior molar consists of
four  lobes,   a small rounded lobe in front, followed by two transverse
lobes, of which the anterior one is the smaller, and finally a small
transverse posterior lobe; the second molar consists of two equal
transverse lobes, and a small lobe behind them; the last molar con
sists of two simple transverse lobes.”
   On account of the differences observable in the structure of the
teeth, and form of the skull, combined with the hairy nature of the
tail and ears, Mr. Waterhouse regarded this animal as constituting a
sub-genus, and proposed for it the name of Phlaeomys", this name
being suggested by the habit of the animal, which Mr. Cuming
(after whom the species is named) states, feeds chiefly on the bark of
trees.     It may be thus characterized:

  Some notes on the birth of the Giraffe at the Society's Menagerie
were communicated by Professor Owen.
   Of this paper the following is an abstract.
   Connexion took place between the female Giraffe and the lighter
coloured male on the 18th March, 1838, and again on the 1st of
April.
  *F. young       animal was a male, and was born June 9, 1839, being
444  days,   or fifteen lunar months, three weeks, and three days, since
the last  observed,    and, in      probability, the last coitus.

   The new-born animal came into the world, like other Ruminants,
with the eyes open, and the hoofs disproportionately large. The
skin was marked            distinctly

   A paper was read “On the polarizing property of living animals
and animal substances upon the rays of transmitted light,” by Mr.
J.  F. Goddard*.
   In this communication Mr. Goddard first alluded to the double
refracting (polarizing property) exhibited by the lenses of the eyes
of fishes and several other animal substances, an account of which
was published in 1816 by Sir D. Brewster.
   On repeating these experiments, Mr. Goddard, after observing
that the scarf skin of the human subject, sections of human teeth,
the finger nails, bones of fishes, and other substances, possessed the
same property, was led to examine some living objects, when he
discovered that among others, the larvae and pupae of a gnat (Co
rethra plumicornis) possessed this property in an eminent degree.
The extraordinary transparency of this little insect is such, that the
whole of           its
               internal structure     beautifully displayed, and when
                                                         is

regular parts, present (as the insect changes its position with regard
to the plane      polarization) the most varied hues and brilliant co
                     of
lours.   Mr. Goddard stated that the same phaenomena may also                                                   be
seen,    possible,

source, arising from a branch of natural history to which in particular
I have devoted my attention; but from the general nature of the de
scription, I was obliged to defer my desire of identifying the fish till
some future opportunity should enable me to do so.          Quite unex
pectedly, however, a few days ago, the last overland despatch brought
me a letter from my valued friend Mr. McClelland, a Corresponding
Member of this Society, an extract of which, bearing upon the point
in question, I lose no time in laying before the Society:- . . . . I
have now to mention what is of far greater importance in another
point of view, namely, that the Suleah Fish described in a recent
number of Parbury's Oriental Herald is the Polynemus Sele of Ha
milton. I have examined that species, and found an individual of
two pounds weight to yield sixty-five grains of pure isinglass, an ar
ticle which here sells at sixteen rupees (ll. 12s.) per Ib. Refer to
your dissections of Polynemi; mark those with large air-vessels to be
isinglass, requiring no other preparation than merely removing the
vascular membrane that covers them, washing with lime-water, and
drying in the sun. You know the size these fishes attain, and the
number in which they abound in the Sunderbuns; you also know
the method of taking them, and can therefore state to what extent
isinglass may be obtained in India.     I have sent a paper on the sub
ject to the Journal of the Asiatic Society, which                  I
                                                       will send you by
the next overland     despatch.”
    “Perceiving by this that the subject has been taken up by a na
turalist of Mr. McClelland's rank, and that we ere long may expect
his observations embodied in a paper from his hand, I think it suf
ficient to confine myself to a few general remarks upon those species
of Polynemus which have come under my actual examination while
I was attached as surgeon to the Hon. Company's survey of the
sea-face of the Gangetic Delta.

  THE ITALIAN SCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION: MEETING AT PISA,
               oCTOBER 1st to 15TH, 1839.
    All    the members of the Italian Scientific Association are admitted
   to the privileges of membership without any pecuniary payment.
   An open field is granted to them in the sectional meetings of the
   Association for the communication of their discoveries and observa
   tions; constant opportunities are afforded for the encouragement of
   conversation, and a tribute of respect is paid to a large portion of
   the members, by the formation of a select society, within the Asso
   ciation, consisting of those individuals who have worked for the ad
   vancement of science, and including, at the same time, the members
   of distinguished scientific societies.
       Great praise is due to Prince Charles Bonaparte, aided by several
   eminent Professors of Pisa and Florence, for their exertions in ori
   ginating the Italian Scientific Association. These philosophers were
   fortunate in obtaining the zealous cooperation of Leopold II., the
. Grand Duke of Tuscany, in the preliminary arrangements for the
   meeting; and the attendance of that sovereign at the sectional meet
   ings of the Association, and his willing attention bestowed on the
   scientific papers which were read in the various sections, plainly
   demonstrated the interest which he felt in the proceedings of this
   society.
      On the 1st October, 1839, a religious service was performed in
  the cathedral at Pisa, to which the Catholic members of the Asso
  ciation were invited.     After this service, an introductory meeting
  of the scientific members was held in the university. On the follow
  ing day, a beautiful marble statue of Galileo, which had been re
   cently erected in the centre of the court of the university, was ex
  hibited to the members of the Association, and a formal oration was
  delivered by Professor Rosini of Pisa in honour of Galileo.
      The first general meeting of the Italian Association took place on
  the 3rd of October, and Professor Gerbi, the aged President of the
   Association, read a long address on this occasion, in which he ex
  patiated largely on the praises of Galileo, and detailed some of the
  principal advantages of the six sections of the Association. Several
  letters from the absent friends of the Association were also read at
  the same meeting, and among these letters, one of the most interest
  ing was from Sir John Herschel.
      Sectional meetings commenced on the 4th October; early hours
  were adopted, and the sections of agriculture and zoology com
  menced their labours at eight o'clock in the morning.          Only two
  hours were allowed for each sectional meeting, and at ten o'clock
 the first two sections concluded their business for the day, and the
 sections of geology and chemistry were allowed to commence their
 sittings, which ended at twelve o'clock.
     Between twelve o'clock and two, the sections of medicine and
 botany were at work, but the popularity of the medical section, and
 the large number of contributors to  its  stores, often rendered alonger
 period than two hours requisite for the discussion of    the various sub
jects brought before its notice.

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              551
    All the sections were well attended, and the audience appeared
interested, and at times greatly delighted, especially during the
most animated discussions.
    In the geological section, and probably in all the other sections,
the results of long and laborious investigations were brought for
ward by their authors.      Professor Sismondi of Turin, the president      .
of the geological section, exhibited to the members of that section
his accurate and valuable map of the geology of Piedmont; Pro
fessor Savi of Pisa explained his views, to the same section, respect
 ing the formation of the mountains near Pisa, with which he had
long been familiarly acquainted, and M. Pasini exhibited his map of
 the Alps to the north of Venice, accompanied with a regular series
 of rock-specimens from numerous localities in that portion of the
Alpine district.
    On the 8th October the second general meeting of the Scientific
 Association was held, and papers were read by the President, or by
 some other distinguished individual, from each section.     Great ap
 plause was elicited from the audience by the concluding sentence of
 one of these scientific papers, in which the author, who was an emi
 nent Grecian geologist, stated, that “in ancient times the inhabit
 ants of Italy were accustomed to visit Greece in search of know
 ledge, but that, at the present time, the inhabitants of Greece were
 in the habit of coming to Italy to acquire additional knowledge.”
     A magnificent dinner was given by the Grand Duke of Tuscany
 to all the scientific members of the Association on the 10th Oc
 tober, and about three hundred philosophers sat down to this ban
 quet, at which the Governor of the city of Pisa presided.        After
  dinner, the health of Leopold II., the Grand Duke, was drunk with
  evident gratification, and verses were recited in well-merited praise
of his liberality.
   On the 14th October, the sectional meetings terminated, and on
the 15th October, the last general meeting of the Association was
held, when the Grand Duke of Tuscany took his seat at the right
hand of the President. Reports were read from each of the sections;
the laws of the Association, drawn up by the committee of the pre
sidents of the sections, which formed the governing body of the
Association, were declared; and it was announced that the next
meeting of the Italian Association would be held, in 1840, at Turin,
and that the meeting in the following year, 1841, would take place
at Florence.

         CAPITAINE prepares this compound (which he calls a chlo
          rohyposulphite of mercury) by mixing accurately ninety-four
 parts of bichloride of mercury and six parts of sulphur. The mixture
 is to be put into a platina capsule, covered with a funnel, and very mo"
 derately heated; an efflorescence rises from   allthe points   ofthe sur
 face and  athick crust  is formed;  the   capsule    is

sionally from the fire to remove the crystals formed, and is to be
again heated to procure more of them. This compound may be
obtained directly by making a mixture of protochloride of mercury
and chloride of sulphur in sufficient quantities to form a thin paste.
After twenty-four hours' digestion in a close vessel, it is to be gently
heated ; the excess of chloride of sulphur is dissipated; the matter
fuses, becomes red, and sublimes; this compound may also be formed
by the action of sulphuret of arsenic upon bichloride of mercury.
    Chlorosulphuret of mercury is of a yellowish white colour; the
crystals are exactly similar in form to those of bichloride of mer
cury; when exposed to the action of heat, they fuse into a brown
liquid, capable of boiling and volatilization without undergoing any
change. This compound is immediately decomposed by water,
which converts it into bichloride of mercury, and sulphur, which
precipitates in the state of a granular powder.      This ready decom
position effected by water, renders the analysis very easy; for it is
sufficient to take a known weight of            boil        it,
                                                       for some time
                                                                  to          it                          in

                                              sulphur deposited, which
being subtracted from the weight employed, the difference         bichlo                      is

quite free from objection, the relative proportions        the elements             of
were determined             by
                       direct means.  The mercury was reduced        the                            to
metallic state, the sulphur was obtained uncombined,            sulphate                or   as
of  barytes, and the chlorine     combination with silver.

                          the compound was passed       vapour over iron      in
filings heated     redness. The mercury was condensed
                       to                                        the end                     at

    which the mercury was converted into sulphuret, the same result
was obtained.
     In   order  determine the sulphur, 100 parts were heated
                  to                                               red                             to

       WHITENESS OF PRECIPITATED SULPHUR.               BY H. Rose.
    It  is
        a  well-known fact, that sulphur, which separates from liquids
                   of                                                   sul

of the difference between them.
     In
      the opinion   M. Rose has escaped notice, that the peculiar
                                 of                   it
yellow colour               of   sulphur      is   wanting              only      in   those cases         in   which     it

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               555
is deposited from solutions containing free sulphuretted hydrogen;
the more they contain of this the whiter is the sulphur. It is
never    whiter than when it is deposited from water saturated with
sulphuretted hydrogen, in which the hydrogen of the sulphuretted
hydrogen has been gradually oxidized by the contact of the air. If
on the contrary finely divided sulphur be precipitated from solutions
which do not contain free sulphuretted hydrogen, it has a yellow
colour, even when the quantity is small. It is sufficient to decom
 pose a small quantity of a solution of an alkaline hyposulphite by
 an acid, to be convinced of the truth of this assertion.
     White or gray precipitated sulphur, (milk of sulphur) contains a
 very small quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen, in the state of per
 sulphuret of hydrogen. If it be fused and the small quantity of gas
 disengaged from the surface of the fused sulphur be conducted by
 the aid of a current of atmospheric air into a solution of lead, a no
 table quantity of sulphuret of lead is obtained. M. Rose treated in
 this way a large quantity of the different modifications of this white
  sulphur prepared in different modes, and he always obtained the
  same result.
      In melting flowers of sulphur, or roll sulphur, it is true that there
  is sometimes obtained a little sulphuretted hydrogen; but the quan
  tity of it is so small that it cannot be compared with that disengaged
  from the milk of sulphur. Water cannot remove from this last
 mentioned      substance the small quantity    of sulphuretted hydrogen
 which it contains; for all the modifications examined were washed
 with water till it produced no effect in a solution of lead.—Journal
 de Pharmacie, Aout, 1839.
                              URIC ACID.
     M. Fritzsche has analysed hydrated crystallized uric acid. When
  the process given by M. Boeteger of preparing uric acid is adopted,
  and which consists in dissolving pigeons' dung in a solution of borax,
  and precipitating the uric acid with hydrochloric acid, the acid is
  procured in much larger crystals when the solution contains a great
  quantity of organic matter than when it does not contain any. The
  separation of the uric acid takes place readily, and but a small quan
  tity remains in the liquor. Even this separates on standing, in the
  form of yellowish brown dendritic crystals, of a line in length, and
  are hydrated uric acid.     This hydrate, when dried at 212° Fahr.,
  loses about 21:52   per  cent. of water.    It is only these large crystals
  which are  hydrated;    whenever it is   precipitated from hot dilute so
  lutions the acid is always of this kind; the smaller the crystals are,
  the more readily they part with a portion of their water at the usual
   temperature, and it is on this account that they have been so long
   unknown.—L'Institut, No. 304.

  FALL of A METEORITE IN MISSOURI, FEBRUARY 13, 1839.
   On the afternoon of the 13th of February, 1839, a meteor ex
ploded  near the settlement of Little Piney, Missouri, (lat. 37° 55'
N. ;  lon. 92° 5' W.) and cast down to the earth one stony mass or
more in that vicinity. Mr. Forrest Shepherd, of this city, who was
at the time exploring this region in the line of his profession, viz.
that of a mineralogical and geological surveyor, hearing of the ex
plosion of the meteor, exerted himself to collect
                                                                                byin all
                                                    the circumstances
of the occurrence. He subsequently succeeded obtaining several
fragments      one  of         of
                      the stones thrown down        the meteor.   Mr.
Shepherd has favoured me with          opportunity       an

  on the non-eristence                       of Fluoric Acid in Animal Matter.                          559
   Baron Berzelius has published a paper in the 61st volume of the
“Annales de Chimie ;” in which he states, fluoric acid may be de
tected in human teeth, bones, and urine; and may be demonstrated,
in the latter case, by operating on the precipitate obtained from the
excretion by means of lime-water.      Since the publication of this
paper by Baron Berzelius, the existence of fluoric acid, as a con
stituent of the animal substances above mentioned, has been ac
knowledged by chemists generally; and it is mentioned as such in
the standard chemical works of the present day.
   Having lately been engaged in the analysis of human bone, with
more especial reference to those ingredients which have been stated
to exist in small proportion, I was led to search particularly for
fluoride of calcium.      My experiments were made in the usual man
ner, by trying to obtain the corroding action of fluoric acid on a
plate of glass, which was used as a loose cover to a platinum cru
cible, which contained the substance for examination, mixed with
strong sulphuric acid. A gentle heat was applied to the bottom of
the containing vessel.        In this way, several specimens of human
bone (both before and after calcination) were subjected to experi
ment; but in no instance could I obtain any action upon the glass.
   The experiment which the Baron recommends, in order to ob
                                                                       strong sul

 and all the animal substances in which fluorine has been said to
 exist, are particularly rich in phosphoric acid;—thus the ashes of
 ivory, of human bone, and the enamel of teeth, as also the precipi
 tate obtained from urine by means of lime-water, are all of them
 composed, in very great part, of phosphate of lime.               Mr. Richard
 Phillips has mentioned (in the Annals of Philosophy, vol. v.), that
 when the water contained in uranite is driven off from the powdered
 mineral, a portion of the phosphoric acid is volatilized with it; the
 heat used being that of a common spirit-lamp. This is the only
 fact with which I am acquainted (with the exception of my own
 observation), to show that phosphoric acid will volatilize with
 water.    The heat used in Mr. Phillips's experiment was, most pro
 bably, considerably higher than any which I applied.              There seems
 no doubt that phosphoric acid is much more volatile than it has
 heretofore been supposed.
    Having failed in detecting fluoric acid in human bones, I deter
 mined on testing for its presence in the enamel of teeth, in recent
 ivory, and in the precipitate obtained from urine by the addition of
 lime-water.    Two different specimens of ivory (tusks of the ele
phant) gave no evidence of the presence of fluoric acid, when care
fully tested, either before or after calcination; and I was equally
 unsuccessful with the enamel of human teeth and the precipitat
from the urine *.                                                              .
    In these experiments, when I had failed in acting on the glass,
I always found that the addition of 0.3 grains of fluoride of calcium to
the experiment produced a strong and indelible mark on the surface
of the glass test-plate.      I mention 0.3 grains, because it will always
be found sufficient to   produce   a most unequivocal corrosion; though                     I
obtained   satisfactory   results by  the addition of a much less quantity.
I have had   only   one  opportunity    of examining fossil ivory; and in
that instance I could not ascertain              locality:
                                                       its              on

immediate action         on
                         the glass.
