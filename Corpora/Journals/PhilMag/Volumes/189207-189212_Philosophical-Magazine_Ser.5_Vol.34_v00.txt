   2. Remarks on the present Paper.—The
temperature work was done nearly five years ago. Having
the present occasion to corroborate the former results,       was                                              I
gratified to find that in the lapse of time my original constants
cannot have varied more than 4° or 5° at 1000°, while even
this index of the time-error of the method can be largely
explained away.      It seems justifiable therefore to give the
chief features of my method of work+ a larger publicity than
it will reach in a geological bulletin.
   Apart from this, since M. H. Le Chateliert has thrown
discredit on the platinum-iridioplatinum thermocouple, it
becomes incumbent on me to endeavour to restore the prestige
of the older couple, lest the same slur should also come over
my work.       Let me remark in passing, that though      have no                                     I
doubt of the trustworthiness of the platinum-rhodium couple,
nobody has as yet taken the pains to put it to the severe test
of a direct air-thermometer comparison, through which                                                                    I
have                                         I have long hoped to
         º  the platinum-iridium couple.
find the time to do this   myself.
   The present paper, therefore, though          main object                    its                                is

                           have proved that bulbs not glazed
internally are quite available for the exact air-thermometry
of high temperatures, one of the serious difficulties which the
work entails will have been removed.
  6. Metallic Capillary Tubes".-The bulb and the mano
meter are joined by seamless metallic capillary tubes, about
200 centim. or more long, and '05 centim. in diameter within.
These tubes are to be cut apart near the middle, and joined
                                                 ...
by a suitable three-way glass stopcock, through which the
bulb may be exhausted and thoroughly dried at red heat, and
both bulb and manometer finally              with the necessary
amount of   dry air or other gas.
   Capillary tubes may be made of either copper, silver, or
platinum.    The latter are preferable because they do not
amalgamate in case of an accidental contact with mercury.
I  succeeded in making, copper capillaries myself, by filling
a thick copper tube with fusible metal, rolling and drawing
the tube down to a wire, and finally melting out the fusible
core under slight pressure applied at one end of the tube.
Tubes of the kind necessary, however, are now in the market,
and may be obtained in lengths not exceeding 5 metres.        As
employed in the work below, an external diameter of 1 centim.
to a bore of '056 centim., or a volume of ‘0025 cub. centim.
per centimetre of length, was found to insure a sufficiently
rapid flow of gas from bulb to manometer, while the air con
tained in the capillary is nearly negligible in amount.
   7. Manometer.—This is practically a U-tube, one branch
of which is made of glass, 150 centim, long, accurately
graduated in cubic centimetres, with a total capacity of about
300 cub. centim.    Into the top of this tube, the available end
of the platinum  capillary, tapering to a fine conical point, is
suitably soldered with cement. The point so adjusted is a
convenient fiducial mark, the registration being made either
by optical or by electric contact with the mercury meniscus
of the manometer. The other branch of the U-tube is flexible,
and communicates with a sufficiently large mercury cistern,
which may be raised or lowered at pleasure. The whole is
attached to a prismatic stand, 2 metres high, consisting of
four uprights rigidly joined at the top and the bottom.
Observations are made for equal heights of the mercury in
both branches, by the cathetometer.     A barometer is attached
to the stand. Sensitive thermometers at the lower and the
upper end of the glass measuring-tube show         temperature.   its

   8. Revolving Muffle.—In order that corresponding indica
tions of thermocouple and air-thermometer may be compared,
both must be placed in a space at practically uniform tem
perature, which must be variable at pleasure from ordinary
temperatures to extreme white heat.   I constructed a special
furnace for this purpose, in the way indicated in plan in the
diagram (fig. 4). The body of the furnace is a thick cylin
drical box, % B, surmounted by a hemispherical lid, suitably
            Fig. 4.—Plan of   the revolving muffle.    Diagram.
  erforated.     In this cylindrical enclosure a spherical muffle,
    D, provided with hollow lateral arms or axles, E F, and
  laced symmetrically with respect to the centre of figure, is
 ree to rotate around the horizontal axis of the arms.                 If
                                                                     the
rate of rotation be   sufficient,  this insures  constancy  of tempera
ture within the muffle around the horizontal EF.             Two blast
burners, G and H, purposely placed tangentially so as to be
equivalent to a force-couple, blow a vortex of flame into this
furnace, equalizing temperature around the vertical.                    Vir
tually, therefore, the muffle, regarded as a geometrical sphere,
has two rotations, one round E F, and the other round the
vertical through O. To make this apparatus theoretically
perfect a third rotation, round a horizontal axis through O,
and perpendicular to EF, would have to be supplied. This
third rotation is a mechanical impossibility, bearing always
in mind that cumbersome or complicated apparatus would
rather detract from the end to be obtained than add to it.
    In the spherical space of constant temperature thus obtained
is  placed   the bulb of the air-thermometer (not shown), with
                                  through the axle F; and the bulb

 the fact that the observer can get very near it without               in

    10. Wires and Insulators.-The thermocouples used con
sisted of platinum combined with an alloy of platinum and 20
per cent. of iridium. The wires were cut in lengths of a metre
each, from large coils, and successive lengths showed the same
electric properties.     Even when melted down on lime hearths
before the oxyhydrogen blowpipe and drawn over again, the
constants of   §.   couples were not found to have appreciably
(To per cent.) changed. The wires should be annealed at red
heat before using.

    In order to keep the wires apart, devised a machine by
which doubly perforated insulators could be pressed, much in
the manner of lead-pipe manufacture.                The insulators were
made of very refractory fire-clay, 25 or 30 centim. long, and
‘5 or 6 centim. thick, with two parallel canals, each 1 centim.
in diameter, running from end to end.

upon the special purpose of the observer.       Suffice it to say
that I divided the total gas volume into 4 parts, viz., the
volume of the bulb and hot stem, the volume of the part of
the stem where temperature falls        from hot        cold, the           off                    to

On   *...
    dge has used the idea with the best of results in his book
              Views of Electricity.’
   The            of Dr. Lodge's book suggested to me the
               reading
working out of the results contained in this paper.
   The object of the paper is to draw attention to the advan
tages that are to be derived, especially by the student, from
taking as hypothesis, not, as is usual, the law of the inverse
square, but the existence of this elastic medium.       The hypo
thesis  may  not be exactly true, but it is as nearly true, and in
the same manner true, as that a wave of sound may be repre
sented by a wavy line.      We have as much right to deduce
theorems of electrostatics from consideration of the behaviour
of this medium under stress, as to deduce the laws of the
interference of sound from the summation of waves on a dia
gram.     In both cases the whole truth is not presented, but
sufficient to ensure the accuracy of the deduction.
   Suppose, then, the existence of an incompressible perfect
fluid filling            all
                 space and      bodies—the aether.   all

the particles with it; and that whenever displacement                 the                    of

     3.     If we consider                 the case         of   a   “charge” imparted to a
  conductor of any shape whatever, it will not be ordinarily
  possible to determine the pressure at any point in the sur
 rounding medium. The same difficulty arises of course in
 the ordinary method.     But it is possible, as in the ordinary
 method, to map out the nature of the strain in the medium by
 drawing lines of displacement and surfaces of equal pressure.
    A surface of equal pressure corresponds to a surface of
 equal potential.
     Since there can be no displacement along a surface of equal
  pressure (otherwise the pressure must vary along the surface),
     #.
 displacements always take place at right angles to such surfaces.
             a line drawn so that at every point on it the dis
 placement is along the line is always perpendicular to the
 surfaces of equal pressure which it meets.
    Also if a number of such lines be taken forming a tube,
 there will be no displacement across the walls of the tube;
 and hence if S be the area of any section, and a the displace
                                                   S.

 The energy, therefore, in a cell bounded by a unit tube and
two surfaces drawn so that the pressure on one differs by
unity from the pressure on the other, is #.
   Hence in any particular case of strain, if we can count the
number of cells into which space is divided by tubes and
surfaces drawn as above, we can calculate the total energy of
the strain.
   4. Since the aether in a conductor is to be regarded as an
incompressible fluid free from strain, it possesses the properties
of a perfect weightless fluid, and the pressure is the same at
every point of the conductor.                         If

converge on the gap left by the sphere, those in front will
correspondingly diverge.       We have to find the amount of the
extra   displacement  at every  point of the sphere.
    General considerations alone seem to show that the sphere
will be undistorted, simply translated ; for from symmetry
the positive charge on the one side of the sphere must be
numerically equal to the negative charge on the other side,
point by point, taking always two points the line joining
which is parallel to the direction of the displacement of the
field. The sphere is therefore uncontracted longitudinally,
and therefore also laterally.
    But this is proved also in the following complete solution.
    Let us examine the effect on the external medium of shifting
the sphere undistorted an extra distance a to the left. We
shall find that if we give a certain value to a, the resulting
strain of the external medium will cause a pressure across
each unit of area of the surface of the sphere equal and
opposite to the pressure across that area caused by the strain
of the medium within the sphere. Hence there will be com
plete equilibrium, and we shall have found the nature of the
state into which the sphere and medium will naturally fall.
                                Fig. 7.
    Now the state of strain into which the external medium
 will fall in consequence of the sphere being moved a distance
 a to the left is the same as would be produced if E, were
 equal to E1, and charges 27trº and —2Tr” were placed at O'
 and 0 respectively.      For the displacement at any point P
 produced by such charges would be

satisfied, gives rise to a considerable evolution of heat.   The
following determinations, however, will, trust, possess some       I

Indeed a knowledge of the thermal phenomena of solution
must be of the highest importance for arriving at any true
theory on the subject, although, so far as am aware, these               I

                                        confined my attention to
non-electrolytes, where the results obtained would not be com
plicated by any supposed dissociation; and, by selecting those
of which the heat of vaporization was known, it was only neces
sary to determine their heat of dissolution when in the liquid
condition in order to arrive at their heat of dissolution in the
gaseous condition.      Water, benzene, and acetic acid were
taken as solvents.       The various results will be found in
Table I. Three determinations were made consecutively in
the same quantity of solvent, so as to obtain the values for the
formation of solutions of three different strengths.     The rise

                 Dissolution  of Gases in Liquids.              37
    By plotting the results against percentage-composition and
drawing a curve through      #. I     have obtained the value for
the heat of dissolution of a gram-molecular proportion of the
substance   in 22,400 cub. centim. (gas strength)   of the solvent
(1244 H2O, 396 C, H, O, or 245 C.H.), and also of the heat
of dissolution in an infinite amount of the solvent. In some
cases these values can be but approximately correct, for the
heat of dissolution often increases very quickly with the dilu
tion and renders extrapolation uncertain.         In three cases,
  yridine and carbon disulphide in acetic acid, and ether in
   nzene, there is no sensible alteration in the value with
dilution; in every other it occurs in the above-named direc
tion, whether the heat of dissolution is positive or negative,
and is particularly large in the case of alcohol in benzene:
a fact which is in harmony with the rapid increase of the
molecular depression of the freezing-points of benzene by
alcohol as the dilution increases (Phil. Mag. xxxiii. p. 449,
A B, fig. 2, and p. 461), since both these phenomena point
to the existence of alcohol aggregates in comparatively strong
solutions, and the breaking up of these on further dilution.
               I
In Table II. have collected the values for the heat of disso
lution of the liquids in infinity of solvent, and also that of the
corresponding gases in 22.4 litres of solvent, the heat of
vaporization at 18° being also given here. This latter is not
known very accurately in many cases, and in that of the
   ridine is not known at all.
                                   .
   This Table shows at a glance that, whatever gaseous sub
stance or solvent we take, a considerable amount of heat is
evolved during the dissolution, from 5000 to 10,000 cal., and,
therefore, that there is a disappearance of a considerable
amount   of potential energy,   so      we can but conclude that
combination in some form or        another,  whether chemical or
otherwise, must have occurred.
                                                        §.
   Further, just as in the case of every known instance of
chemical combination, the amount of heat evolved is not con
ditioned by the nature of one of the reagents only, but by
that of both of them, so, here, the heat evolved by
different gases in the same solvent is very different, showing
a variation of as much as 6000 cal.; while the dissolution of
the same substance in different solvents gives as great a      di
versity of values, the variation in this case also amounting to
some 6000 cal.     Nor does there even appear to be any relation
ship in the differences; for the differences between the values
for the various substances are not the same in the case of the
three solvents, as will be seen from the columns headed “Diff.”
in Table II.      The only general conclusion which can be

38               Heat of Dissolution of Gases in Liquids.
drawn from the comparative magnitude of the various values
is one which is decidedly in favour of the existence of chemical
compounds in solution, namely, that more heat is evolved in
every case here investigated by the dissolution of a substance
in water than in the other two solvents examined, this being
very significant in view of the fact that water undoubtedly has
a much greater tendency to form definite molecular compounds
than either acetic acid or benzene.     It is scarcely necessary
 to mention that pyridine in acetic acid is not an instance of
 dissolution strictly comparable with the others, since the
 pyridine acetate which is formed is a compound of a different
order of stability from the hydrates or analogous compounds
 which, I believe, are present in solutions.
    We have thus most of the main characteristics of chemical
 combination attending the dissolution of gases in liquids—a
 selective attraction, a considerable evolution of heat, and an
action which is more energetic in the very case where che
mical combination is known to occur more readily ; and all
that is wanted to convert this evidence of the truly chemical
nature of the action into proof, is to find that the combination
which does occur, occurs in definite molecular proportions.
This last proof I have already obtained. Series of different
strengths of            all
                      the solutions here dealt with have been
examined        as their freezing-points, and
                     to                              nearly every case      in
changes     ofcurvature, some          them  very  marked,

   The first point of Dr. Walker's criticism deals with my
results with the freezing-points of sulphuric acid and other
substances: his conclusions, however, are based on a con
fusion between two very different forms of experimental
error—(1) the deviation of the values from the absolute truth,
and (2) the relative error of the consecutive determination of
a single series performed under strictly identical circum
stances, on which latter the existence of changes of curvature
must of course be based.                                  I
                               As have recently dealt at length
with these determinations (Ber. der deutsch. chem. Gesell. xxv.
p. 1099), I need not say more about them here beyond men
tioning that although Arrhenius's calculated values agree very
                                                                                                              of 4°,

they     do
          not        do
                    even for this short range within the limits
                          so
experimental error, and                      by
                                   means, therefore, disprove the

existence      changes

                           curvature.
   Dr. Walker’s objections            my conclusions  to         the                           as       to

                             Dissolution        of Gases in Liquids.                               43
substances, and, when pure, they exhibit perfectly constant
freezing-points which are depressed by the addition of the dis
solved substance ; and, till some argument to the contrary is
                        I
forthcoming, must maintain that i am perfectly justified in
talking of them as solvents, and in talking of the depression
of their freezing-points.   I certainly join issue with Dr. Walker
in his opinion   that the crystallization   of a substance from a
liquid does not prove the existence of some molecules of that
substance in the liquid (see Chem. Soc. Trans. 1890, p. 340,
where various reasons against this view, none of which Dr.
Walker discusses, are given), although the number of these
which are present may be insufficient to be recognized by the
methods at our disposal, especially in a case such as that of
racemic acid to which he alludes, where only a comparatively
weak solution can be investigated.        If racemic acid could be
fused, and if it was then found that the liquid gave none of
the reactions of racemic acid, then Dr. Walker's argument,
though, perhaps, not conclusive, would have some weight. The
other instance, of ammonium chloride, which he quotes in
support of the view that a solid may be obtained from a fluid
in which none of the molecules of the former exist, is equally
unfortunate, for if Dr. Walker had glanced at the values for
the vapour-density     of this substance given by Deville and
Troost, and by Neuberg, he would have seen that there must
be a very large number of undissociated ammonium-chloride
molecules in the vapour even at temperatures considerably
above that of                  its
                      vaporization.    Dr. Walker must entirely
ignore the positive evidence           the existenceas    the liquid

published after my own, gave Dr. Walker                  very good                 a
opportunity       answering them. My objections were,
                        of                                                                             of

possible to deny the existence of dissociation on the score of
the energy changes evolved; for whatever may be the thermal
changes actually accompanying dissolution, it is impossible to
say that they are inconsistent with the view that a decom
position into atoms has taken place, since we may bring in
the heat of combination of these atoms with the solvent to
counterbalance the heat absorbed by the decomposition of
the dissolving molecules, and, however improbable such an
explanation may appear, we cannot say that is impossible so
long as         all
              the quantities concerned are unknown.                                       It       is,   as
van der Waals points out, only the difference between these
quantities, and not the real heat            dissociation of     the mole           of
cules, which Arrhenius measured                the work referred                                   to    by

                      :    in                 the time was basing his
results         on
               the  very    grounds     against     which my criticism
was directed—the absence of action between the solvent and
dissolved substance.
   Dr. Walker then declares that               am misrepresenting the
views      of
            the dissociationists when                     I I

           be             repelling each other.

true, but   I         do
                  not see how the expressions which they use can
be  interpreted         any other sense.

incapable         of

an ordinary atom and             ion, we are told,

possesses “enormous electrical charges.”                Therefore,      the                    in
absence         of
             any other assigned cause, we can but conclude that
these charges are the supposed cause                the difference  of  the                    in
behaviour             of
                 these ions and        ordinary    atoms,    and that the
union which         possible when we are dealing with ordinary

charged.
   Dr. Walker informs                      us
                                 that the positively and negatively

into the action of the different forms of energy upon silver
chloride and bromidef.         It was there shown that these
substances   possessed  an equilibrium so singularly balanced as
to be affected by the slightest action of any form of energy.
Such action produced a change which, though it might be
wholly invisible, yet caused the breaking up of the haloid
when subsequently placed in contact with a reducing agent.
The forms of energy with which this effect was observed
are—-
   1st. Heat.
     2nd. Light.
     3rd. Mechanical force.
     4th. Electricity (high tension spark).
     5th. Chemism.
     Itfollows, therefore, that it is not light only that is capable
of   producing   an invisible image, but that this power belongs

   Silver bromide gave exactly the same results. It should
be mentioned that the silver chloride and bromide were each
precipitated with an excess of the corresponding acid.
   As silver iodide precipitated with excess of potassium iodide
is not darkened by light it seemed improbable that it should
be by pressure.    The experiment was, however, tried, and it
was found that the iodide darkened fully to the same extent
as the others.     This result surprised me so much that the
experiment was repeated with every possible precaution.     The
result left no doubt that silver iodide, as well as the chloride
and bromide, is blackened by great pressure. All three silver
haloids take on the same coloration—an intense greenish
black.    It was found best to use the material air-dried.                                    If

of heat thus generated has anything to do with the reaction.
The heat is not perceptible, it is momentary; and it has been
elsewhere shown that though moist silver chloride can be
broken up by heat, the action is slow even at a temperature
of 100° C.
   In the case of simple pressure, heat certainly plays no part.
The material is small in quantity, is folded up in metal, is
placed between large and heavy pieces of metal, and the pres
sure is applied gradually by means of a screw.       Even sup
posing a slight increase of temperature, it could not exceed
one or two degrees and would be momentary.              As just
remarked, heat does not produce an effect except at about
100° C. and after many hours.
   The powerful affinity which exists between silver and the
halogens is well known.    That this affinity can be counteracted
and annulled by simple pressure—that the halogen can in part
be forced out of the molecule by mechanical means unaided
by heat—is remarkable.
   It need scarcely be said that this phenomenon has nothing
in common with decompositions produced by mechanical force

in substances such as silver or mercury fulminate, nitrogen
chloride, and similar explosives.              substances are all
formed by endothermic reactions, and their decompositions
are exothermic.    Heat does not need to be supplied, but only
what Berthelot has named a “travail préliminaire,” an impulse
to start the reaction.   But silver haloids are formed by exo
thermic   reactions;   consequently   their decompositions are
endothermic, and require that the energy which was disen
gaged in their formation should be returned to effect their
decomposition. The experiments described in this paper show
that mechanical force may be made to supply this energy,
and so play the part of light, electricity, or heat, without
previous conversion into any other form of energy.

                                                             have
been studied  by  Berthelot, and their reductions were found
to be endothermic". There can be no doubt, therefore, that
an endothermic reaction can be brought about by simple
pressure.

 I should like to lay some few remarks upon the subject of the
 probabilities of molecular configurations before the readers of
 the Philosophical Magazine.
   Let us imagine a volume V divided into n equal parts or
“elements,” and suppose in that volume N points to be con
tained.    These points may represent ordinary material mole
cules for the sake of investigating the distribution of density
in a fluid medium, phenomena of diffusion, and some further
cases of material equilibrium; in other problems, however,
the points may be taken to represent anything else. They
may mean elementary chemical atoms in discussing dissocia

drawn from a fixed point so as to represent the speeds of
various molecules at a given time (in order to investigate the
distribution of velocities in a crowd of molecules);     again,                                        or,

 the value of the number of lines of induction                                                 will then
 represent the effect very well.    But the current                                             is not in
 general a simple sine curve, and so we must write
     9 = a, sin (bt+el) +          as    sin (2 bt+es)+                 as      sin (3   bt   +es)+.
     Inthis case it is much more difficult to express the hysteresis
 empirically.    In most cases the first term in the value of y is
the  largest.    A term of the same nature as before will, in
this case, suffice to express the hysteresis approximately.
We can then write for the total flux of magnetic induction,
                p=A    cos   (bt+e) + Bny + Cnº/*-i-8m'y'--&c.
 Problem 1.--To find the electromotive force necessary to
make the electric current a sine curve in a transformer without
secondary. Let the resistance be                              R, and make y=c sin (bt).
Then Maxwell's equation becomes
                                             -               dp
     Substituting the value of y we have
E= (Re-H Abn)          sin (bt)+Bnch cos (bt)                  +3 Cn”            sin” (bt)     cosbt+&c.
     But
            Sin
                               Fº            bt-cos
                   “bt cos   bt                               3    bt),
            Sin “bt cos bt=1's           (cos 5 bt–3           cos 3 bt+2 cos bt),
            Sin "bt cos bt=&c.
   Hence the electromotive force that must be given to the
circuit must contain not only the frequency of the current
but also frequencies of 3, 5, 7, &c. times as many. In other
words, the odd harmonics.
  Problem 2.—Transformer without secondary, the electro
motive force being a sine curve.
                         -              dp
                     E sin bt=Ry +n #.
                 be noted that when we place in this equation
     First it is to
the  general  value of y and make the coefficients of like
functions, of bt zero,            all
                          the even harmonics will strike out.
  Hence the value             of
                        the electric current will be
      y=a, sin (bt+el)+                 as   sin   (3   bt   +es)+a; sin (bt+ ex)+.
Substituting this value       the value for

                i.
      A simple harmonic current through an iron transformer
     1.
will produce   a secondary electromotive force and current, or
both, which contain not only the fundamental period but the
higher odd harmonics.
   2. This effect is not due to hysteresis, but to the variation
in the magnetic permeability.               -
   3. The             increase with the increase in magnetiza
tion of the iron and nearly vanish as the magnetization
decreases, although it is doubtful if they ever quite vanish.
Hence, an increase of resistance will decrease the harmonics.
   4. In the method of introducing the hysteresis into the
equations, it enters as an addition to the resistance in the
term Rai + Amb, where R is the resistance, a the maximum
current, A the coefficient of hystersis, which is dependent
upon the amount of magnetization of the iron, n the number
of turns of wire, and            b- 2T
                                     T is 2it      divided     by the time of a
complete period.
   The introduction of the hysteresis into the ordinary
equations, therefore, presents little or no difficulty.
   Many observers have noted that the current curve in a
transformer was not a sine curve and Prof. Ayrton has shown
the presence of the odd harmonics, but gives no explanation.
Mr. Fleming has attributed them to hysteresis, but I believe
the present paper gives the first true explanation.
   Problem 3.—To find the work of hysteresis.           Let the
resistance, R, be zero.     The work done will then be the
integral of the current times the electromotive force, or

 IT flowis well known that while Sir G. Stokes's       theory   of viscous
              gives a completely satisfactory account of what is
 observed in the case of capillary tubes, no                   at present
 exists to    explain    the   complete    change  in the laws of flow
 which supervenes when the tubes are of larger diameter and
 the velocities not very small.          Prof. Osborne Reynoldst has
 applied the theory of                      similarity to this question,
 and has shown both        by  theory   and experiment that the change
 in the law of resistance occurs when cow/u has a certain value,
 where c is a linear parameter such as the diameter of the tube,
 w is the velocity, u the coefficient of friction, and p the
 density.     The conclusion is perhaps most easily reached by
 applying the method of dimensions to the expression for the
  ratio (P) of the difference of pressures at two points along
  the length of the tube to the distance between the points.
  The dimensions of this ratio are those of a force divided by a
  volume ; and if we assume that it may be expressed in terms
  of v<U+017F> (equal to a<U+017F>p), c, p, and w in the form

that (at an earlier date") I attempted an investigation of the
stability of stratified flow in two dimensions, fully expecting
to find it unstable.    The result, however, was to show that in
the absence of   viscosity the stratified flow between two parallel
walls was not unstable, provided that the law of flow were
such that the curve representing the velocities in the various
strata was of one curvature throughout, a condition satisfied
in the case in question. To be more precise, it was proved
that if the deviation from the regularly stratified motion were,
as a function of the time, proportional to e”, then n could
have no imaginary part.
   On the other hand, if the condition as to the curvature of
the velocity curve be violated, n may acquire an imaginary
part, and the resulting disturbance of the steady motion is
exponentially unstable, as was shown by several examples in
the paper referred       and       to,

62               Lord Rayleigh on the Question of
motion there is a finite slip at the walls, and this is inconsistent
with even the smallest viscosity.          And, further, there are
kindred problems relating to the behaviour of a viscous fluid
in contact with fixed walls for which it can actually be proved”
that certain features of the motion which could not enter into
the solutions were the viscosity ignored from the first are
nevertheless independent of the magnitude of the viscosity,
and therefore not to be eliminated by supposing the viscosity
to be infinitely small.    Another case that may be instanced is
that of a large stream of viscous fluid flowing past a spherical
obstacle. As Sir G. Stokes has shown, the steady motion is
the same whatever be the degree of viscosity; and yet it is
entirely different from the flow of an inviscid fluid in which
no rotation can be generated.          Considerations such as this
raise doubts as to the interpretation of much that has been
written on the subject of the motion of inviscid fluids in
the neighbourhood of solid obstacles.
   The principal object of the present communication is to
test the first of the two latter suggestions.         It will appear
that, as in the case of motion between parallel plane walls, so
also for the case of a tube of circular section, no disturbance
 º
of the steady motion is exponentially unstable, provided vis
cosity be altogether ignored.
   Referring the motion to cylindrical coordinates 2, r, 6,
          to which the component velocities are w, u, v, we
 have

   These are the general equations.         In order to apply them
to the present problem of small disturbances from a steady
motion represented by
                       u-0,    v=0, was W,
where W is a function of r only, we will regard the complete
motion as expressed by u, v, W.H. w, and neglect the squares
of the small quantities u, v, w, which express the disturbance.

  The difficulty in reconciling calculation and experiment is
accordingly not to be explained by any peculiarity of the two
dimensional motion to which calculation was first applied.
It   may indeed be argued that the instabilities excluded are
only those of the exponential type, and that there may remain
others on the borderland of the form t cos t, &c.            But if
the above calculations are really applicable to the limitin

into one distinctly stable, and if so the difficulty remains.

ments are not worth much ; but the impression upon my
mind is that the motions calculated above for an absolutely
inviscid liquid may be found inapplicable to a viscid liquid
of vanishing viscosity, and that a more complete treatment
might even yet indicate instability, perhaps of a local cha
racter, in the immediate neighbourhood of                  i.

viscosity is very small.
    It is on the basis of such a complete treatment, in which
the terms representing viscosity in the general equations are
retained, that Lord Relvin             t
                                  arrives at the conclusion that
the flow of viscous fluid between two parallel walls is fully
stable for infinitesimal disturbances, however small the amount
of the viscosity may be. Naturally, it is with diffidence that
I  hesitate to follow so great an authority, but     must confessI
that the argument does not appear to me demonstrative.          No
attempt is made to determine whether in free disturbances of

finite, and if so whether it is positive or negative.                         If I

validity.     Here attention will be directed only to the stress
difference and greatest-strain       theories".
    In   applying    these theories we may confine our attention
in the first place to the first approximation.                 Doing so, it
may be proved by somewhat laborious analysis, omitted here
as in itself of no interest, that the greatest values both of the
stress-difference and greatest strain occur at the centre of the
disk.      They are respectively         the   values of    <U+017F>º and    *  for
r=y=0.          Denoting the maximum stress-difference and great
est strain   by   S and s respectively, we find
        S=oºpa” K,      .   .  .   .  .    .   .   .  .   .  .   .  .  (23)

where K is given by (20).
     § 7. We may attach to the limiting speed at least two
different values. Taking, for instance, the stress-difference
theory, and measuring          "...     in tons weight and length in
F.
inches, we may regard S as the greatest longitudinal traction
in tons weight per square inch under which the material in
 question, in the form of a bar, satisfies Hooke's law “stress
                   to strain * with sufficient exactness for the
   egitimate application of the mathematical theory.               We may,
 however, regard S as the number of tons weight per sq.
 inch which engineers consider the safe working limit in the
 material, provided this be taken sufficiently low to satisfy the
 linearity of the stress-strain relations.              The former view
 would unquestionably be theoretically the more satisfactory
 if experiment showed a distinct point in stress-strain diagrams
  where Hooke's law ceases to hold.              Even, however, if such a
  point did exist when the load on the bar was gradually raised
 in a particular way, it might be rash to assume that the same
 definite point would present itself in the material of a rotating
  cylinder whose speed was being gradually increased.
     An objection to the second view is the wholly arbitrary
  nature of the limit it assigns to S, and the fact that the safe
  load varies with the engineer, and is likewise an unknown
  function of the contingencies to which he surmises the parti
  cular structure may be exposed.                It thus appears best to
  present the results in such a way that a reader may attach his
  own values to S or s, and may have a minimum of trouble in
  deducing numerical results.

that in a disk of given material" and eccentricity S and s both
vary as (oa)*.    Thus oa is a more convenient quantity to

venient to suppose that the major axis has in         the same                                               all

    § 10.   For  a comparison of the results of the stress-differ
ence and     greatest-strain-theories   we have only to remember
that S = Es. We thus see that the limiting speeds allowed
by the two theories are the same when either m=0 or b/a =0,
                                            i.
and that in any other case the limiting speed allowed by the
greatest-strain theory is the greater.              difference between
the two theories is the more conspicuous the larger the values
of   m and b/a.      For values of b/a other than 0 the limiting
speed     according to the stress-difference theory falls as m
increases, whereas according to the greatest-strain theory it
increases with m.          It is also noteworthy that while the
limiting speed on the stress-difference theory falls as b/a
increases, there is on the greatest-strain theory, unless m =0,
a value     of b/a less than 1 for which the limiting speed is a
minimum. This critical value of b/a is less the greater the
value of 7.
    § 11. A considerable amount of caution must be observed
 in applying the results of the tables to disks in which b/a is
very small. For, in the first place, no point in such a disk is
very far from the rim, where the accuracy of our results is
 somewhat doubtful : and, in the second place, if the velocity in
 such a disk were to alter, there would arise at every point a
 reversed effective force proportional to the rate of change of
 the velocity, directed approximately at right angles to the
 major axis, and there would be a tendency for the elongated
 disk to snap in two, just as if it were exposed to flexure in a
 plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation.
    § 12. When the rim is so nearly circular that we may
 neglect the fourth power of the eccentricity e, we find from
 (23) and (24)

         s= oºpa” (3+m) (1—m) {1+eºm/(1-m)}+8E.                 .  (26)
 Thus when      e" is negligible the maximum stress-difference is
 the same as in a circular disk whose diameter equals the
 major axis. Also, since m/(1-m) cannot exceed 1, the greatest
 strain, though greater than that in the circular disk, cannot
 stand to it in a greater ratio than 1+ e”: 1. Thus, according
 to either theory, the limiting speed is but little, affected by
 the substitution for a truly circular form of a slightly ellip
 tical.    This constitutes a strong a priori probability that any
 slight want of uniformity in the length of a disk’s radius,
 which does not remove the centre of gravity from the axis
 of rotation, nor involve any sudden discontinuity in the

where R is the radius of curvature at the centre of a face
of a circular disk of the same thickness and material as the
actual disk rotating with the same angular velocity.         It is a
well-known theorem in Solid Geometry that the sum of the
curvatures at a point on a surface in any two orthogonal normal
planes equals the sum of the                             We may
                                  principal curvatures.
thus fairly call (R, +R.T.')/2 the mean curvature, and
embody (37) in the following law :        The mean curvature pro
duced by rotation at the centre of the faces of an elliptic disk
depends solely on the material, thickness, and angular velocity
of the disk, being entirely independent of the area or eccen
tricity of the faces.
      16. If a small area at the centre of a face of the disk were
polished, the image of a luminous point seen by reflexion
from this area would be disturbed by rotation in consequence
of the curvature developed. With an elliptic disk the optical
effect would be of a somewhat complicated character, and
there might be a difficulty in finding any definite quantity to
measure, or in interpreting such measurements as could be
made.     With a circular disk, however, it seems not unreason
able to suppose that measurements might be taken from
which the curvature might be deduced.
    In attempting this experiment it would be desirable to
employ rapid rotation, so as to produce as large a curvature
as possible.     At the same time care must be taken that the
rotation is kept within the limits prescribed by the linearity
of the stress-strain relations, otherwise it would be erroneous
to apply the formulae.       I  thus proceed to obtain formulae
connecting the mean curvature at the centre of a face of a
disk with the maximum stress-difference S and greatest strain
5.   Attributing  to S and s in these formulae the limiting
values consistent with the linearity of the stress-strain rela
tions in the material of the             ".
                                         we deduce the largest
curvatures it would be    possible to produce   by rotation suffi
ciently slow for the legitimate application of our formulae.

    The blanks signify that for the corresponding values of m and
    b/a the curves do not pass through the centre of the disk.
       The curve of no radial displacement lies between the
    tangents at the centre when that is a double point on the
    curve.          Within the disk, however, it departs but little from
    these  tangents, so that the portion of the disk wherein the
    distance of elements from the axis of rotation is reduced is
    never, comparatively

        § 25. The variations in the nature of the curve of no
    radial strain are most conveniently traced by supposing b/a to
    increase from 0.        Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 show the several
    types of the curve for the value 25 of m.                 The same types
    occur with other finite values of m, the only difference being in
     the critical values of b/a.      The curve is of course symmetrical
     about both axes of the       eilipse,  so we need consider            form                           its

 finite values of b/a.   The curve crosses the rim at but a small
 distance from the end of the major axis, and recrosses it at a
 point whose angular distance from the end of the minor axis
 is not very small.       The curve passes through the centre
 cutting the minor axis at a finite angle.          Thus, at finite
 distances from the centre, there is radial compression every
 where in the neighbourhood of the minor axis. This second
area of radial compression is much more considerable than
 that at the end of the major axis; but the two areas together
are a good deal smaller than the area throughout which the
 radial strain is an extension.    This type of curve is illustrated
by fig. 1, which answers to b/a = 4, m-:25.

    As  b/a increases the area   of radial compression at the end
of the major axis expands both in length and thickness. The
angular distance from the minor axis where the curve re
crosses the rim also increases, but the angle at which the
curve cuts the minor axis at the centre diminishes.              This
latter angle eventually vanishes when b/a reaches the value
bº<U+017F>a of Table VI., and we get the type shown in fig. 2, which
answers to b/a = 5, 7="25,

    As b/a further increases the points in which the curve cuts
the rim continually approach one another, and the point in
which it cuts the minor axis recedes from the centre. In this
stage we have the constricted type shown in fig. 3, which
answers to b/a = 6, m = 25.

    § 30. The terms of order 2* in (14) and (15) indicate that
for a given value of a, y the radial displacement and strain are
always algebraically greatest when 2 =0. Thus the natural
influence of rotation in repelling the material from the axis is
most felt in the central plane and least in the faces of the disk.
The magnitude of the difference is best brought out by
reference to the curvature in lines originally parallel to the
axis of rotation. Before, however, entering on details it is
desirable to consider briefly the reliability of the results, as
they depend on terms in 2 and 8 of order                                     2*.

 This vanishes of course in a circular disk for all values of m

Comparing (73) with (38) and (37), we find between the
curvature in a generator of the rim and that at the centre of
a face of a circular disk the simple relation

Thus in a thin     disk the curvature produced by rotation in a
rim generator      is much greater than that produced at the
centre of the     faces.     The curvature in the rim generator
might perhaps     be measured by an optical method, at least in
a circular disk.

   Now, having defined quantitatively the different varieties
of dichromic colour-impressions, we ought to be able to repre
sent them in graphic form ; and this is another point in
my original paper required supplementing.      Professor Clerk
Maxwell, who was kind enough to take much interest in my
case, pointed this out to me, referring me to the explanation
he had given on the subject in the Phil. Trans. for 1860.
The system he there laid down, founded on Newton’s law
for colour mixtures, has since become well known to earnest
students.                      an equilateral triangle is drawn,
                      For normal vision
and on    three its
                 angles are  supposed         located the three         to   be
                                                                                                             all by
fundamental colour-sensations—red,      green, and violet,
combinations      which, according
                         of               Young's theory,           to
hues are formed.    Then   every  possible  hue will       repre                               be

                                                    dichromic vision has
never   yet  received  proper    attention.     Maxwell,          his fig. 11,           in
gave        an
            example, the object           which was    of      compare              to                       di
chromic with trichromic vision, and for which, therefore,                                                    he
used the normal triangle.          But,       show simply the pheno

  Then, finally, there was another                                incompleteness     in my
paper, pointed out by Sir John Herschel.   He was pleased to
say, in a letter to me dated 14th November, 1856, that he
“ thought my paper had exhausted the part of the subject
referring to absorptive or negative colour (that with which
painters and dyers were conversant),” but he recommended
that  I should follow up the communication with another,
giving more attention to the prismatic phenomena, which he
termed positive colour.    Soon after this, Professor Clerk
Maxwell undertook        to make with me the necessary experi
ments on the prismatic colours, by the aid of the colour-box
described in his paper of 1860.            ey made some progress,
but were     unfortunately     never  completed.     Since that time
several observations on dichromic vision with spectral colours
have been published.        They agree in general character, but
fully confirm the tendency to variability in the quantitative
details.    It will suffice here to give a general description of
the  appearance    of the spectrum, according to my vision, with
the view of     showing         analogy its  my colour-impressions

side, beginning with the left-hand or yellow division. Pro
                                   i.
ceeding from the neutral point towards b, the sensation of the
yellow colour immediately comes in, but at first very faint.
and pale, being much diluted with white; but as we go
further the saturation gradually increases until, beyond É,
the colour becomes a              resplendent fully-saturated
yellow.             -
   This continues for some distance, until, somewhat beyond
D, the strength of the colour begins to fall off again. But
the change now is of a nature different from that already
described in coming from the neutral point.       There is here
no dilution with white, the saturation remains full and con
stant, the change being a diminution of luminosity only.
This diminution increases gradually, giving an appearance
like that of the shading of a round column in an engraving,
and it increases in darkness till the visible spectrum ends.
But the saturation of the colour is fully maintained the whole
way, and some good authorities contend that it even increases
towards the end *. This fact is very important, for the high
saturation of the dark yellow at the end of the spectrum
gives   sonovel an effect as often to lead dichromic patients to
believe  they  really see a third colour there, and so to give an
erroneous account of their vision.       This error was fallen into
by no less a person than John Dalton, and it was the cause
of the long delay in the general acceptance of Herschel's
dichromic explanation.

my case; Sir           Herschel, who had expected         shortening,   a

firmed his statement.

described.     Starting from the neutral point, the blue colour
enters,       first much diluted with white, but gradually

strengthening till        becomes brilliant and fully saturated

    In   order, now, to show the connexion between                     these
appearances and those of the pigmental colours, it is necessary
to state how the spectrum appearances are explained.                     For
this   purpose          I
                     have added the       diagram,    fig.  5,  of the two
colour sensations in the manner shown by Clerk Maxwell in
his            of 1860. The ordinates of the curves * give a
         ..".
general idea of the variations of the luminous strength of the
sensations at the various points of the wave-length.                 Begin
ning at the left-hand end of the figure, the yellow curve near
its origin has small ordinate, and consequently the colour
                        a

                   is       But further                          on
                                                the luminosity rapidly
increases till      arrives
                    it          its maximum. at    This series of colour
impressions, therefore, exactly corresponds                 the pigmental           to

 begins        descend,

 the wave-lengths which excite the other                 blue curve; and        or
 beyond this we have both the yellow and blue acting together.
 The effect        of
                  this mixture            make white, and
                                                       is   to        dilute                      so   to
 the yellow colour, and

 the two colours becomes equilibrated, when the yellow dis
 appears and we get the neutral hue.
      In                                                                        we

        ANY     people who constantly use the mercury-pump of
           Sprengel, or other forms of pumps in which a vacuum
 is produced by the fall of mercury, must have felt that it
 would be a considerable help in their work if the mercury
 which falls in working the pump could be returned at once
 to the cistern at the top of the instrument without any
 personal attention, so that the process of exhaustion might
 go on without interruption for days together if necessary.
 The instrument which

 I  described a water-engine, whereby mercury was raised for
 driving a pump used for exhausting glow-lamps.                     This
 arrangement was satisfactory but costly, and required careful
adjustment.        The instrument about to be described produces
 the same    results,  while it can be easily made up from appa
ratus in      daily   use in every laboratory.          The idea of a
Sprengel pump completely reversed both in position and
action, first suggested to me the possibility of making this
instrument.
    The mercury elevator is nothing more than a Sprengel
pump, inverted, and worked backwards.                Where a vacuum
is formed under         ordinary    circumstances,     air is forced in,
and instead of little cylinders of mercury falling they are
raised.
    The construction is shown in the appended diagram,
where A is the cistern of the Sprengel or other mercurial
pump ; , B C D, a tube furnished with a side tube at C, and
attached at D to the catcher of the Sprengel pump E.                  By
means of the      pinch-cock    F, the   supply  of  compressed    air is
controlled.      The air may be compressed either by an ordinary
condensing pump driven by any prime mover, or by the
following arrangement, which may be used where there is a
supply of water at a sufficient pressure.
   G is an ordinary water-pump. When water under pres
sure enters at L, air is drawn in at G, and is discharged at
K into a copper cylinder H.; here the air and water separate;

method adopted for drying this exceedingly hygroscopic gas
was probably not sufficient to insure absolute freedom from
moisture.
   The apparatus which was used in these investigations was
as  follows:–                                        -
   To two of the branches of a three-way tube were attached
respectively a Kipps' apparatus for the production of carbon
dioxide, and a flask in which was generated the hydrochloric
acid (the hydrochloric acid being made either from concen
               i.
trated sulphuric acid and sodium chloride or by dropping
concentrated sulphuric acid into a saturated solution of
hydrochloric acid in water). The current of gas was regu

                  filled with copper turnings to remove any
                might     be present, next through four straight
tubes containing small lumps of pumice moistened with
concentrated sulphuric acid previously boiled, each of which
                º
tubes was about a foot in length, then it passed through two
   É.
tubes containing pumice and phosphorus pentoxide, of lengths
respectively 6         18 inches.
            the gas was led through a series of four pentoxide
bulbs, to which was attached the experimental tube contained
in an air-bath, beyond which was placed a drying-tube of
calcium chloride ; the issuing gas was passed into a wash
bottle containing sodium hydrate.
   The method of experiment was this:—
   Carbon dioxide having been passed through the apparatus
for a sufficient length of time to remove the air, the
experimental tube, being maintained at a temperature of
about 130° Centigrade, was sealed and weighed.
   The tube was replaced, the ends were cut off, and a stream
 of hydrochloric-acid gas was passed through for about an
hour ; the current of hydrochloric-acid gas was then stopped
and carbon dioxide was driven through to remove the hydro
chloric acid. It was, however, found so difficult to remove
the hydrochloric acid from the sulphuric-acid drying-tubes,
that these were replaced by a series of calcium-chloride tubes,
with the result that in a short time -   the last traces of hydro
chloric acid were removed.
   The tube was again sealed, it having been raised to a
temperature of about 130°Centigrade before sealing.         It was
then weighed together with the ends previously cut off.

        Dried Hydrochloric-Acid Gas on Iceland Spar.       119
   Experiments were undertaken at the temperature of the
laboratory and at about 100° Centigrade.
   The weight of the leeland spar taken in an experiment
conducted at the temperature of the laboratory was
                           '8705 gram.
   The weight after the passage of the hydrochloric-acid gas
Was                        ‘8712 gram.
   The difference shows an increase of weight equal to
                          -0007 gram,
or a percentage increase of .08.
   Another experiment, conducted at the temperature of
95°–110° Centigrade, gave the following results:—
   The weight of Iceland spar taken . . . . . . = 6.196 gram.
              i.
   The weight after passage of hydrochloric
         acid      - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - = 62025,
      which shows an increase . . . . . . . . = .00065,
      or a percentage increase . . . . . . . . = 1
   The theoretical increase is 29 per cent.
   In order to compare our experiments with the dried gas
with the case in which the gas was not dry, the hydrochloric
acid before passing over the carbonate was caused to take up
moisture by passing through a tube in which moist glass
wool had been placed.         This showed a very considerable
action, and the numbers are as follows:—
   The weight of calcium carbonate taken . = 68735 gram.
   The weight of the carbonate after the
         passage of the hydrochloric-acid gas = -70735.
   The increase shown is . . . . . . . . . .      .02.
   Comparing this experiment with moist hydrochloric acid
with those in which the dried gas was used, we find that if
the action on the carbonate when moist hydrochloric-acid gas
was used be 100, then the action on the carbonate when dried
hydrochloric-acid gas was used becomes 2:66 and 3.
   If  a piece of dry blue litmus-paper was placed in the tube
through which the dried gas was passing, no change of colour
was observed ; but if the gas was allowed to take up a small
quantity of moisture, then an immediate change to a red
colour was noticed.
   Glacial acetic acid was shown by Marsh to have no action
on litmus, and Gore showed the same for the liquefied dried
hydrochloric acid.
   An experiment was undertaken on the action of dried
hydrochloric-acid gas on witherite at the temperature of the
laboratory.
   The conditions of the experiment were the same as those
under which the experiments with calcium carbonate were
made.

     The weight of barium carbonate (witherite) used was
                                              •9976.
     The weight after the passage of dried hydrochloric-acid                                         gas
Was                                           •9984,
which shows an increased weight of
                                              •0008,
or a percentage increase in weight of
                                              •08,
whereas the theoretical increase is 14.7 per cent.
   Thus the action of dried hydrochloric-acid gas on witherite
is nearly double the amount of         action          its
                                                    Iceland spar.        on
   The   specimen            of
                        witherite used was       fairly  pure, but                                       in
performing further experiments            the carbonate  on    barium                     of
the precipitated pure carbonate will            used. Incidentally  be
it was noticed that the dried gas had                             no
                                              action upon cellulose,
whereas    amoistened   filter-paper  placed      the current       the in                      of
gas became rapidly converted into            gum-like mass which

it produces (Chem. Journ. 1884, p. 38.)        It occurred to
me at once that the carbon of the marsh-gas is present, and
ought not to be neglected.  In fact it certainly has an illu
minating value, as #. been shown by P. Frankland himself,
who found it (l.c. p. 39) to have an illuminating-power of
several candles.                  I
                          cannot therefore think that the carbon in
the marsh-gas should be neglected.              we regard the carbon      If
in flame as   being    in a sense in solution in the hydrogen, until
it is precipitated    in the luminous form, it is clear that          the                               all
 carbon present must count.

   The author remarks that, besides the subaerial, fluviatile and
marine Drifts       the Southof      England, there of     another Drift                   is
which      yet unplaced.
           is               This      considers          he
                                                         connected with            to   be
the “Head” overlying the Raised Beaches.          Of these       describes                        he
the distribution, characters, and relations along the South Coast.
The “Head' overlies the beaches, and frequently overlaps them.
In  the beaches large boulders are found, and marine shells,        which                               of
lists for the various localities are   given.   The “Head'     frequently
shows rough stratification                     of finer and coarser materials.                        It    contains

         The Olenellus-Zone in the North-West Highlands.             131
 mammalian hones, land-shells only, and occasionally flint imple
ments.      On the coasts of Devon and Cornwall it is separated from
 the Raised Beaches by old sand-dunes.
    In South Wales the beach occurs below the mammaliferous cave
deposits, whilst material corresponding to the “Head' seals up the
cave-mouths.      The ossiferous breccias of the caves are therefore
intermediate    in age between the beaches and the “Head.’
   The origin of the boulders is discussed, and it is inferred that they
have been brought, not from the French coast, nor from a sub
merged land, but from a north-easterly source by floating ice
through the Straits of Dover.     The mollusca of the Raised Beaches,
of which a list of 64 is     given, are closely related to forms living
in the   neighbouring  seas.
   These Raised Beaches are not of the age of the Higher Valley
gravels; but the evidence (especially that yielded by the Somme
 Valley deposits) points rather to their connexion with the Lower
Walley-gravels, and therefore, with the exception of the Caves, they
represent the latest phase of the Glacial Period.
    2. “The Olenellus-Zone in the North-West Highlands.”              By
B. N. Peach, Esq., F.R.S.E., F.G.S., and J. Horne, Esq., F.R.S.E.,
F.G.S.
   In the stratigraphical portion of this paper brief descriptions are
given of certain sections in the Dundonnell Forest, from eight to ten
miles N.N.E. of Loch Maree, which have yielded fragments of
Olenellus.     The organisms are embedded         in dark blue shales
occurring near the top of the ‘Fucoid Beds' and towards the
base of the ‘Serpulite Grit, forming part of the belt of fossiliferous
strata stretching continuously from Loch Eriboll to Strome Ferry—
a distance of ninety miles.
   In the Dundonnell Forest the basal quartzites rest with a marked
unconformability on the Torridon Sandstone. There is an unbroken
sequence in certain sections from the base of the quartzites either
to the ‘Serpulite Grit' or to the lowest bands of the Durness Lime
stone.     At these  horizons the strata  are truncated   by a powerful
thrust, which, at Loch Nid, brings forward a slice of Archaean rocks
with the Torridon Sandstone and basal quartzite.
   The strata from the base of the quartzites to the base of the
Durness Limestone, exposed in the Dundonnell Forest, are compared
with their prolongations to the north and south of that region,
from which it appears that there is a remarkable persistence of
the various subzones identified in Assynt and at Loch Eriboll. But
between Little Loch Broom and Loch Kishorn dark blue shales
near the top of the ‘Fucoid Beds' have been observed at various
localities, evidently occupying the same horizon as the Olenellus
shales in the Dundonnell Forest.
   The serpulites (Salterella) associated with the trilobites in the
“Serpulite Grit’ occur in the

 stone; they were found during last      season in the brown dolomitic
 shales accompanying the Olenellus-shales in the ‘Fucoid Beds,' and
 they were formerly detected in the third subzone of the ‘pipe-rock’
 in Sutherland.      Their appearance on these horizons leads us to
 cherish the hope that portions of Olenellus may yet be met with in
 certain shales in the quartzites and probably in the lowest group of
 limestone.
    The evidence now adduced proves (1) that the ‘Fucoid Beds' and
 * Serpulite  Grit' are of Lower Cambrian age, the underlying
 quartzites forming the sandy base of the system; (2) that the
 Torridon Sandstone, which is everywhere separated from the over
 lying quartzites by a marked unconformability, is pre-Cambrian.
    The Olenellus which has been discovered is described as a new
species (0. Lapworthi) closely allied to 0. Thompsoni, Hall, from
 which it differs chiefly in the arrangement of the glabella-furrows
 and in the presence of a rudimentary mesial spine at the posterior
 margin of the carapace.        Remains of other species referable to
 Olenellus are   described,  but these are too fragmentary for exact
determination.      All are characterized by a reticulate ornamentation
similar to that described by Walcott in O. (Mesonacis) asaphoides,
Emmons.       The remains consist chiefly of portions of carapaces.

    1. “The Raised Beaches, and “Head,” or Rubble-Drift, of the
South of England: their Relation to the Valley-Drifts and to the
Glacial Period; and on a late Post-Glacial              Submergence.—
Part II.” By Joseph Prestwich, D.C.L., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    The ossiferous deposits of the Caves of Gower are shown to
be contemporaneous      with the raised sand-dunes between the beaches
and the    ‘head,  and reasons are given for supposing that the ele
vation of land which preceded their formation need not necessarily
have been greater than 120 feet. The mammalian fauna of these
caves is the last fauna of the Glacial or post-Glacial period, and
the ‘head' or Rubble-drift marks the closing chapter of Glacial
times.
    Evidence is given for considering that the “Rubble-drift'        has
a wide inland range, and that to it are to be referred the “Head”
of De la Beche, the Subaerial Détritus of Godwin-Austen, the
Angular flint drift of Murchison, and in part the trail” of Fisher
and the “warp' of Trimmer, as well as other deposits described by
the author.      The accumulation is widespread over the South of
England, and occurs in the Thames Valley, on the Cotteswold
Hills, and on the flanks of the Malverns.       The stream-tin détritus
of Cornwall and the ossiferous breccia filling fissures (which must
be distinguished from the ossiferous deposits of the true caves) are

 held to be representatives           of the “Rubble-drift,”   which      is of a
 variable character.
      The author         the views of previous writers on the origin
                   discusses
 of    the accumulationswhich he classes together as “Rubble-drift,'
and points out objections to the various views.       He considers that
they were formed on upheaval after a period of submergence
which took place slowly and tolerably uniformly ; and that the
absence of marine remains and sedimentation shows the sub
mergence to have been short.     This submergence cannot have been
less than 1000 feet below  present   sea-level, and was shortly brought
to a termination   by a series of intermittent uplifts, of which the
‘head' affords a    measure,  sufficiently rapid to produce currents
radiating from the higher parts of the country, causing the spread
of the surface-détritus from various local centres of higher ground.
The remains of the land animals killed during the submergence
were swept with this débris into the hollows and fissures on the
surface, and finally over the old cliffs to the sea- and valley-levels.
Simultaneously with this elevation occurred a marked change of
climate, and the temperature approached that of the present day.
The formation of the ‘head' was followed in immediate succession
by the accumulation of recent alluvial deposits; so that the Glacial
times came, geologically speaking, to within a measurable distance                    .
of our own times, the transition being short and almost abrupt.
   In this paper only the area in which the evidence is most
complete  is described.    The author has, however, corroborative
evidence of submergence on the other side of the Channel.

Equivalents    in other Districts.”  By Clement Reid, Esq., F.L.S.,
F.G.S.
   The gales of last autumn and early winter exposed sections such
as had not before been visible   in the Selsey Peninsula.      Numerous
large erratic blocks were discovered, sunk in pits in the Bracklesham
Beds.     These erratics included characteristic rocks from the Isle of
Wight. The gravel with erratics is older, not newer as is commonly
stated, than the Selsey “mud-deposit’        with southern mollusca.
Numerous re-deposited erratics are found in the mud-deposit, which
is divisible into two stages, a lower, purely marine, and an upper, or
Scrobicularia-mud, with acorns and estuarine shells.
   At West Wittering a fluviatile deposit, with erratics at          base its

   In the Hornchurch cutting of the new railway, Boulder Clay,
of which about 15 feet is seen, rests upon the London Clay near
the 100-feet contour-line, and is overlain by 10 to 12 feet of sand
and gravel.   The author gives reasons for inferring that this sand
and gravel belongs to the oldest terrace of the Thames Valley gravel
occurring in this district, and states that it demonstrates the truth
of Mr. Whitaker's conclusion that the Thames Valley deposits are
(locally) post-Glacial, or newer than the local Boulder Clay.
   2. “The Drift Beds of the North Wales and Mid-Wales Coast.”
By T. Mellard Reade, Esq., C.E., F.G.S.
   This paper is a continuation of papers by the author on the Drift
Beds of the N.W. of England and North Wales.            The author first
treats of the Moel Tryfaen and other Caernarvonshire drifts; he de
scribes the drifts of the coast and coastal plain, connecting his observa
tions with those of the Moel Tryfaen drifts. An important feature of
the investigation is the numerous mechanical analyses of the various
clays, sands, and gravels.      In           all
                                        the samples but one,      large pro         a

 By Edw. Wethered, Esq., F.G.S., F.C.S., F.R.M.S.
   Microscopic   examination of the Devonian Limestones of South
Devon shows that they have been built up by calcareous organisms,
 but that the outlines of the structure have for the most part become
obliterated by molecular changes, and the limestones are often ren
dered crystalline.    In connexion with this the author alludes to the
disturbances which have affected the limestones. He finds occasional
rhombohedra of dolomite, and discusses the probability of their deri
vation from magnesian silicates contained in the rocks.
   A description of the insoluble residues follows. The micas, the
author considers, may be of detrital origin, but this is by no means
certain : he is disposed to consider that the zircons, tourmaline, and
ordinary rutile were liberated by the decomposition of crystals in
which they were originally included.        Minute crystals, referred to
as “microlithic needles,' resemble    “clay-slate   needles,’ but are not
always straight: they occur in every fine residue, and as inclusions
in siliceous and micaceous flakes. The siliceous fragments which
enclose them frequently contain many liquid inclusions, which does
not necessarily imply any connexion between the two, though there
may possibly be some connexion.         Micro-crystals of quartz occur,
and have been derived from     decomposing   silicates.

the area; he then discusses the physical relations of the gold
bearing conglomerates and associated rocks in the Witwatersrandt

   He concludes that the gold-bearing conglomerates and the
quartzites and shales of the Witwatersrandt district (which have
undergone considerable metamorphism) form one series, of which
the base and summit are not seen ; that this series is much newer
than the gneisses and granites on the eroded edges of which they

  the fall is produced by the destruction of the barrier formed in this

     The following communications were read:—
     1. “On the so-called Gneiss of Carboniferous age at Guttannen
 (Canton Berne, Switzerland).”        By Prof. T. G. Bonney, D.Sc.,
 LL.D., F.R.S., W.P.G.S.
     It is stated by Dr. Heim (Quarterly Journal, vol. xlvi. p. 237)
 that the stems of Calamites have been found at Guttannen in a
 variety of gneiss, i. e. in one of a group of rocks which exactly
 “resemble true crystalline schists in mode of occurrence.         Petro
 graphically they are related to them by passage rocks; at least the
 line of separation is not easily distinguished. . . . The Palaeozoic
 formations mostly show an intimate tectonic relation to the crystal
 line schists, and have been converted petrographically into crystal
line schists.”
     The author describes the result of a visit to the section at Gut
 tannen in company with Mr.        J.  Eccles, F.G.S. (to whom he is
 greatly indebted for kind assistance), and of his subsequent study of
 the specimens then collected.     The belt of sericitic “phyllites and
 gneisses,” presumably of Carboniferous age, represented on the Swiss
 geological map (Blatt xiii.) as infolded, at and above Guttannen, in
 true crystalline gneissoid rocks, is found on examination to consist
 partly of true gneisses, partly of detrital rocks. The boulder from
 which the stems in the Berne Museum were obtained belongs to the
 latter.   These rocks sometimes present macroscopically, and occa
 sionally even microscopically, considerable resemblance to true
 gneisses, but this proves on careful examination to be illusory.
 They are, like the Torridon Sandstone of Scotland, or the Grès
feldspathique of Normandy, composed of the detritus of granitoid or
 gneissoid rock, which sometimes forms a mosaic resembling the
 original rock, and which has been generally more or less affected by
subsequent pressure and the usual secondary mineral changes. Thus,
 if the term be employed in the ordinary sense, they are no more
gneisses than the rocks of Carboniferous age at Vernayaz (Canton
 Valais) are micaschists, but in some cases the imitation is unusually
good, and, so far as the author saw, there are at Guttannen neither
conglomerates nor slates to betray the imposition, as happens at the
other locality.
    2. “On the Lithophyses in the Obsidian of the Rocche Rosse,
Lipari.”      By Prof. Grenville A. J. Cole, F.G.S., and Gerard
W. Butler, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
    The rock described in this paper differs in no essential particular
from that at Forgia Vecchia, or from the obsidian on the north flank

 Lithophyses in                  the   Obsidian        of the      Rocche      Rosse,    Lipari.   139
of Vulcano; but the specimens show in a specially striking manner
the passage through various stages of lithophysal structure, from indis
putable steam-vesicles with glassy walls to typical solid spherulites.
A full description is given of the formation of spherulites by a double
process—firstly, divergent growth from the margins of vesicles out
wards, and, secondly, convergent growth inwards from the margins
towards the centres of the hollows, until in the smallest cases the
fibres from the opposite sides of the vesicle may meet in the centre,
producing a spherulite, which, but for the occurrence of intermediate
stages, might be supposed to have originated entirely by divergent
growth. The authors give details of the appearances presented by
intermediate stages of growth.
   The prevailing type of spherulite, both in Lipari and Vulcano,
shows in section a dusky fibrous central area, which may possess con
centric as well as radial structure, surrounded by an irregular brown
cloudy zone of various width. The authors' studies lead them to
the conclusion that this type owes its characters to the dual mode of
growth, and therefore to the original presence of vesicles in the rock.
Commonly the process of infilling does not go so far as this: on the
ends of the felspar fibres plates of tridymite are deposited, and this
seems to close the growth.      It is clear that the lithophysal structure
of the  Lipari obsidians was formed during the cooling of the mass,
and not by subsequent amygdaloidal infilling of vesicles.
   The authors discuss the effect of confined vapours on such rocks
as those forming the subject of the paper, noting that these vapours
may be kept at a high temperature for a considerable time, each
vesicle thus becoming a sphere of hydrothermal action ; so that if
the surrounding glass remains at a temperature little below its
fusion-point, crystallization will be promoted in         and    the same          it,    at

              EXPERIMENTS          ON    ELECTROLYTIC POLARIZATION.
                                       BY L. ARONS.
     F  a cell containing dilute sulphuric acid through which a current
        is passed by means of platinized electrodes is divided into two
 halves by a partition of one of the noble metals platinum, gold, or
 silver, so that all the lines of flow must traverse the metal, an en
 feeblement of the current, in general, occurs. On that side of the                                :
 partition which is opposite the anode hydrogen polarization occurs,
 and on the opposite side oxygen polarization.             The true resistance
 of the cell is not appreciably altered, if the thickness of the metal
 is very small compared with the length of the cell of liquid. The
 question suggests itself whether the metal partition can be made
 so thin that the electrical polarization on either side will neutralize
 the action of that on the other.                         I
                                                   have in fact succeeded in
observing this phenomenon.
    The cell, 22 cm. long, 5 cm. broad, and 8 cm. high, was divided
 into two halves; a hole 1.5 cm. in diameter was bored in the
 plate, which could be easily removed and feplaced by exactly similar
ones in which the aperture was filled with plates of different
 metals.      The cell formed in the first place part of a circuit with
a  galvanometer       and a battery of 2 to 5 accumulators.             instead

used to determine the transmission of                               the rays from a naked gas
jet through this cell. The mean of                                 ten galvanometer    readings
was 201 divisions.
   The cell was then filled with pure    water and the mean of ten
readings found to be 196 divisions,      showing, if anything, that
water is a slightly better absorber than alum solution.         When
two hundred ohms resistance was added in the galvanometer
circuit, the deflexion produced by the unobstructed gas-jet was
240 div.     Through the water-cell it was 21.5 div. and the per
cent. transmitted was 89.       When a sheet of plate glass 0-7 cm.
thick was interposed the deflexion was 86 div. and the per
cent. transmitted     was 35.8.   Melloni shows that alum in its
crystalline form cuts off                   all

  AURORAS             OBSERVED AT GODTHAAB.                                      BY ADAM W. PAULSON.
  The author publishes the journal      the observations         the       of                                  of    all
auroras which appeared      Godthaab (South Greenland) during the

winter     1882of   1883, and develops the general considerations
                                  to
to which they lead.
  Aurorae boreales are divided into two distinct categories.  When
the phenomenon       feeble they simply appear
                                   is                luminosities                               as                          or
luminous clouds. The more marked aurorae boreales affect the arc
shape. These arcs may present various shapes known      curtains,                                          as
bands, zones, and coronae. The two latter, no doubt, do not differ

 from each other; the difference of appearance arises from a variation
in the direction of the corona in respect of the observer. The
aurorae in the form of curtains or of draperies are very long and
high, but have no appreciable thickness.        They may sink to within
 600 metres from the     ground.   Zones and coronae, on the contrary,
are   always at  very  great heights  and may exceed 320 kilometres.
Thus, in the south of Greenland, the region in which the aurorae are
produced extends from the highest regions of the atmosphere to
the surface of the soil, while in temperate countries the phenomenon
takes place simply in the higher regions of the air.               then, we                       If,

même    sile liquide
                   était exempt de toute viscosité’”.   In the
case of jets composed  of liquids such as water, the influence
of viscosity might be expected to be small, but it would be
erroneous to conclude that the limit ka = 1 would then corre
spond to the mode of maximum instability.        Inertia would
necessarily play a leading part, and from a complete investi
gation f it appears that the mode of maximum instability
corresponds with A=4:51 × 2a, exceeding very considerably
the circumference of the cylinder.
                                                Fº
     The importance attached by Plateau to viscosity suggested
an investigation in which this                 should be included ;
and the results would at     any  rate find   application to threads
of materials like glass and sealing-wax, in which viscosity
                            i.
would predominate over inertia.           Having in my mind some
old    experiments   upon  the behaviour of fine threads of treacle
deposited upon paper, which slowly resolve themselves into
drops having a very similar appearance to those obtained
from a jet of water,              expected to find that under the
influence of    viscosity alone the mode of resolution would be
nearly the same as under the influence of inertia alone. This
anticipation proved to be wide of the mark, the result showing
that under viscosity alone the value of A for maximum insta
bility would be very great. And a little consideration shows
that the retarding forces exerted by the paper support may well
 be of quite a different character from those due to mere fluid
viscosity.     In the latter case the gathering together from con
º
 siderable distances is but little resisted, the motion not differing
 greatly from that of a solid body, whereas such a mode of
 resolution would be greatly impeded by the contact with
            In order better to represent such contact forces,                  I
    ave considered the problem in the form which it assumes
 when the resistances are proportional to the absolute velocities
 of the parts. This admits of easy solution, and the result
 illustrates the behaviour of the thread of treacle in contact
 with paper, and shows that there is a marked difference between
 this case and that of a thread whose disintegration is resisted
 by true fluid viscosity.
      The introduction of resistances proportional to absolute
 velocities does not interfere with the irrotational character of
 the motion of otherwise frictionless fluidf. The radial and
 axial velocities u, w may thus, as usual, be regarded as derived
 from a velocity-potential according to the equation

is very large in comparison with the diameter of the cylinder.

cosity is paramount long threads do not tend to divide
themselves into drops at mutual distances comparable with
the diameter of the cylinder, but rather to give way by

It is also easy to prove

Thus the surface of no longitudinal stress lies wholly within

   When this inequality holds the portion of the cross section
wherein the longitudinal stress is a pressure forms a complete
annulus limited externally by the surface of the cylinder and
internally by (88).    When, however, the above inequality
does not hold—and   by  taking b/a small enough it can always

the greater would be the danger attending the bending of the

  The previous considerations, it must be clearly understood,
are intended not to throw doubt on the existence of a species
of instability, such as Professor Greenhill imagines, but merely
to give a general idea of the uncertainties attaching to any
numerical details to which his theory leads on account of
possible divergences between the terminal conditions he
assumes and those existing in practice.        The only positive
conclusion we have come to is that a tendency to instability
may be expected to show itself by a want of smoothness in
the motion and an undue wearing away of the inner edges of
the bearings.     This tendency to instability might be seriously
increased   by a slight departure of the centre of gravity of the
cylinder when at rest from    axis.     its

and long cylinders are, unless m = 0, only approximate, and the
principle of statically equivalent surface-forces on which they
are based is one as to whose degree of accuracy opinions may
differ.   It is thus very desirable to subject our results to some
independent test.

      XIX.      On the Instability of Cylindrical Fluid Surfaces.
                      By LoRD RAYLEIGH, Sec. R.S."
          former paperst I have investigated the character of the
IN        equilibrium of a cylindrical fluid column under the
action      of capillary force.         If  the column become varicose
with      wave-length      X,    the   equilibrium     is unstable, provided
A exceed the circumference (27ta) of the cylinder; and the
degree of instability, as indicated by the value of q in the
exponential e” to which the motion is proportional, depends
upon the value of A, reaching a maximum when A = 4:51 x 2a.
In these investigations the external pressure is supposed to be
 constant; and this is tantamount to neglecting the inertia of
the surrounding fluid.
     When a column of liquid is surrounded by air, the neglect
of the inertia of the latter will be of small importance ; but
there are cases where the situation is reversed, and where it
is the inertia of the fluid outside rather than of the fluid
inside the cylinder which is important.                 The phenomenon of
the disruption of a jet of air delivered under water, easily
illustrated by instantaneous photography, suggests the con
sideration of the casewhere the insideinertia may be neglected;
and to this the present paper is specially directed.                    For the
sake of      comparison     the results of the former        problem    are also
exhibited.
    Since the fluid is supposed to be inviscid, there is a velocity
potential, proportional to e” as well as to e<U+017F>', and satisfying
the usual equation

   On account of the factor (1—a”) both (10) and (11) vanish
when a =0 and when was 1.                       Beyond w= 1, (10), (11) become
imaginary, indicating stability.                     It will be seen that when the
fluid is internal the instability is a maximum between was 6
and w="7; and when the fluid is external, between c=-4 and
ar="5. That the maximum instability would correspond to a
longer wave-length in the case of the external fluid might
have been expected, in view of the greater room available for
the flow.      The same consideration also explains the higher
maximum attained by (11) than by (10).

    Some numerical examples applicable to the case of water
 were given in a former paper.           It appeared that for a dia
 meter of one millimetre the disturbance of maximum insta
 bility is multiplied 1000-fold in about one-fortieth of a second
 of time. This is for the case of internal fluid. If the fluid
 were external, the amplification in the same time would be
 more than one-million-fold.

              years back Prof. Karsten, of Berlin, placed a coin
        upon glass, and by electrifying it made a latent impres
 sion, which revealed itself when breathed upon.                   About the
 same time Mr. W. R. (now Sir W. R.) Grove made similar
 impressions with simple paper devices, and fixed them so as
 to be always visible.      A discussion of Karsten's results occurs
 in several  places,       I
                      but have not been able to find details of
 his method of performing the experiment.                      During my
 attempts to repeat it some effects have appeared which seem
 to be new and worthy of record.
                          I
     After many trials found the following method the most
 successful:—A glass plate, 6 inches square, is put on the table
 for insulation : in the middle lies a coin with a strip of tinfoil          ||
 going from it to the edge of the glass : on this coin lies the
 glass to be impressed, 4 or 5 inches square, and above it a
 second coin.      It is essential to polish the glass scrupulously

clean and dry with a leather: the coins may be used just as
they usually are, or chemically cleansed, it makes no differ
ence. The tin-foil and the upper coin are connected to the
poles of a Wimshurst machine which gives 3 or 4 inch sparks.
The handle is turned for two minutes, during which one-inch
sparks must be kept passing at the poles of the machine.     On
taking up the glass one can detect no change with the eye or
the microscope; but when either side is breathed upon, a clear
frosted picture appears of that side of the coin which had faced
it : even a sculptor's mark beneath the head may be read.
For convenience those parts where the breath seems to adhere
will be called white, the other parts black. In this experi
ment the more projecting parts of the coin have a black
counterpart, but there is a fine gradation of shade to corre
spond with the depth of cutting in the device : the soft
undulations of the head and neck are delicately reproduced.
   The microscope shows that moisture is really deposited over
the whole surface, the size of the minute water granulation
increasing as the point of the picture is darker in shade.
   There seems to be no change produced by the use of coins
of different metals.

      sparking is allowed across the glass instead of at the
       of the machine, traces of metal are sometimes deposited

    a     single pole, are inferior.

182           Mr. W. B. Croft    on Breath Figures.
   The plan which gives the surest and most beautiful results
is to place five or six coins, lying in contact side by side in a
cross or star, on either side of the glass: it is not necessary
that each coin should exactly face one on the other side.
   There has not appeared any distinction between the figures
made by positive and negative electricity.
   When several coins are side by side, touching one another,
there appear in the spaces between them, which are mostly
black, well-defined white lines, common tangents to the cir
cular edges of the coins.     If these are of equal size the lines
are straight; otherwise they are curved, concave towards a
smaller coin.    They seem to be traces in that plane of the loci
of intersection of equipotential surfaces.             -
   Similar effects are obtained when coins and glasses are piled
up alternately, and the outer coins are put to the poles of the
machine.      With six glasses and seven coins perfect images
have been formed on both sides of each glass. With eight
glasses the figures were imperfect; but there is little doubt
this could be improved by continued trials as to the amount
of electricity applied.
   If several glasses are superposed and coins are applied to
the outer surfaces, there are only the two images at the outside.
After the electrification there is a strong cohesion between
the plates.
   It requires some practice to manage the electrification so
as to produce the best results. There are two forms of failure
which present interesting features.          Sometimes a picture
comes out with the outlines dotted instead of being continuous.
At other times, if the electrification is carried too far, the
impression comes out wholly black; but on rubbing the glass
when dry with a leather the excess is somehow removed.
Naturally it is difficult to rub down exactly to the right point,
but I have succeeded on several occasions in developing from
a blank all the fine detail of elaborate coins.
   Here, again, we have another instance of the development
by lapse of time, for an over-excited piece of glass usually
gives a clear picture after an interval of a day or two.
   Impressions from stereotype plates have been taken of
which the greater part is legible: the distinctness usually
improves after a few days.        i.  default of a second plate, a
piece of tin-foil about the same size should be put on the
opposite side of the glass.
   Sheet and plate glass of various thicknesses have been used
without any noticeable change either in the treatment or the
results.

single definite impressions.       However great Moser's assump
tion  may   be, there are  many    achievements of modern photo
graphy that would be as           surprising  if they were not so
familiar. I have not the means of knowing the precise form
                                               º
of Moser's methods: in the experiments which follow there
is usually contact and light pressure, and if they are not
wholly analogous, they may for that cause help to generalize
the idea: in none of these is electricity
    A piece of mica is freshly split, and a coin lightly pressed
for 30 seconds on the new surface : a breath-image of the
coin is left behind.     At the same time it may be noticed that
the breath causes abundant iridescence over the surface, whilst
 it is in a fresh state. It is not clear how the electricity of
 cleavage can have an active agency in the result.
    It is familiar to most people that a coin resting for a while
 on glass will give an outline of the disk, and sometimes faint
 traces of the inner detail when breathed upon.
    An examination-paper, printed on one side, is put between
two plates of glass and left for ten hours, either in the dark
or the daylight: a small weight will keep the paper in continu
ous contact, but this is not necessary if thick glass is used. A
perfect breath-impression of the print is made, not only on
the glass which lay against the print but also on that which
faced the blank side of the paper.        Of course the latter reads
directly, and the former inversely; the print was about one
year old, and presumably dry.
    More often both impressions are white, sometimes one or
other or both are black.       At other times the same one may be
part white and part     black,  and they even change while being
examined.

these impressions of all kinds were easy to produce, so as to
be quite perfect to the last comma; but in general they are
difficult, more especially those from the blank side.
    At the best period           from the blank side of the paper
were white and very strong; also there were white spots and
blotches revealed by the breath. They seemed to correspond
with slight variations in the structure of the paper, and suggest
an idea that the thickness of the ink or paper makes a minute
 mechanical indentation on the molecules: the state of these
is probably tender and sensitive under certain atmospheric con
ditions, as happens with steel in times of frost.
    The following experiments easily succeed at any time:–
 Stars and crosses of paper are placed for a few hours beneath
a plate of glass: clear white breath-figures of the device will
appear. A piece of paper is folded several times each way

the raised lines of the folds produce white breath-traces, and

     Fig. 4 (Plate          III.)
                           shows the fields round Mr. Kapp's
8-pole machine. They are noticeably small.
   Fig. 2 (Plate IV.) shows the effect of edges, corners, &c. on
the strength of field.     On the flat surface of the pole-piece
the field was about 600 (varying between 517 and 690),
on the edges increased to about 1000, whilst on the corners
it reached a strength of over 1100 C.G.S. lines per centimetre.
   Fig. 3 (Plate IV.) shows the deformation of the stray field
produced by the armature reactions. The measurements were
made on an Elwell-Parker Motor. The strength of field on
the trailing edge was about 460, whilst that on the leading
edge was about 500.
   Fig. 6 (Plate           III.)
                         shows various measurements made on
the Gulcher Dynamo ; Fig. 7 (same Plate) gives the field
near one of Mr. Kapp's Dynamos; Fig. 4 (Plate IV.) shows
the fields at two positions of a Laing, Wharton, and Down
shielded dynamo.
   Some curious effects of armature reactions are noticeable
on the Thomson-Houston Dynamo (fig. 5, Plate III.).              As
the bars in this machine act as a yoke, the result is due
to combined magnetic leakage and armature reaction.

some experiments on a watch, previously unmagnetized, which

employ a table such as Table I. at p. 192, with an additional
column for height of knee.       This material, consisting of un
manipulated observations on the stature, cubit, and knee-height
of three hundred men, was kindly furnished to me by Mr.
Galton.     Out of these three hundred triplets               out

ninety-six which have the stature and
respective means of those organs; and proceed in a manner
analogous to the simpler calculation discussed at p. 193.     The
columns for stature and cubit will be    nearly the same as those
of Table II. in that passage ; but not quite the same.        For
negative values are admissible there for the deviation of
stature which is there the dependent variable, but not here,
where both stature and knee-height are treated as independent
variables.   On the other hand, negative deviations of cubit
are admissible here, but not there. The rationale of this dis
tinction is sufficiently explained by the remark at p. 194 (top).

  is instability of ozone, equally at very low and at high

nitrous oxide did not present so great difficulties.          The
minimum deviations for the rays C, D, F, G, and for the
lithium ray A. 6705:5, and the indium ray A 4509:6, were
found to be, respectively, 22°53', 23°, 23° 18', 23° 33', 22° 52',

   Publishing Co.: New York, 1891.
                                 to determine a Natural System in Minera
ENDEAVOURING
   logy,           the author of this work carefully studied the minera
logical systems proposed by Berzelius (1815–24), Werner (1817),
Mohs (1822–24), Shepard (1835–44), Jameson (1820), Breithaup
(1836–46), Weisbach (1875–84), Rammelsberg                     (1841), Dana
(1837–82), Naumann (1849 2–85), Groth (1882).                      The chief
features of these systems are carefully defined, and the author
observes that at present “the results of the chemical analysis of
species are generally considered as of paramount significance;
while hardness, specific gravity, crystalline form, and optical
 characters assume a secondary value in classification, and are
regarded as important chiefly in connexion with determinative
mineralogy.           The conception of a true natural method, which,
 although but partially understood, was at the basis of the system
 of Mohs, has been generally lost sight of ; the order which the
 naturalist finds in the organic is no longer apparent in the inorganic
 world, as presented in modern mineralogical text-books; and this
 state of things has contributed not a little to the comparative
 neglect into which systematic mineralogy has of late years fallen.”
  - - - - - - - -   “There exist, in fact, inherent and necessary relations
 between the physical characters and the chemical constitution of
 inorganic bodies, which serve to unite and reconcile the natural
 historical and the chemical methods in mineralogy.                A physico
 chemical         study   of the mineral     kingdom,  having   in view these
 relations, will enable us, while remaining faithful to the traditions
 of Werner and of Mohs, to frame a classification which it is
  believed will merit the title of a Natural System in Mineralogy.”
      The chemical and natural-history methods being both defective,
  Dr. T. S. Hunt has endeavoured to reconcile the two, observing a
  strict conformity to chemical principles, and at the same time
  retaining    all      that
                          is           in
                                  valuable       the natural-history method.
  “Chemical and           physical  characters (he observes) are really depen
  dent   on     each other, and present two aspects of     the same problem,
which can never           be
                          solved but       by
                                            the consideration           of

and of chemical homology, of solution, and those of polymerization
or rather of intrinsic condensation, and the relation of condensa
tion to hardness and to chemical indifference, have therefore been
dwelt upon at some length.         The problem of determining the
co-efficient of condensation in liquid and solid species has moreover
been discussed in a   separate chapter;  while a new and simplified
chemical   notation, which is believed to be advantageous for the
purposes of the mineralogist, has been set forth. The subject of
mineral constitution, and the theoretical questions therein involved,
are treated in Chapter X.”
   A new mineralogical classification is propounded in Chapter XI.,
the mineral kingdom being divided on chemical grounds into four
classes:–I. Metallaceae; II. Halidaceae;               Oxydaceae; IV.        III.

   The Metallaceae comprise the non-oxydized metalline minerals,

sulphur, selenium, tellurium, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and
bismuth.    The resemblance,         noted, between the typical and

iron, and the elementary metalline species, tellurium, arsenic,
antimony, and bismuth, are such, Dr. Hunt states, that the com
pounds    of these with the metals above named cannot well                                          be

genera with 167 species with latin names either indicative          their                     of

   The book is better than the mere Cambridge text-book in one
particular, viz. that it contains frequent references to the papers
compiled from ; and in certain parts of the subject where a purely
algebraic treatment is not out of place—as for instance in the
details of diffraction—its method is not so unsatisfactory, though
even here the diagrams and general explanations are very feeble.
    One peculiarly irritating quality the preface and general text
of the book possess, viz. the tremendous superfluity and misplace
ment of commas.        If the sentences be read as punctuated they are
half   unintelligible and grotesquely wearisome.     The author seems
to be under the     impression  that a comma must always precede the
words “which,’ ‘who, and ‘that’; for instance page 190 :—“The
general theory of media, which are capable of resisting compression
and distortion, is given in treatises on Elasticity; and it will there
fore be unnecessary to reproduce investigations, which are to be
found in such works.” Almost any page at random may furnish an
example, for instance page 345:—“If we adopted the first hypo
thesis, it would be necessary to suppose, that & the free period of the
 matter vibration, lies below the infra-red portion of the spectrum ;
if on the other hand, we adopted the second hypothesis, it would
be necessary to suppose, that k corresponds to a point in or above
the ultra-violet,” &c.
    On page 249, “From this law we see, that the intensity of the
 blue light is the greatest.    Hence the blue colour of the sky may
 be accounted     for on the supposition, that it is due to the minute
 particles of vapour, and also probably to the particles of air, which
 scatter the waves proceeding from the sun.”
    This last, by the way, is one of the extraordinary statements.
 Here is another, p. 287:—
    “It   was formerly supposed, that the infra-red portion of the
 spectrum produced the maximum heating effect; that the yellow
 was the most luminous portion; whilst the maximum chemical effect
 was contained in the violet and ultra-violet portions. More recent
 investigations have shown, that this view is not correct.”
    There was room for a treatise on Physical Optics more advanced
 than the entirely admirable text-book of Mr. Preston. We venture
 to maintain that there is still room for such a treatise, and we hope
 that the work will be undertaken by a mathematical physicist
 instead of by a mere mathematician.
      -  A  Dictionary  of Electrical Words, Terms, and Phrases.
                       By Edwin J. Houston, A.M.
  SoME months ago a learned judge, after ten days’ evidence by
 electrical engineers had been brought before him, asked naïvely,
  “What is the difference between an Ampere and a Volt 2." Some
  days ago, in the Appeal Court, another learned judge, in the third
  day of a trial concerning electrical engineering, asked, “What is an
  ampere-hour?” After ingenious and long explanations had been
  given to him and his two colleagues          i.  both defendant and
 plaintiff, it was obvious that the dissatisfaction of the Court had
  not been altogether removed.

Oerstedt was and what a Henry may be ; they may be so interested

them, said to be Lord Kelvin's, which is obviously quite vague and

indicatrix  as applied to uniaxal crystals, in the simplest possible
way, by assuming that in a biaxal crystal the surface to which the
finite straight lines specifying the rays have to be normal is an
ellipsoid with three unequal axes, instead of a spheroid.
       If
      this idea sustains itself it manifestly constitutes a beauti
fully simple mode of stating every particular concerning rays in
a biaxal crystal.     It does sustain itself, for it leads to Fresnel's
wave-surface in so straight and clear a manner that Mr. Fletcher
conjectures with some assuredness that this was the path by which
Fresnel really arrived at that famous result, and that his elaborate
but unsatisfactory quasi-dynamical structure was an afterthought
and backward development.
   It seems to the writer that Fresnel's version of an aether theory
was really based on his study of reflexion; his treatment of double
refraction as ordinarily given must apparently have succeeded that;
but it now seems exceedingly probable, as Mr. Fletcher surmises,
that the substantial truths in his double-refraction          results were
arrived at, not by his dynamical hypotheses, but by the simple
geometrical method now rediscovered.
   Mr. Fletcher's treatment is independent of theories of light;
nevertheless he points out how untenable the theory of vibration in
an incompressible elastic aether                             is,
                                         and that the optical properties

 was further found that platinum electrodes of 10 to 20 square
centim. surface, which Kohlrausch found quite sufficient for mea
 suring the resistance of liquids, are by no means adequate with
 the human body to produce a cessation of the tone in the telephone
 in any position whatever.    It was only when the surface of con
tact between the metal and the moist hand was increased to several
 hundred square centimetres that the tone ceased, or at any rate
there was a very pronounced meniscus.            The surface necessary
varies with the region of the body.      In order uniformly to moisten
large surfaces of the body, they were immersed in troughs through
 which the current was passed by cleanly polished zinc plates.         In
such conditions the resistance of the body was found to be very
small (from hand to hand 3–400 ohms), and, as was to be expected,
independent of the induction-currents.
   In order to utilize the method for electrodiagnostics, in which a
very small electrode is always used, the author replaces the metal
rheostat, by a liquid one (platinum in dilute sulphuric acid), the
immersed metal surface being very small.        There must be a definite
ratio between this surface and the surface of the skin touched by
the electrode, to produce a cessation of the tone—that        when the                               be is,

   3. An anode surface is far more feebly attracted, and therefore
far more feebly charged, than a kathode surface.
   If the two infinite plane electrode surfaces are opposite each
other, they are equally attracted only so long as electricity is in
equilibrium.    If the glow-discharge passes between the surfaces,
the  charge  of the anode is feebler than the charge of the kathode
by the excess of free positive electricity which is met with in the
gas traversed by the current.
   4. For the normal density in which the negative glow-light can
spread freely over the kathode, the electrical force at the kathode
decreases with decrease of pressure, and is less for hydrogen than
for nitrogen, in conformity with the well-known laws for the
striking-distance. Hence at normal density the excess of free
positive electricity mentioned under (3) diminishes with increase
of pressure.
   5. The actual electrical charge of the gas which takes place in
the glow-discharge brings with it an increase of the hydrostatic
pressure, and therefore, under ordinary circumstances, produces
eddy currents which flow between limited electrodes from the
anode to the athode, and may explain the frequently observed
transport of matter in the direction of the positive current.—

      it be assumed that molecules are minute droplets, which are
formed from larger ones by impact against and repulsion from solid
walls, and which ultimately acquire a definite mean value for a given
temperature, seeing that a division is only possible as long as the
wis viva with which the drop strikes against a wall is greater than
the work necessary for the division; in this case we obtain a limit

   4. When the surfaces of the shell are subjected to external
            the results furnished by the above hypothesis are no
  onger correct.    This was first pointed out by Lord Rayleight,
and   shortly  afterwards by myself.        wrote f:—           I
    “The fundamental hypothesis that R, S, T may be treated
as zero, is not true when the surfaces of the shell are subjected
to external pressures or tangential stresses; for if the
 convex and concave surfaces of the shell are subjected
to pressures III,            II,
                          the value of R, as we pass through the
substance of the shell from its exterior to its interior sur
 face, must vary from              to — –II,               II,
                                             and consequently (ex
cepting in very special cases) R will contain a term inde
pendent of the thickness.        Hence the theory developed in the
present paper is not applicable to problems relating to the collapse
 of boiler-flues. . . . In order to obtain a theory which would
enable such questions to be mathematically investigated, it

assumed to be free from external pressures and tangential
stresses, although the extension of the middle surface is taken
into account. As the analysis in the general case of three

the original work as is necessary to obtain the value of the

     is insufficient to determine the period, and the only course
     open to us is to assume that the middle surface is inextensible,
     which gives a further relation between v and w, and furnishes
     a sufficient number of equations.          I am inclined to think
     that the neglect of the extension of the middle surface is not
     likely to lead to any serious error in the final result ; but at
     the same time the solution cannot be regarded as perfectly
     rigorous, for when the surfaces are subjected to uniform
     pressure (which is the case we are considering), an extension
     of the middle surface must necessarily take place unless the
     pressures are specially adjusted.

are artificial appears when we consider that each, apparently,

that is their dimensions only in terms of L, M, and T; whereas
we should expect that the absolute dimensions of a physical
quantity could be expressed only in one way. Thus, from the

    +   Read before the                       Society, June 24, 1892, and communicated

                              [uk] =           (L-T")",
then the fact that the dimensions of electrical and magnetic
quantities are different in the two systems arises only from
our ignorance of the dimensions of u and k, which must be
such as to bring the two systems into accord when ultimately
expressed in terms of L, M, and T.         Prof. Rücker therefore
suggested that u and k should be admitted into the formulae
along with L, M, and T, and that, since nothing is definitely
known as to their physical nature, they should be regarded as
secondary fundamental units, additional to L, M, and T, but
which must be ultimately expressed in terms of them. There
is thus, in each formula, an indication that the irrational and
unsuggestive dimensions are not absolute as they stand; each
formula is made to express a physical reality, and each con
tains in the proper form the factor necessary to render the
formula absolute.      This system has been adopted, among
others, by Prof. Gray in his smaller edition of ‘Absolute
 Measurements in Electricity and Magnetism,’ and by Prof.
Everett in his last edition of ‘Units and Physical Constants.”
    Prof. Fitzgerald has pointed out (Phil. Mag. April 1889)
that if a system be taken “in which the dimensions of u and k
are the same, and of the dimensions of a slowness, that is the
inverse of a velocity (LT'T), then the two systems become
identical as regards dimensions, and differ only by a numerical
coefficient just as centimetres and kilometres do.”              But
although A and k are quantities of the same order, both being
 capacities, their dimensions need not necessarily be the same,
 unless electrification and magnetization be phenomena of the
 same order as well.
                               If,
                              however, these              be
                                                 different orders—
as  they ahmost certainly are—the one possibly           strain, thea
 other    vortex

                                               is           bearing,

                                       two dissimilar   phenomena,

    Before doing this, however, it becomes necessary to examine
in more detail the real nature of dimensional equations, and to
determine how far they are capable of giving reliable results
when used in the way here suggested.                Primarily, a dimen
sional formula       expresses   only    numerical relations between
units, and for the purpose of the present paper is defective
from the fact that different physical quantities have the same
dimensional formulae.          For example, couple and work, as
pointed out by Prof. S. P. Thompson in the course of the
discussion on Prof. Rücker's paper above referred to; or,
again, an area and the square of the same vector-length; pres
sure and tangential force per unit area, &c.                 therefore,            If,                     di
 mensional equations are               to

 dependent and secondary consideration.
     The question then arises, what             the test       the identity          of
of    a physical quantity?        Plainly,                  it is

  couple and the unit             of
                              work both     change      the same manner       in

238     Mr. W. Williams                 on the     Relation of Dimensions
the manner the unit length enters their definition is different:
in the case of work the two units of length involved are in
the same direction ; in the case of couple they are mutually
at right angles.     The absolute measure of a force is the work
done through unit linear displacement; similarly, the absolute
measure of a couple is the work done through unit angular
displacement.      Hence the relation between couple and work
is similar to that between force and work, the difference
being that angular displacements are considered in the
former case, linear displacements in the latter.                  But the
measure of an angular displacement is independent of the unit
length. Hence, in expressing the numerical dependence of
the unit couple and the unit of work upon the fundamental
units we get the same formula ML*T-*, although the difference
in the physical nature of the quantities is of the same kind as
that between force and work. And generally, when used in
the purely numerical sense above indicated, the dimensional
formulae fulfil        all
                     requirements;           only when endowed with
                                                    it      is

various quantities that they are found           fail.           to

standpoint—that              is,

                                                  as
mere “change ratios' between units—is shown                       the fact         by
that difficulties are felt when the dimensions of two different
quantities, e.g., couple and work, happen            become the same.  to

formulae are       express
                  to       nothing    more,   then the two     quantities
must have the same dimensions, and from this point                    view               of
we are not entitled       feel any difficulty
                               to                   the matter.    in That
such difficulties are felt arises therefore from the more com
prehensive signification which          attached   is   the formulae—a   to
signification which obviously includes                           all

   Thus, the dimensions of pressure are the same as those of
energy per unit volume, as should be the case, for the pressure
at a point in a gas is given by p=# pV*, where p is the den
sity and pV* is of the dimensions of energy per unit volume.
The case is different from that of W = G6, where W is the
work done by a couple G through an angular displacement 6.
In the former case, p is the same in kind as p"V*, mothing
concrete intervening.     In the latter case, G cannot be the
same as     W
          unless 6 be a mere number, having no reference to
anything concrete, which is not the case.

curve.   Let A B be an element of a curve, and let the tan
gents at A and B intersect at 0, making an angle bib. The
angle   of     is ultimately    =.               If   AP    be taken along
                                                                Y,
                                                                                  the
normal X at A, and             OA along the           tangent         then A B is
also ultimately along          Y, and may be          written dy.       Hence the
curvature becomes
                           }    or dimensionally
where XYT are the dimensions of 3%, and        those of AB.

                                                                Y
The radius of curvature at O is therefore of the dimensions
(Y-X-').
  24. Centrifugal          Force.—Let a particle describe the path
                                                                                  2

A B with        velocity         the centrifugal           force is
                                                                      F=(m    })
Taking   instantaneous           axes at A,           as   in 23, this      becomes
dimensionally
                 [F]=M(YT-1)(xy-")=MXT-".
Thus the force is directed along the radius X.
   25. Compressibility.—Hydrostatic   pressure is of the dimen
sions MXT"    (YZ)",   according to the direction of the plane
of reference YZ. Strain is here of no dimensions, being the
ratio of two concretes of the same kind. Hence the dimen
sions of compressibility are MT'X'YZT”.
   26. Rigidity.—“A simple shear is a homogeneous strain in
which    all
           planes parallel      fixed plane are displaced
                                 to to

same direction parallel       that plane and therefore through
spaces proportional    their distances from that plane” (Kelland
                           to
and Tait's ‘Quaternions,"         p.
                              204).   Let the planes    displace       of

                                                                   243

ment be the planes XY, and the direction of displacement            X.
The applied stress (tangential force per unit area) is
                      MXT" vºv-ºr-2
                        xy--MY-Tº.
The shear is   XZ".     Hence the rigidity is of the dimensions
                  MY-IT-2            –1 vr—lryrn–2
   The velocity of propagation of a wave of distortion is
W  = V;    p
              n = rigidity.   Hence
                 [V]=
                            MZ(YZ)-'T-”

Thus, the applied stress acts over the face         XY, and    the dis
turbance is propagated along Z.
   27. Torsion.--Let OABC be the section of a
                                                      cylinder, axis Z
and radius Y, subjected to torsion; a ABb the face of an elemen

                                                                            4

MXYT-2.
         To determine from this the dimensions of T we have
                                         [rnrój= MXYT                            *,

         Thus     T       in   this case         is    of       the dimensions                 of    a   plane angle
in       the plane         XY.

    Since,   as above shown,    we obtain the same dimensional
formulae by Cartesian and vectorial methods, we may attach to
X, Y, Z and their products and quotients in these formulae
either purely vectorial or purely                 meanings just as
we please : in both cases, the formulae represent the same
 physical identities.     When X, Y, Z are vectors the formulae
 express the directional properties of the corresponding quan
tities.    [An inspection of a formula shows this, for the pro
 ducts and quotients of two rectangular vectors are vectors
 directed normally to the planes containing the original vec
 tors, and the products and quotients of parallel vectors are
 scalar]. Thus: Pressure MX(YZ)T"T", scalar, for YZ is

    In deducing the dimensions of electromagnetic quantities
 it will be necessary to start with the dimensions of energy,
 or energy per unit volume.       Using Cartesian units of length
 this is MX*T*, MY"Tºº, MZ"T", or MR*T*, as the case
  may be ; and since we shall have to deal with connected
 equations between the various quantities, the particular form
 to be used becomes of importance.        Of course, energy being
 a scalar    quantity,  the above do not differ essentially:        the
 difference arises only from the different ways (the different
 dynamical reactions) by which the expressions are derived.

250        Mr. W. Williams               on the Relation          of Dimensions
It   might be more convenient to put                            X=i), Y=jL,       Z=       kI,
then the dimensions of the energy of the medium become
ML*T*. There is thus nothing to indicate how or with
reference to what dynamical reactions the expression is
derived.     In what follows, however, Cartesian expressions
will still be used though more cumbrous and involving more
explanation.    They may be immediately converted into the
above. The     energy of the medium will be expressed in terms
of an instantaneous linear displacement R upon which our
conceptions of the electromagnetic displacements at a point,
whatever their nature may be, must ultimately depend.       By
keeping R, at first, separate from X, Y, and Z, the formulae
gain in generality, and by retaining R, X, Y, Z instead of
their equivalent vector forms rD, iL,       kII, the dynamical  jL,
connexion between the various     quantities   is more clearly
expressed.
   The quantity ºr enters prominently into electromagnetic
relations, and it becomes necessary at the outset to determine
in what manner it is to be dealt with. This subject has been
discussed by Mr. Oliver Heaviside (Elec. October 16th and
30th, 1891), and his conclusions may be briefly summarized
as   follows:–                                    -

      m and q be point sources of induction and displacement

 254    Mr. W. Williams      on the Relation   of Dimensions
are mutually at right angles, and Z is at right angles to both,
being the intersection of the electric and magnetic equi
potential surfaces.     Let this relation between the directions
of the axes of reference and the displacements hold for every
 point of the medium, so that the axes constitute an instanta
neous system at every point.             In passing therefore from
point to point in the medium, and for different epochs at the
 same point, the axes and the displacements preserve their
relative directions, while their absolute direction in space in
general alters.

   Let AO’ be a closed electric circuit, and BO a correspond
ing closed magnetic circuit, both being circles in planes at
right angles to each other.         Taking instantaneous axes as
above, every element of the circuit AO' is or, and of the
circuit BO is by, while an element of the intersection of the
planes of the circuits is oz. The length of the circuit AO' is
Soar, and of the circuit BO, Xoy, while the surfaces of the
circuits are ultimately X(Öröz), and X(Öyöz).
therefore  :-                                             We have
           1.  Circuitation H=X(Höy)=C.

           4. Surface-integral    of B-X(Böröz) = m.
   To express these dimensionally, we have to neglect the
summation X, and substitute for or, by, Ö3 respectively X,
Y, Z. The relations then become : —
             1. D  = k E.
            2.  C   = eT-1.

    The energy of the medium at any point may be expressed
 by
                         Sm(3°4-y”43°)=S(mr"),
 where r is the instantaneous linear displacement upon which
 both the electric and magnetic displacements at that point
depend, for the two laws of circuitation express that the
electric and magnetic displacements at a point in the medium
are not independent, but originate from the same dynamical
cause.      Expressed dimensionally, this becomes
                      M(X24-Y-4-Z')T-2 or MR"T-",
and the dimensions of energy per unit volume are
             -               MR (XYZ)-T-2.
Since the axes        of reference (X, Y, Z) and     the displacement
 R are both instantaneous with            respect  to any point, the
direction of R must be definitely related to the axes, the
relation being dependent upon the dynamical mechanism of the
field.    It will be convenient, however, to express the dimen
sions of electromagnetic quantities, first, in terms of M, X,
Y, Z, T and R ; and afterwards to determine the relation
between the direction of R and the axes. The fact that the
tormulae of some of the quantities involve R, while others do
not, then simply means that in the former cases the corre
sponding quantities depend upon and involve the instanta
neous linear displacement specified by R ; while in the other
cases they are independent of the displacement and express
only physical properties of the medium.

we cannot analyse the corresponding ideas to anything
simpler.    We should thus be unable, according to any physical
theory, to give interpretations to formulae involving frac

such cases would be that the units themselves might cease to
be fundamental.       On the other hand, the building up of a
derived from fundamental units is always a simple process,
nothing but whole units of the latter kind being involved.

units are derived, to find the dimensional formulae of physical

Since        the indices of M, X, Y, Z in the dimensional formulae

odd  multiples of                     ,
                    their indices in the dimensions of a must
be odd, otherwise, on substituting for u and k in these formulae
their dimensional values, the formulae would not be rational
ized.   For a similar reason, the indices of R and T must
be even.    Hence, the indices of M, X, Y, Z must be + 1,
and of R, 0, or + 2.     In the case of Z, + 1 is not admis
sible, otherwise we should have ZT” in the case of k. Thus,
Z must enter both u and k as              In the case of T the      Z'.

          of Physical Quantities to Directions  in Space.     263
duced for m must obviously       hold for the other quantities.
Thus:—
   1.  Let u' contain     X*Y*ZT”. Then [m] contains
              (x-Y-AZ-4) R (X;Y-Z})=RY-'.
This becomes scalar only when R coincides with Y.
   2. Let u' contain X*Y*ZT*.      Then [m] contains
                (X'Y'Z') R (X;Y-AZ})=RX.
This becomes scalar only when R coincides with X.
   3. Let u' contain   X*Y*ZT*. Then [m] contains
              (X;Y-AZ-9) R (X;Y-AZ)= Rx Y-'.
This becomes scalar when R coincides with Z.
   4.  Let tº contain X*Y*ZT*.       Then [m] contains
                (X-Y,Z-) R (X;Y-Z})= R.
This cannot become scalar.
   Thus, in order to render the scalar quantities scalar, R
must ultimately coincide with X, Y, or Z.          There are thus
three cases to be considered   :—
      1. When R coincides with    Y,   a contains  (XYZ)".
      2.    ,          **
                               ,   X,       ,      (XYZT").
      3.    ,          »       ,   Z,      ,      (XY-Z-).
But, according to the electromagnetic theory of light, R cannot
coincide with Z, for XY is the wave-front of an instan
taneous plane-polarized disturbance at a point in the medium--
the disturbance ultimately originating in the displacement R,
and since the medium is isotropic, the linear displacement
specified by R can have no components along Z. We are
thus restricted to the two cases where R coincides with Y,
and the dimensions of a involve (XYZ)", or where R coin
cides with X, and the dimensions of A involve XYZ".             In
the former case, the instantaneous linear displacement R of
the medium at any point is in the plane of polarization (the
plane of magnetic displacement), magnetic energy is kinetic,
and electrical energy potential.      In the latter case, the dis
placement R is at right angles to the plane of polarization,
 magnetic energy is potential, and electrical energy kinetic.
 Physicists are not yet agreed as to the interpretation of
 Weiner's results, so that no arguments as to the direction of the
instantaneous displacement of the medium at a point can be
 based upon his experiments.      We have, therefore, to suppose

              =M-ºx-Yºz'MºRX-YZ-A-RX-'-1,
since    R here coincides with X.     Thus,         the                                        is   of             di

Electrical force E becomes MXT", and voltage          E

MY"T" (energy) and c (current density)=MY*(YZ) 'T".
These formulae, although it may be possible to give them in
terpretations, are at present unintelligible, and do not suggest
any connected relation between the various quantities.
  The cause of the unintelligible character of these latter
formulae lies in the fact that the formula MXYZT" is not sym
metrical with respect to the dimensional axes X, Y, Z. Since
the above formula is independent of T, the corresponding
quantity must be of the dimensions of some property of the
medium depending ultimately upon the inertia of the medium
alone.   It is difficult, however, to conceive what property
depending upon the inertia of the medium can involve the
three dimensional axes unsymmetrically except the rotational
inertia, or moment of inertia of a unit volume. The above
formula, however, does not admit of such an interpretation.
Thus, whether MXYZT'be the dimensional formula of u or k,
the results are either incapable of interpretation (as, for ex
ample, u and k), or the interpretations are unintelligible.
  Thus there are left only cases 1 and 2. If the dimensions
of u be those of 1, that is M(XYZ)", u becomes the inertia
of unit volume, or the density of the medium, and magnetic
energy is kinetic.   If the dimensions of A be 2, those of k
are 1, and k becomes the density of the medium, and electrical
energy is kinetic.  There are thus two cases to be discussed.

   (3) All values which while satisfying (2) rendered the
direction of the instantaneous linear displacement at a point
in an isotropic medium parallel to Z, and therefore normal to
the plane of displacement (XY).
   In the foregoing discussion I have attempted to generalize
the ordinary dimensional expressions for physical quantities,
and to carry somewhat further than he did the suggestion
of Prof. S. #. Thompson that the idea of direction may be
associated with the symbols as well as that of numerical
magnitude.     This is clearly possible—as the examples given
show—in the case of ordinary dynamical quantities, and the
method certainly enables us to distinguish between things
which are physically different, though      the ordinary system
                                                        (if
in  which the idea            of
                         direction    suppressed
                                               is     used) the    be
dimensions are the same.         The dimensional formula thus
becomes for     physical quantity the analogue
                  a                                            of

sion    of  Concrete       Quantities”  (“Nature,”  July  19,  1888).
In   this article Prof. Lodge discusses the general question                       of
the products and quotients              of
                                   concrete quantities, and     the           of
meaning      of physical relations between concretes      different of
kinds.     He clearly points out that the dimensions          quan       of
tities  do not always afford     test
                                    a   their identity, and that
                                               of                                  in

particular concretes of the order of angles and angular dis
placements are treated as pure numbers. The present paper
may be regarded as an attempt to remove such difficulties by
taking as fundamental in our theory of dimensions the vector
instead of the cartesian unit length.   By expressing the for
mulae  according to the conventions of vector algebra, we thus
assign dimensions (in the extended meaning of the term) to
all quantities which are physically recognized     concrete, the                 as
only quantities having unity        their dimensional formula
                                                       as

                            Prof. Lodge, the cause      the above                     of
difficulties lies     the neglect

quantities, these modified formulae approximate more closely

     Here A and Bo each stand for a summation, as expressed in
 (6) and (7), and are calculated from the particular values of the
 resistance, self-induction, and capacity of each branch.                 This
 gives a definite value to the equivalent resistance, R', accord
 ing to (11), and      a   definite value to      & – L'o,           according
 to (12).      There may be an indefinite number of values
 assigned to L' or C' according to values assigned to the other.
 If  the right-hand member of (12) is positive, we may consider
 that the equivalent circuit has no self-induction, i. e. L’=0,
 and calculate the equivalent capacity.               If   this member is
 negative, we may consider that the equivalent circuit has no
condenser, i. e. C/= x , and calculate accordingly the equi
 valent self-induction. The angle of advance or lag of the
 main current is obtained from equation (8).
    If there is no condenser in any branch, the expressions for
 A and Bo are obtained by substituting C= x in the summa
 tions in  (6) and (7), thus

Equations (11) and (12) with these values for A and Bo give
the equivalent resistance and self-induction of parallel circuits
containing resistance and self-induction only. These expres
sions are the same as those obtained by Lord ltayleigh.

   Another advantageous result arising from permanently
magnetizing a soft-iron core by the addition of a steel magnet
(as in a common arrangement of the telephone) probably is
that the permeability of the soft iron is increased thereby; so
that our 8 H itself (that is to say, the magnetic force at the
armature arising from the current) is greater than were the
current to act on an initially unmagnetized core. This effect

by reference to the well-known curves of magnetization (fig.                                           1),

      HE   theoretical investigation        of the relation between the
        distribution of light in        a  source, as a function of the
 wave-length, and the resulting “visibility curve” has been
 given in a paper bearing the same title as the present one in
 the “Philosophical Magazine’ for April 1891.
    The physical definition of “visibility " there adopted is
                                    _ II-I,
                                      It + Is’
 in which II is the intensity at the centre of a bright inter
 ference-band, and I, the intensity at the centre of the ad
joining dark band. In order to interpret the actual curves
 obtained by observation of interference-fringes, it is first
 necessary to reduce the results of the eye-estimates of visi
 bility, which may be designated by V., to their absolute
 values as above defined.
    For this purpose two quartz lenses, one concave and the
 other convex, and of equal curvatures, were mounted with
their crystalline axes at right angles to each other between
 two Nicols. Under these conditions a series of concentric
interference-rings appeared.           If  a be the angle between the
 principal section of the polarizer and the axis of the first
quartz, and o the angle between the axis and the analyser,
 the intensity of the light transmitted will be

     The curves show              a       general tendency to estimate the                                  visi
bility too high when the interference-bands are clear, and too
low when they are indistinct.     This tendency may be modi
fied by a number of circumstances: thus, it increases with
the refrangibility of the light used ; it is greater when the
field contains a large number of bands than when there are
but few ; it is greater while the visibility-curve is falling
than when it is rising ; it does not seem to be greatly affected
by the intensity of the light; finally, it varies on different
occasions and with different observers.       Notwithstanding
these disturbing causes, the result, after applying the correc
tion, will rarely be in error by more than one tenth of                                                       its

   As stated in Part I. of this paper, the observations neces
sary to construct the visibility-curves, from which the distri
bution of light in any approximately homogeneous source is
to be deduced, may be made with any form of interference
apparatus which allows a considerable alteration in the
difference of path between the two interfering streams of
light.
   The apparatus actually employed for this purpose was de
signed for the comparison of wave-lengths, and while admi
rably adapted for the observation of visibility-curves, it con
tains many parts not necessary for this use. Fig. 1, Woodcut,

the surface of the plane parallel plate Giº.         Here it divides,
part being transmitted to the fixed plane mirror M, and part
reflected to the movable mirror Ms. These mirrors return
the light to the silvered surface, where the first part is re
flected and the second transmitted;           so that both pencils
coincide on   entering   the observing-telescopef.
   A little consideration will show that this arrangement                                                                     is,

                adjustment of the surfaces of a second of arc
would produce a diminution of 4 or 5 per cent. in the visibility.
Accordingly, if the ways on which the mirror-carriage moves
are not true to this degree, it is necessary to make the adjust
ment for every observation.
   This can be done with very great accuracy by moving
the beam of light from side to side and adjusting the mirror
until there is no perceptible alteration in the size of the rings.
Since the admissible error in adjustment is inversely propor
tional to the aperture, the observations may be facilitated by
making this, as small as possible if there be light to spare.

rent was interrupted by a rotary break attached to the arma
ture of an electric motor, making about 20 to 30 breaks
per second.     The steadiness of the light thus obtained was far
greater than with the ordinary Foucault interrupter. Probably
it would have been still more satisfactory to use an alternating
dynamo properly wound to give a strong current with compa
ratively few alternations.
    The box surrounding the vacuum-tube was heated just suffi
 ciently to give a steady bright light, and the temperature then
 kept as nearly uniform as possible. This temperature was
usually taken to represent that of the vapour within the tube.

   The metal is not sufficiently volatile at the temperatures
attainable, but the chloride answers admirably, giving a
brilliant green light, the visibility-curve varying but little
with temperature. This curve is given in fig. 13 b, Plate VI.,
together with the dotted curve representing the equation
       V= }cos    2/160 V4V,”+W,++4WIW, cos         27X/253,
in which W1–      2–xº     and W, _2-x"<U+017F>iss".
   This is the visibility-curve due to a double source, each of
whose components is a close double, as shown in fig. 13 a.
                               Mercury.
    Mercury in a vacuum-tube gives two yellow lines 5790
and 5770, a very brilliant green line at 5461, and a violet
line at 4358.
    The yellow lines are not very bright, and are so close
 together that it is somewhat difficult with the dispersion
 employed to prevent the light from overlapping.          Notwith
 standing these difficulties, the close agreement of a number
 of observations shows that the curve for the lower line, given

292          Mr. A. A. Michelson      on the Application   of
in fig. 14b, Plate VI., is    a close approximation      to the truth.
Neglecting the effect of a line of feeble intensity at a distance
of about 24 from the principal line, the distribution of light
in the source is represented in fig. 14 a, which gives for the
visibility-curve

      Fig.  15 b,  Plate VI.,   represents   the results of observa
tions on the upper yellow line, omitting some peculiarities
 due to the presence of one or more lines of feeble intensity.
 The curve agrees closely with the formula

 visibility-curve produced by two lines of intensities 1:3 and
 separated by 0.019 divisions as shown in fig. 15 a.
     The green mercury-line is one of the most complex yet
 examined.      The constituent lines are nevertheless so fine
 that the interference-bands are frequently visible when the
 difference of path is over four tenths of a metre. The full
 curve in fig. 16 b, Plate VI., gives the results of observa
 tions corrected for personal equation, while the dotted curve
 represents the equation                              -

 and                   V2-774-23 cos       27-X/110.
     This is the visibility-curve corresponding to the distribu
 tion represented in fig. 16 a. The components of the line,

 for simplicity, have been assumed to be symmetrical, as
  figured ; but the observations are not sufficiently accurate to
  determine whether, for instance, each component is a double
  or a triple line. In this case also, as in the preceding ones,
  it is impossible from the data given to determine whether
  the smaller component is to the right or left of the principal
  line.    A direct observation with the grating showed,
  that the smaller component is towards the red end         -   of the
  spectrum.
      The full curve shows that there is at least one other line—
  probably more than one—whose intensity is roughly one
  twentieth of the principal line, and whose distance from it is
  about three times that of the chief components.
      The violet mercury-line is much more difficult to observe
  than the others. The results obtained by observation, cor
   rected for personal equations, are given by the full curve
   fig. 17 b, Plate WI. The formula for the dotted curve is

   The results of the preceding work are collected for com
parison in fig. 18, Plate VIII., together with the D group in
the solar spectrum.     From these, as well as from the curves,
it will be seen that it is easy by this method to separate lines
whose distance apart is only a thousandth of that between
D1 and D, and even to determine the distribution of light in
the separate components. The conditions most favourable to
high values of the visibility are low density and low tempera
ture, and these conditions were complied with as far
possible. Still, in many cases, the range of visibility-due to
slight variations of the conditions sho            le behaviour of

  In  order to show conclusively that the effect of density may
be neglected in the foregoing observations, as well as to
ascertain the law governing the broadening of spectral lines
by pressure or density, a series of observations was made on
the red hydrogen-line at varying pressures, with the results
shown in fig. 19 a, Plate VII."

   In fig.     19 b the curved             line gives the relation between 8

the effect of collisions has almost entirely ceased.       we take                    If
as variables 8 and p, the results agree very closely with the
straight line 8–8,-kp, in which 8,--047 (the “half-width "

   The same results were found for the blue hydrogen-line,
though, as might be expected, these were not so consistent.

 296        Mr. A. A. Michelson   on the Application of
intermediate stage. This last observation was obtained by
 placing the mercury in an atmosphere of hydrogen whose
pressure could be measured by a McLeod gauge.
     It might be objected that the presence of a foreign sub
 stance might of itself affect the distribution of light in the
 source, and therefore the form of the curve.    In order to test
 this point, a series of observations of the red hydrogen-line
 was taken, while the tube contained liquid mercury, which was
heated until the mercury-spectrum was at least ten times as
 bright as that of the hydrogen.     The character of the visi
bility-curve was not perceptibly altered.
     In the same series of experiments it was found that, pro
 vided the pressure of the hydrogen remained constant, the
 effect of a change in temperature from 75° to 140° had no
appreciable effect on the result.   In this connexion it may be
 mentioned that the character of the curve for the green mer
cury-line was not essentially altered when, in place of metallic
 mercury, the nitrate, iodide, or the chloride was substituted,
 the only important effect being a diminution in the visibility
in the order named.
    In the case of yellow sodium light, it has already been
 mentioned that the character of the curve is more variable
than that of any other line thus far examined. This is illus
trated by the curves in figs. 21a and 21b, Plate VII.     It has
not been possible thus far to devote the attention which a
systematic investigation demands. These changes are very
puzzling to trace, but undoubtedly much of the difficulty is
due to the fact that the dispersion employed was not sufficient
to permit the separate examination of the components.       Still,
there can be no doubt that the width of the lines, their dis
tances apart, and their relative intensities vary rapidly with
changes in temperature and pressure.
    In addition to the preceding investigations of visibility
curves for light emanating from a rare gas or vapour in a
vacuum-tube, the curves for sodium, thallium, and lithium in
the flame of a Bunsen-burner have been observed ; and the
results are given in fig. 22, Plate VII. The thallium- and
lithium-lines are clearly double ; the distance between the
components of the former agreeing very well with the results
obtained with the vacuum-tube.
    These substances were brought into the flame in the ordi
nary way, and the results obtained were at least as good as
when a finely divided solution was used according to the
method of Gouy. It appears from these curves that the width
of the line is about ten times as great as when the vacuum
tube is used.    But if the temperature of the flame be taken

    Interference Methods to Spectroscopic Measurements.                              297
at 1500° C. and that in the vacuum-tubes at 350°C., the lines
should be only twice as broad in the former case as in the
latter.   It appears, then, that notwithstanding the small
quantity of substance present (barely enough to colour the
flame), the real density must be comparable to that of the
                                                    ºf
vapour of the substance boiling under atmospheric pressure.
   The principal object of the foregoing work is to illustrate
the advantages which may be                     from a study of the
variations of clearness of   interference-fringes   with increase in
difference of path. The fundamental principle by which the
“structure” of a line or group of lines is determined by this
method is not essentially different from that of spectrum
analysis by the grating, both depending, in fact, on interference
phenomena;      but in consequence of the almost complete
freedom from errors arising from defects in optical or mecha
nical parts, the method has extraordinary advantages for this
special work. A glance at fig. 18, Plate VIII., will give a
fair idea of the “resolving-power" of the method as compared
with that of the grating. In order that the comparison be
quite fair, however, it would be necessary to take for a com
parison-spectrum that of the substances here used, and under
the same conditions.      With the best instrumental appliances
now in use, it is difficult to “resolve” lines as close together
as the components of either of the yellow sodium-lines.          It is
evident, however, that by Light-ware Analysis                   may        of (if

grating will give the information necessary for the investi
gator  to  select the proper combination.

                         shown that the formula

for the visibility-curve due to a distribution of light, y=f(r),
is identical with that of the intensity-curve at the focus of a
telescope   provided with apertures which produce this distri
bution in the light passing through.           Accordingly, if a
telescope be provided with apertures adjustable in width (or
length) and distance apart, the diffraction-image of a distant
illuminated slit will give, at once, a representation of the whole
visibility-curve; and by adjustment of intensities and dis
tances any particular visibility-curve may be more or less
accurately copied, thus furnishing a means of studying the
relations between V and p(v), which, while giving perhaps
only a rough approximation to the truth, may prove more
convenient than analytical or graphical methods.
     II.One of the purposes which led to these investigations
was the search for a radiation of sufficient homogeneity to
serve as an ultimate standard of length.      It will appear from
the curves of cadmium that there are three lines which may
be used for this purpose. The red cadmium-line is almost
ideally homogeneous, and will readily permit the estimation
of a change of phase in the interference-fringes of one
hundredth of a fringe in a total distance of 200 millimetres,
or over 300,000 waves.
    Both the green and the blue lines are fairly well adapted
for the purpose, and will prove very valuable as checks. Each                                          .
of these, however, has a small companion, and it is necessary
to know the effect of this in altering the phase of the inter
ference-bands.

further could be gained in resolution of groups of spectral
lines, on account of the real width of the lines themselves,
caused by the lack of homogeneity in the radiations which
produce them. The results of the preceding investigations
show that, while this is very far from being true with present
gratings, such a limit                  exists. The accordance
between the measured widths of eighteen lines shows, further,
that this broadening of lines in a rare gas can be fully
accounted for by the application of Döppler’s principle to the
motion of the vibrating atoms in the line of sight, and indeed
furnishes what may be considered one of the most direct
proofs of the kinetic theory of gases.

literature is the thoroughly interesting and readable character of
 the text. Unlike the majority of text-books, which give but the
 dry bones of the science, Mendeleeff’s “Principles’ can be opened
 anywhere, from the first page of the preface to the last page of the
 appendix, and the reader, even if he has but a spark of that some
what rare gift in this country, the chemical faculty, will find his
interest arrested by the wealth of ideas and suggestions abounding
on every page. To quote the author's own remarks:—“Thus the
desire to direct those thirsting for truth to the pure source of the
science of the forces acting throughout nature forms the first and
 most important aim of this book. The time has arrived when a
knowledge of physics and chemistry forms as important a part of
education as that of the classics did two centuries ago. In those
days the nations which excelled in classical learning stood foremost.
 just as now the most advanced are those which are superior in the
   nowledge of natural sciences.”
    Before giving an account of the contents of the two volumes
especial attention must be called to the footnotes, which are printed
in smaller type than the text but often run to the length of two or
more pages. The author modestly suggests in the preface that the
study of these notes should be postponed till the more important
matter of the text has been mastered. So far as the elementary
student is concerned this advice is sound, but we do not imagine
that many of “those who are commencing to study chemistry.”
are likely to begin with Mendeleeff’s “Principles.        If they do
adopt this work at the beginning of their studies—and there is
certainly   no better course open to them—they will find it
impossible to avoid the fascination of these notes, which often
contain some of the most suggestive passages in the work.      It is in
these notes, in fact, that the author most frequently gives his own
views on the many important questions now being debated in the
chemical world.     Thus, in notes occurring in the Introduction
there are discussed such questions as the composite nature of the
elements, the chemical origin of electricity, the value of thermo
chemical data, the mechanical nature of chemical forces, contact
action, and many other topics of general interest and importance.
It will interest those who have followed recent speculations as to
the elements being evolved from some primordial form of matter,
to learn Mendeleeff's views:– “All labour in this direction has
as yet been in vain, and the assurance that elementary matter is
not so homogeneous (single) as the mind would desire in its first
transport of rapid generalization is strengthened from year to year.

these amalgams by means of mercury, or the dilution of one solid
metal by means of another in an alloy, is universally attended by
an increase of mean electromotive force of the diluted and diluting
substances beyond the calculated amount, and therefore of the
actual electromotive force of the diluted one (that of the diluent
being very little affected), provided that no chemical union of
the diluted and diluting substances occurs.        however, chemical  If,

the direct light was thus partially cut off, a mechanically held
screen being advanced a little above the plane of the revolving

coincidence of the times of exposure has the disadvantage of
rendering the calculation dependent upon the assumption that
the light is uniform over the duration of an experiment.

   The surface of water must be large enough to avoid curva
ture due to capillarity.       Shortly before an experiment it is
cleansed with the aid of a hoop of thin sheet-brass about
2 inches wide.       The hoop is deposited upon the water so
doubled up that it includes but an insensible area, and is then
opened out into a circle.        In this way not only is the greasy
.
film   usually  present  upon    the surface greatly attenuated, but
also dust is    swept  away.      The avoidance of dust, especially
of a fibrous character, is important.         Otherwise the resulting
deformation of the surface causes the field of the reflected
light to become patchy and irregular.
    We come now to the silvered glass reflectors, which are
assumed to reflect the direct and reflected lights equally well.
It seems safe to suppose that no appreciable error can enter
depending upon the slightly differing angles at which the
            takes place in the two cases.          But the mirrors are
liable to tarnish, and, indeed, in the earlier experiments soon
showed signs of being affected.          The influence of this tarnish
would be much greater in photographs done upon ordinary
plates, sensitive principally to blue light, than in           estimation

   When not in use the reflecting-surfaces are protected by
a sort of cap of tin-plate, which fits loosely over them. The
improvement thus obtained was very remarkable, the mirrors
not suffering so much in a month as they formerly did in a
day before the protection was provided.
  The following are the measures of distances required for
the calculation.

so that
                               AB+ BC = 104'43.
The factor expressing the ratio of the squares of the distances
is thus 1-6137.
  The angle of incidence is best obtained from a measurement
of the horizontal distance between C and A. This proved to
be 11% inches; so that

but it is not probable that this would sensibly influence the
reflexion.
                             APPENDIx.
   The calculation of the reflexion depends upon the assump
tion that the reflecting surface is plane ; and a very moderate
concavity would suffice to explain the small excess in the
observed number for water over that calculated from Fresnel's
formulae. It is thus of importance to assure ourselves that
the concavity due to capillarity is really small enough to be
neglected.    For this purpose an estimate founded upon the
capillary surface applicable in two dimensions will suffice.
   If  6 be the inclination to the horizon at any point, a the
horizontal and y the vertical coordinate, the equations to the
surface are:—
           w-2a   cos #6 + a log cot 46, y=2a sin   #6,

In the experiments upon reflexion the part of the surface in

that w/a = 40, and 6 is very small.

             XXXVI.      On Joints in Magnetic Circuits.
               By Professor Ewing, M.A., F.R.S."
     N   the “Philosophical Magazine’ for September 1888 an
        account was given by Mr. William Low and myself of
 experiments we had made to examine the influence of a plane
 of transverse section in an iron bar which formed part of a
 magnetic circuit.     It was found that a transverse cut intro
 duced what is now frequently spoken of as magnetic resist
ance, even when the faces at the cut were scraped up to be
 as nearly as possible true planes, and were brought into ex
cellent mechanical contact. Only when a very considerable
force was applied to press them together did the resistance
of the joint appear to vanish : except in this case it required
a stronger magnetomotive force—a greater number of ampere
turns in the magnetizing coil—to bring the magnetic induc
tion up to any assigned value when the bar was cut than it
had required when uncut.        In this respect the joint is equi
                                              º:
valent to a narrow crevasse of air or other non-magnetic
material. We proceeded to calculate the width of the air
gap which should be equivalent, in                     resistance, to
the   joint, and obtained values which made it       appear  that the
width of this equivalent air-gap became reduced when the
magnetization was forced up to       fift   values.
       aving occasion recently to revise these results        I found
that an incorrect procedure had been followed in calculating,
from the experimental data, the width of the equivalent air
  ap.     When the necessary correction is made it appears that
this width remains constant, or nearly constant, whether the
magnetization be weak or strong. The object of this note is
to point out the error in the former calculation, and to state
the corrected values.

  Data relating to a second experiment in which a cut with
 true-plane surfaces was introduced in another iron bar will
  be found in the former paper. Fig. 2 shows the graphic
  treatment of this example, and it will be seen that the dotted
 curve which exhibits 5'-35 is in this case slightly concave
 towards the axis of 98, whereas in the former example it was

  324                 Professor Ewing on Joints
  slightly convex.        The deviations from straightness are in
  neither case more than may well be set down to uncer
  tainty in the experimental data ; and taking the two examples
  together it seems very probable that the joint is equivalent
  to an air-gap of sensibly constant magnetic resistance.               In

 the first example the width of the equivalent gap was about
 0-0033 cm.: in this case its mean value is about 0.0036 cm.
     Small as these gaps are, it is difficult to believe that the
 metallic surfaces were actually separated so far, and it seems
 more probable that the magnetic resistance of a joint is due
 in part to a reduction of permeability in the metal itself at
 and close to each surface, as a result of the influence of
 surface conditions in affecting the grouping of the molecular
 magnets.
     Since the joint is equivalent to an air-gap of sensibly con
 stant width it is easy to apply a graphic construction, like
 that used by Lord Rayleigh in the case of ellipsoids", to de
termine the influence which the joint must exert in any cyclic
or other magnetizing process; or, conversely, to determine
from experiments made on a circuit in which there is a joint
the form which the magnetization curve would assume if the
joint were not there. The effect of a gap or of a joint is to
make the true magnetic force less than the apparent mag
netic force (namely, the force due to the magnetizing sole
noid) by an amount which is proportional to the magnetiza
tion.     We have

 non-metals at the low temperatures obtainable by the evapora
 tion of liquid oxygen at ordinary barometric pressures and the
ebullition of liquid oxygen under reduced pressures of about
 25 or 30 millim.    Since liquid oxygen, as already pointed out
 by one of us, is a very perfect insulating fluid, it is quite a
simple matter, if once sufficient of the liquid gas is ob
tained, to measure the electrical resistance of a wire or small
rod of the metal when immersed in liquid oxygen, and
thus entirely at the same temperature as the evaporating
liquid. A series of observations has accordingly been made
by us on the specific electrical resistances of various metals,
non-metals, and alloys over a range of temperature varying
from +100° C. to nearly —200°C., and although these in
vestigations are as yet incomplete, the observations already
made seem to be of sufficient interest to render it worth while
to place them on record.
    § 2. A number of small resistance-coils were prepared of
wires of different metals and alloys in the following way. A
thin rectangular sheet of mica, about 5 centim. long and 1 or
2 centim. in width, had a number of nicks cut in the edges,
and round this was wound loosely the wire whose resistance
was to be determined.       The ends of the wire were brought
out through two holes in the mica and soldered to two stout
copper terminal wires formed of high-conductivity copper
wire well insulated with indiarubber.          The ends of these
terminal wires were bent over so as to dip into mercury cups
(see fig. 1). The small resistance-coil so formed could then
be lowered into a test-tube full of the liquid gas or other fluid,
by means of which the temperature of the wire was deter
mined.      The majority of the wires used had a length of 50
or 100 centim. and a diameter of 003 of an inch (3 mils).
The electrical resistance of these small coils of wire was
measured by a Wheatstone's bridge, kindly lent for the
purpose by Messrs. Elliott Bros. The coils of this bridge were
of platinum-silver, and adjusted to read in B.A. units at 15°.5
Cent.     The balance was determined by the use of a highly
sensitive mirror-galvanometer, using the current from a single
Helsen's dry cell. The experiments were carried out in the
Royal Institution laboratories, in a room which remained
approximately at about 20° C. during the whole time.            A
series of wires of pure metals was obtained, and also others of
known alloys.        r.  J.  S. Sellon and Mr. G. Matthey, of
Messrs. Johnson and        Matthey    of Hatton Garden, kindly
provided for us carefully drawn wires of absolutely pure

pure silver, aluminium, and tin. Also wires of alloys of

values of p are the relative resistances at the different tempe
ratures of one cubic centimetre of the metal taken at the
atmospheric temperature and allowed to shrink or expand
with the temperature. They are therefore the relative specific
resistances for constant mass and not for constant volume.
These latter cannot be obtained until we know the true mean
 coefficient of cubical or linear expansion of the various metals
and alloys between 0° C. and –100° C. and —200° C.; but
in any case, even for the most expansible metal, the correction
would probably not amount to one-half of a per cent., or to
less than the error created in the measurement of the resist
ance by an uncertainty in the temperature to the extent of
one degree Centigrade.
    §4. The following Tables give these specific resistances
 for constant mass (p) at the various temperatures (tº) of the
different pure metals, alloys, and impure metals employed.
The mean value of the various results is given, and the
temperature in degrees Centigrade placed over the number de
noting the specific resistance in absolute electromagnetic units.
     If  these specific resistances are plotted out in a series of
curves, taking the absolute temperature as abscissae, we find
that all the lines of resistance are more or less curved lines
which tend downwards in such a way as to show that if pro
longed beyond —200° C. they would probably pass through
or near the origin or absolute zero. These curves of resist
ance can be divided into three classes:—(i.) those of metals
such as iron, nickel, tin, and perhaps copper, which are con
cave upwards; (ii.) those of metals such as gold, platinum, and
palladium, and probably silver, which are concave downwards
towards the axis of temperature; and (iii.) those of metals
such as aluminium, which are apparently nearly straight lines.
    In the case of a metal of the first class, such as iron, the
resistance changes with the temperature in such a way that
the rate of change of resistance with temperature increases as
the temperature increases.         In other words, the second dif
ferential of resistance with     respect to temperature is positive.
In the case of a metal of the second class, such as platinum,
the second differential of resistance with temperature is nega
tire ; that  is,    the temperature increases the rate
                     as                                 of  change
of   resistance with temperature decreases.

332       Profs. Dewar and Fleming on Electrical Resistance
–200° C. Accordingly the distinction between these two
metals, in this respect, extends over a very large range of
temperature.
   The most interesting fact which these experiments have
brought out is the enormous decrease in specific resistance
experienced by the perfectly pure metals when cooled to these
low temperatures. Thus the electrical resistance of a given
pure iron wire at –197°C. is only one twenty-third part of
that which it is at +100° C. In the case of pure copper
the ratio of resistance is about one to eleven for the same
change of temperature. The very smallest impurity greatly
affects this decrease.      In the case of some nickel wire sup
posed to be pure we found that the specific resistance at
zero Centigrade was 13387 electromagnetic units, and that
                                                                       iº.
the specific resistance at –182°C. was 6737.             On repeating
the measurement, however, with some absolutely pure nickel,
obtained by Mr. Ludwig Mond's process of                            the
metal on glass by heating the gaseous compound of nickel
and carbonic oxide, we found a very different result.                In
this last case, although the specific resistance at zero Centi
grade was not very different, viz. about 12000 units, the
specific resistance at –182° C. was only 1900, showing a
far greater decrease.        For the perfectly pure metals, there
fore, it seems probable that as the temperature is lowered
towards the absolute zero the specific electrical resistance
decreases so that it either vanishes at the absolute zero or
reaches a very small residual value.         Clausius made the sug
gestion in 1858 (Pogg. Ann. vol. civ. p. 650) that the elec
trical resistance of all pure metals is proportional to the
Fº
absolute temperature. Owing to the marked curvature of the
resistance-temperature lines this statement is only very ap
               true for a few metals, and not at all for others,
  ut it yet remains not improbable that the electrical resist
ance of       all
              pure metals would                      at
                                        the absolute zero        either          be
         exceedingly
null  5. or            small.

                       indicate that        prolonged      would pro

as pure.           If,

    On charting the above figures for the alloys, it is found that
the resistance-lines are very nearly straight lines with but
little slope, not one-tenth that of the pure metals, when the
constituent metals of the alloy are chemically very different.
This is the case with the platinum-silver, platinoid, and
German-silver alloys.          When, however, the constituents of
the    alloy   are  chemically     similar, as in the case of the
                      and platinum-rhodium alloys, the resistance
  ines plotted in terms of the absolute temperature slope down
at a much steeper angle, but never, as in the case of the pure
metals, in such manner as to indicate that if prolonged they
 would pass through the absolute zero.             In a similar manner
 the impure metals also behave.          We have laid down on such a
 resistance-temperature diagram the lines representing the
 change of specific resistance with temperature for palladium
 not known to be pure, for nickel not pure, for commercial
 iron wire, for ordinary bismuth, for gold not pure, and other
 commercial metals, and found that the resistance-lines of
 these metals do not slope down at such an angle as to indi
 cate that if prolonged they would pass through or near the
 origin or absolute zero. The lines for these impure metals
 are in position more or less like the lines for alloys formed
 of similar metals.
     § 6. Another fact of considerable interest has been ascer
 tained. We know that for temperatures above zero Centi
 grade carbon behaves like an electrolyte as regards change of
 resistance with temperature, that                 is,   its
                                                     specific resistance
 decreases   as  temperature    increases.     Hence       was it matter
                                                                     as a

pure copper, and pure nickel has about ten times the resist
ance ; but at the temperature of liquid oxygen boiling at
ordinary atmospheric pressure, the specific resistance of iron
is only two-thirds of that of pure copper at the ordinary tem
perature, whilst that of nickel is only about twice as great as
that of iron. It is a striking illustration of the effect of great
cold on electrical conductivity to realize that at the tempera
ture of boiling liquid oxygen pure iron conducts electricity
better than the purest electrolytic copper does at ordinary
temperatures.    We hope before long to extend and complete
the above  investigation.

                     By Rev. O. FISHER, M.A., F.G.S.*
      EOLOGISTS        who have made glacial epochs their special
         study have in general come to the conclusion that the
advent of an ice-sheet has been accompanied by a considerable
depression of the earth's surface in the regions covered by                                it.
More than one theory has been advanced                account for this
                                                                  to
circumstance, and we will begin                       by
                                             examining what appears
to   be the latest conception upon the subject, but one which
has not hitherto been submitted                the test to   numerical      of
computation.
    It is easy       to
                   see that              an
                                   area not previously within the

a  contraction         of
                     the rocks must follow.        The idea that this
contraction     may  possibly   account for   much,     not the whole, if
of   the depression which requires               explained, appears
                                                       to   be                             to
have   presented   itself     sometoglacialists.   The following cal
culation has been undertaken with the view                 testing this   of
hypothesis.      The result will show that          wholly inadequate
                                                             it   is
to  explain the phenomena.
   We may consider that before the ice-sheet was formed the
underground       temperature increased                          to the
depth,        as,
               for instance, one degree Fahr. for             feet.            51     .    In
that case the temperature-curve will have been                  straight        a
line, and may        expressed
                          be                by

where     v   is    the temperature        at   the depth        r,   m   the rate   of   in

338                        Rev. O. Fisher on Theories to
crease per unit depth, and b the mean constant temperature
at the surface.  For convenience we will take the temperature
b as the mean above the freezing-point, which for degrees Fahr.
will make    = 20°, supposing the mean temperature of the
                    b
surface to be 52°. This merely implies shifting the zero of
the scale up through 32°.
   Let us then suppose that, as soon as the ice-sheet is formed,
the surface is reduced to the freezing temperature of water,
and kept at that temperature as long as glacial conditions
last.  These hypotheses will deviate from the truth in two
respects: first, because the mean temperature of the surface
will be not suddenly but gradually lowered while the climate
becomes colder, before the ice-sheet is permanently established;
and, secondly, because the temperature of the surface under
the ice will, on account of the pressure, be somewhat lower
than the melting-point at atmospheric pressure. Nevertheless
our result will give a general idea of the rate and extent of
the refrigeration of the crust of the earth beneath an ice-sheet,
and of the order of magnitude of the depression of the surface
which it may be expected to produce.
   Let V be the temperature at the depth a when the surface
of the ground has been kept at zero temperature during t years.
   Let K be the conductivity of rock expressed in terms of                                        its
own capacity for heat, the units used being one foot and one
year. Then, according       Lord Kelvin, k=400.

a much smaller value than that given above.
   This method is capable of giving tolerably accurate results,
although it cannot be used with heavy oils; for the force to
be measured is small and the volume of the cylinders is con
siderable; hence the latter move very slowly through a quite
viscous liquid.     The method given in the paper already
referred to is applicable to such liquids, and is perhaps more
convenient for all.

   It does not appear as yet what is the strength of the field,
or the difference of potential between the electrodes. Our
formula for the potential due to two parallel wires is

this shows that along the axis of Y where R' = R", V=0. At
a (figure 3) R' =0:37 cm. and R" = 2.07 cm., whence V=
 + 1-72 electrostatic units, or +516 volts. The force of 0-52
dyne calculated above is therefore for a difference of potential
of 1032 volts between the electrodes.       For 100 volts, since
the force is inversely as the square of the difference of poten

tial, it would be

                 B=O-OO49 dyne for 100 volts.
   The torsion of the suspending wire was determined and
found to require 0:0040 dyne for each centimetre of deflexion
on the scale.    As 100 volts gave 1:50 cm. with carbon cylin
ders in air (for this position of the scale), this would corre
spond to 0-0060 dyne. Thus the measured force is nearly of
the same magnitude as the calculated, but about 20 per cent.
   eater.   This is probably due in large part to the effect of
the ends of the cylinders, which tend to increase the force,
and of which no account was taken in the calculation. More
over, the electrodes being short, the field would not be quite
uniform along the axis of Z as was assumed; this would be
strictly true only for infinitely long electrodes.

volume, while they are also capable of holding certain pro
portions of carbon in quasi-solution, and withdrawing it from
precipitation in the flame. I shall call w the carbon/diluent
ratio. It is the ratio of the volume of carbon vapour present
to the sum of the volumes of the diluents. The following

   For the hydrocarbons            and elements, we suppose them
pulled to pieces, and the atoms counted, for the purpose of
estimating the proportions.            The numbers of atoms will be
proportional to the volumes of the substances, in the free
state. Neutral gases, behaving more or less in the manner of
hydrogen or nitrogen, are reckoned as if they were elements.
 This representation is only concerned with the volumes of
the substances.         Their properties are indicated by other
 means, a thus arrived at is the volume of carbon vapour in
unit volume of diluents.
   It must be observed that while the values of a employed
in my previous paper for hydrocarbons and their mixtures
 remain unchanged, in cases where diluents are concerned, as
in coal-gas and disilluminated coal-gas, the values of a to be
now employed will differ materially.
   The following tables embody the experiments of P. Frank
land on mixtures of diluents with ethylene, the values of e
being added. The figure represents them graphically.

     In mixture (4), having y          a little over 30, there is a con
siderable   deviation,     which must appear in any representation.

nearly the same value of y.                        If
                                            these are errors they may be

That which     prevails throughout the rectilinear marsh-gas
ethylene mixtures is was 1840. The illuminating value of
unit precipitated carbon in the mixtures is 2006, larger than
that of ethylene in the table (180).     It is obvious that a

mixtures differing little from marsh-gas in composition.
  Let us now examine the locus which represents the hydro

    For very small percentages of ethylene it seems that no

light is given. But long before enough carbon is absorbed to
fill         solvent capacity of the hydrogen present, light
            Raw hydrogen therefore presents a resistance to
the entire absorption of carbon of density 2.   And, as far as
we can ascertain, this resistance continues present in     the                       all
mixtures,           as       there remains unsaturated solvent capacity

predominates, and                 if taken to increase would have to be
balanced         by       a still larger resistance to absorption than that
shown.

  The number thus obtained for benzene is
                           312(1-1592)=262:4.
  For marsh-gas, y=123(25–184)=8-2(? real).
  It seems probable that the H.S.C. for C.D. 3–6 may have
slightly lessened values. But if they have, they are very
slightly lessened.  I first assumed that they would form a
geometrical series with the numbers belonging to C.D. 1 and
2; but the numbers thus obtained give rise to a value for
benzene much too low according to rigorous evidence. The
assumption of the same H.S.C. for      C.D. except leads       all                        1            to

   If  we estimate the error to be expected, by analogy from
the ethylene, at 1/7, this would give 274.                       But there is a
               that the benzene molecule may be but little
attacked by absorption, in which case the straight line would
hold more nearly than in the case of ethylene.                           So that the
value may probably be between 240 and 274, and the number
in the last paper (255, p. 125) may not be far wrong. But                            I

    The number obtained in the former paper was 177. The
rectilinear method seems likely to hold here, as there cannot
be any                  and there seems to be no change of solvent
capacity. The next step is to draw the line from the dis. gas
 point to the point which represents the hydrocarbon mixture.

    Here there is likely to be some absorption, and the calculated
 value ought to be reduced, for it lies where the true locus
 would fall below the straight line. But it is not probable that
         —-
 the correction would be so great as in the case of the ethylene
 mixtures; we have already observed on the probability of the
 smaller liability of the benzene molecule to absorption.                         The
 lower   ethylene  mixture falls below the               corresponding        straight
 line in this manner by 2 candles.                    If  we suppose the excess
 of 16-6 over 16 to       represent       the correction required in the
 case of the     gas,  it would be 1/3 of the correction for the
 corresponding ethylene mixture, which seems likely enough.

    This is very fair, for an approximate method.
    The oxygen has been omitted. The quantity is small; and
the introduction of a small quantity of oxygen into diluted
gas seems to produce a condition so different from that of the
oxygen or air dilutions of ethylene, that conclusions drawn
from the latter do not seem applicable to the former.
    Although mixtures of marsh-gas with higher illuminants
will probably be free from absorption, yet they may be
expected to show towards the top the curvature found in the
ethylene mixtures.        It has therefore occurred to me that
ethane    might    probably      be used with good results as the
foundation of     mixtures,     for obtaining rectilinear loci leading
to the C.P. values of the higher illuminants. At                   events                 all

 Line-spectrum       of Hydrogen in           the Oxyhydrogen Flame.       371
  If the  hydrogen and nitrogen mixtures stood alone, there
would be a presumption that the law of the logarithmic curves
originated in proportionality of I.W. and C.P. to temperature.
But this law does not hold for any of the other mixtures; and
in the marsh-gas mixtures the I.V. is certainly constant
through most of the range.
   It seems possible that the increased 1.V. for higher carbon
densities may be due to temperature.       But am rather     I              in
clined to look in the direction of molecular behaviour.

  spectrum      of   Hydrogen in the Owyhydrogen                 Flame.   By G.
       Live1NG,      V.P.R.S."
       a paper published in Poggendorf’s                 Annalen (1862, 4th
IN ser. vol. xxvi. p. 48)   Plücker stated that the flame of a
mixture of   oxygen  and hydrogen,   when the latter was slightly
in excess, showed the two lines of hydrogen H. and Ha.
   The passage in which this statement occurs is an episode in
a paper on recurrent electric discharges in gases at low pres
sure, and is given by way of confirmation of the
theory that the illumination of gases by the electric discharge
                                                                       ºr.
is due to the high temperature of the discharge.
    This statement seems to have been generally accepted on
Plücker's authority; but no one else, so far as I can learn,
has ever succeeded in seeing, or in photographing, any of the
lines of hydrogen in the spectrum of a flame.
 no one has,    I
                believe, distinctly challenged the correctness of
                                                                   $º.
the statement, and it is still currently taken to be true, and
inferences have been drawn from it (as to the condition of the
 solar atmosphere and other matters) which become untenable
 if Plücker was mistaken. Plücker's authority is so great that
every one hesitates to call any observation of his in question.
Moreover, it is difficult to prove a negative.    For one to suc
ceed with an   experiment   when another fails is nothing un
common.      Still spectroscopy    has made long strides since
1862, and the interests of science demand that the evidence
on this question should be reviewed.

every case he found it to be a faint continuous spectrum
extending from red to blue, fading out at both extremities,
and                in the green. No line but the yellow line of

sodium was to be seen, except when he used jets of brass.
Even in this case it was not until the metal had become a
little oxidized that any lines were visible. When this occurred
several bright lines were seen in the red, green, and blue, and
the brightest of them he found to be identical with those
produced by copper chloride in the flame of a Bunsen burner.
     In 1868 (Proc. R. S. xvi. p. 421) Frankland stated that he

pressure, gradually increasing up to ten atmospheres; and

that at the last-named pressure the spectrum of               flame was
  berfectly continuous.       He does not say what it was at the
         pressures.     Salet also (Compt. Rend. lxviii. p. 404) says
 that hydrogen burnt in oxygen gives a continuous spectrum.
     Some years ago, when examining the spectrum of the arc
 in hydrogen, given by a powerful dynamo, was struck by I
 the fact that no line of hydrogen, bright or reversed, could
 be detected, except at the moment of breaking the arc. This
 led me to look at the oxyhydrogen flame; when I found, to
 my surprise, that the hydrogen lines were absent from the
 flame.     Subsequently (Proc. R. S. xxx. p. 157) Dewar and                     I
 found that the alternating current from a De Meritens mag
 neto-electric machine, arranged for high tension, produced an
 arc in hydrogen which showed H. fairly bright and Hs as a
 faint diffuse band.        Secchi (Compt. Rend. lxxvii. p. 177)
 stated that the     negative  pole of an arc showed lines of hydro
 gen and of the metals in the carbons, and that a drop of
 water thrown on the carbons caused the hydrogen-lines to
 appear, and many others.          Subsequently we found (Proc. R.
                                                                          let

   In every case the proportion of oxygen to hydrogen was
very gradually varied, from excess of hydrogen to excess of
oxygen and rice versä ; and different parts of the flame
brought in front of the slit. This was done again and again,
but no trace of any hydrogen-line could be detected.            Except
for the D line of       sodium,   which was     always   present,  and
flashed out brightly as particles of dust entered the flame, and
for an occasional flash of the two well-known lime-bands, the
spectrum was quite continuous, extending from near C to
near G, very faint at both ends.
   When the hydrogen was in excess the flame had a reddish
tip, which may be what Plücker saw ; but the spectroscope
showed that this colour was only due to the fact that (under
these conditions) the maximum of the continuous spectrum
lay in the orange between C and D. This continuous spec
trum faded away gradually and could be traced down to
about the position of C, but there it ended, and there was
nothing like a maximum at C. When the oxygen was in                                               ex
cess the maximum of the continuous spectrum shifted into
the citron, and           I
                     could no longer trace the spectrum so low
as C. There was no maximum of brightness about F or G'.
   When the separate impinging jets were used the flame had
a curious appearance—the oxygen side had a greenish hue, the
hydrogen side a fainter orange hue.          In the mid-plane would
be the most active combustion and the hottest temperature,
and there, if anywhere, we might expect to see the hydrogen
rays developed.       l examined both the broad side and the
edge, but could see no hydrogen-line at all.          When the spec
troscope was directed on to the edge, the radiation would be
received from a considerable thickness of the hottest part of
the flame, and this would seem to be the most favourable
condition for detecting the hydrogen rays.
   Having failed to get the hydrogen rays at                    any            all   in           of
these flames    I next tried cyanogen flame burning

than the    hydrogen     flame,  and gives     brilliant spectrum

   An inspection of this table shows that above 1500° cooling
is too rapid for the interpolation method. Hence, in Table II.,
the burner was left in place, and the furnace heated to the
maximum intensity (above 1700°).        Changes of temperature
were now so    gradual   that observations could be taken every
minute, two for iridioplatinum including one for rhodio
platinum.     The means of the two former were considered
identical, as to time, with the latter.

   5. Digest.—The results of these tables have been put in
the chart, thermoelectric powers (microvolts) of iridioplati
num as abscissae, and of rhodioplatinum (microvolts) as ordi
nates.    The cold junctions are at 20°C. The consecutive
regions of temperature of the hot junctions are marked on
the curve.
   It will be seen that within 1200° the ratio of electromotive
forces is strikingly constant, viz. 0.7724+0:0016, between
340° and 1220°.       Moreover the probable error is due to
difficulties of observation, and not to any apparent march of
the data.    Platinum-iridium,  20 per cent., is thermoelectri
cally stronger than platinum-rhodium, 10 per cent., in the
ratio of 100 to 76, from which, however, it does not follow
that a 10 per cent. alloy of the former metal would be weaker
than the latter.    Thermoelectric power (caet. par.) usually
increases at a retarded rate with the quantity of the foreign
metal added to platinum.
   Between 1200° and 1700° the rhodioplatinum couple gains
thermoelectrically on the iridioplatinum couple, so that the
relation is no longer linear; but the change of curvature is
very gradual, and<U+017F> uniformly continuous.     Even above 1700°
the ratio of thermoelectric powers is (Table II.)
                                  '7774+:0016,
or only about 2 per cent. in excess of                   its   value below 1200°.

   6. Change of Curvature, incidental.—The          departure from
the linear relation of thermoelectric powers above 1200° may
of course be real. But there are agencies here at work into
which it is necessary to inquire.       In the first place, at these
excessively high temperatures the fire-clay insulators +, as
well as     all
             parts      the furnace, conduct electrically.
                             of                                                                    Itis  a
curious fact, too, that the aeid silicates, although the more
viscous, are better conductors than the more nearly liquid
basic silicates, capt. par. Thus       certain part    athe thermo                  of
electric power         possibly tapped off through the insulators.
                            is
Again, and more seriously, under the given circumstances
volta contacts are introduced, consisting,            one case,                in                        of
rhodioplatinum/silicate/platinum,     and      the other      iridio  in                      of
platinum/silicate/platinum      and         altogether improbable
                                                           It it is is
                                                ;
that these effects will      equal.        beobvious, also, that the
discrepancies       question would increase with temperature,
                        in
compatibly with the chart.      Finally, the hot gases themselves,
particularly the flame-gases, cannot            once      considered free
                                                                 at           be
from disturbing influences.
    Some experiments made                relatively low temperatures
                                                      at
with the burner                  in
                         action seem          bear out these points
                                                            to                                           of
view. Thus between 1050° and 1150°                 series of       measure
                                                                         a                7
ments led       the factor e'.0/e,0–0.7689 +0.0009;
                  to                                               measure                6
ments between 950° and 1200°                     0.07682+0.0295, to       &c.
Hence, when        flame
                       a   envelops    the  crucible, and the insulators
are hotter, the factor         apparently larger than

    Chapter IV., on “Dispersion,” contains an account, fully illus
trated, of some of the most used Spectroscopes, and an outline of
Spectroscopy—under        the title “Study of the different sources of
Light"—mainly taken from a special work by M. Salet. Then
follows an account of various methods which have been employed
for the measurement of indices of refraction, with a discussion of
the results, as of the formulae which have been proposed for con
necting the variations of the index with those of temperature and
density.    A third section of the chapter is devoted to “Achroma
tism” and instruments for measuring dispersive powers.        Dollond's
achievement is by an oversight, or misprint, dated 1557 for 1757.
Here it may be remarked that M. Violle is usually full and exact
in his references to original memoirs and their dates, as becomes a
pupil of M. Verdet; but the careful reader will occasionally miss
those verifications of statements taken, presumably, from predeces
sors; as when he is told, “Ptolémée avait constate la réciprocité des
rayons incident et réfracté:” “d'après Aristote, toute couleur était
mélange de blanc et de noir.       Ce fut aussi l'opinion de Goethe"—
without   any  reference for the statements. Or when the authority is
quoted but without addition of page or edition; as: “Roger BACON
le premier a donné la place exacte du foyer d'un miroir concave
dans son livre, dédié à Clément IV., Opus majus, 1267.” “FERMAT,
Litterae . . . . . Paris, 1667.” “KLINGENSTIERNA K. Sv. W.-Ak.
Handlingar, 1754; ” and so on. Finally, Section IV. of this im
 portant chapter deals with Colours (the true theory of which is
assigned to Malebranche), and the methods which have been given
for calculating the tint of a given mixture. Here, and in the section
 of the next chapter devoted to the Eye and Vision, reference is
 freely made to the French translation of Von Helmholtz's work on
 Physiological Optics, and to Clerk Maxwell's researches. In this,
as in several other parts of the treatise, it has been found necessary
 to anticipate some of the results of the Wave theory.
    The concluding Chapter v. is occupied with “Optical Instru
 ments” other than those described in the preceding chapters;
 preliminary to which the Eye, with the optical means of meeting
 its defects, and the Stereoscope are treated of in the first section.
 In the second section the method of treatment is founded on the
 consideration of the single equivalent lens.          The “loupe.” or
 magnifying-lens,     the eyepieces of Ramsden and Huyghens,
 Microscopes     with some account of the recent improvements,
 Refracting and Reflecting Telescopes, are successively dealt with
 in as much detail as a text-book on general Optics can afford. A
 sketch of the history of Optical Instruments, down to the “Lunette
 Coudée" of M. Loewy, occupying some six pages, follows; and a
 sketch of apparatus for Projection and Photography closes the
 volume.
    From this abstract of the contents it will appear that there
 is no English book which covers the same extent of ground with
 equal fulness of treatment and illustration.                  J. J. W.

   The rock, which is about two miles N.E. of the Little Knott rock,
formerly described by Prof. Bonney, was referred to by the author as
“a large mass of hornblende picrite of like nature" to the Little
Knott rock, in a paper published in the “Transactions’ of the
Cumberland and Westmorland Association for 1889–90.              Micro
scopic examination by Prof. Bonney of the rock which is the subject
of the present communication confirms this determination.
   The metamorphism observable around this mass is considerably
larger than that seen round the Little Knott mass.

    6. “Contributions to the Geology of the Wengen and St. Cassian
Strata in Southern Tyrol.”      By Maria M. Ogilvie, B.Sc.
    In the first part of this paper the authoress gives a summary of
 previous investigations and speculations respecting the sequence and
fossils of the Triassic rocks of the well-known Dolomitic region of
 Southern Tyrol; more especially with reference to the famous fossil
bearing strata of the neighbourhood of St. Cassian.        The different
views which have been advanced with regard to the actual mode of
 formation of these strata, and their proper classification, since the
 appearance of the classical works of Won Richthofen and Mosjisovics,
 are indicated, and their geological significance discussed.
    In the main body of the paper the authoress gives a generalized
 account of the results of her own personal study of these strata
 during the years 1891–1892, illustrating her conclusions by maps and
 sections. Three areas have been partly mapped in detail, on the scale
 of 1:25000, and the various fossiliferous zones have been traced on
 the ground.    The range and nature of the faults, &c., have in this
 way been determined.
    The typical area of Prelongei and St. Cassian is first described in
 detail, and from a careful mapping of the ground and a study of the
 fossils the authoress reaches the conclusion that the St. Cassian

strata are naturally separable into three divisions, viz.:-
       1. Upper Cassian Beds (or Prelongei Zone).
      2. Middle Cassian (or Muren Zone).
      3. Lower Cassian (or Stoures Zone).
   Each division is characterized by certain special lithological features
and palaeontological characters, everywhere recognizable.        In oppo
sition to the views of some other investigators, it is shown, by
physical and palaeontological evidence, that the Upper Cassian series
is normally succeeded, as originally asserted by Von Richthofen, by
the well-known Schlern Dolomite, and that between this band and the
massive Dachstein-Kalk there is invariably found the peculiar zone
of the Raibl strata.
   The physical and paleontological relationships of the disputed
strata of the Richthofen Riff and Sett Sass are next discussed.       The
richly fossiliferous strata of Heiligenkreuz are shown to include
rocks belonging to             all

     10.   “On the Basalts and Andesites of Devonshire, known as
Felspathic Traps.”     By Bernard Hobson, Esq., M.Sc., F.G.S.
   The evidence in favour of the contemporaneous (non-intrusive)
character of these Permian (or Triassic) lavas is discussed, and the
improbability of the former existence of felspathic traps in the area
of the Dartmoor granite, as suggested by Mr. R. N. Worth, is shown.
The macroscopical and microscopical characters of the rocks are
described.    The great majority of the rocks examined are olivine
basalts, though mica-augite-andesite occurs at Killerton, near Exeter.
The presence of quartz-inclusions     in the rocks of West Town,
Knowle, &c. near Exeter is shown to have misled De la Beche into
terming these rocks quartz- (‘quartziferous ') porphyries.        The
 veins in the traps, mentioned by Mr. Vicary, and regarded by some
authors as intrusive felsite dykes, are found to be red-stained veins
of calcite and sandstone.
  11. “Notes on Recent Borings for Salt and Coal           in the Tees
Salt-District.” By Thomas Tate, Esq., F.G.S.
   The Tees Salt industry has expanded considerably since Mr.
E. Wilson's exhaustive paper was read in June 1888.
   The results of subsequent borings have in most cases simply con
firmed previously ascertained facts, but the two boreholes with
which this paper principally deals, put down on the White House
estate, 3 miles due west of Stone Marsh, may be useful in relation
to the determination of (a) the area of the Tees Salt-field, and
(b) the southern limit of the Durham Coal-basin.
   After boring through 115 feet of Drift deposits and 151 feet of
Red Sandstones and Marls, the Saliferous Marls, at the base of
which the Salt-rock, when present, is usually found sandwiched
between two beds of anhydrite, were reached, having a thickness of
178 feet, but with no Rock-salt.      The Magnesian Limestone for
mation, only 299 feet thick, an unusually large proportion of which
is gypsum or anhydrite, was succeeded by grey sandstones, rich in
calcite, probably due to infiltration. The carbonaceous shales and
sandstones with bands of encrinital limestones below these, to
gether with their contained fossils, determine their identity with
the Yoredale Series. Total depth, 107.94 feet.
   The chief results are:—(1) the Upper Keuper Red Marls are
wanting (as in nearly every borehole north of the Tees); (2) the
Salt-rock is absent and the Red Marl overlying      itshorizon      not
                                                                   is
‘rotten marl’ but compact; (3) the Magnesian Limestone (299 feet)
is the thinnest complete section  in  County Durham    ;(4)   nocoal     is
found; (5) the Yoredale Rocks are represented     by3364 feet     grey

sandstones and encrinital limestones, carbonaceous shales, ironstone
nodules and carbonaceous sandstones.

                     TREATISE     ON   OPTICAL PHYSICS.

                                                  United University Club,
    GENTLEMEN,                       -               August 4th, 1892.
    T  is to be regretted that the anonymous author of the review of
       my treatise on Physical Optics has not adopted the manly and
 straightforward course of appending his name to the review.            No
 reasonable person can complain of legitimate criticism; but surely
those principles of fair play, which happily prevail amongst English
 gentlemen, require that an assailant who has made rather a severe
attack upon my book should disclose his identity.
    It   would be hazardous to speculate whether the anonymous
 reviewer belongs to a school of thought which has on more than
 one occasion come forward as the satirist of Cambridge Mathe
 matics, and which, if I mistake not, has its headquarters in the
 capital of the northern portion of this Island; or whether he hails
 from a part of the United Kingdom whose political constitution
 will shortly be the subject of much discussion.          If, however, he
 will   lay aside the bias which he     evidently entertains against Cam
bridge text-books, and will read more carefully the work of one
 who still looks back with gratitude upon the admirable system of
 instruction provided by the University of Cambridge,          I  think he
will find that the “skeleton’’ is by no means devoid of flesh, nor
is it in a state of nudity.
    The ancient school of investigators postulated the existence of a
medium, or aether; but their ideas were not sufficiently clear to
enable them to construct a satisfactory dynamical theory.             They
succeeded, however, in explaining a variety of phenomena relating
to isotropic media; they discovered the form of the wave-surface
in biaxal crystals; and they accounted for the production of
coloured rings by thin crystalline plates.          But I should be very
much surprised to find any modern physicist who would attempt
to justify the dynamical reasoning upon which Fresnel attempted
to base his theory; and there are grounds for thinking that he
originally discovered his wave-surface by an inductive method,
founded upon the construction of Huygens' for uniaxal crystals.
    The modern school of investigators commenced with Green, who
                       I
did the one thing have so strongly insisted upon, and which the
anonymous reviewer describes as the foolish process of writing
down equations.        Green formulated a definite hypothesis concern
ing the physical constitution of the aether; he thereby obtained
the equations of motion of the medium ; and he solved them both
in the case of an isotropic medium and a doubly refracting one.
Further research has undoubtedly shown that Green's theory is
defective, since it furnishes several results which are inconsistent
with experiment; but the fact that Green did write down his

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              387
equations and integrate them, enabled a variety of results to be
explained which altogether puzzled the older investigators, and
would probably have remained a mystery to this day had it not
been for the industry and skill of the despised mathematicians.
    If the anonymous reviewer will read through chapters XI., xiv.,
and xv., he will find that the physical constitution of the aether
according to Green's theory, and also according to Lord Kelvin's
modification of Lord Rayleigh's theory, is fully explained; and
that the principal mathematical developments are given, and dis
cussed in relation to experimental phenomena.          What more can
he want?
   The next stage in the history of the subject consists in the
attempt to account for dispersion and absorption by means of the
mutual reaction between aether and matter.           The physical idea
which lies at the root of such theories is so  exceedingly simple, that
it would be difficult for a person  afflicted with the most exuberant
verbosity to write more than a page or two of general talk upon
the subject. The real difficulty lies in attempting to express this
idea in a mathematical form, as will be seen by consulting the
somewhat voluminous German literature upon the subject.                I
decided, after some consideration, to confine myself to the theories
of Lord Kelvin and von Helmholtz. The former theory is espe
cially valuable, because it enables us to construct a mechanical
model of a medium which produces anomalous dispersion; whilst
the latter theory, besides giving a partial explanation of selective
reflexion, enables us to place Cauchy's formulae for metallic reflexion
on a dynamical basis.
                   I
   In conclusion, will give an example which shows how necessary
it is to cover up the nakedness of the physical skeleton with
mathematical clothing. Many years ago the hypothesis was for
mulated (by Lord      Kiin, I  believe) that magnetic force was the
effect of something in the nature of rotation. So far so good; but
in the absence of the fructifying influence of mathematical analysis
the idea would have remained as barren as a seed lying in the
desert.   There is no à priori reason for supposing that rotation of
the medium would produce rotation of the plane of polarization of
aethereal waves; for it might equally well have happened that it
would change a plane-polarized wave into a single elliptically pola
rized wave.     But, thanks to mathematical analysis, we now know
that rotation of the plane of polarization is a necessary consequence
of rotation of the medium.
   The reviewer has finally come forward as an authority on style.
How far he is competent to assume that character may be judged
from the following quotations:—“But, as the author in his preface
says” (then follows a passage from my book concluding with a full
stop). “This last, by the way, is one of the extraordinary state
ments.” “The entirely admirable text-book of Mr. Preston.”

    ON  THE DETERMINATION                   OF THE DIELECTRIC    CONSTANT OF
           CONDUCTING           LIQUIDS.          BY W. STSCHEGTIA   EFF.
    To avoid the errors caused by absorption and the conductivity of
the dielectric, it is necessary to use electrical oscillations of as short
 period as possible, or to arrange the experiment so that the errors                -
 mutually compensate each other. The author prefers the second
 method. The condenser is formed of three disks, two of which
are fixed vertically at 5 millim. from each other, and the third can                |
 be displaced parallel to itself, this latter and one of the two fixed
 disks are connected with the electrodes of a Ruhmkorff, while the
central disk is put to earth through a sort of Geissler's tube formed
 of a small ineandescent lamp of 5 volts, the filament of which has
 been broken by too strong a current.                 This apparatus placed quite
 near the disk is extremely sensitive to electrical oscillations, the
 presence of which is shown by a light like that of Geissler's tubes,
 while the static discharge of the condenser produces a spark.
    If the two extreme disks are not arranged so as to form two
 condensers of equal capacity with that of the middle, this latter is                s
charged and the lamp is illuminated; by varying the distance of
 the movable disk this light can be annulled; it reappears when
the desired position has been passed.                  In order to diminish this
error the mean a of the two distances is taken. If between the two
stationary disks of the condensers a layer of a dielectric of thick
ness d is interposed the constant of which is D, the movable disk
 must be displaced through a length a in order to make the light
 disappear. We have the equations
                                                d          al            -

different spheres were used in the different experiments.    The
smaller sphere was suspended from a fine wire and arranged,
as represented in the figure, so that the condenser was receiving
a charge only when the spheres were in contact. The con
denser was charged by allowing the smaller sphere to swing
against the larger ºrebound.         The length of time that the
condenser was receiving a charge could be varied either by
varying the size of the smaller sphere, by varying the number
of times the spheres were brought in contact, or by varying
the velocity of the smaller sphere at the time of contact.    The
charge of the condenser was measured by allowing it to dis
charge through a Siemens and Halske high-resistance astatic
galvanometer and observing the throw of the needle.
   A few preliminary experiments showed the important part
played by the resistance of the charging circuit in determi
ning the charge given to the condenser in any given time.

392               Dr. W. L. Robb       on Oscillations
charge which the condenser eventually assumes when charged
for a considerable time. These variations and their character
seemed to indicate that, during the charging of a condenser,
oscillations occurred in the charge.               y variation in the
velocity of the smaller sphere at the moment of contact would
vary the time of contact, and consequently the charge given
to the condenser.     Owing to the character of the suspension
of the smaller sphere it was found that, even when the greatest
care possible was taken, slight variations in the time of contact
would occur.
   If the  relation  between  the charge      of a condenser and the
time of charging were represented by a curve such as that
given in fig. 2 (see Table XI.), owing to the variation in the
                               Fig.    2.

time of contact of the spheres that always occurs in a series
of observations, a series of determinations would give us, not
the charge corresponding to any single definite time, but the
charges corresponding to a series of different times comprised
between limits a and b, a denoting the shortest and b the
longest time of contact.     Further, the greatest difference in
the  charges   observed would be an indication of the amplitude
of the oscillations corresponding to the time of contact.
    The following analytical consideration of the charging of a
 condenser shows that oscillations in the charge should occur;
and indicates how the oscillations are related to the time of
charging, the resistance and self-induction of the circuit, the
electromotive force of the charging battery, and to the
capacity of the condenser.

Equation (8) is only exact on the assumption that the capacity
of a condenser is independent of the time. The capacity being
a function of the time", the equation is simply valuable as
indicating the general character of the oscillations, and how
their amplitude should be influenced by changes in the values
of any of   the various quantities that enter into the expression
for the   amplitude.
    From equation (8) we have the amplitude of the oscilla
                       – “t

 tions equal to  — TR2U'            From this it would follow that
 an increase in the amplitude of the oscillations in the differ
 ence of potential of the two surfaces of the condenser corre
 sponds to a decrease in the time or of the resistance, and to
 an increase in either the electromotive force, the coefficient
 of self-induction, or the capacity.
    The following determinations, which are to be considered
 simply as qualitative in their nature, were made to see in how
 far the observed variations in the charge followed laws similar
 to those given by equation (8) for variations in the difference
 of potential of the two surfaces of the condenser. Two con
 densers were used in these experiments.          One was a standard
 microfarad mica     condenser,     manufactured by Carpentier of
 Paris, and subdivided into 0-5, 0.2,0.2, and 0.1 microfarad.
 The other was a microfarad paraffin condenser, manufactured
 by the Société d'exploitation des cables électriques of Cor
taillod, Switzerland.

                    1.  Effect  of Diminishing       the   Time.
     A series of determinations was made to find the effect of
 diminishing the time of contact of the spheres (see fig. 1)
 upon the variations observed in the charge of the condenser.
 #.     simplest way of varying with certainty the time of con
 tact was to use, as the smaller sphere, spheres of different
 sizes.    An increase in the diameter of the sphere lengthens
 the time of contact. Three different spheres were used, and
 in Tables II. and       III.  the results of twenty consecutive obser
 vations with each sphere are given.                    In the actual work,
 however, at least fifty observations were always taken to ensure
 that the observations given in the following tables were
 representative       in their character and included the extreme
 variations.

                2. Effect    of varying     the Resistance.
   A  series of determinations was made to find the effect of
varying the resistance of the charging circuit upon the varia
tions observed in the charge of the condenser. The resistance
was varied by changing the suspension of the sphere S2 (see
fig. 1). In one set the suspension was a single silver wire,
0.05 millim. in diameter and 6 centim. long.                        In a second
set a band made      up   of ten such silver       wires,   and    consequently
having only one tenth the resistance, was used. In the third
set a single platinum wire 0.05 millim. in diameter and 6
centim. long was substituted for the usual suspension of silver
wire.   The results obtained with these various resistances are
given in Tables IV. and W.

    Inorder to determine the effect of varying the electromo
tive force of the battery used in charging upon the variations
in the charge, two sets of observations were made.       In one
set the battery used consisted of five accumulators joined in
multiple arc. In the second set the battery consisted of fifteen
accumulators joined in multiple arc in groups of five, and the
resultant groups joined in series; in       other respects the      all
conditions under which the two sets of observations were made
were identical.   Tables VI. and VII. give the results     these                            of
observations.

   An inspection of Tables VI. and VII., and of the graphical
representation of these observations given in diagram 4, shows
that the variations in the charge are increased when the
electromotive force of the battery used in charging the con
denser is increased.
                           4. Effect   of rarying     the Self-induction.
  In  order to determine the effect of varying the self-induction
                º
in the charging circuit two sets of observations were made.
In the first set, No. 7 B.W.G. copper wire was used in making
the circuit, and the total length of copper wire used was
50 centim. In the second set an additional piece of copper
wire, of the same diameter and 120 centim. in length, was
included in the circuit, making the total length of copper
wire 170 centim. In this way the self induction was increased
without                altering the resistance. Tables VIII. and
 IX. give the results of these observations.

   The resistance of the circuit in this determination was about
0.03 ohm, and the condenser was charged by means of the
well-known von Helmholtz pendulum", manufactured                        by
L.   Zimmermann,          of   Heidelberg.             The usual manner of

 The binding-posts denoted by P and the metal parts attached
 to them were insulated from each other by being fastened to
 hard rubber bases.    As arranged, the circuit was completed
 by A coming in contact with the lever C, and broken by B
 coming in contact with the lever D.       In order to insure
 good contacts the surfaces at the points where the circuit was
 made and broken were plated with gold.      By means of the
 micrometer-screw attached to one of the hard rubber bases,
 the time between the contacts      that made and broke the
 circuit could be varied. One     complete    turn of the drum,
 which was subdivided into one hundred divisions, corre
 sponded to a difference in time of contacts, and consequently
 to a duration of charge of 0 00018 second. The result of
 this determination accords fully with the earlier results ob
 tained with the mica condensers. In the determinations with
 a paraffin condenser, described in the first part of this article,
 the observed charges were usually considerably smaller than
 the normal charge, and than the charges given to the mica
 condenser under the same conditions.      It is therefore to be
 expected that, when the determination just described is
 repeated with a paraffin condenser, a curve will be obtained
 differing somewhat from that obtained for the mica condenser.
    The above work was carried out in the laboratory of Prof.
 H. F. Weber, at Zürich, and I take this opportunity of
 thanking him for his kindness in permitting me to use the
 laboratory at    times, and for his numerous valuable sug

may be resolved are represented as before by cos ot. cosnt.
There is of course one case in which these complications fail
to occur, i.e. when the axis of rotation coincides with the
axis of vibration ; but with axes distributed at random we
must expect vibrations (n +                     0
                               to be almost as important as
the vibration n. The law of distribution of brightness in the
spectral line would probably be exponential, as when the
widening is due to motion of molecules as wholes in the line
of sight.

effects.   If v be the linear velocity of a molecule and V that
of  light, the comparison is between o and no/V, or between
o and v/A.             If
                   r be the radius of a molecule, the circum
ferential velocity of rotation is or, and we may compare or
with wr/A.    Now, according to Boltzmann's theorem, ro would
be of the same order of magnitude as v, so that the import
ance of the rotatory and linear effects would be somewhat
as A : r. There is every reason to suppose that A is much
greater than r, and thus                  (if

escaping from the liquid, since there is nothing to alter this
condition of things, as the molecules of the dissolved sub

assuming a homogeneous composition of the solution, the
theory     of chances shows that only the fraction                                       Nº. of the    a
molecules which get suitable opportunities will be molecules
of the solvent, and therefore able to escape. Thus we have

v will be very small in comparison with N +n.                So that we
may write, in accordance with Raoult's Law :—              .
For concentrated solutions,        v  will be greater and     Nº. will
not be   a small fraction, so that in this case it is just possible
tº will have an appreciable effect, in which case we should
have

where k is less than unity.           But as r will evidently never
become of much      importance     in comparison with N + n, k will
never deviate far from      unity,   as Raoult observed.
   In the above investigation, v stands for the number of
molecules gained by the liquid.             But it is evident v is con
nected with the    change    of  vapour-pressure.      At first, number
of molecules   per   unit volume of     vapour=\f.       Denoting time
by t, the rate at which the liquid gains
                                                     molecules=–A.
Hence the number of molecules gained by the liquid from
volume V of vapour in time t is expressed by
                          t=td;
                -vº<U+017F>     t=0 d t dt = WA(f—f")=v.
Thus we have    :-

                      N + n+    VA(f—f")

                                                  f
   This expression assumes that the whole volume V remains
saturated.
   Assuming that the fundamental equation of the kinetic
theory of gases is applicable to the space occupied by the
vapour (and the liquid surface acts towards the vaporous
space just as if it were an immovable wall), it is easily seen
that

square of the molecules (the pressures        f and f" being measured

ordinate of our gauge at a distance of about a metre from the
apex.    It is instructive to observe that even this enlarged
interval is ultra-visible, and that in this so-called extreme
vacuum there remain something like a million millions of mole
cules of the gas in every cubic millimetre of the space within
 the receiver—i.e. about a thousand in every cubic micron.

a molecule. By this is to be understood the distance within

sensibly to deflect each other's path. This size of         gaseous                                  the

     IX. Of the        Smallest Magnitudes that have                  been   Measured.
   The most minute magnitudes that have been actually
measured are differences of wave-length.       These can be de
termined with   truly astonishing precision by  observations with
the diffraction-grating spectroscope, so much so that they
carry us down to magnitudes that are fractions of the diameter
of a gaseous molecule. The observation is most easily made
in the case of close double lines. In these the interval be
tween the two constituents is due to the difference of their
wave-lengths, and by measuring the former the latter can be
ascertained. Thus, an interval of one degree on Angström’s
or Rowland's map indicates a difference of wave-length
amounting to a tenthet-metre, which, as we know, is the
ordinate of our standard gauge at a distance of a millimetre
from its end.     But lines have been seen to be double with
Prof. Rowland's gratings, in which the separation of the two
constituents is not more than from 1/30th to 1/100th part of
a degree.   In the latter case the difference of wave-length is
only one twelfthet-metre.     This is the ordinate of our gauge
at a distance from its apex which is little more than the
diameter of a single blood-corpuscle, and may be taken to be
the smallest measurement that can as yet be directly   - effected
with certainty.

   This last is about the closest double that my spectroscope
will resolve. There is no micrometer on my instrument, so
that I cannot give measures, but I estimate the coarsest of
these, those first mentioned, to have a difference of wave
length under two eleventhet-metres—and in the closest, that
last mentioned, it cannot be more than a very few twelfthet
 metres.   Most of them could be measured with a good
micrometer.
   This can be accomplished with one of the smaller of
Professor Rowland's splendid gratings ; and he himself and
other observers have carried matters farther, by taking pho
tographs with the best of his great six-inch concave gratings,

which are ultra-visible events.          These are facts which every
biologist should keep constantly before his mind when carry
ing out his investigations and interpreting them, and especially

when he is tempted either to speak or think of “undifferen
tiated protoplasm.”
   4.         more striking instance is presented when we
consider the operations                 º
                            the human mind.      Here   will                      I
make    the usual assumption, that every perception or other
thought in the mind is accompanied by a physical event
occurring in the brain, which is connected with it in such a
way that neither presents itself without the other. Of this
event we know that it is of a kind that arises only in living
brains and in them only while the man is either awake or
dreaming. We also know that it is of a kind that lasts for a
considerable    time when it does occur, viz. throughout the
duration of the perception or other thought in the mind.
   This last consideration is very significant.         The event in
the brain with which human perception or any other human
thought is associated must be one which can last while the
thought lasts, i. e. for a time immensely long when compared
with the original molecular events that are going on. The
event may, for example, be such an event as a strain conse
quent on a stress, whether dynamical or electromagnetic,
acting on some part of the brain ; or it may be of the nature
of a forced vibration or current. These are events which
would continue in existence so long as the stress is applied,
and will cease when the stress is removed : they fulfil the
requisite time conditions.      Another event which would fulfil
the time conditions is an undulation—dynamical,                electro
magnetic, or of any other kind. The waves that make up an
undulation may continue in it but a short time, some passing
off while others come on, and the motions or stresses of whic
each wave consists may be such as succeed each other with
extreme rapidity, while                all

All  such events fulfil the necessary condition of continuing
temporarily in existence, as each of our thoughts does, for a
time which may be immensely long compared with the funda
mental events within or between the molecules, or in the
interfused aether.   It must, however, be borne in mind that
it is upon these fundamental events that the whole super
structure rests; and that stream effects are in relation to
them of the nature of very small outstanding residual events
which remain over, when the rest—the great bulk of the
events that are actually happening—are                                             such as balance one
another".
     It
      is evident that it is among protracted events such as
those spoken of in the last paragraph that we must search for
the physical event in the brain with which human thought is
associated.   It is also evident that it is with but a very small
selection out of the vast number of such events occurring in
the brain during life, that the thoughts of which man is
conscious can be directly associated.    All the rest of the
innumerable stream events, and        the underlying funda          all
mental events within and between the individual molecules,
go     on    besides.

   WHIS is a contribution     to the investigation of the most
      general conditions under which the exponential law of
error is fulfilled ; together with some applications to the
theory of “correlated averages”f.
   I. The simplest case in which a group of measurable objects
range in conformity with the law of error is where every
member of the group is a sum of a certain number of items,
or elements, each of which has or has not a certain quality, e.g.
the colour white, or, as it may be expressed, assumes the value 1
or 0, with a certain average frequency (e.g. 1 just as often—
or half as often—as 0, in the long run) and at random, or in

changes in my brain; and the term                  means that other portion of
the autic universe which is shadowed by all the other events that happen
objectively in my brain.    It appears from physical considerations that the
particular stream effects or other changes in the brain that were the
shadows of the perceptions                   I

such wise that the value assumed by one item does not affect
that of another.    This is a case fully discussed by the classical
writers on   Probabilities;   under the guise of problems relating
to games of chance.       Thus if we take several batches of balls,
every batch containing n balls, each of which is either black
or white, the probability of a white being p”; then the fre
quency of white balls is approximately represented by a curve
of error, of which the centre corresponds to mp, the most pro
bable number of white balls in a batch, and the modulus is
 V2np(1-p).                     I
                    venture to refer to my reproduction, in a
former number of this Journal f, of Poisson's reasoning on
this problem, in order to recall a proposition which will be
required here : namely, that the limits, on either side of
mp, up to which the approximation holds good are of the
order Vnt.
     II.
       An easy transition brings us to a more general case in
which each item has any finite limits a, and a, (a greater than 2).
These limits need not be identical for each item; provided that
the range of any one item, say a,—2, is small in comparison
with the sum of the ranges S(a, -a,).       Nor are we confined to
the supposition that each item should assume one or other of
two values a, and a, ; it may assume any one of an indefinite
number of values indicated by the curve of distribution
y, = f(a), representing the frequency with which the rth
element assumes each value ºr ; wheref, may have any form
whatever, continuous or not, provided that it does not extend
beyond a, and                   ar,
                    and that the integral between those limits
is unity.    Moreover,         allowable                        to
                                            affect each item with
                                           it    is                                              a
different factor     “weight”; provided that

434              Prof. F. Y. Edgeworth on the
meters (the centré and the modulus) for the primary and for
the dislocated curves ; namely, from the Arithmetic mean,
and from the distance between certain percentiles which are
given by observation.    In the primary group, above the point
69'5 occur 305   observations, 305 of the total thousand ; and
below the point 66.5 occur 264 observations, 264 of the total.
Whence between the Mean and the point 69-5 there should
occur 5–305 = 195 of the total; and between the Mean
and the point 66'5, 236 of the total. Now it is found from
the tables that 195 of the total number corresponds to 361
of the Modulus, 236 of the total to 447 of the Modulus.
Accordingly we have '808 (= 361 + 447) modulus, equated
to the interval between 66.5 and 69-5 inches = 3 inches.
Whence the modulus = 3-i-'808=3-71 inches.
   Let us now apply this result to predict the number of
observations at particular heights (not too near the ex
tremity, where the fulfilment of the Probability-curve is not
to be looked for). To predict the number above 70.5 (which
gives the number between 69-5 and 70°5, the number above
69'5, being already taken for granted) we are to employ the
Arithmetic mean, which is 68.20. 70.5–68.2–2–3 inches
 ="62 modulus. Now, according to the Tables, the proportion
outside the point which is at a distance of '62 modulus from
the Mean=}(1—6194) of the total = } x 380 x 1000 = 190.
The real number is 184.
   To find the number above 71-5 we have 71-5–68.2–3–3
inches = 89 modulus; corresponding to $(1–7918) of the
total= }'2082 x 1000–104. The real number is also 104.
   Proceeding similarly with the lower limb, to predict the
number below 65.5, we have 682–65.5–27 =nearly '728
modulus; corrresponds to (1–16971) total = }:302 x 1000
 = 151. Whereas the real number is 147.
   By parity we find below 64-5, 79 by calculation, against
                            -
 72 observed.
   The question is now whether we shall fare equally well when
we apply the same method to the group which is formed by
squaring each observation in the manner explained.          By
parity of calculation the modulus of the new curve x 808
                 =(69.5°–66.5°) inches =408.
Whence the new modulus =505 inches. Also the Arithmetic
mean of the new group is 4657-38.      Accordingly, to predict
the number of observations above (70°5)” we have
           4970.25–4657:38-312:87–62 modulus.
 Whence the calculated number is 190, exactly the same result

                   Law of Error and Correlated Averages.                                                            435
 as before.           By parity the number above (71.5)? is calculated to
 be 102.
   With regard to the lower limb, in order to predic, the
 number below 65.5°, we have 4657:38–4290:25 = 367-13–1727
                                                        -
 modulus, which corresponds to
#(1-(-6914+7 x 0007)) x 1000–4(1-6961) x 1000–152;
a result which is wider than the former result from the true
 figure 147 by only an unit. For the number below (64.5)”
 there is found by parity a result not much worse than that
 which was obtained from the primary observations.
      Ihave applied a similar test to the group which is formed
 by cubing the original observations.      The results of both
 verifications are embodied in the annexed Table * :—

            j       Prof. F. Y. Edgeworth on the
 standing * that each number of men, e.g. 155, entered against a
 certain height, e. g. 67 inches, means that there were 155 men
 between           and 67-5 inches) is 67.023. The Arithmetic
 mean of the squares is 4498.671, very nearly the square of
 the primary Arithmetic mean, viz. 4492.08.             Also the Arith
metic mean of the cubes is not far from the cube of the
Arithmetic mean.
    Similar verifications would no doubt be obtained, if we
employed, for F, any other simple, function, e.g. c log E or
ce-F. The limits within which the rule may be expected
to hold will appear, if we consider an exception.            Let
               ==(x-X),        and  F(X)=(w-X)*={*

of these measurements               not range under such a curve.

        LI.   Further Data on Colour-Blindness.-No.                     II.
                 By Dr. William Polk, F.R.S.*
  N the July number                the Phil. Mag., seeing the
                                    of
      importance     that had been attached to the subject of
Colour-blindness, I contributed some data as to certain early
investigations of my own.        Since that time the interest in
the matter has been much increased by the prominence given
to it at the late meeting of the British Association in Edin
burgh, and by criticisms made on some of the views still held
on it in this country.       It may therefore be useful to invite
more attention than has yet been given, to opinions
expressed on it by foreign writers of eminence and authority
who have made it their special study ; and I propose to add
some notes with this object.
  I    will begin with a writer whose reputation as physicist,
physiologist, and practical oculist was second to none,—
the late Professor F. C. Donders of Utrecht.            He took
great interest in Colour-blindness,        made many valuable
investigations, and wrote much thereupon.       The position he
took was    peculiarly  independent.   He embraced and strongly
advocated Young's trichromic theory, but entirely dissented
from the application of it so commonly made to dichromic
 vision.   At the same time, though he agreed with some of
 Hering's fundamental principles, he opposed his colour theory.
 And, consistently enough, having objected to the current
explanations, he brought forward a hypothesis of his own,
remarkable for       originality and
                    its                            its
                                          consonance with modern
biological science.
    Professor Donders came over        the meeting
                                               to      the British of
Medical Association        Cambridge
                           at              August 1880, and gave
                                                    in
there an able lecture on Colour; but his views are still but
little known here. They are contained chiefly                 in
                                                     two elaborate
articles, namely:—

rated “fundamental" energies, corresponding to red, green,
and violet, which is essentially the Young-Helmholtz doctrine.
   He describes the phenomena of dichromic vision, according
to the testimony of patients (laying some stress on my own
case), confirmed by his own experiments and observations.
But he prefers to denote the contrasting colours as “warm"
and “cold * respectively.
   He then discusses at some length (what is the most im
portant part of his work for our purpose here, namely), “The
connexion between the Normal and the Abnormal Systems,”
and he puts the question thus:–
   Is one of the energies belonging to the normal system wanting
in the dichromic system? Or, in other words, Does every di
chromic system consist of two of the energies of the trichromic
system     2
     Maxwell and Helmholtz assumed this;–and they believed they
found     it   so.
   After discussing at some length the reasonings and calcula
tions of Maxwell and Helmholtz, the author continues:—
   Now do these facts prove that the colour wanting in colour
blindness is generally one of the fundamental colours ?
   We call those colours fundamental which do not spring from
others, but are necessary to form others.    We assume that every
fundamental colour shall base     specific    its

   Edmund Rose was the first to point out this difficulty in the
application of Young's theory, but he was, in my opinion, quite
wrong in inferring that this was fatal to the theory. The retina
is not a thing formed by human hands. It is not an instrument
with three strings, one of which is broken for the colour-blind.
It is a living instrument—genitum non factum—whose three differ
ently-tuned strings have developed themselves in combination with
each other.    If one is absent, then the tuning of both the others is
certainly not what it would have been under a regular develop
ment of the whole.

   From these extracts it is clear that he agrees in the
view, drawn from observation, that the colours seen in
dichromic vision are, generally speaking, yellow and blue, and
he does not consider that there is any such connexion between
the dichromic and the normal vision as should require them
to be otherwise.
      But he goes farther, and puts forward a view of                                              his   own,

sensation       is   absent, and the dichromic ring extends,                                         as   in

states are absent, and these are the very rare people with
vision of light and shade only.
   Donders even thinks that he can trace, within the ocular
 area, a vestige of a difference of the kind existing between
 red and green blindness, the former having a shortened
 spectrum, and the latter being a stage nearer perfect vision,
 which, if it were established, would be an additional element
in the analogy. The idea of a complete system of evolution
 for colours might then be sketched out somewhat as follows:–
    1. Achromic vision (light and shade only).
    2. Dichromic imperfect vision (called “Red-blindness”:
short spectrum, low sensitiveness to the long-waved rays).
    3. Dichromic perfect vision (called “Green-blindness”:
longer spectrum, full sensitiveness to the long-waved rays).
   4. Trichromic imperfect vision (as pointed out by Lord
Rayleigh), with low sensitiveness to certain colours.
   5. Trichromic perfect vision.
   These classes would be subject to intermediate gradations,
as in other evolutionary development.
   Looked upon in this way, colour-blindness would be only
an imperfect development of normal vision, not springing out
of it,   asthe Young-Helmholtz explanation would suggest, but
antecedent         to   it.

                                              of
 Dr. Nietzki and now generally adopted. The first chapter deals
 with nitro-compounds and comprises such well-known dyestuffs                                                              as
 picric acid, dinitronaphthol, acid naphthol yellow, &c. The large
 and important class               azo-dyes form the subject

author, as will be found on reference to the original paper.
    Oxyquinones, such as the important anthraquinone dyestuffs
and the quinoneoximes, formerly known as nitrosophenols, form
the subject of the third chapter.        The author here unreservedly
accepts the isonitroso-formula of Goldschmidt.        The fourth chapter
deals with Ketoneimides and        Hydrazides, the sole representative of
the former class of       compounds    being  auramine,   and the latter
class being represented by tartrazine.
    The derivatives of Triphenylmethane form the subject of the
fifth chapter, and are dealt with under the three headings of
Rosaniline      Dyestuffs, Rosolic Acid Dyestuffs, and Phthaleins.
 Owing to the large number of colouring-matters comprised under
 this group this is necessarily one of the longest chapters in the
 book, extending over about 40 pages.       The sixth chapter is devoted
 to the Quinoneimides, viz. Indamines, Indophenols, and Thiazines,
 the latter comprising the well-known Methylene Blue of Caro.
 In this same chapter the author includes the oxyindamines or
 oxazines, typified by the first known member of the series, Naphthol
 Blue or Meldola's Blue.        In accordance with his own researches
 Dr. Nietzki also comprises the dichroines or Liebermann's Phenol
  dyestuffs in this chapter.
     The Azines, treated of as Eurhodines, Eurhodols, Saffranines,
  Magdala red, and Mauveine, constitute the seventh chapter, which
  is also of considerable length.       A short chapter, the eighth, is
  devoted to Aniline Black, a subject on which the author is well
  known to be an authority.        Chapter IX. treats of Indulines and
  Nigrosines; Chapter X. of the Quinoline and Acridine dyestuffs,
  and it is of interest to note that the author includes the natural
  dyestuff berberine in this group, to which it is evidently related,
  since it gives pyridine-tricarbonic acid on oxidation.      Indigo dye
  stuffs are discussed at some   length in Chapter  XI., and an excellent
  summary of Prof. von Baeyer's results is given. In Chapter XII.,
  devoted to Euxanthic Acid and Gallo<U+017F>lavine, we notice the objection
  able Teutonism :-"Euxanthic acid contains as chromogen the
   rest (sic) of diphenyleneketone-oxide.”     Canarine is dealt with in
   a short page constituting Chapter XIII., and a similar Chapter
   (XIV.) suffices for Murexide. The dyestuffs of unknown con
   stitution forming the subject of Chapter XV. are Haematoxylin,
   Haematein, Brazilin, Morin, Quercitrin, Archil and Litmus,
   Cochineal, Catechu, and several other well-known and largely-used
   vegetable colouring-matters.      Any of these may, with the advance
   ment of chemical science, have their constitution explained or even
   become transferred to the true tar-products before the appearance
   of the next edition of the work.
      In an industry of such importance, and we may add of such
   great scientific interest as that of the coal-tar colouring-matters,

the self-induction of short pieces of wire or rod.          It is now
generally known that the impedance in even large copper rods or
strips may be enormous, and that when there is a condensing
a tion and rapid discharge, great surging of electricity may take
place and the potential differences which may exist between
different parts of such rods may be enormous. The currents on
the outsides of conductors may fuse the metal when there is no
current and no heating inside. We are led to the use of round
rods of iron because their strength and endurance are of more
importance than any other qualities.      The reader of this book sees
clearly how Dr. Lodge was led to the study of those electric
oscillations which Prof. Hertz began to consider a year or so
previously.    It is good that these lectures and papers and extracts
from discussions before learned societies should be published in a
book form.    Now that they are published, it would be good to
have a much smaller book published with those parts left out
 which are merely historically interesting.

axis as the Quaternion":      viz. if A is less than a quadrant,
a=a (cos. A. a, index 0 + sin. A. a, index r<U+017F>2).       Here it may
be of interest to recall Hamilton's original definition as given
in the Phil. Mag. for July 1844, viz.: Q=w-Hir-Hjy+kz, where
i"= –1   ... j=-ji=k...      and no linear relation connects i,      k.                                     j,
The later definition (adopted in the ‘Lectures’ and “Elements ')
of a Quaternion as the operator which changes one vector into

as the quotient of two vectors.   Sums and Products of Quaternions
are then dealt with and “Quaternion Exponentials.”             “Scalar
Differentiation,” “Matrices,” “Wector Differentiation,” and “Gene
ralized Addition” occupy the concluding fifteen pages of what is
thus a tolerably complete monograph on the bases of the Calculus
written from the point of view which commends itself to the
author.    That all          !.

has been one of the most prolific suggestions in organic chemistry
since the “benzene theory” of Kekulé.        The article concludes
with some suggested changes in the terminology of the subject
which chemists will do well to consider carefully whether they
adopt them or not.
   The next article demanding notice is that on Isomorphism by
Dr. Hutchinson, which extends to nearly 8 pages. The author
has found it necessary, in view of the development of the subject
since the time of Mitscherlich, to modify the definition of the term.
Dr. Hutchinson considers isomorphism to be “a part of that branch
of physical chemistry which studies the relations between the
chemical composition and crystalline form of bodies, and which
from a knowledge of the constitution and chemical properties of a
substance seeks to predict       system, form, and crystallographic
                                                 its
constants.”     The author justly points out that this final aim has
rarely been achieved         yet, and   as then goes            he
                                                             discuss the                 on   to

yet, elements, but quasi- or meta-elements.   Our notions of a chemical
element have been enlarged; hitherto the elemental molecule has been
regarded as an aggregate of two or more atoms, and no account has been
taken of the manner in which these atoms have been agglomerated.   The
structure of a chemical element is certainly more complicated than has
hitherto been supposed.   We may reasonably suspect that between the
molecules which we are accustomed to deal with in chemical reactions,
and the component or ultimate atoms, there may intervene sub-molecules,
sub-aggregates of atoms, or meta-elements, differing from each other
according to the positions which they occupy in the very complex
structures commonly known as didymium, yttrium, and the like.”
   A careful consideration of this important utterance by Mr.
Crookes will lead readers to the conclusion that, after all, the re
solution of the rare earths by the methods of fractionation and
phosphorescent spectra may simply be a separation into modifica
tion of the nature of isomerides or polymerides having different
optical properties.   The basic element or metal may be the same
form of matter     throughout  whole groups, and if so we should
expect that compounds giving different “radiant” spectra would
give identical emission spectra under the influence of the more
violent disruptive discharge. The problem appears to require attack
from this side also before we can hope to arrive at any finality.

this same subject in the companion “Dictionary of Applied
Chemistry, edited by Prof. Thorpe. It is interesting to notice
as an illustration of the inseparable union between theoretical and
applied chemistry that the theory of the constitution of the naphtha
lene derivatives is more completely discussed by Mr. Wynne in
Thorpe's Dictionary than by Dr. Morley in the present article.
Among other lengthy contributions under this letter are two by
Mr. Muir on Nitrogen and the Nitrogen Group of Elements,
which together occupy about 20 pages. The article on the
Periodic Law by Mr. Douglas Carnegie is also noteworthy as an
admirable statement of this subject.
   Enough has been said of the contents of the present volume to
show that it is as full of interest to chemists as its predecessors,
and the editors are again to be congratulated on the results of
their labours.     We have tested the work over and over again by
referring to those topics with which we happen to be personally
familiar, and have found it in no way behind its companion volumes
in completeness and accuracy. Among the contributors whose
articles we have not hitherto mentioned are Dr. Halliburton, who
 writes on Milk and Muscle; Dr. Rideal, who contributes the
articles on Paraffin and Petroleum ; Mr. Shenstone, who treats of
 Ozcne ; and Dr. Tilden, who writes on Pentinene. Some of the
 present contributors have not before appeared in the pages of the
new Dictionary, but their names indicate that the editors have
 known where to look for authoritative treatment of the respective
subjects.
            LIV.    Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
            ON THE COLOUR        OF IONS.    BY W. OSTWALD.
    T  follows from the dissociation hypothesis of Arrhenius that the
       absorption-spectrum     of a very dilute solution of a salt is the
 sum of the   spectra   of the ions. If one of the ions be so chosen that
 it exerts no absorption in the region investigated and is therefore
 colourless, the colour of all the salts formed of one coloured ion
 and several colourless ions must be identically the same.           This
 conclusion has been tested and confirmed by the author on a series
 of salts, both by actual observation and by photographs.             The
 photographs were so arranged that the spectra of one series of
 salts were on a plate under each other, so that they could be con
 veniently compared.
    The following salts were investigated:—
    1. Permanganates.—The solutions investigated were prepared by
 mixing a decinormal solution of barium permanganate with an
 equal volume of an equivalent solution of the desired metal, and
 then diluting with 50 times as much water.           The final solutions

contained    therefore a gramme-equivalent of the ion MnO, in 500
litres. The first four absorption-bands measured from red had the
same position in 15 different salts of permanganic acid.
    2. Fluoresceine and          its
                             derivatives.—The solutions     compared                     to    be

    (a) Fluoresceine.—The salts showed the same position          the                                    of

Ann. xliii.  p. 767, 1891),        the salts investigated showed the same
absorption-spectrum.        The author attributes this difference           the                          to
different preparation          the specimens used.
                                 of                          The salts which
the above-named experimenters had used were prepared                     double                     by
decomposition and purified                       by
                                         long continued washing.          With
eosine-aluminium       the author observed                             in
                                                         the wash-waters     on

   (c) Iodeosine.—There was the same absorption for the different
salts.  If  dilute solutions       aluminium sulphate and eosine-barium

 ypothesis.
  3.   Rosolic acid.—Solutions were prepared which contained an
equivalent       of
                  the neutral salt                    in
                                       2600 litres. Both       direct                               by
observation and        by
                      photographs they showed considerable variations
in their spectra. The author ascribes this        hydrolysis.  When    to     an

and the dilution extended to 2650 litres, the rosolates were in the
presence of an equivalent of free base, and the hydrolysis was
sufficiently avoided. Unlike the previous great deviations these
solutions showed now only small differences.
   The salts of the following groups showed finally equal spectra:
(4) Diazoresorcine, (5) Diazoresorufine, (6) Chromoa'alates.     The
absorption is relatively small; the investigation was therefore
made by the photographic method.       The chromoxalates        exert                        all
all an
     absorption    the violet and ultraviolet.

and aluminium salts, which exceptions the author ascribes                                          to   a
hydrolytic decomposition.
  (7) Safrosine.—Here again the aluminium and copper salts show
a deviation which     distinct with the former and just perceptible
                                 is
with the latter.
  (8) p-Rosaniline, (9) Aniline Violet.—The different intensity
of  the absorption-spectra   which the salts     some acids show        of                             is
explained by their insolubility.
  (10) Chrysaniline,     (11) Chrysoidine.—The salts        this last                  of
group which were prepared with various acids showed         develop                     a
ment like that observed with rosolic acid. They have different
spectra, which, however, assumethe same appearance,      the solution             if

ON      THE THEORY        OF THE USE OF A PERMAN ENTLY MAGNETIZED
                           CORE IN THE TELEPHONE.
     In No.208 of this Journal Dr. Trouton has explained the
meaning    of the permanent magnet in telephonic receivers.
Although his explanation is undoubtedly true, there is a second
side to the question that he has wholly left alone.

        1. It serves to give the sounds the required loudness.
        2. It serves to give the sounds the true pitch.
   My researches have shown me that when a non-polarized
telephone is joined to the secondary of an induction-coil, in the
primary of which a microphone is placed, the sounds given out by
the telephone are an octave higher than those produced before
the microphone.        Of course it follows from this, that such a
telephone will be unable to speak intelligibly, as              the vowels     all

                      By A. P. CHATTock".
IT the is well known that    a  displacement of electricity  along
           axes of certain crystals is capable of accounting   for
the phenomena of both pyro- and piezo-electricity observed in
them, the fact having been pointed out by Lord Kelvin in
1878. Such a displacement may be conceived of as taking
place (1) by the separation of the two electricities within
  reviously unelectrified conducting atoms or molecules, or
 (2) by the relative motion of two sets of initially and oppo
sitely charged molecules, distributed throughout the crystal.
There seems to be no third way for the displacement to occur
if electricity cannot exist apart from matter.       *
    To explain the displacement by the first of these hypo
theses amounts, in the present state of our knowledge, to
little more than a confession of ignorance. The mechanism
for such a process has yet to be invented.          But with the
second hypothesis the case is different.         Given a certain
arrangement of unalterably and oppositely charged mole
cules, and both pyro- and piezo-electric phenomena follow at
once from mechanical principles.       Moreover, it is possible to
calculate an    approximate    value for the molecular charges
assumed ; and the fact that this comes out of the same
order of magnitude as that of the charges carried by ions in
electrolysis, seems to me to lend no little support to the view
that such charges exist.

in amount to about half the charge possessed by each mole
cule.    But there is no necessity for the chains to be opened
out   by  heat in order to cause pairing of the molecules.
Tension along their lengths will give rise to the same effect,
while compression will correspond with cooling; the result of
either being what is known as piezo-electricity.         Such an
agreement of heating with tension and of cooling with com
pression appears to exist”.      It is true that it is not invari
able; but there seems to be no great difficulty in supposing
that in those cases where the rule is reversed, disturbing effects
may exist due to some action on the chains of the molecules on
either side of them; for while both heating and tension affect
the chains similarly, they produce opposite effects in planes at
right angles to them—heating decreasing, while tension in
creases the proximity of the molecules therein.       The theory
does not therefore necessitate the above     agreement—it    only
renders it  likely; but the calculations which follow can only
be made when the agreement occurs.
  The point at which the free piezo-electric           charge is a
maximum, and which corresponds with the absolute zero of
temperature in the case of pyro-electricity, occurs at a pres
                                                  ..
sure which is sufficient to bring the molecules into contact.
As this pressure is reduced the pairing tendency comes more
and more into play, until, after changing from compression
to tension, the breaking-point is                  Now the break
occurs when the cohesion of the weakest place in the test
piece is overcome by the pull; and, on the above view, the
                |.
weakest place will be found between the molecules which
are farthest apart in the chains (flaws being supposed absent),

great alterations long before the molecules were brought into
contact.    Nevertheless, the following considerations seem to
me to render it probable that if M and k are represented by
their normal measured values in the above expression, the
resulting number will not be hopelessly different from what
it ought to be.
   T is small compared with 0.4M, as M is almost certainly
larger than the measured value of M.                 The expression
(0.4 M+T)k therefore reduces itself practically to the inte
gral of the product Mk with alterations in length of the
crystal between the limits 0 and 0.4 cm. Now M and k are,
from their nature, closely connected (if the chain hypothesis
be true). Whatever alteration one undergoes, the other must
undergo a similar one and in the opposite sense. If, for in
stance, at high pressures M increases, it will be due to the
fact that the molecules resist being brought together more
than they do at low pressures; but this is only another way
of saying that they are more reluctant to unpair at high than
at low pressures: in other words, that the value of k has di
minished, and to an extent which is roughly comparable with
the increase of M. The variations of M and k thus tend to
compensate each other, and it therefore follows that the varia
tions in the value of their product will be small compared with
those of either factor separately, and that the assumption that
Mk is constant over a wide range is probably not very far
from the truth.
   Mallock * gives the value of M for tourmaline parallel to
the axis as 1.3 × 10° C.G.S. Hence we may write
                  (0.4 M+T)} = 2.8x10'xp.
As regards the value of n    one can   only assume that the chains
are close together; i.e. that
                               1
                                      = 4x     1016.
                    * = (, xIO-5),
It is quite possible, and even likely, that the true value is less
than this, but it cannot be much greater.
   Putting these quantities into the equation for q, we obtain
for tourmaline,

   Now          I
           think it will be admitted that if permanent charges
are to exist on the mol-e-les of a t-ly, the probabilities are
enormously in favour of their being ionic charges; so that
the fact that the above line of argument leads to a value for 7
so near 10-4 is in itself evidence in favour of the truth of the
assumptions on which the reasoning was based. It was on
this ground that I concluded above that the pairing of the
molecules had taken place to an appreciable extent before the
limit of tenacity was reached. At first sight, it is true, this
method of justifying the means by the ends looks like a vicious
circle, but I believe it is in reality reliable. One obtains, as
it were, a new fact in the agreement between q and 10-";
and this affords a fre-h Point of departure for the reasoning.
   Coming now to the calculation of 4 from pyro-electric data,
 Riecke * has measured what he calls the “specific electrical
moment” brought about by a change of temperature of 100°
in tourmaline; i.e. the quantity of electricity set free at the
end of a rod of tourmaline of unit length parallel to the axis
and weighing one gramme. The mean value of this quantity
for twenty-two different specimens is 42 E.S. units, which,
when multiplied by the mean value of the densities of the
specimens (3:1) and divided by 100°. gives 1-3 as the number
of E.S. units liberated per sq. cm. of crystal surface normal
to the pyro-electric axis per degree alteration of temperature
 (= x). The different specimens do not, however, agree very
closely with each other; the maximum value of x for any
 specimen being 1-S while the minimum value is 0.5 t.
   Proceeding in the same manuer as for piezo-electricity,
q will be given by the equation
                                                rt
where T is the range of temperature within which the mole
cules pass from the state of absolute contact with each other
to the state of complete pairing (i.e. the range from the
absolute zero of temperature to the evaporation-point of the
crystal), and x is the mean value of k throughout that
range.
     Now k is necessarily unknown, and in                        all   probability very

   It may be well to refer here to an argument brought for
ward by Wiedemann in his Electricität" against Lord Kelvin's
theory, by which he seems to consider that the latter is
rendered untenable. According to him a pyro-electric crystal

exhibit opposite charges               on        its

This quantity represents the cohesive force of the mass, and
is consequently equal to the internal pressure per sq. cm. of
the particles due to their heat-motions.
   Pairing of the particles will, however, reduce the cohesion;
for it will strengthen some bonds at the expense of others, and
the cohesion depends on the strength of the weakest part. On
the other hand, the above formula is only accurate if the
closeness of the lines of force cutting the imaginary surface is

  Of course a theory which is to account for the cohesion
of pyro-electric crystals must also account for that of all
dielectrics.   And in fact, according to the present view,
pyro-electric crystals only differ from other crystals in the
peculiar chain-like arrangement of their molecules, whereby
the cohesive force, as it were, shows itself externally; whereas,
in the case of other substances, it is kept entirely within their
bounding surfaces. As regards the variations of tenacity
in different substances, they are, I think, to be easily accounted
for by the different sizes, masses, and perhaps shapes of the
molecules as compared with the charges they carry. Varia
tions in these quantities will give rise to a greater or less degree
of pairing, as well as to alterations in d and in internal
pressure, sufficient to account for a greater range of variation
than is observed in the tenacity of homogeneous bodies.
 (Porous substances like cement do not fall under this head,
of course. They may be regarded as containing an infinite
number of flaws, and their tenacity will- therefore be too
small.)

The measured value of           K for quartz     is 4-6, and of   M 7.5 x 10".
Hence, for quartz,                             -
                                   = 2.3 x 10-11.
If K      be calculated from the index            of refraction (u) of quartz
its value is 2:4, which makes
                                q  = 1.4x    10-11.
 (As, however, M was measured by a “slow ’’ method, the
first value of q is likely to be the more correct.)
    For tourmaline K (obtained from u)=2:7, M=1.3 × 10”.
Hence
                                q  = 2.1 x   10-11.
    For glass, K=7             (about)    for     slow   electrification,   and
M=5.5 x 10",
                                q  = 2.6 x   10-11.
    These values are about double the ionic charge of oxygen,
so far as it is known; and the method of calculation is at the
 same time far more reliable than those that have hitherto
 been discussed.        There are no very uncertain assumptions in
    ;
it and the         only  quantity not accurately known is d, which
 enters     equally  into all the methods.             It is therefore satis
factory that the results obtained by this particular method
 should be so good.
     Applying now these considerations to liquids and gases, the
 results are at first sight less satisfactory.
    Taking water as an example of a liquid dielectric, K=1-8
 (calculated from u); M* = 2 x 10”,
                                 q =  1-8  x  10-12.
     For bisulphide of carbon K=1-8 (measured), M= 1.6 x 10",
                                 q =  1.6  x  10-12.
     These values are small; and          if we    take gaseous oxygent the
    * M is now the coefficient of volume elasticity, of course.        For solids
 it makes very little difference, theoretically or practically, whether this
 or Young's Modulus is used.
    t  In using the formula for a gas there are one or two modifications to
 be made.     The number of molecules in the protruded (fictive) layer of
 electrified particles at either end of the gas is d/d,” per sq., cm., where d
 is the thickness of the layer (= }×10-8) as before, and d, is the distance
 apart of the gas-molecules,      say 5.3×10–8     (=dx V1200).        Hence the
 equation for q comes to be
                                       (K–1)M- d d,” -
                             q  =            2m.
 It is worth noticing that the direct variation of (K-1) with the density
 of the gas (1/d,”) follows from this as it should do.

474                          Mr. A. P. Chattock            on an
discrepancy is far greater:                  K= 1.00054,             M=1:1 x 10", and
d=5'3 × 10-5,
                                       q=8 x     10-13.
   The following considerations, however, seem to me to show
that these results are just what they should be, on the view of
initially charged particles.       According to that view, the
oppositely charged particles tend to pair more and more as
the temperature rises.       When the pairing has gone on to a
certain extent the     body   becomes liquid (provided, of course,
the critical  pressure    is not overstepped), the bonds holding
the  paired  particles  together  having been strengthened at the
expense of the others to such an extent that the latter are no
longer capable of holding the particles in relatively fixed
positions. At a still higher temperature they have become so
weakened that the paired particles fly off in the form of
wº  Now Young's Modulus expresses the difficulty experienced
in bringing the particles of a body nearer together. When a
body is compressed it yields chiefly at those places where the
particles are furthest apart.          Hence, in the case of a body
composed of partially paired particles, the yielding will chiefly
occur where the pairing is least, i.e. between the particles B
and C, D and E, &c. in fig. 1. The same is of course true of
tension.
    When, however, the body is strained electrically the case is
different. The electrostatic field takes hold, as it were, of all
the + charges throughout the dielectric, and urges them past
all the   –  charges, which         pulls
                                        it    the opposite direction.

pected result.   It would be necessary to divide the M for
paired particles by 2, as it acts, as it were, on one side only
of each particle ; but the increased nearness of the particles
due to pairing probably increases M sufficiently to render this
unnecessary.

electrical and mechanical elasticities.     Pairing must have
taken place to a certain extent, or there would be no pyro- or

 the dielectric strength of glass, in the form of the thin plates
 used for the covers of microscope-slides.    The plates, which
were 14 inch diam., were held at their centres between platinuin
knobs of 24 mm. diam. Parallel with these knobs was a
micrometer spark-gauge, the length of which was gradually
increased until the glass was pierced.     The following table
gives the results obtained            :-

      The potential was measured by comparing the spark in the
 liquid with a spark in air arranged parallel with it; the
 assumption being made that the same potential was necessary
 to produce the air-spark whether the potential was applied
 suddenly or slowly.
      M for water is 2 x 10".               Berthelot" has succeeded in
 stretching water by Tºp of its whole volume.                 K for water
  (calculated from u)=1-8.              We have therefore
                                    q = 2.6 x 107*.
       In  the accompanying table the values of q calculated by
  the various methods discussed in this paper are collected for
  convenience of reference. Their agreement with each other
  and with the ionic charge seems to me to be quite beyond the
  range of chance.             Except in one case theory has been able
  to   anticipate       any   marked divergence from the ionic value, as
  is shown by the sign > or <.
       On the other hand, it is well to emphasize what has already
   been pointed out, that even granting the reality of the above
   relations, the existence of initially charged molecules is not in
   every case necessitated by the success of the method of calcu
   lation.        It has been shown above that Method          III.  affords
   equally good evidence that cohesion is due to chemical affinity,
   to ionic charges, or perhaps to both. The order of magnitude
   of the resulting value of q will in each case be the same. So,
   too, Dielectric Capacity has been shown by Clausius to be
   explicable on the hypothesis of induced charges in conducting
   molecules; and the ratio of the volume of the molecules to
   the space they occupy, when determined by this theory, is in
   close agreement with the same ratio calculated from the
   behaviour of gases under pressure. Either this agreement,
   therefore, or that of the results of Method IV. with the other
    five determinations of q, must be accidental; for neither theory
   of dielectric capacity implies the other in any way, so far as

I am  able to judge.   With Method W., however, acceptance of
the formula seems to necessitate acceptance of initial charges;
and this is still more the case with Methods I. and II., where
 electrification is produced without the application of any
 apparent electrostatic field.

I   think it will be admitted that the hypothesis of initial ionic

 plaining them. Indeed, if it were not for the difficulties met
 with in the consideration of elementary substances, and espe
 cially of metals, one would be almost tempted to imagine that
 chemical affinity and ionic attraction were one and the same
 thing.     The difficulty, however, of accounting for opposite
 charges in similar particles—the fact that the pairing ten
 dency is so small in metals that monatomic vapours are the
 rule—the low compressibility of liquid mercury, which also
 points to incomplete pairing—and especially the fact that
 metals conduct without any apparent convection of their par
 ticles—all these points are clearly opposed to the idea that the
 particles of metals are oppositely and permanently charged.
     It is true that the phenomena of thermo-electricity, like                                             all
 other cases where electricity              produced  is    apparently non     by
electrical     means,  are   likely      find      easy

postulated. So, too, magnetic permeability might conceivably
 be   due   to the spinning         permanently charged atoms.

The reason for this will appear more clearly if we consider
the nature of the first summation (with respect to m').      In
(19) we have to deal with the sum of (r--iy)-", where y is
for the moment regarded as constant, while a receives the
values a = m'. If, instead of being concentrated at equidistant
points, the values of a were uniformly distributed, the sum
would become

zero.   We see, then, that the finite value of the sum depends
entirely upon the discontinuity of       formation, and thus        y its                                          a

498         Lord Rayleigh on the Influence of Obstacles
cumstances the flow of gas round the obstacles follows the
same law as that of electricity, and the kinetic energy of the
motion is at once given by the expressions already obtained.
In fact the kinetic energy corresponding to a given total flow
is increased by the obstacles in the same proportion as the
electrical resistances of the original problem, so that the
influence of the obstacles is taken into account if we suppose
that the density of the gas is increased in the above ratio
of resistances.     In the case of cylinders in square order
(35), the ratio is approximately (1+p)/(1-p), and in the
case of spheres in cubic order by (68) it is approximately
(1+!p)/(1-p).
  But this is not the only effect of the obstacles which we
must take into account in considering the velocity of pro
  agation. The potential energy also undergoes a change.
 The space available for compression or rarefaction is now
(1–p) only instead of 1 ; and in this proportion is increased
the potential energy corresponding to a given accumulation
of gas". For cylindrical obstruction the square of the velocity
of propagation is thus altered in the ratio

   To deduce the formula for the kinetic energy we have only
to bear in mind that density corresponds to electrical resist
ance.   Hence, by (26), if a denote the density of the cylin
drical obstacle, that of the remainder of the medium being
unity, the kinetic energy is altered by the obstacles in the
approximate ratio
                                 (a +       1)/(a   – 1) +p         -   -    -     -    -        (71)
                                 (a +       1)/(a-1)–p
The effect of this is the same as if the density of the whole
medium were increased in the like ratio.
  The change in the potential energy depends upon the
“compressibility” of the obstacles.     If the material com
posing them resists compression m times as much as the re

   Itwill be evident that results such as these afford no
foundation for a theory by which the refractive properties of
a mixture are to be deduced by addition from the corre
sponding properties of the components.          Such theories re
quire formulae in which p occurs in the first power only, as
in (76).
   If  the obstacles are themselves elongated, or, even though
their form be spherical, if they are disposed in a rectangular
order which is not cubic, the velocity of wave-propagation
becomes a function of the direction of the wave-normal.         As
in  Optics, we   may   regard the character of the refraction as
determined by the form of the ware-surface.
    The aeolotropy of the structure will not introduce any cor
responding property into the potential energy, which depends
only upon the volumes and compressibilities concerned. The
present question, therefore, reduces itself to the consideration
of the kinetic energy as influenced by the direction of wave
propagation.      And this, as we have seen, is a matter of the
electrical resistance of certain compound conductors, on the
supposition, which we continue to make, that the wave
length is very large in comparison with the periods of the
structure.    The theory of electrical conduction in general
has been treated by Maxwell (‘Electricity,’ $297).               A
 parallel treatment of the present question shows that in                                              all   .

        LVII.     On the Determination of the Critical Volume.
      By    SYDNEY YoUNG, D.Sc., University College, Bristolº.
                                 I
APQ.              a year ago
            Society
                                    read a paper before the Physical
                     (Phil. Mag. Feb. 1892, p.       153) on the “Gene
ralizations of Van der Waals regarding Corresponding Tem
peratures, Pressures, and Volumes;” and at the close of the
  raper, after calling attention to the extreme difficulty attend
ing the determination of the critical volume,                 I  described
a method by which the relative critical volumes of various
substances could be ascertained.              At that time it appeared
to me that the direct determinations of the critical volumes
of benzene, fluorbenzene, chlorobenzene, and acetic acid were
probably approximately correct; and                 I was supported in
this view      by  the fact that the ratios of the observed volumes
to that of fluorbenzene were practically identical with the
 ratios obtained by the graphical method then described.
     I   therefore assumed that the observed critical molecular
 volume of fluorbenzene was correct, and calculated the
 volumes of the other substances from their ratios to that
 of fluorbenzene, and gave these values as the probable
 critical molecular volumes of the other eleven substances.
 It was observed, however, that the critical volumes of the three
 alcohols and of ether obtained by this method were consider
 ably lower than those previously deduced by Dr. Ramsay and
 myself, and were also lower than those calculated by M. Guye
  (Compt. Rend. cxii. p. 1257).            Finally, I  pointed out that if
  these values are taken as correct it would appear that the
  ratio of the actual critical density to the theoretical (for
  a “perfect” gas) is for many substances about 4.4.
      Since then, M. E. Mathias has shown (Compt. Rend. cxv.
  p. 35) that the critical densities of the substances referred to
  in my paper may be determined by the method described
  by MM. Cailletet and Mathias (Compt. Rend. cii. p. 1202,
   civ. p. 1563).          The method has also been found by
   M.    Amagat     to  give   excellent results with carbon dioxide,
   and    by  Mr. G. L. Thomas and myself with five of the lower
   esters; and       I  have therefore much pleasure in acknow
   ledging the correctness both of the method (except, perhaps,
   in the case of the alcohols) and of the critical densities cal
   culated by M. Mathias, and         I  have no hesitation in accepting
   these values in     place  of those   previously  adopted.
      I    have   myself    made an     independent    calculation of the
  critical densities of the twelve substances by this method,
   and     the results    I  have obtained      are practically identical

              ji.
(except in the case of the alcohols) with those given by
M. Mathias.
   The law of MM. Cailletet and Mathias may be described
very briefly as follows :-The means of the densities of any
substance in the state of liquid and of saturated vapour, when
mapped against the temperature, fall on a straight line.
I quite agree with M. Mathias that in the great majority
of cases the verification of the law is perfect; but with the
three alcohols, especially methyl alcohol, there appears to me
to be very                             too pronounced to be neglected,
and   I think it must be admitted that these substances behave
exceptionally in this as in many other respects.
   M. Mathias admits that at low temperatures the alcohols
cease to follow the law; but he is satisfied with the agree
                                       º
ment between the observed and calculated mean densities for
a range of 200° from the critical point.                     The constants
employed by M. Mathias for                       alcohol can be ascertained
from his paper, and          I   give below the mean densities cal
culated from these         constants,    together with those calculated
            *

 that there is considerable curvature of the “ diameter’ in the
 case of ethyl alcohol, and with methyl alcohol it would be still
 more marked.

convenience, the critical temperatures and pressures.       The

vature of the “ diameter.” The critical volumes of a gram
and molecular volumes are calculated from the densities.
The last two columns contain the ratios of the new critical
molecular volumes to that of fluorbenzene, together with the
ratios given on p. 184 of my previous paper and obtained by
the graphical method there described.      It will be seen that
these ratios show satisfactory agreement.
   As regards the alcohols it will be noticed that, if the cur
vature of the diameter is taken into account, the critical
densities are lower and the volumes higher; also that the
ratios of the critical molecular volumes to that of fluor
benzene agree better with those obtained by the graphical
method.
   It may be pointed out that if the generalizations of Van
der Waals were strictly true, the angular coefficients (2) of
the diameters of different substances should be directly pro
portional to their critical densities and inversely proportional
to their absolute critical temperatures, or that for any sub

  The first eight numbers agree fairly well; and it may be
stated thatfor many substances the ratio of the actual critical
density to the theoretical density (for a perfect gas) is about 38.
The alcohols, notably methyl alcohol, and acetic acid, form
exceptions to this law, and in the case of the esters the ratios
(3-89 to 3-95) are rather high.

                       by M. E. Mathias (Compt. Rend. cxv.
IT p.has35) been shown
              that the method of determining the Critical
Density proposed by MM. Cailletet and Mathias (Compt.
Rend. cii. p. 1202, civ. p. 1563) gives good results in a con
siderable number of cases.       We have recently investigated
some of the thermal properties of five of the lower esters,
and find that these substances afford further proof of the
truth of the “Law of the Diameter’ described by these
authors.     We therefore think it may be well to give the
data   illustrating   this law, without waiting for the com
 pletion of the work on the remaining esters.
   The law of the diameter may                    i.
                                              briefly explained as
follows:—It is well known that if the densities of any sub
stance, both as liquid and as saturated vapour, be mapped as
ordinates against the temperatures as abscissae, they fall on
a continuous curve which passes through the critical point.
This curve possesses, according to MM. Cailletet and Mathias,
the characteristic property that the locus of the middle points
of chords parallel to the axis of ordinates is a straight line.
If  this is     so,follows that the ordinate
                      it                            the point
                                                           of      the                 on
diameter    corresponding      the critical
                                      to     temperature    gives  the
critical  density.

     From the differences between                 the observed and calculated
 mean densities it     may    be concluded that, though there may
 be in some cases a     slight    indication of curvature, it is far too
small to affect the determination of the critical densities of
these substances.
 LIX.      On the Boiling-points of different Liquids at Equal
    Pressures.     By SYDNEY YouNG, D.Sc., Professor of Che
    mistry, University College, Bristol".
EARLY          in the present year, M. E. Colot (Compt. Rend.
|.      cxiv. p. 653) described a relation between the boiling
           of any two liquids under equal pressures, which may
     shortly described as follows.
    If t and 6 are the temperatures of the two substances at
any pressure, then
                                 t=A6+B,

           A and  B are constants depending on the nature of                         the
           constants given by M. Colot refer to Centigrade tem
peratures, but for the purpose of this paper it is better to
employ absolute temperatures.                      In this case A remains un
altered, but B has a different value.
    There are certain cases in which B=0 (for absolute
temperatures), and the equation then becomes

                   different Liquids at Equal Pressures.                                        511
   This is identical with the equation given by Dr. Ramsay
and myself (Phil. Mag. Jan. 1886, p. 33) for certain closely
related substances such as ethyl chloride and bromide orchloro
benzene and bromobenzene, and                           I
                                       have shown that it holds
good for the four halogen derivatives of benzene.
   For bodies which are not closely related we proposed an
equation which may be written
                                      R= Ro-4-ct,
where R is the ratio of the absolute temperatures of the two
substances at any pressure p, Ro is the ratio at such a pressure
that the temperature of                   &
                                  second liquid = 0°C., and t is
 the Centigrade   temperature of the same liquid at the pressure p.
   The second terms of the two formulae (B in that of M. Colot
and ct in the one just mentioned) are not equivalent, but they
both serve to bring the calculated results pretty well within
the limits of experimental error, though not in          cases for                all

     It is obvious, however, that by taking a smaller range of
  pressure—say from the lowest to 2000 millim., or from 4000
  millim. to the highest pressure, and by altering the constants,
  a very much better agreement would be obtained.               Extra
  polation beyond the limits of pressure chosen would, how
  ever, introduce very large errors indeed.
     In conclusion it may, I think, be stated that in a great

  the formula of Ramsay      .#             gives better results than
  that of M. Colot; the latter, which is very convenient, may,
  however, be employed, even for very wide ranges of pressure,
  when the constant B is small, and for small ranges of pressure
  when B is large.

     Being in the possession of the constants of several platinum

at temperature t; the value of 8 for each thermometer is
determined by observations of the resistance in boiling sulphur
(t=444°53).

      The actual numbers used in these calculations are those
  taken from the papers referred to in column 2.
     All the other thermometers mentioned by Griffiths (Phil.
  Trans. A. 1891, pp. 43–72) were made with single electrodes
  for rapid observations; and thus every observation includes
  their stem-resistance, which evidently cannot become zero, so
  that the above investigation with their constants would be of
  no use.
     The above table seems to corroborate the conclusions arrived
  at by Profs. Dewar and Fleming, and at the same time is a
  valuable testimony to the accuracy of the method adopted by
  Callendar and Griffiths in the papers referred to, for it did
  not appear probable that their formulae could bear the strain
  of extrapolating over a range of nearly 300°; this is more
  especially the case when it is remembered that the wires
  used have different resistance coefficients and different values
  for 8 ; the origin of these differences is probably to be found
  in slight impurities in the platinum.
     We have reason to believe, from some recent experiments
  conducted by us, that the rise in temperature of the wire, caused
  by the current necessary to determine         resistance,         its
                                                               greater                is

           Although the above discrepancies may in some cases appear
  large,         be remembered that we have here the whole of
                  it must
  the error in each case, and that such errors as non-uniform
  bore, zero changes (both temporary and permanent), unequal
 graduation, changes of condition, sticking, &c. are totally
 absent, while the experimental
                            -     difficulties of the air-thermo
 meter are avoided.
    Thus we conclude, that a platinum-thermometer—especially
 of the H pattern"—would be a convenient instrument for the
 determination of very low temperatures where an error of
 0°5 is immaterial; and that further light on platinum
 thermometry only strengthens our belief in           correctness                                         its

§...".
   The question may now be raised: whether one of these
                    the more distinctive one, where F'(X)=0—
is likely to be realized in the (exceptional) case of the action
                             i.
of numerous independent agencies not resulting in the pro
bability-curve.         following problem may have wide ana
logies.    Let a body be moved from rest in a right line by the
simultaneous action of numerous small impulses, each as likely
to be in the positive as in the negative direction.          The law
of frequency for the momentum of the body will be the proba
bility-curve; for the energy of the body is the curve represented
in fig. 2.
   V. So far we have supposed the “elements" to assume
different values in virtue each of a single variable 4, or                                                      re.

fulfilled by functions of the form  Je-", where R is a quadratic
function of r and   y”.   By parity it may be presumed that, if
the law of frequency for each element involve three or more

more than what is deducible from Taylor's theorem, because
for short distances from the maximum of F(x, y) (the surface
of frequency for a and y), the value of y most likely to
attend any assigned value of a may, in general, be regarded
as a linear function of w. One might as well attribute to
Taylor's theorem the fulfilment of the law of error in the
case of a single variable, on the ground tilat any continuous
curve symmetrical about a certain point may be identified for
short distances from that point with a probability-curve.
That consideration alone would not have enabled us to predict
the fulfilment of the law up to a sensible distance from the
centre—that exact consilience between the quartiles, octiles,
deciles, &c. of theory and of fact which has been observed by
Mr. Galton and others. Those verifications allow us to pre
sume the existence in rerum naturá of elementary agencies in
such numbers and of such magnitude as to generate a proba
bility-curve of sensible dimensions.    From that presumption
we may reason down to the genesis of a probability-surface
also of sensible dimensions.      d this conclusion is confirmed
by specific experience: the sort of correlation which is dedu
cible from that hypothesis having been, in fact, observed by
Mr. Galton and Prof. Weldon. There is required here not
only the use of Taylor's theorem, but also the presence of the
essential condition of the law of error; the action of numerous
independently variable elements.
   In fine, the tieorem of this section completes the answer
which was given in a former section to the objection brought
by Cournot and Prof. Westergaard against Quetelet's prin
ciple of the Mean Man; in substance, that the mean organs
obtained by averaging a number of specimens might not
each other.         now seen that the objection

last section.    If the objection is understood in a less narrow
sense as suggesting that antinomies arise when correlations
other than linear are supposed, the answer furnished by this
 section is that correlations other than linear are not to be
 supposed (in the case of composite organs).
      I. In the investigation of the most general conditions of
 the law of error, one more step has still to be taken.      We
 have so far supposed every member of a group to be a definite
 function of a number of elements, each of which varies
 according to some definite law of frequency. But now it is
 to be added that the conclusion is not seriously affected if we
 suppose these functions to be themselves variable ; provided
 that they preserve certain characteristics       approximately
 constant, namely, the parameters of the probability-curve.
 These are         its
                centre and      dispersion:      its                            or
                         p;x +pax, +&c.--p,\,(=X),

where   pi, ps, &c. are “weights” (identical with the
                         F'(x1,            x2,   &c.),       F.'   (x1,         x2,   &c.),
employed before);                    x1,    x2,
                                 are the average values&c.    the                                       of

possessing static capacity is given by Mascart, and Joubert,
L'Electricité et Le Magnétisme,     vol. i. § 2:33, and is treated at
length by Mr. T. H. Blakesley in his book on Alternating Currents.
The object of the present communication is to give the solution
for the case of a conductor possessing self-induction as well as
distributed capacity, and to note the effects produced by the intro
duction of the self-induction.
   The rate of change of the charge on an element of the cable is
equal to the difference of the currents flowing into and out from it;
and so, writing q for charge and i for current at any time, and a
for the distance of any point from the origin—positive direction
being that of current-flow—we have

   The difference in the rates of propagation and decay of waves of
high and low frequency doubtless constitutes the limitations to
the use of the telephone.     As the several harmonic components of
a complex tone advance along a conductor, they keep shifting their
relative phases according to the difference in their rates of propa
gation and also change their relative intensities according to the
difference in their rates of decay, thus changing the resultant
combination tone ald materially altering       quality. These effects            its
