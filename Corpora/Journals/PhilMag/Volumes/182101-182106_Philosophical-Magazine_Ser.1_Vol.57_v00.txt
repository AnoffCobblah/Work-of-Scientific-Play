 I. On the discordant Opinions delivered by the Chemists who
   gave Evidence on the Trials of the Insurance Question of
   SEveRN, KING, and Co. versus the Fire Offices. By M. Ri
        CARDo, Esq.
                           To   Mr. Tilloch.
sin–For       commenting upon the discordant opinions which
were  given on the trial of Messrs. Severn and Co. relative to some
of the properties of oil, and which have been put on record in the
last Number of the Philosophical Magazine, it is unnecessary for
me to offer any apology to those gentlemen the correctness of
whose doctrines I have presumed to call in question. Opinions
upon scientific subjects, or indeed upon any other, which are
publicly promulgated, become public property, and are open to
the observations and criticisms of any one who chooses to descant
upon them; and in freely canvassing such opinions, it is always to
be understood that the doctrines only are criticised and not the
 persons advancing them; nothing personal is meant: that esti
mation in which, as men of science, they are so highly held,
and that respect to which they have become so justly entitled,
and which no one feels more warmly than the individual who is
now addressing you, are not in the slightest degree lessened by
the casual advancement of doctrines which on examination may
not be found perfectly tenable.      The question at issue, however,
is not the truth or falsehood of an hypothesis; but it is as to the
existence of facts, facts that no doubt may and will be clearly
proved to the satisfaction, or I should rather say to the convic
tion, of    all
            parties. Hypotheses           or
                                       theories may       be
                                                          disputed, but
the facts themselves cannot      be
                                  disproved;    and whether    oil   de
                                                                     is
composable below      certain heat, whether
                      a                            gives out inflamma
                                                     it
  blevapour, and whether   it    easily
                                is          difficultly heated, may
                                               or                         be
   clearly proved,    the trial                           by
                                                          party feeling,
as as

                                     is
   any problem    in mathematics.

commence    them with an examination of the second points, as
stated in your last Magazine, which each party wished to esta
blish ; the gentlemen on the one side maintaining “that oil kept
at a heat of 360 degrees for two months, underwent no change
whatever, excepting becoming darker and thicker ; that by such
operation it did not become at        more inflammable.” The             all
gentlemen                 on
               the other side asserting,   that    kept    the heat            “               oil          at
and  during the time above mentioned did become changed, that
partial decomposition took place, and that        became more                             it

The above assertion            the plaintiffs' side was made

 Dr. Thomson may say.            Perhaps it may be difficult to disprove
what has been      said,  that  boiling of sugar is more dangerous than
 heating oil—that sugar boiling over would catch fire and burn as
 it ran along the floor—that mixing it with water rendered it more
 dangerous;—such assertions could only be met by counter asser
 tions. But I would ask those gentlemen who made them, to re
 flect calmly, without letting their judgements be biassed by their
prejudices, and say whether they really believe that syrup could,
in the state in which it is boiled in the sugar-houses, and as the
fire-places are constructed, on boiling over, possibly set the building
on fire 2 whether it would burn as it ran along the floor 2 and
whether mixing water with sugar adds to                 combustibility?         its

   It may be said, that in the observations I have made, it has
evidently been with a leaning to one side, and from my acknow
ledgement of having been present at one of their experiments with
a strong bias to that side.  If it is so, it is the result of convic
tion. With the best judgement I am capable of bringing to this
investigation, the evidence on the one side appears to me infi
nitely more conclusive than on the other; and what            I observed as
an eye-witness, I cannot disprove to myself.
    The assertion of the Solicitor-General, that the party opposed
to him tried the experiments to prove how dangerous this mode
of heating sugar was, is certainly not incorrect; but he did not
properly state how they proved           when                   it,
                                                    said that Mr. Farra             he

talents; but the greatness of these talents renders it the more ne
cessary, as it gives a currency and a sanction to errors that ema
nate from them; nor should the obscurity of an individual deter
him from pointing out such errors when he thinks he has detected
them.
   l cannot conclude these observations without bearing my
warmest testimony to the fairness, the candour, and perfect good
humour, with which the experiment I witnessed was conducted.
Mr. Dawes, the respectable solicitor, whom I had not the honour
of knowing till I met him on this occasion, seemed only anxious
for the truth, the strict impartial truth, and I am sure would have
been as much above taking any quibbling advantage, had it been
offered, as the gentlemen who acted with him were above offering
him any.     I have been induced to make these remarks, from
many rumours that have been afloat of the motives which                                            in
duced some gentlemen to give the evidence they did.         It is to
be most sincerely regretted that upon a question,--as far as they
were concerned,—purely       scientific, any personal insinuations
should have been thrown out that must have wounded the feel
ings of those who knew they were as unjust as they were un
true.   Let us hope that in the further pursuit of this subject, or
indeed any other connected with science, a better feeling will
prevail, and that the same desire will actuate all,—that of pro
moting       its
            benefit          to
                      the utmost.      -

14                                 On the Pyroligneous     Acid.
   The ham sent for the Society's examination has been cured
in the usual way recommended for Westphalia hams; the acid
was employed, instead of being smoked, two table spoonfuls of
the acid being added to the pickle; and when the ham is to be
removed from the pickle, it must be well washed in cold spring
water and dried, and then some of the acid applied over it by
means of a brush, and this repeated two or three times at about
a week’s interval.
     Herrings Mr. S. cures with very little salt.          Being well dried,
 as  early after   being   caught   as can be     effected,   they are then
 dipped into a vat of the acid, and when dry, the same process
 repeated a few times, suspending them like the manufacture of
 candles.     Mr. S. entertains no doubt, from the result of his ex
 periments with herrings, that the same process would answer for
 other kinds of fish, as salmon, cod, &c.; and hence, when cooked,
 may be salted according to each individual's taste.            The red co
 lour, in dried salmon and herrings, has been generally attributed
 to nitre; very frequently tobacco, dissolved in a fluid not very
agreeable (urine), is made use of in Holland.
    I presume this acid would be found very useful on board any
vessel fitted out for long voyages; it appears from calculations
 on a small scale, that one hogshead of this acid would suffice to
cure six tons of fish, in such a manner as to retain their nutri
tious quality; and they could be cured on board when oppor
 tunities occurred of procuring them, independent of                 being          its            an
excellent substitute for common          vinegar       many    culinary

   N. B. Mr. S. recommends that fish, as soon as practicable
after taken, should be a little rubbed with salt, and laid upon a
sloping board to drain, and when dry to be dipped in the acid
as before stated.    The ham sent has been cured a year, and not
kept in a place very favourable for preservation.    It must not be
soaked in water, previous to being cooked.        One great advan

stance, have approximated to a still greater degree of exactness.
Tycho Brahe by this method computed the solar tropical year
at 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes; and the same measure was
found on examining two corresponding observations at 168 years
distance; the one by Tycho Brahe at Uraniberg, A.D. 1585,
and the other by Dr. Bradley, at Greenwich, 1753.
    Thebites, an Arabian astronomer, about the year of Christ
 1200, computed the sidereal year at 365 days, 6 hours, 9 mi
nutes, 12 seconds; an exactness confirmed by the most able
and accurate astronomers of late years, aided by the most superior
and perfect instruments fabricated by human hands.       This mea
sure very nearly agrees with that of the Indian astronomers,
computed at 365 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes, and 9 seconds; see
Phil. Mag. vol. 55. p. 314. The Newtonian astronomy reckons
365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes.      These are evident proofs of the
fact, that the sidereal year is greater than the solar year, as at
tested by astronomers of different nations.
    It is generally believed the Hebrews and Egyptians followed
the reckoning of the antediluvians in their years and months;
each month consisting of 30 days, and each year of twelve months
 and five intercalary days, in respect of the sun; and therefore it
is that Hermes Trismegistus, the earliest of the Egyptian astro
nomers, fixed the year at 365 days, which is the common quan
tity in whole days; but this not being found to correspond with
the solar motions, Ennius, another astronomer of the same na
 tion, stated the full year of the sun at 366 days, which quantity
 Democritus, who studied among the Chaldeans, Calippus,
 Archimedes, Gemius of Rhodes, and Sosigenes, who assisted
 Julius Caesar in reforming the Roman calendar, also followed;
 and hence we must consider the solar year to have been com
 puted in three several quantities, the common year 365 days,
 the full year 366 days, and the mean or astronomical year at 365
 days, 6 hours.
     The year of Oenepidus of Chios, computed at 365 days,
 8 hours, 57 minutes; that of Harpalus, at 365 days, 13 hours;
 and that of Meton, at 365 days, 6 hours, 18 minutes, 56 seconds,
 belongs to the stars, wherein Meton, the inventor of the lunar
 cycle among the Greeks, came very near the truth.
     Hipparchus, the first among the ancients who discovered the
 motion of the equinoxes, was the first who determined the quan
 tity of the solar year with any accuracy; he was followed by
 Ptolemy, and Rabbi Adda the Jew, who corrected the Hebrew
 calendar about A.D. 340, and others; and this quantity disco
 vered by Hipparchus is the nearest and most convenient of any
 other for the joint motions of the sun and moon.       I shall here
 put down the several quantities deduced from his principle :

IV. Account of the Poyage ofDiscovery and Circumnavigation
  performed in 1818, 1819, and 1820, by Capt. FREycinet,
  Commander of the French Corvette Urania”.
M. Louis    DE FREvcINET, captain of a frigate, to whom the King
had intrusted the command of the corvette Urania, in order to
make a voyage of discoveries in the South Seas, arrived at Havre
on the 13th of November 1820.
   The principal object of this expedition was to make the neces
sary observations for determining the configuration of the earth,
and the strength of the magnetic power in the southern hemi
sphere; but having to traverse, during more than two years, a
great extent of sea, M. de Freycinet was also to take advantage
of   all
      occasions which might offer         him,     augment our collec
                                                   to                   to

   The corvette   Urania,    fitted out     Toulon       the early part           in
of  1817, was furnished with every article necessary for            long                            a
voyage; she received        picked crew, and her quarter-deck was

  A  numerous collection         the best instruments for physical and
                                of
nautical astronomy were       put     board,

                                of                                                                        de

of October, and she did not arrive at Santa Crus, in the island
of Teneriffe, before the 22d of the same month.
   This port would have been a commodious place for making
observations of various kinds; but the necessity of first submit
ting to a long quarantine, determined M. de Freycinet to stop
only for six days; and on the 28th of October he sailed for the
Brasils.
  On the 6th day of December Cape Frio was observed, and                                                 its
geographical position verified. The Urania entered Rio                                             de   Ja
neiro the same night, where she remained until the 29th                                                  of
January.
     This

                 nearly two months was not       usefully employed       so
as   M.    de

course towards the coasts of New Holland, the northern extremity
of which was seen on the llth of September 1818. (This part-
of the coast is called Edel's Land.)
    The Urania coasted along at a moderate distance, and, having
fallen in with Endracht's Land, she followed it until she arrived
at the entrance of Sea Dog's Bay, from whence, after a short
stay, she sailed on the 13th of September to the anchorage be-
fore the peninsula of Peron.
    An observatory was at first established on shore, and then they
were employed in procuring, by means of distillation, water                                                 fit

in the strait formed by the Isles of Rouib and of Balabalak, and
by the Wyag Islands, where, during a calm, violent currents set
upon shallows ; but she was fortunately able to keep her anchor
age, and to wait for such winds as permitted her to keep her way,
until she had got clear of that perilous situation.

Rawak, after having at a short distance coasted along the northern
side of Waigion.

where these experiments were made are nine in number, viz.
Rio Janeiro (first stay); the Cape of Good Hope; Port Louis,

the Island of Mowa, in the Sandwich Isles ; Port Jackson; the

   2d. Each day during the voyage, two officers at least took
by rotation the necessary astronomical observations to ascertain
the situation of the vessel at sea, and, on shore, the positions of
the different observatories; to regulate the chronometers, &c.
All these observations have been transcribed into journals de
 stined for that purpose.

   10th. Notwithstanding the shipwreck at the Malouin or Falk
land Islands, which caused the loss of 18 cases of specimens of
natural history, there remain still about 40.      These contain a
great number of specimens out of the three kingdoms of nature;
and especially almost the whole of those which were collected at
the Marianne Islands, yet little known in that respect to na
turalists.
   11th. The number of drawings made during the voyage
amounts to several hundreds; the greater part admirable for the
beauty of the situations which they represent, or for the correct
ness of the portraits, and the graces of their composition.
   l 2th. In short, the observations on the manners and customs
of the people whom they visited, have been collected in very great
number by              all
                 the officers employed       the expedition.     All  in                         of

  W.  Answer    of Mr. P. Nicholson      to  Mr. HoldreD   on Mr. N.'s

                              To   Mr. Tilloch.
  SiR,  -   Permit       me to offer a few observations in my own de
  fence in reply to what appear to me the very illiberal and invi
  dious insinuations of your correspondent, Mr. Holdred, in the
  Philosophical Magazine for November 1820, upon my recent
  work on Involution and Evolution,
                                 -          published about the middle
  of April  1820,    and
                    You will oblige your most obedient servant,
 Gower-Place, Euston-Square,                          P. Nicholson.
         Jan.  12, 1821.
     It is not  my intention to review Mr. Holdred's work, or to an
 swer his calumnies, in any other way than by contradicting some
 of his principal assertions, which might otherwise have a ten
 dency to prejudice the reader,"who might not have had an oppor
 tunity of examining the Essay which I have published, and his
 recent tract on the Resolution of Equations; and by placing the
 points in dispute, in such a light that the candid and ingenuous
 reader may be able to judge for himself of the merits of the case.
 I shall therefore confine myself to the two following points:
     1st. He says the article which I put into the Philosophical
 Magazine for October 1818, was taken from his method of ex
 tracting the cube root, and that this has been the means by
 which Mr. Horner has become acquainted with the principle.
    2d. He says also that the Essay on Involution and Evolution
published by me about the middle of April 1820, was, exclusively,
 his and Mr. Horner's.         I am under no necessity to prove it is
 not Mr. Horner's, but I can make it appear sufficiently evident
that the nonfigurate method first published by the above gentle
 man did not originate with Mr. Holdred.
    The following quotation from your correspondent will evi
dently show his unfair disposition towards me, excited by my
having published my own improvements of his method of ex
tracting the roots of equation, the principle of which he had at
first but very rudely suggested.
    “After Mr. Nicholson had discovered another manner of de

rule is applied to a quadratic equation*.
   This idea only wanted generalizing.
   He was acquainted with the numeral exegesis to which his
method bears a striking affinity, but he was an entire stranger
to what had been done by either Newton or Ralphson, before I
pointed out their methods to him.
   If he had known Sir Isaac's method of transforming equations,
which is that from which I derived my ideas, and not from his
crude notions, he would have been ashamed to say that “Mr.

an unknown quantity in a transformed equation, will be the proper
divisor for ascertaining the next figure of the root; but certainly                                                      s
nothing can be more absurd or destitute of principle, and this one
instance is sufficient to show that he never had any clear ideas of
treating the subject.
   The manner in which I first formed my ideas on the extraction
of the roots of equations, will be found in the Introduction to the
 Essay on Involution and Evolution. I shall therefore not take up
the reader's time by repeating it here, but proceed to give an ex
ample of my method of demonstrating the rule, as I have now just
done by the method of Mr. Holdred, which the candid reader will
no doubt feel to be the most eligible and satisfactory method of
settling the dispute.
    l take a, b, c, &c. for each part of the root found by the corre
sponding step.      In the first equation I substitute a--u for       and                                  ar,

 to him that we owe that fine observation, that a metallic wire,
 which communicates with the two extremities of a Voltaic elec
 trical apparatus, acquires the very remarkable property of acting
 at a distance on a magnetic needle. This metallic wire has been
 named the conjunctive wire.
    It was already known, that by augmenting the surfaces of the
 metallic plates which compose the electrical apparatus of Volta,
 and uniting the two wires which communicate with the extreme
 plates of that apparatus, these wires become heated, redden, and
 burn in atmospheric air. M. Thenard and myself had made that
 experiment in 1801. (See No. 11 of the Journal of the Polytech
 nic School, p. 291.) The conjunctive wire, in the experiment
 of M. (Ersted, will become heated, but if it is of sufficient dia
 meter it will not burn; and  action may     observed  its    mag                be                     on

most latent, has any action on the magnet. Now, the electricity
in the conjunctive wire of an electrical apparatus in action, is                         in
deed latent, since it does not manifest itself to any electrometer;
 and, in fact, M. CErsted performed last winter (1819) the expe
                                                                                               t
riment which justified what he had conceived seven years before.
 The result of this experiment has been known in Paris only three
months, and already several distinguished philosophers have de
 duced from it most important consequences, both for magnetism
and electricity. We shall give an account of these as succinctly
as possible.
    Supposing the metallic plates which form the electrical appa
 ratus with troughs, to begin with zinc and finish with copper, the
 electrical current, supposed to be in the conjunctive wire, would
 go from the first plate to the last. Now, imagine another con
junctive wire of the same apparatus, placed parallel to the first,
 and disposed in such a manner that it may transmit an electrical
 current in a direction contrary to the first, the two wires will                        re
 pel. If the currents are in the same direction, they will attract.                            {
 M. Ampere was the first to observe these attractions and repul
 sions at a distance, between bodies traversed by an electric fluid
 which does not manifest any tension.
    M. Arago magnetised a slip of iron, and afterwards a steel
wire, by putting them in contact with, or under the influence of,
the conjunctive wire. A simple method of magnetising a steel
needle by the conjunctive wire, consists in placing the needle in
the part of the conjunctive wire which is twisted spirally : whe
ther the needle is placed directly upon the threads of the spiral,
or enveloped in paper or a glass tube to prevent contact with
the conjunctive wire, it becomes magnetised, and          north and        its
south poles, corresponding       the north and south poles
                                        to                        the               of

        M. Arago, following the theory of M. Ampere, conceived the
idea of  twisting  a conjunctive   wire in the manner of two symme
trical  spirals placed  one after the other; these spirals differed
from each other only as to the direction in which their generating
points turned round their hollow spindles: by putting a needle in
each spindle, the two needles became magnetised at the same
time, so that their poles of the same name were contiguous.         In
transmitting a discharge of a Leyden phial through a copper wire
twisted in the same manner, in the manner of two consecutive
symmetrical spirals, M. Arago has further observed, that the steel
needles placed on these spirals became magnetised by the electric
fluids of ordinary machines, as well as by the Voltaic apparatus.
    Other facts have been long known, which prove the mutual                                         in
fluence of the two fluids, magnetic and electric.       The points of
paratonnerres become naturally magnetised by the electricity of
 the atmospheric air.      M. Arago, author of an article on the
 magnetic forces, which is inserted in the Annuary of 1819, re

Royal Academy of Sciences, on the mutual actions of the earth,
the conjunctive wires of a Voltaic apparatus, and a magnetic
needle.    He presented in the following sittings three new ar
rangements of apparatus, of his invention.        The first shows a
circular conjunctive wire submitted to the action of a Voltaic ap
paratus, and which is directed by the action of the terrestrial
globe in a vertical plane, perpendicular to the plane of the mag
netic meridian. The second apparatus consists in a circuit almost
closed, and of a rectangular form, which turns round a horizon
tal axis perpendicular to the plane of the magnetic meridian, and
the plane of which inclines to take, by the action of the earth, a
direction perpendicular to that of the inclination of the needle.
This inclination, which has not been measured with exactness
for some years past, was at Paris on the 22d April 1819, 68° 25'.
It is variable, like the declination, according to times and places.
The third apparatus of M. Ampere exhibits a conjunctive wire
twisted spirally, the extremities of which are attracted and re
pelled by a magnetic bar, as those of a needle would be.
   The coexistence of the electric and magnetic actions has na
turally led to the idea, that wires submitted to the influence of
the terrestrial globe, or of a magnetic needle, may decompose
water, like those which communicate with the extremities of a
Voltaic pile.

doubled, without the effect being greatly diminished.       When the
surface of the two metals is small, the effect is proportionally                                                 di
minished; and vice versa, it is increased in proportion as the
surfaces are increased.     A considerable effect is obtained from a
zinc plate six inches square, immersed in a copper vessed filled
with the liquid conductor which I have just mentioned. An ap
paratus of this description, in which the surface of the zinc plate
is two inches square, acts upon the needle with so much force,
that the effect is sensibly felt at the distance of three feet, and
that too, when the needle is not very moveable.       I have not met
with  any  greater effects from an   apparatus  composed   of forty                                              si
milar  troughs;  indeed,  the effect appeared  somewhat diminished.
I have not pursued the investigation of this point very minutely,
but the observation which I have made is correct.         I shall con
clude that by the slight diminution of the conducting power,
which results from an increase in the number of the elements of
the apparatus, a diminution in the electro-chemical                                               effect is also
occasioned.                   -

       reduced the phenomena observed by M. CErsted to two ge
  neral facts.   I showed that the current which is in the pile, acts
  on the magnetic needle like that of the conjunctive wire. I de
  scribed the experiments by which I had established the attrac
  tion or repulsion of the whole of a magnetic needle, by the con
 junctive wire.     I described the instruments which I proposed to
  construct, and, among others, galvanic spirals. I announced that
 the latter would produce, in                   all
                                     cases, the same effects     mag                          as

ple forms of matter, is also manifested by the production of heat
and light, or the phenomenon of combustion, at the instant of
their mutual combination.      But this phenomenon is not charac
teristic; for it is neither peculiar nor necessary to their action,
and, therefore, cannot be made the basis of a logical arrangement.
Combustion is vividly displayed in cases where none of these pri
mary dissolvents is concerned.  Thus some metals combine with
others with such vehemence as to elicit light and heat; and many
of them, by their union with sulphur, even in vacuo, exhibit                               in
tense combustion.    Potassium burns distinctly in cyanogen (car
buretted azote", and splendidly in sulphuretted hydrogen.    For
other examples to the same purpose, see CoMBUSTIBLE and CoM
BUSTION.                             -
   “And again, the phenomenon of flame does not necessarily
accompany any of the actions of oxygen, chlorine, and iodine.
Its production may be regulated at the pleasure of the chemist,
and occurs merely when the mutual combination is rapidly ef
fected. Thus chlorine or oxygen will unite with hydrogen, either
silently and darkly, or with fiery explosion, as the operator shall
direct.
     “Since, therefore, the quality of exciting or sustaining com
bustion is not peculiar to these vitreo-electric elements; since
it is not indispensable to their action on other substances, but ad
ventitious and occasional, we perceive the inaccuracy of that clas
sification which sets these three or four bodies apart under the de
nomination of supporters of combustion ; as                      if,
                                                  forsooth, combus

combustion   was their indefeasible attribute, the essential conco
mitant       of
            their action.   On the contrary, every change which
they can produce,                 by

     “A  crude vinegar has been long prepared for the calico print
 ers, by subjecting wood in iron retorts to a strong red heat. The
 following arrangement of apparatus has been found to answer
 well. A series of cast-iron cylinders, about 4 feet in diameter,
 and 6 feet long, are built horizontally in brick work, so that the
 flame of one furnace may play round about two cylinders.     Both
ends prºject a little from the brick work. One of them has a disc

been well understood.    It has been generally held that vertical
bars of iron, which have remained long in that position, acquire a
magnetic property, the upper end being a south pole, and the
lower a north one. But it now appears that this property is com
municated instantaneously, and that the polarity may be reversed
by reversing the position of the bar.   In southern latitudes the
upper end is a north pole.
    No seaman should be without this work, which satisfactorily
explains several of the phenomena pointed out by Captain Flin
ders and Mr. Bain in their works on the same subject.     The au
thor mentions in an advertisement at the end of his tract, that he
had not heard of Mr. Barlow's work on Magnetic Attractions,
till his own was at press. We think his pages produce internal evi
dence of the fact. These two works should accompany each other.
   Being no seamen, we may suggest nonsense; but it has occurred
to us that advantage might sometimes be found from having a
compass aloft, in one of the tops. Whether any system of                                          gim
bles could keep a compass steady enough for use, in such a                                        situ
ation, others must determine.

to   ll   sec. 12 deg. and will twice a year decline from it the
 greatest possible quantity, being when his long. is 2 sec. 10 deg.
 and 8 sec. 10 deg. or in the beginning of June and December,
 in the first case to the west, and in the second to the east; I
 should conceive that in such observations, a new projection of
 the sun's disc, axis, &c. is highly necessary for at least every
 week or ten days, as in that time there will be a sensible differ
 ence in the inclination.           I also conceive, that as we cannot                           al
ways be sure of an observation when he is on the meridian, a te
lescope mounted on a polar axis will be found a proper instru
ment, as by following the sun's motion in the parallel he describes
 on any particular day, the projection will, if rightly constructed,
be correct at any distance from the meridian, provided the motions
 of the instrument are good, and it is exceedingly well mounted.
 I may also further observe, that during the period of observations
 in question from September to November, the sun's axis de
 clined from about 0 deg. 10 min. W. to about 3 deg. 45 min. E.
 supposing him upon the meridian, instead of being constantly
 8 deg. westward, as stated by Mr. M.; and consequently those
 observations are absolutely wrong,                         if
                                                  the tables are right, as to
 the position of the aris and direction of the spots.
     I recommend to such as speculate upon these curious phaeno
mena, after observing the sun's image upon paper for the pur
 pose of tracing the places and directions of the spots, to exa
 mine them by means of a dark glass applied to their telescope,
before they describe their shape, as I am convinced from long
 and repeated observations, that their true appearance is much
better seen that way than the other.               They would also do well
 to remember, that a telescope which produces erect vision, when
looking in          it,
                   inverts the images when received upon paper, and
that     inverted vision
         if                      produced
                                        is       looking   bythe instrument,      in
erect objects will           seen upon the paper, but the right and left

is  turned upon           it,   as

          REDUCTION OF MURIATE (CHLoRIDE) of silver.
      The use of nitrate of silver in laboratories, as a test for the
  muriates causes a quantity of muriate of silver to be collected,
  which is usually reduced to the metallic state by fusion with pot
  ash—a process generally accompanied with a loss of silver. The
  following way is more economical.
      Take a clean zinc or iron vessel, or else a glass vessel, with
  pieces of clean iron or zinc in it; cover it with water, and add
  the muriate of silver with a little sulphuric or muriatic acid. The
  reduction soon begins, and offers a very curious sight, particularly
  when the muriate is in lumps; it begins on the surface, and ex
  tends over the whole in the form of ramifications, and penetrates.
  the inner part, so that in less than an hour considerable lumps
  of the muriate of silver are reduced. Some heat is generated in
  the process which assists the reduction; or if it goes on slowly,
  the mixture may be warmed.         Wash the reduced metal with a
  little muriatic acid—Annales de Chimie xiv. 319.
               The FRENCH FLOCK OF CASHMIRE         GOATS.
     The flock, consisting of 175, imported into France in 1819,
  and placed at the north-east of Toulon, has been removed to a
  more congenial climate at St. Omer, near Paris. The kids from
 this flock are abundantly covered with magnificent down of which
 the Cashmire shawls are made; and they are superior in strength
 and appearance to the indigenous kids of the same age; which
 leaves no doubt of success from the naturalization.
                       THE STATUE OF MEMNON.
     The Russian    Ambassador at the Court of Rome has received
 a letter from Sir A. Smith, an English traveller, who is at present
at the Egyptian Thebes. He states, that he has himself exa
mined the celebrated statue of Memnon, accompanied by a nu
merous escort.       At six o'clock in the morning he heard very
distinctly the sounds so much spoken of in former times, and
which had been generally treated as fabulous.         “One may,” he
says,   “assign    to this phenomenon    a thousand different causes,
before it could be     supposed  to be simply  the result of a certain
arrangement of the stones.” The statue of Memnon was             over
turned by an earthquake; and it is from the pedestal that this
mysterious sound is emitted, of which the cause has never been
ascertained, and which was denied merely because it was inex
plicable.

   In our last volume (p. 93.) we announced the discovery of this
land by Captain Smith, of the William of Blythe, who named it
New South Shetland; not, to be sure, a very correct name, as
there is no other South Shetland.       In consequence of this dis
covery, the Admiralty sent out the Conway, Captain Basil Hall,
to explore the coasts and procure whatever information may be
attainable.     Advices have since been received of the arrival of
the Conway at     Rio Janeiro, on her voyage out.
                     ARCTIC LAND EXPEDITION.
   The last accounts from this party are dated in January 1819.
They were then in winter quarters at Cumberland House.           The
temperature 30° below zero, but owing to the dryness of the at
mosphere, less unpleasant than the cold wet weather in England.
The hunters bring them moose      deer and buffaloes, and the rivers
and lakes abound with fish.
                    NEWLY DISCOVERED ISLANDS.
   The Swedish journals announce that Major Graner, who set
out last year to explore in the South Sea a new route for ships
from Chili to the East Indies, has discovered a group of islands
hitherto unknown to mariners; but these journals do not mention
either their longitude or latitude.    He has named the largest of
the group Oscar Island.

4, the lightning struck the fore royal-mast of the Exmouth, and
shivered the mast to the gun-deck in a thousand pieces; struck
down and dreadfully burnt several of the crew, and most provi
dentially was conducted out of the hawseholes by the attractive
powers of the iron chain cables, by which she was moored; to
which fortunate circumstance is entirely to be attributed the pre
servation of the ship from blowing up, her hold being full of salt

  During the eclipse on the 7th of September, M. Necker of
Cologny, near Geneva, had two delicate thermometers suspended
about four feet from the ground; one of them exposed to the
direct rays of the sun, the other near the first, but in the shade,
on the north side of a tree.     The following are some of the re
sults:

 the second Monday in the ensuing months, before the results
 are published.        I may however say that a steady uniformity in
 the results must not be expected, under different circumstances
 of distance, and direction and strength of wind; and there may
 be some laws at present unknown that influence the height
 of the mercury. It is hoped that a few difficulties or anomalies
 in the onset may not induce us to abandon the pursuit. Before
 any regular list of the height of towns, rivers, hills, &c. can be
 published, it is highly desirable to settle the point of zero; and
as a change of signs + and — will be troublesome to the general
 reader, and as the surface of the sea at low water, spring tide,
 has been used for such a standard, it may be right to adopt it
 as sufficient to express every part of dry land in the country.
 Considering London as the most important part of these king
doms, it will be desirable to ascertain the correct height of some
few public and accessible points in the metropolis above this
 Zero,
    Perhaps the best way to obtain this object would be to pro
cure a correct section of the river Thames from London to
Sheerness. At present I am not aware of any such section, al
though it is a river of more consequence than any other in
Great Britain.
   If any of your readers should know of any such section,
either of the whole or part of the river, a reference to it will be
very acceptable.         I am, dear sir, yours truly,

                              To Mr. Tilloch.
   SIR,-In      compliance with the wish of Mr. Bevan, I send you
the state of the barometer and thermometer on the 8th instant
at this place. I unavoidably lost the observations at 8 and 9
o'clock, but suppose it of no material consequence.              At a rough
                                            j,
estimation, the cistern of the barometer may be about 260 feet
above the level of the sea. I cannot be certain to a few feet.

82             On the      best      Means for conducting meteorological
our obscrvations relate to the whole of that space; which he
would therefore divide into four equal parts, to each of which a
set of observations should distinctly relate. I suppose, in order
to obtain far better comparison, the heat of the day, the cold of
the night, and the two intervening spaces of middle temperature,
as also the duration of other phaenomena, with reference to these
four periods.   He deprecates the objection of making the ob
servations by this means too laborious, though it is clear, that only
persons of fixed or sedentary habits could comply with such a
rule; which for that reason it would not be advisable to make
a general one.
   With regard to the variations of the barometer and thermo
meter, he thinks that, for want of knowing the elevation of the
place above the sea in the former case, and              annual mean                           its
temperature      the latter,

in the scale:             he
                  would therefore have the variations         put down                                    all
relatively; that               is,                        many tenths                                so

                                  Edinburgh, the 14th of October 1820.
Several years       have now elapsed since I recommended to the
attention of medical practitioners, a soporific medicine, prepared
from the common garden lettuce, the Lactuca sativa of Linnaeus.
In a paper, first published in the Memoirs of the Caledonian
Horticultural Society, about ten years ago, I described what I
considered as the best method of preparing             and    gave       the
                                                                                 it;       I               to

                                  is               the name       Opium,        by                  of

                        several  particulars.    And from these differ

                                exhibited with success,       many cases                       in
where   opium      altogether
                    is         inadmissible.

sold under the name of Lactucarium, and still oftener from sub

lettuce opium was prescribed, and thus exhibited to patients with

Lactucarium has sometimes been unjustly accused of being fol

  S6                        Additional Observations on the Use of
  of warm water, were employed without delay. And I had also rc
  course to the use of calomel, in the manner recommended for thc
  cure of croup, by my late worthy friend Dr. James Anderson,
  surgeon in Edinburgh.          Under these practices his disease soon
  subsided; and in the space of even a few hours, my great alarm
  was at an end.        My opinion was, that an inflammation at the
  head of the      wind-pipe,    which produced the croupy-cough, as it
  is  ealled,  had been cut short by the active measures employed,
  and that his disease might be said to be an example not of the
  Cynanche Trachealis, but of the Cynanche Laryngea.                         In the
  case of my son, who died of the croup about fifteen years ago,
  the inflammation and consequent inflammatory exudation, was
 not in the larynx, but entirely in the trachea: and indubitable
 evidence was afforded, that the affection extended not only to
 the under part of the trachea, but even to                                  its

 bronchiae distributed through the lungs.

No    event will be deemed more remarkable by future ages, than
the decided discovery of the actual existence of a north-west
magnetic pole, by the hardy and enterprising navigators of the
passing century.     The vast importance of the fact is of the                                              ut
most   consequence,  as it must, infallibly, in time, lead to certain
theory of the difference of the variations of the magnetic needle.
Dr. Halley had recourse to the supposition of four magnetic
poles belonging to a magnetic nucleus revolving within the earth,
from east to west; and thus he attempted to account for the
variation, and         its
                    changes, supposed                           to
                                            have been first observed
by  Columbus and Sebastian Cabot.        Duler, under    very plausi                  a
bºe and ingenious theory, supposed only two magnetic poles.
 Mr. Churchman adopted the idea            two magnetic poles; and
                                                            of
 imagined the northcºn one         move eastward,to        parallel                   on   a                 of
latitude, while the southern moved slower; the former takin
 1096 years      in    its
                     revolution, while the latter required 2289. The
north-west pole was supposed                      by
                                       these philosophers                                        be

                  of                    This certainly furnishes strong
evidence that these poles are more imaginary than real; and
that  all future theories              of

00                    On the North-west Magnetic Pole.
A small needle compared to a large real magnet, is experimentally
found to furnish   similar effect to a magnetic compass-card,
                            a
acted on by some invisible magnetic power within the body of
the earth.       This leads to the certain conclusion, that the changes
in variation, and those much less in dip, arise from a correspond
ing change or movement in the cause.      I have made the remarks
contained in this paper, because I am led to believe that the recent
discovery of a north-west magnetic pole has put it in the power
of experimental philosophy to establish, in time, the law of move
ment of the magnetic cause producing effects which have hitherto
baffled all human research.    The anomalies of the variation ob
served by different persons in the same year, in London, clearly
evince that the application of a needle to a meridian-line accu
rately laid down, can alone furnish the precise variation at the
place of observation.—In two papers by me, in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1796 and 1798, the process of laying off such a
meridian is described; and this was done for the purpose of as
certaining accurately, not only the variation, but also the varia
tion   of the variation,or the diurnal vibrating variation, at Ben
coolen or Sumatra   ; and afterwards, at the island of St. Helena.

the earth and common magnetic needles. There            now every            is

        It
       is utterly impossible to attempt to account for the constant
 increase of the variation, without supposing that the north-west
 magnetic pole has a constant motion round the north pole of the
 earth in longitude, on a parallel of latitude; or in an elliptic
 curve. . Though the variation, when first discovered, was only
  11° 15' east, there can be little doubt but that those who are
 destined to exist in the year 2040, or about that period, will find
 the variation as much east, as it is now west.     The north pole
 appears to attract more powerfully than the north-west magnetic
 pole, as must be the case on the supposition of a revolutionary
 movement indispensable for the formation of any tolerable theory
 of the variation.    The great difficulty in the way of a theory of
 magnetic revolution, arises from that of accounting for the fact
 of no variation found in some places. The solution of this diffi
 culty may be found in a fair supposition, that the north pole,
 the moving magnetic pole, and the place of no variation on the
 surface of the earth, may be at the time nearly in one line.      I
 found, by continued observations during two years, that the va
riation at Bencoolen was 1” 7 to 1" l l east; the vibrating va
riation giving a returning swing of about four minutes of a de
gree.     Capt. Cook found the variation in the Straits of Sunda
to be 1% west.—At Condore in 8° 6' north, and 106° 18' east
longitude, the variation was 0° 14' west. Now these, and many
other places of nearly no variation, are nearly in the line, verti
cal plane, or section of the two poles; and, consequently, the
variation must, necessarily, be little or nothing. The well-known
fact that the variation is constantly changing in one and the
same place, furnishes no small proof in favour of the theory of
movement of the secondary magnetic cause, or north-west mag
netic pole.—The variation in London was nothing in 1662, or
158 years ago.      Supposing the new pole to be situated in 100°
of west  longitude,  it would require 568 years, nine months, and
eighteen days, to effect       revolution under the parallel
                                          its                                    of   its

in proportions corresponding to these numbers, but also fre
quently in multiple or submultiple proportions. We have there
fore two distinct propositions on this interesting subject.
   1st, The general reciprocity of the saturating proportions.
   2d, The multiple and submultiple proportions of prime equi
valents, in which any one body may unite with any other body, to
constitute successive binary compounds.
  The first proposition, or grand law of chemical combination,
was discovered by J. B. Richter of Berlin, about the year 1792.
The second, of equal importance, and more recondite, was dis
covered so early as the year 1799, by Mr. W. Higgins.
   Richter inferred his from the remarkable and well established
fact, that two neutral salts, in reciprocally decomposing each
other, give birth to two new saline compounds, always perfectly
neutral.    Thus, sulphate of soda being added to muriate of lime,
will produce    perfectly feutral sulphate of lime and muriate of
soda.     The conclusions he drew were, 1st, That the quantities
of two alkaline bases, adequate to neutralize equal weights of
any one acid, are proportional to the quantities of the same
bases, requisite to neutralize the same weights of every other acid.
For example, 6 parts of potash, or 4 of soda, neutralize 5 of sul
phuric acid; and 4:4 of potash are adequate to the saturation of
5 of nitric acid.    Therefore, to find the quantity of soda equiva
lent to the saturation of this weight of nitric acid, we need not
make experiments, but merely compute it by the proportional
rule of Richter.     Thus, as 6:4:4:: 4:2-93; or in words, as the
potash equivalent to the sulphuric acid, is to the potash equiva
lent to the nitric acid, so is the soda equivalent to the first, to
the soda equivalent to the second.        And again, if 6.5 potash sa
turate 5 of muriatic acid gas, how much soda, by Richter's rule,
will be required for the same effect? We say 6:6-5                ::4::
                                                                      4.3.
3dly, If 10.9 potash combine with 5 of carbonic acid, how much
soda will be equivalent to that effect? Now, 6: 10-9::4: 7-26.
Here, therefore, we have found, that if 6 potash be equivalent to
4 soda, in saturating 5 of sulphuric acid, this ratio of 6 to 4, or
3 to 2, will pervade     allthe possible saline combinations;          that so
whatever    be the  quantity     potash,
                                 of        requisite      to

&c.   of  any other acid, two-thirds         that quantity
                                               of                 of
                                                               soda will
suffice.

   The experimental verification of this most important law, oc
cupied Richter from the year 1791 to the year 1802, in which
period he published, in successive parts, a curious work, entitled
The Geometry of the Chemical Elements, or Principles of Ste
chiometry.       We might have expected greater accuracy in his
investigations, from the circumstance, that Dr. Wollaston se
lected his statement of the constituents of nitre, in preference to
those of all other chemists, in the construction of his admirable
table of chemical proportions.
   With indefatigable zeal Richter examined, by experiment,
each acid, in             its
                    relation      the bases, and then compared the
                                               by

 has since been hypothetically called the atoms.
    2. But two chemical constituents frequently unite in different
proportions, forming distinct and often dissimilar compounds.
Thus, oxygen and azote constitute in one proportion, nitrous
oxide, the intoxicating gas of Sir H. Davy; in a second propor
tion, nitric oxide, the nitrous gas of Priestley; in a third pro
portion, nitrous acid; and in a fourth proportion, nitric acid.
 Is there any law regulating these various compounds; so that
knowing the first proportion, we may infer the whole series?
This question was first answered in a work containing many cu
rious anticipations of discoveries, to which posterior writers have
laid claim; I mean Mr. Higgins's Comparative View of the
Phlogistic and Antiphlogistic Theory, printed in 1788, and pub
lished early in 1789.     Besides some additional facts, decisively
hostile to the hypothesis of phlogiston, this publication distinctly
advances the doctrine of multiple proportions, with regard to the
successive compounds of the same constituents.        This was like
wise interwoven, with new and    ingenious views  concerning gaseous
and atomical combination.      Mr.  Higgins   having felt himself ag
grieved at seeing discoveries, clearly announced by him in 1789,
brought forward nineteen years afterwards by Mr. Dalton, in his
own name, published in 1814 a book, entitled Experiments and
Observations on the Atomic Theory and Electrical Phaenomena.
 In this work he gives numerous quotations from his Comparative
 Piew, which abundantly establish his claim of priority to the dis
covery of multiple proportions, and the atomic theory of che
mistry. It is no fault of Mr. Higgins, that his first work par
took of the imperfect analyses of the day.     Indeed we have rea
son, on the contrary, to be surprised at his rejection of many
errors then sanctioned by high authority, and his promulgation
of many new truths, which might appear, to contemporary writers,
insulated, or of little consequence, but to which subsequent re
searches have given a due place and importance in the system
of chemical knowledge.       Who would deny to Columbus the
glory of discovering a new world, merely because the means of
research placed within his power, did not permit him to explore
its extensive coasts    Is not that glory   on the contrary greatly
enhanced,   by  the very early period at  which the discovery was
achieved, while navigation   as
                             a     science was still unknown?   I

shall quote a few passages, as he gives them, from his Compa
rative View, which I think are decisive in this fundamental dis
cussion.
  “Hepatic gas (sulphuretted hydrogen), as shall be shown, is
hydrogen in                 its
              full extent, holding sulphur  solution.” This                                  in
fact,    hydrogen not changing
          of                       volume,     combining with        its                         by
sulphur, has been marked among the valuable discoveries  later                                                            of
times.
     “Therefore, 100 grains          sulphur require only 100
                                                       of              102                                                or

each     a multiple of the first.  By correcting and extending Rich
ter's    scale of reciprocal saturation, and reviving Mr. Higgins's
long     neglected discovery of multiple proportion, Mr. Dalton has
been      no mean contributor to the advancement of the science.
It is difficult to say how far his figured groups of spherical atoms
have been beneficial or not.      They may have had some use in
aiding the conception of learners, and perhaps in giving a novel
and imposing air to the atomical fabric. But their arrangement,
and even their existence, are altogether hypothetical, and there
fore ought to have no place in physical demonstrations.
   That water is a compound of an atom of oxygen and an atom
of hydrogen, is assumed by Mr. Dalton as the basis of his system.
Put two volumes of hydrogen here combine with one of oxygen.
He therefore infers, that an atom of hydrogen occupies double
the bulk, in            its
                  gaseous state,        atom      oxygen.   These as
                                                               of     an             of

full development.         Mr. Dalton had ever chanced          look into                            to

  We cannot withhold from our readers the following masterly
observations, which must make every one regret, that the first

case, when different sorts combine singly, there is but one mode
of union.           If
              they unite in the proportion of two to one, the two
particles will naturally arrange themselves at opposite poles of
that to which they unite.     If they be three, they might be                                         ar

     Here we have a fine example of the stability of equilibrium,
 introduced by the combination of four atoms with one. The
 discovery which I had also the good fortune to make with regard
 to the constitutio. of aqueous sulphuric acid, that the maximum
 condensation occurred, when one atom of the real acid was com
 bined with three atoms of water, is equally consonant to Dr.
 Wollaston's views. “But in this arrangement,” says Dr. Wol
 laston, “for want of similar matter at the poles of this circle,
 the equilibrium would be unstable, and would be liable to be
 deranged by the slightest force of adjacent combinations.” Com
 pare with this remark, the following sentence from my paper on
 sulphuric acid, as published in the Journal of Science, October
 1S 17.—“The terms of dilution are, like logarithms, a series of
 numbers in arithmetical progression, corresponding to another
 series, namely, the specific gravities, in geometrical progression.
 For a little distance on both sides of the point of greatest con
 densation, the series converges with accelerated velocity, whence
 the 10 or 12 terms on either hand, deviate a little from experi
 ment.” Page 126. Or in other words, a small addition of water
 or of acid to the above atomic group, produces a great change
 on the degree of condensation; which accords with the position
 “ that the equilibrium would be liable to be deranged by the
 slightest force of adjacent combinations."

series  offine experiments,          he
                                 deduces the following important
inferences:– “Thus       evidently
                          it        appears, that     gases,       all
                                                               their                   in

  that the ratio of their union is that of 1 to 1, of 1 to 2, or of
  1 to 3, by volume.     It is important to observe, that when we
 consider the weights, there is no simple and definite relation
 between the elements of a first combination; it is only when
 there is a second between these same elements, that the new
 proportion of that body which has been added, is a multiple of
 the first.  Gases, on the contrary, in such proportions as can
 combine, give rise always to compounds whose elements are in
 volume multiples the one of the other.
        “Not
           only do the gases combine in very simple proportions,
 as we have just seen, but moreover the apparent contraction of
 volume which they experience by combination, has likewise a
 simple relation with the volume of the gases, or rather with the
 volume of one of them.”
        By supposing the contraction of volume of the two gaseous con
stituents of water to be only equal to the whole volume of oxygen
added, he found the ratio of the density of steam to be to that
of air as 10 to 16; a computed result in exact correspondence
with the experimental result lately obtained in an independent
method, by the same excellent philosopher.        “Ammoniacal gas
is composed   in volume,”   says  he,       3 parts             “of
                                                     of hydrogen and
I of azote, and                      its

the total volume, we find 0.594 for         density.   Thus        de its                         it   is
                       of by

    He conceives that the calculations will be much expedited,
and the formulae rendered more simple, by considering the smallest
proportion of any combining body, namely, that of hydrogen, as
the integer.     This radical proportion of hydrogen is the ºrgarm
0xn of the ancient philosophers.
    It has been objected by some, to our assuming hydrogen as
the unit, that the numbers representing the metals would be
come inconveniently large.          But this could never be urged by
any person acquainted with the theory of numbers.                   For in
what respect is it more convenient to reckon barium 8.75 on the
atomic scale, or 8.75 x 16 = 140 on Sir H. Davy's scale of
experiment       or is it any advantage to name, with Dr. Thomson,

combine with l of carbon =0.75, to form the compound prime
 2.75 of carbonic acid.      We likewise know that carbonate of
lime consists of 43-6 carbonic acid + 54.4 lime.       We therefore
make this   proportion, to determine the  prime equivalent  of lime.
    1.   43.6 : 54:4:: 275 : 356= prime of lime.
    2. We know that 100 parts of dry sulphate of lime consist
of 41.6 lime and 58.4 acid. Hence, to find the prime of sul
phuric acid, we make this proportion:
   41-6:58:4::3-56: 5 = prime of sulphuric acid.
   3. Sir H. Davy obtained from 100 grains of fluor spar in pow
der, acted on with repeated quantities of sulphuric acid, and
ignited, 1752 grains of sulphate of lime. Now, since 100 grains
of sulphate of lime contain, as above, 41-6 of lime, we have this
proportion:
    100 : 41-6: ; 1752 : 72-88 = lime, correponding to 1752
grains of sulphate, and which previously existed in the 100 grs.
of fluor spar. If from 100 we subtract 72-88, the difference 27-12
is the fluoric acid, or the other ingredient of the fluor, which
saturated the lime. Now to find                    its
                                       prime equivalent, we say,

of fluoric acid would come out 1:3015. As the Doctor had

  We shall give another example, derived from          more complex          a

   M. Vauquelin found, that 33 parts           lime, saturated with
                                                                 of
sorbic  acid, and carefully dried, weighed   100 grains.   Hence the

    Now we must find such an assemblage of the primes or atoms
of these elements, as will form a sum-total of 7.5; and at the
same time be to each other, in the above proportions. The fol
lowing very simple rule will give a ready approximation; and by
a common sliding scale, it may be worked by inspection.
    Multiply each proportion per cent. by the compound prime,
and compare the products with the multiples of the constituent
primes.      You can then estimate the number of each prime re
quisite to compose the whole.       Thus,
                                                      Theory.   Exp.
    0.168   × 7.5 = 1.2600   or 10 hydrogen = 1.25     16-7   16-8
    ()-2S3 × 7.5 = 2. 1225        3 carbon = 2.25      30-0   28-3
    0.549   × 7-5 = 4" l 175     4 oxygen    = 4:00    53.3   54-9
                                               7-50 100.0 100.0
     The differences between these theoretical and experimental
 proportions, are probably within the limits of the errors of the
 latter, in the present state of analysis.
     If on Dr. Wollaston's scale, we mark with a type or a pen,
 2h, 3h, &c. up to 10h; 2c, 3c, 4c, 5c ; and 2n, 3n, 4n ; re
 spectively opposite to twice, thrice, &c. the atoms of hydrogen,
 carbon, and nitrogen, as is already done for oxygen (with the
 exception of the fourth, where copper stands) we shall then have
 ready approximations to the prime components, by inspection of
 the scale.     Move the sliding part, so that one of the quantities
 per cent. may stand opposite the nearest estimate of a multiple
 prime of that constituent.     Thus we know that hydrogen, car
 bon, and oxygen, bear the relation to each other of 1, 6, 8; and,
 of course, the latter two, that of 3 to 4. But 54.9 oxygen, be
 ing more than one-half of 100, the weight of oxygen in the
 compound prime is more than the half of 7.5, and therefore
 points to 4. Place 54.9 opposite 4 oxygen (where copper stands)
  we shall find 18 opposite 10 hydrogen, and 30.7 opposite 3 car
 bon. Here we see the proportions of carbon and hydrogen, are
 both greater than by Vauquelin's analysis.        Try 51 opposite
 4 oxygen, then opposite 3 carbon we have, 28-7, and opposite
  10 hydrogen 16:9.       The proportions I have calculated arithme
 tically above, seem somewhat better approximations; they were
  deduced from hydrogen 0.125, and carbon 0.75, instead 0 132
  and 0.754, as on the scale.
     If the weight of the compound prime is not given, then we
 must proceed to estimate the nearest prime proportions, after
  inspection of those per cent.    The scale may be used with ad
 vantage, as just now explained.

1   IS         Reply to a Review in Brande's Journal of Science.
should be equally honoured with insertion in your Journal—and
to the justice of this claim you readily acceded *.
   In order to bring these circumstances more particularly to your
memory, it will be well to mention that the conversation above
referred to took place on the evening of the 14th of December
IS20, at Somerset House, a short time before the meeting of the
Royal Society; and that it was again repeated by you, in a more
cursory, yet impressive manner, immediately after the Society had
adjourned, as we were both in the act of leaving the meeting room.
   Had the review been “severe,” yet just, correct, and candid,
I should have preserved a becoming silence, and endeavoured to
profit by the admonitions bestowed on me, however harshly; but
as it possesses none of the latter qualities, I can scarcely be ex
pected to suffer it to pass unnoticed.
   When I state that the review is the reverse of being just, cor
rect, and candid, I am advancing what, I trust, I shall fully prove
to yourself and the public; and this circumstance induces me to
declare, in limine, that, although by designating that review as
“severe,” you implicitly acknowledged that you had read it;
yet, from my acquaintance with your character and urbanity of
manners, I am free to assume that you had not paid any very
particular attention to the structure of that article, and the as
sertions it comprises; or it would never have appeared in your
Journal, to which I am proud in having been one of the earliest,

and certainly not the least zealous of     contributors.
   My observations, therefore, can,         way whatever, apply
                                                                                                         so to

120        Reply to a Review in Brande's                           Journal of               Science.
   To which  assertions I beg to apply the following answers:
Answer l. The chemical history of prussic acid is Not adverted
    to superficially in my treatise.    It is more fully given, than
    in many recent works on chemistry.         It is a hundred times
    more extended than that substituted by the reviewer for
    the edification of his readers.
PRoofs.          My chemical history of Prussic Acid begins from the
           discovery  of Prussian blue, and terminates with the latest
           researches respecting the component parts and real na
           ture of the acid itself, by Gay-Lussac, whose notions and
           atomic theories are fully given; while the intermediate
           epochs of this interesting history are duly noticed, the
           labours of several eminent chemists, particularly those
           of Morveau, Scheele, Berthollet, &c. as well as those of
           M.   Porrett, in this country, are mentioned; and con
           tinued reference made throughout the section, as well as
           at the conclusion of                 it,
                                                      in to
                                          various works        which the                    in
           subject has been treated      the most  satisfactory manner.
           The historical account above alluded        occupies twenty         to
           four printed pages        my work; while not one-third
                                                of
           of that  space,     the most approved modern works on
                                    in
           chemistry, has been dedicated        that subject, excepting
                                                               to
           in  the laborious and classical system          chemistry by             of
           Dr. Thomson. The chemical history             the same sub              of
           stance, substituted             by
                                   the reviewer himself, occupies just
                                                                    -
           twenty-nine lines.
CoRollary.             O's assertion, therefore, respecting my “super
           ficiality,”      is   incorrect.
Answer      2.    It   is            have given the different pro
                            Not true, that          I

     and the Use that may be made of this Fact in determining
     Longitude.
                          To Mr. Tilloch.

sin–Ir      is very well known that some of the planets, and the
fixed stars to the second or third magnitude, may be seen in full
daylight with but small telescopes; but I am not certain whether
it is generally known, that Venus can be seen during a great por
tion of her revolution around the sun, in full sunshine with the
naked eye.    As the Moon's distance from the planets may at
some future period be employed in deducing the longitude at
sea, and Venus is easily found in the daytime, she may be of more
service in that operation than those planets which are slower and
less bright.   If you think the following extract from my diary
worth insertion in the Philosophical Magazine, as bearing upon
this point, I shall be much obliged by your making use of                                         it.     It
appears      me, that
              to          ever Venus     employedif   deducing the     is            in
longitude, she affords     ready means     extending the advantage

                             rest of the planet, which was very
                             pale, but pretty well defined; he was
1821.                         not so bright as the moon.
  Jan. 16 9 30 A.M. Saw 2 again in bright sunshine, invi
                              sible to the naked eye, very white,
                             pale, and indistinct with 170, but
                              with 40 much better; alt. about
                              15°; she was visible through thin
                              flying clouds.
   Thus she was visible to the unassisted sight from a period an
terior to 16th May, when I first saw her, until 15th June; from
that time, till about the 30th August, she was too near the sun
to be seen without better eyes than mine, unless assisted by a te
lescope, when she again became visible to the naked eye, and
continued so until about the 19th November : and, I may add,

   The above request, though anonymous, is entitled to an answer,
because the article alluded to (namely, the Notice respecting
M. Wronski's Address to the Board of Longitude, which ap
peared in our last Number) was incorrect. Dr. Young's acknow
ledgement was not publicly made, but was transmitted to M.
Wronski in a private letter, in his capacity of secretary to a                                            Pul

addressed. Our mistake, we beg                say, was not intentional

evident that the temperature of Penzance is remarkable for                                           its

          DESTRUCTION        OF ZANTE         BY AN EARTHQUAKE.
                            R. M. Academy, Woolwich,       19th February      1821.
sin–Although              it is past the usual time at which you receive
communications for your valuable journal, yet I think you may
deem the following account of the late destructive Earthquake
at Zante of sufficient interest to give it a place this month.   It
is extracted from a letter from a relation at Corfu, and I can rely
on the correctness of the information it affords.       The atmo
spheric phaenomena, which accompanied this earthquake, appear
to have been similar to those observed on other occasions, and
clearly point out an intimate connexion between the convulsions
beneath the surface of the earth and those in the atmosphere, ex
tending even to the higher regions. The circumstances of per
sonal danger, generally attending these convulsions,               are such as
not to allow of any but the most remarkable phaenomena being
observed; which is the more to be regretted, as a series of correct
observations detailing        all
                           the accompanying circumstances would
   this,

     “I
      have only one piece of news to give you, which is a very sad
one, and which perhaps you will have heard before this letter
reaches you, -the destruction of Zante by an earthquake.        On
the twenty-ninth,  at three in the morning,  we had a   very smart
shock here, which however did no damage, and, as they are very
frequent, little notice was taken of it; but the first boats from
Zante brought up news, that on the same morning, at about
twenty minutes before four, they experienced a most violent
shock, which overthrew a great many houses. The people                                                all
ran into the streets, and most into the church      St. Dionysius,            of
the patron  saint;  but scarce had they been there      short time                 a
when another shock, much stronger than the first, came and
finished what the other had left undone. Upwards        thousand                       ofa
houses are much injured; five hundred,     more,    much     that     or          so             so
they are obliged     pull them down; and numbers totally over
                               to
thrown. Providentially very few lives were lost, only ten; but
many people severely wounded and bruised.      The escape     the                                of

Latter states that, in the Thibetian manuscript, the rhinoceros
is described under the name of servo, and classed with the ele
phant; “neither,” says he, “is it the wild horse (well known
in Thibet), for that has also a different name, and is classed in
the MS. with the animals which have the hoofs undivided.”—
“I   have written (he subjoined) to the Sachia Lama, requesting
him to procure me a perfect skin of the animal, with the head,
horn, and hoofs; but it will be a long time before I can get it
down, for they are not to be met with nearer than a month's
journey from Lassa.”—Quarterly Review.

    The Chevalier Theodore Carezzini, a Piedmontese, has in
vented two kinds of round tables, which he calls geocentric and
heliocentric tables, and by their aid, a person without any know
ledge of mathematics can, in a very short time, thoroughly ob
serve the course of the stars, and explain the celestial phaeno
mena.      Ladies, and youths, whom the inventor has instructed
in his method, have, without much previous knowledge of astro
nomy, solved various problems respecting the sun, the moon,
the planets, fixed stars, eclipses, &c.     By means of these instru
ments, you may, in the open air, obtain a meridian line in a few
minutes: and in a journey by land, never miss the direction to
 the north.    You may also learn the hour during the night, with
 out a watch.     It is remarkable, that in the country the geocen
tric table may appear in the shape of an astronomical garden, of
 whatever size you please.      It is to be hoped that the inventor
 of this new method, of which we have given this imperfect no
 tice, will be able to overcome       the difficulties which usually op

                               Another piece of the land on which
the rows were  planted twelve inches apart, yielded fifteen coombs.
Another piece sown in drill, and a fourth in broad-cast, yielded
nineteen coombs per acre. The produce of this land by plough
ing is usually about six coombs.
   A field of seven acres, in the county of Surrey, was prepared
last year by the spade for barley.   The labourers earned in the                                 f

                             ON
   SIR,-In     the Phil. Mag.   for last month (Jan.) page 67, were
inserted some observations      (signed  “A Corresponde Nt) on a
paper which four years since (vol. xlix. p. 182) was communicated
to that publication at the desire of a friend of yours, but drawn
up by me. The object of the essay was to prove, that an opinion,
which was universally prevalent, respecting the influence of the
solar spots, on the seasons, was entirely without foundation;–
and to show, that during the inclement year 1816, those spots
 were neither unusually large, nor numerous; so that the obscu
 ration never occupied any considerable portion of the sun's disc.
     Under these circumstances, the direction of the solar axis, in
 the diagrams, which this “correspondent” perceives to be erro
 neous, was never intended to be given with accuracy; as it was
 a point of no material consequence to the inquiry.        Why it was
 placed at S" west, I cannot now explain, except that it was not
 from supposing that, viewed from the earth, it constantly retained
 that position, in     all
                        parts        of
                                 the orbit. Such     supposition would

  have been absurd.         was convenient

  whare; and  if it  was within the greatest elongation         the pole of
  from the vertex,     was sufficiently true for the purpose intended.

                          MERCURIAL              ATMOSPFHERE.
   Mr. Faraday states (in the Quarterly Journal of Science) that
a small piece of leaf-gold attached to the under part of the
stopper of a bottle, the bottom of which was covered, about an
eighth  of an inch deep, with mercury, having been set aside in a
dark and cool place for six or eight weeks, was found at the end
of that time whitened by the mercury. This experiment has
been repeated several times, care being taken that mercury
should not get to the gold, but by passing through the air in the
bottle, and always with the same result.     It has long been ad
mitted, that in the upper part of the barometer and thermome
ter there is an atmosphere of mercury, even in common tem
perature; and now it is proved that even in the air mercury is
always surrounded by an atmosphere of the same substance.
                                       NEW COMET.
   We announced in our last, that a new comet had been seen.
at the Royal Observatory, Paris, on the 21st of December.     We
now learn that the same comet was discovered on the same
night about seven o'clock by Signor Pons, astronomer of the
Duchy of Lucca. It appears like a white spot, not thick nor of
a kernel form, and with a very small tail.    On the 22d, Signor
Pons continued his observations, and perceived that the comet
had not changed           its
                     position, but that                   its
                                          tail was becoming more
visible, and   light had acquired greater intensity.
                   its                                 He thence
concluded that this eomet will become     rapidly more luminous,

inserted     your
              in  Number for    December,      appears  that the ta

than those        M. Burg.

   In    calculating the elements from both these tables,                             I    found
the greatest differences     the moon's semidiameter and hori

zontal parallax.   These two elements, taken from Burckhardt,

picion, that the error of the tables of Burckhardt in longitude is
less than in these two other elements, which I think has been so
far confirmed by Mr. Evans's observations.
     I should be glad if some of your correspondents would give
you, for publication, the diameter of the moon as measured on
the sun's disc. The apparent diameter, at the instant of greatest
 observation for Greenwich, is 29' 38-’98 by Burckhardt's tables,
 and 29' 43-"16 from those of Burg.

                      (See our last Volume,   page 436.)
     SIR,--I   am much obliged to your correspondent, Mr. Innes,
 for   suggesting  the probability of an error in the time of my ob
 servation of the solar eclipse on the 7th of September last. I have
 examined the minutes made on that day and the calculations,
 and find I had properly applied the equation of time, but I had
 copied the reduced time for Greenwich, instead of that for this
                                -
 place.     The longitude of this place being 2" 39° west of Green
  wich, this time should be subtracted from the time before given,
 and will stand thus:

                                            end     3     10 28.
      I beg also to state, that the time was obtained from six alti
  tudes of the sun on the morning of the 7th of September, three
  of upper and three of lower limb giving the mean altitude 17°
  6' 22" time by chron. 7: 5" 26°.

      SiR,--I   have the  pleasure   of handing to you an account of
  the quantity of rain fallen, and the quantity of evaporation that
  has taken place at Greenwich in Kent, during the year 1820.
   I have subjoined the whole quantity for the last four years, and
   you will perceive that the register of the past year has been less
   than any other, and very greatly less than that of 1819.—In the
   midland counties inconvenience has been felt for the want of
   rain, as the mills in many, and the canals in several instances
   have stopped working for the want of water.

    It is much to be hoped, that gentlemen who have good instru
ments for ascertaining the correct atmospheric pressure, will take
the trouble of making very careful observations on the second
 Monday in every month, at the hours of 8, 9, 10, l l and 12 in
the morning, as previously fixed on by Mr. Bevan.
    I am confident such observations will have their use, not only
 in ascertaining the altitude of different stations above zero, or
 the surface of the sea at low water, but may probably be the
 means of leading to some discoveries relative to the pressure of
 the atmosphere, that are not at present known.
    From corresponding barometrical observations made here, and
at London Bridge, together with those published in your valuable
Journal, I am led to believe that the altitude of Epping,         above
the surface of the sea, is not quite 400 feet; yet the hill       called
Highbeech, situated about five miles S.W. of Epping, and         which
is not higher than this place, is stated (from observations       made
in the course of the Trigonometrical Survey) at 790 feet          above
the level of the sea

 scarcely, under any form whatever, practised in this country; and
 any thing new or novel of this kind I am inclined to imagine
 will be interesting to, and invite the attention of societies en
gaged and concerned in this particular and important branch of
 human oeconomy. On a former occasion I recommended the sub
ject to their notice; and I do it now with the same persuasion of

cant return the sum of barely 931. Is this then a precedent di
stinguished by any principle of liberality? is it distinguished by a
feature of justice? It would, I imagine, be an excess of candour to
confess as much; but nay, more than this unjustly it seems, that
at some offices there is a refusal to cancel at all, or rather to
make any return whatever of the premiums received; and thus,
were it not through the instrumentality of those trafficking in
such things, it would be impossible to recover a single shilling of
the immense sums so expended, and which, under the peculiar cir
cumstance, would inevitably be sacrificed without any collateral
advantage acquired. An observation occurs now, and though im
plied, yet should be expressly so, to the credit of the Society
animadverted upon, it does then at recurring intervals divide

Analytic Formula and Talle of an increasing Life Annuity. 167
   Respecting these numbers and tabulated values, which I have
extended to other rates, but cannot well augment here, it is to
be observed when at any time needed they are directed to be
calculated by M. De Moivre's Hypothesis, from which some neat
and appropriate formula has been investigated; but it is ob
vious the values deduced by it are only approximate to the true
ones as found from the series of decrements of life; but this
latter value however can be obtained, and, excluding the hypo
thesis, with greater ease, facility and accuracy of course, after
the manner ensuing: first, having from real observations and for
any order of increase determined the value of any such annuity
upon an advanced life, or beginning from an age near the end
of the table, then having for any form chosen so determined the
value at the age begun with, we may thence assign in succession
the value for every age intercepted, or that preceding, by aid of
a subsidiary formula; and the operation being continued until
the Table is completed, as also similarly for single, joint or
longest of lives, the application may be generalized.
   Enumerating therefore the formula of derivation.                                                     Of   the

 B,    that    at    age      n,   but increasing             by   1.   2.,   31.     Then the value
of   such annuity              for   life     N,   is   expressed        by   (A    +    Bx #).
  If    the annuity increases                      in    the order            3.    5.7;      if   C        be   its

his Astronomy   has finally fixed it at 365 days  5 hours 48 min.

but as the solar year is decreasing, it is evidently the best to be
adopted in the reformation of the calendar—Pide my remarks

    the equation of the curve is so; it is not however my object to
    show how such progressions may be summed; but to direct the
    attention of those who have more leisure to the subject.
       There yet remain several illustrations of the application of
    similar principles to problems which are usually done by the me
    thod of fluxions; which will form the subjects of future commu
    nications.    I am, sir, yours, &c.

relax the effort of inspiration with sufficient suddenness to close
the Eustachian tube, and thus maintain the exhaustion; neither
is it very easy to refrain long together from swallowing the saliva,
which instantly puts an end to the experiment.
   I  may here remark, that this state of excessive tension of the
tympanum is sometimes produced by sudden increase of exter
nal pressure, as well as by decrease of that within, as is often
felt in the diving-bell as soon as it touches the water; the pres
sure of which upon the included air closes the Eustachian tube,
and, in proportion to the descent, occasions a degree of tension
on the tympanum, that becomes distressing to persons who
have not learned to obviate this inconvenience.    Those who are
accustomed to descend, probably acquire the art of opening the
Eustachian tube by swallowing, or incipient yawning, as soon as
the diving-bell touches the water.
   It seems highly probable that, in the state of artificial tension
thus produced, a corresponding deafness to low tones is occa
sioned; but, as I never have been in that situation, I have not
had an opportunity of ascertaining this point by direct experi
Inent.
   In the natural healthy state of the human ear, there does not
seem  to be any strict limit to our power of discerning low sounds.
In listening to those pulsatory vibrations of the air of which
sounds consists, if they become less and less frequent, we may
doubt at what point tones suited to produce any musical ef
fect terminate; yet     persons but those whose organs are pal
                            all
pably defective continue sensible     vibratory motion, until

sense of hearing  terminated at a note four octaves above the mid

                 On Sounds inaudible by certain Ears.            191
note to which I allude might exceed it in acuteness, as my know
ledge of the existence of this sound is derived wholly from some
 young friends who were present, and heard a chirping, when I
 was not aware of any sound.      I suppose it to have been the cry
 of some species of gryllus, and I imagine it to differ from the
gryllus campestris, because I have often heard the cry of that
insect perfectly.
     From the numerous instances in which I have now witnessed
 the limit to acuteness of hearing, and from the distinct succes
sion of steps that I might enumerate in the hearing of different
 friends, as the result of various trials that I have made among
them, I am inclined to think, that at the limit of hearing, the
interval of a single note between two sounds may be sufficient
to render the higher note inaudible, although the lower note is
                                                             -
heard distinctly.
    The suddenness of the transition from perfect hearing to total
want of perception, occasions a degree of surprise, which renders
an experiment on this subject with a series of small pipes among
several persons rather amusing.       It is curious to observe the
change of feeling manifested by various individuals of the party,
in succession, as the sounds approach and pass the limits of their
hearing. Those who enjoy a temporary triumph, are often com
pelled, in their turn, to acknowledge to how short a distance their
little superiority extends.
    Though it has not yet occurred to me to observe a limit to the
hearing of sharp sound in any person under twenty years of age,
 I am persuaded, by the account that I have received from others,
that the youngest ears are liable to the same kind of insensibility.
I have conversed with more than one person who never heard
the cricket or the bat; and it appears far more likely that such
sounds were always beyond their powers of perception, than that
they never had been uttered in their presence.
    The range of human hearing comprised between the lowest notes
of the organ and the highest known cry of insects, includes more
than nine octaves, the whole of which are distinctly perceptible
by most ears, although the vibrations of a note at the higher ex
treme are six or seven hundred fold more frequent than those
                                                                    -
which constitute the gravest audible sound.
    Since there is nothing in the constitution of the atmosphere to
prevent the existence of vibrations incomparably more frequent
than any of which we are conscious, we may imagine that ani
mals like the grylli, whose powers appear to commence nearly
where ours terminate, may have the faculty of hearing still sharper
sounds, which at present we do not know to exist; and that there
may be other insects hearing nothing in common with us, but
endued with a power of exciting, and a sense that perceives vibra
                                                               tions

tions of the same nature indeed as those which constitute our
ordinary sounds, but so remote, that the animals who perceive
them may be said to possess another sense, agreeing with our
own solely in the medium by which it is excited, and possibly
wholly unaffected by those slower vibrations of which we are
sensible.                                   -

 Society with idle speculations on mere possible modes of exist
 ence, and should not have called         attention     this subject,   its                    to

lution.   Or the specific gravity of the saturated solution is less,
than the mean sp. gr. of the salt and water.     I know of no salts,
with which this  phaenomenon    occurs, except  the ammoniacal.
   From the above experiments we may infer, that when Mr.
Dalton affirmed that the progressive dilutions of water of am
monia are effected without changing the mean volume or den
sity of the compound, he had been led into the mistake, pro
bably by the imperfection of his instruments for taking specific
gravity.
   In endeavouring to ascertain the quantity of real ammonia in
the aqueous compounds, I took the most diluted of the above
waters, to prevent the chance of any ammonia being exhaled
during the experiments.
   (1). 100 grains of the ammoniacal water, sp. gr. 0-9713, con
taining 25 grains of the strongest, required for neutralization,

might be expected from the greater volatility and decomposability
of this salt; but still according sufficiently well with the above
equivalent (or atomic) constitution.
   The experiments with the sulphuric and muriatic acids were
several times repeated, so that I have no doubt but we may
safely estimate the real alkali in 100 grains of the water of am
monia of 0.900, to be not less than 25 grains.       Sir H. Davy
makes it 26, and Mr. Dalton 22-2.
   I am preparing a complete table for every density interme
diate between 0.900 and 1.000.      Meanwhile the following rule
for ascertaining the proportion of ammonia,  will be found con
venient and tolerably correct.    Subtract the number denoting
the specific gravity of the aqueous ammonia, expressed in three
integers, from 997, and divide the remainder by 4; the quo

 XXXIII.      On the Action of the Voltaic Pile upon the Magnetic
                 Needle.       By M. BoisgerAUD Jun.
         (Read in the Academy of Sciences, 9th Nov. 1820.)
 I   wAs witness in the sitting of the llth September last, to some
 experiments relative to the action of the pile on the magnetic
needle, which were repeated by M.Arago, and of which M. QErsted
 is the inventor.    These newly observed phaenomena inspired me
 with a lively interest; I hastened to renew the experiments, and
 saw my attempt crowned with success.              I did not stop at these
first   attempts;   I made new       trials,   in which I obtained results
which appeared to me interesting, and which may perhaps assist
in explaining this sort of phaenomena. I shall confine myself to
reporting those which I coneeive to be new.
    I made use of a Galvanic trough of twenty pairs of the old
construction, and of little power.        The conducting wire was com
posed of two wires of platina of small diameter; they communi
cated with the poles of the pile, by means of brass wires of a dia
meter more considerable.          I endeavoured to increase the effects
of my first pile, by uniting it to a second exactly the same, in
such a manner as to form a battery.              This arrangement of the
apparatus     gave me occasion to ascertain that the metallic arc
which joined the extreme poles, was not the only one susceptible
of making the needle deviate; the intermediary arc, which united
one of the piles to the other, produced the same effect, and ob
served the same laws.         I was even able to approximate the       ef
fects of the two   arcs;   and according as they tended, by their re
spective positions, to produce a deviation in the same or in an
opposite direction, the effects were augmented or diminished.
    The nature of the conductors in these experiments appeared
to me to have a great influence.         Thus, a simple leaf of paper
dipped in the liquid of the troughs of the pile sufficed to diminish
the effect considerably, when it was interposed between the con
ducting wires of my apparatus; a short piece of charcoal, partly
dipped in water, destroyed it entirely *.
    The following, is in this respect, a fact remarkable enough.
Having placed the magnetic needle under the intermediary arc
in such a manner that a strong deviation was produced when I
made the two extreme poles communicate by a metallic arc, it
was not so when I established the communication with my two
hands: however, I experienced a shock rendered the more dis
   * Some experiments since made by M. Ampere, with an apparatus of
small power, proved that charcoal (especially if incandescent) does not.
entirely destroy the effects,   Water clurged with acid produces the same
effect.

 I believe was already known, is easily to be conceived, and is

  when put out of the magnetic meridian it recovered it promptly

 the needle to the pivot, and that without sensible oscillations.

 206 On the Action of the Pollaic pile upon the Magnetic Needle.
 dle point of the needle is in the vertical plane passing by the con
 ducting wire, it remains in a state of repose. This equilibrium is
 fixed, every time that in this position the conducting wire ap
 pears to exercise an attraction on the poles of the needle, and
 moveable, if it is directed in such a manner as to exercise a re
 pulsion. This remarkable phaenomenon seems to prove that the
 conducting wire acts only the poles of the needle.
    The attractions and repulsions above mentioned, succeed in
certain cases in a manner which merits observation.        The needle
 of which I made use, was placed on the water in a glass stand,
in such a manner that, to observe what passed when the conduct
ing wire was under the needle, I plunged it in the water; and
after having plunged it in the water, it came out to the right and
left of the needle before touching the edges of the glass.     I then
drew some    parallels to the meridian  by the two  points where this
wire issued from the water. I divided the surface of the water
into three parts; the one comprehended between the two wires,
and which     called interior; the two others beyond them, or ex
                  I
terior. Thus placed as indicated in the preceding table, every
time that there was attraction in the interior part, there was                                   re
pulsion in the exterior parts, and vice versit. For then the needle,
after having been repulsed in one of the divisions of water, passed
to that where it had attraction by a movement owing in part to
a declination, and more or less slow according to the distance
of the needle. Once drawn to the attractive side, it takes an
accelerated movement, which continues till        middle comes op  its
posite   to
          the conducting  wire.   This middle   point recedes slowly
from   the wire.    believe that the impossibility
                           I                            touching              of                  it

formed the entrance.    On the 18th, early in the morning, the
task was resumed,  and about noon the workmen reached the en
trance, which was eighteen feet below the surface of the ground.
The appearance indicated that the tomb was of the first rate:
but still I did not expect to find such a one as it really proved to
be.  The Fellalis advanced till they saw that it was probably a
large tomb, when they protested they could go no further, the
tomb was so much choked up with large stones, which they could
not get out of the passage. . I descended, examined the place,
pointed out to them where they might dig, and in an hour there
was room enough for me to enter through a passage that the
 earth had left under the ceiling of the first corridor, which is

to ascend by the rope into the aperture.       I
                                              saw the impossibility of
proceeding at the moment. Mr. Beechey, who that day came from
 Luxor, wished to enter the tomb, but was also disappointed.
    “The next day, the 19th, by means of a long beam we suc
ceeded in sending a man up into the aperture; and having con
trived to make a bridge of two beams, we crossed the pit. The
little aperture we found to be an opening forced through a wall,
that had entirely closed the entrance, which was as large as the
corridor. The Egyptians had closely shut it up, plastered the
wall over, and painted it like the rest of the inside of the pit,
so that, but for the aperture, it would have been impossible to
suppose that there was any further proceeding; and any one
would conclude that the tomb ended with the pit. The rope
in the inside of the well did not fall to dust, but remained pretty
strong, the water not having reached it at all; and the wood to
which it was attached was in good preservation.        It was owing
to this method of  keeping  the damp   out of the inner parts of the
tomb, that they are so well preserved.      I observed some cavities
at the bottom of the well, but found nothing in them, nor any
communication from the bottom to any other place; therefore
we could not doubt their being made to receive the waters from
the rain, which happens occasionally in this mountain.     The
valley is so much raised by the rubbish, which the water carries
down from the upper parts, that the entrance into these tombs
is become much lower than the torrents; in consequence, the
water finds       its
               way into the tombs, some      which are entirely
                                                   of

     “When  we had passed through the little aperture, we found
ourselves    in  beautiful hall, twenty-seven feet six inches

 The figures are painted on a white ground.               At the end of this
corridor we descended ten steps, which I call the small stairs,
into another, seventeen feet two inches by ten feet five inches.
From this we entered a small chamber, twenty feet four inches
by thirteen feet eight inches, to which I gave the name of the
 Room of Beauties; for it is adorned with the most beautiful
figures in basso relievo, like                              all

finest compositions that ever was made by the Egyptians, for
nothing like   it can be seen in any part of Egypt. It consists of
four figures as large as life. The god Osiris sitting on his throne
receiving the homages of a hero, who is introduced by a hawk
headed deity.      Behind the throne is a female figure as if in                        at
tendance on the great god.      The whole group is surrounded by
hieroglyphics, and inclosed in a frame richly adormed with sym
bolical figures. The winged globe is above, with the wings spread
over all, and a line of serpents crowns the whole.     The figures
and paintings are in such perfect preservation, that they give
the most correct idea of their ornaments and decorations. (Plate
 19 is copied from this composition.)
   “Straight forward is the entrance into another chamber with
two pillars. The wall of this place is outlined, ready for the
sculptor to cut out his figure. It is here that we may plainly
see the manner in which the artist prepared the figure on the
wall ready to be cut; and it is almost impossible to give a de
scription of the various figures which adorn the walls and pillars
of this chamber. There are great varieties of symbolical figures
of men, women, and animals, apparently intending to represent
the different exploits of the hero to whom the tomb was de
dicated.          .
     “On going out of this chamber into the first hall is a stair
case, which leads into a lower passage, the entrance into which
is decorated with two figures, one on each side, a male and a fe
male,as large as life. The female appears to represent Isis, having,
as usual, the horns and globe on her head.        She seems ready
to receive the hero,   who is about to enter the regions of im
mortality. The garments of this figure are so well preserved,
that nothing which has yet been brought before the public can
give a more correct idea of Egyptian costume.        The figure of
the hero is covered with a veil, or transparent linen, folded over
his shoulder, and covering his whole body, which gives him a
very graceful appearance.       Isis is apparently covered with a net,
every mesh of which contains some hieroglyphic, serving to em
bellish the dress of the goddess.        The necklace, bracelets, belt,
and other   ornaments,    are  so   well  arranged, that they produce
the most   pleasing   effect, particularly   by the artificial lights,                   all

avoid noticing a rather curious fact, that 15 walking figures in

   The known abilities of the author, his zeal in this branch of
science, and his careful discrimination in examining the charac
ter of every natural product that comes under his observation,
are too well known to geologists to render it necessary for us to
say anything in commendation of the work. We shall only say,
in one word, that it will not disappoint those practical geologists
who apply to it for information or assistance.
   To each of these families is prefixed a geological account of                                           its

in his recollection a declaration made in a previous number, he
would not so hastily, unwarrantably, and unfairly have traduced
Dr. Spurzheim. The following is the passage alluded to :
   “‘The most effectual way of persuading the public that their
opinions are refuted out of a regard to human happiness, is to
treat their authors with some small degree of liberality and gen
tleness. It is also pretty generally taken for granted, that a very
angry disputant is usually in the wrong; that it is not a sign of
much confidence in the argument, to take advantage of the unpo
pularity or legal danger of the opposite doctrine; and that when
an unsuccessful and unfair attempt is made to discredit the ge
neral ability or personal worth of an antagonist, no great reliance
is understood to be placed on the argument by which he may be
lawfully opposed.’”—(Edinburgh Rev., No. 26. page 352.)

 seven volumes    of their Researches to the society.
    A considerable number of drawings of the various tribes and
 castes, male and female, composing the community of Malaya
 lam, were laid on the table. These are understood to give a
 very accurate idea of the characteristic features of those people,
 and were executed by an able native artist, under the immediate
 direction of a gentleman, to whose kindness and zeal in promot
 ing the objects of the institution, on this as well as on former
 occasions, the society is much indebted.

thanks in a neat and impressive speech. The President having
withdrawn, it was moved, and carried unanimously, That Sir John
Newbolt, their first President, by whose able exertions the so
ciety had been established, and under whose fostering care it had
attained so great a degree of success, be requested to continue
President of the society, and  -

               TEST FOR BARYTES AND STRONTIA.
   Make a solution of the earth, whichever it may be, either in
nitric, muriatic, or some other acid which will form a soluble
salt with it: add solution of sulphate of soda in excess; filter,
and then test the clear fluid by subcarbonate of potash.  If any
precipitate falls down, the earth was strontia; if the fluid re
main clear, it was barytes.—(Journal of Science and the Arts,

  The proprietors of the Sulphuric-Acid Works at Gripsholm, in
Sweden, having had occasion to repair the leaden chamber of
their manufactory,   collected a few pounds weight of a substance
chiefly consisting of sulphur impregnated with Selenium, which
Professor Berzelius, of Stockholm, has forwarded to London, to
the care of William Allen and Co. Plough-court, Lombard-street,
requesting that it might be sold for the benefit of the proprietors
of the Gripsholm Works, at a price which they have fixed. By
application, as above, it may be had in bottles of the following
sizes, together with a translation of the process recommended
by Professor Berzelius for procuring this new substance:

   It is announced in the Journal de Medecine Pratique of Ber
lin, that the Belladonna is a preservative against this fever. The
fact was first discovered at Leipsic, but

                            SNARE WITH TWO HEADS,
  Dr. Corradori, at Ruto, in Tuscany, lately saw a snake with
two heads. Sometimes it happened that the heads differed as
to the use of their faculties: thus the one head would eat while
the other was asleep.
                                            POTATOES.
   Last year (says a writer in The Farmer's Journal), I planted
a row of sets, cut out into single eyes, from large potatoes chosen
out of a heap; the row was 25 yards in length: and next to it l
planted another row of equal length, from the smallest potatoes,
picked from the same heap : some of the latter were set whole,
and some cut in half. When I took them up, the former row
produced four bushels and a half of fine large potatoes, with
scarcely any small ones.    The other row gave so few in measure
that they        all
             went into half-bushel scuttle, and were miserably

uncertainty that seems to exist, in regard to the form of their
eccentric orbits and their periodic returns.
                       VOLCA No IN THE MOON.
   In the proceedings of the Royal Society (given in our last Num
ber) it will be seen that on the 8th February the discovery of a
volcano in the moon was announced to that distinguished body.
By the following paragraph, copied from a Plymouth newspaper,
the same or another volcano seems to have been observed also
by another person on the 16th of January.
   “Mr. Cooke, of Stonehouse, having constantly made observa
tions on the moon for the last twelve months, discovered, about
nine o'clock on the night of the 16th January (two days before
the full, and the only bright night of the moon), an effusion of
smoke, which lasted about a minute, and appeared like the flut
tering of a bird. It passed over the moon before it evaporated,
and must have fore-shortened, as it seemed in effect to have
passed over the whole disc, from the place whence it arose, on
the east of the spot Menelaus and near Plineas; but the effu
sion prevented the exact spot from being ascertained.           Mt.
Cooke had nearly finished a painting of the face of the moon in
oil, seven feet in diameter, when he learnt from a friend in the
neighbourhood, of the discovery of a volcano, which has induced
him to delay it; but it is very likely the same.”
               QUERE    RESPECTING TABLES OF VESTA.
                           To  Mr. Tilloch.
    SIR,-Give me leave, through the medium of your excellent
 publication, to avail myself of the opinion of some of your readers
 who may be fully instructed with respect to the management of
 M. Daussy's Tables of Vesta, inserted in the Connoissance des
 Tems for 1820.      I had amused myself during the winter in cal
 culating the orbit from January to April, and had a design of
 communicating it to your Magazine; but as Mess. Groombridge
 and Bode just at the moment published the positions of the
 planet, I deemed it necessary to transmit my computation.      Up
 on comparing my positions, however, with those of Mr. Groom
 bridge (for the meridian of Greenwich 3) I perceive mine to differ
 in almost every instance; and though the error in no case
 amounts to more than three minutes of a degree in right ascen
sion, and sometimes only to a few seconds, yet, as I conceive
 the fault to be mine, I feel anxious to discover the cause. There
 are two notes, one at page 219, and the other page at 255 of the
 Connoissance des Tems, neither of which I clearly understand;
 and from this circumstance the- defect

orbit with great exactness, it was necessary to carry the calcula

   I am at a loss how to interpret this cutting off a figure from
all the arguments.      Had it stated, from the equations, I should
have concluded   that, if the calculations were carried to two places
of decimals, the last figure should be suppressed. But how a
figure is to be cut off from       the arguments      longitude, ex
                                                       all                              of

converted into gas, that scarcely does there appear a single num

  Let us examine how Mr. Ricardo has come to the knowledge
that “one foot of   gas  equal    fouroil

says,   “I        have found            that         Argand burner giving light equal

not informed.     This we know, that Professor Brande states that
“an Argand burner           gas giving the light

observations may, in any way, contribute to the more accurate
determination of the longitude by this method.
  The sudden alteration in the rates of chronometers when taken
on board of ships, has been frequently observed by intelligent sea
men; and is generally ascribed to the motion of the vessels.
Before, however, I attempt to account for this alteration, I shall
first prove that it actually takes place; and, in order to do this,
shall relate the circumstances connected with the chronometers
on board the Dorothea and Trent, commanded by Capt Buchan,
which occurred during the late voyage to the north pole.
   Soon after the arrival of the ships on the coast of Spitzbergen,
the chronometers on board the Dorothea (five in number) were
found to be rapidly gaining on their former rates as determined in
London previous to the ships sailing; in consequence of which
the land appeared considerably to the westward of         true posi                       its
tion   as determined                by
                         lunar observation, and they were found                                               to
be  still gaining daily, which appeared not only from each sub
sequent set    lunars, but also
                   of                                 by
                                  comparing the longitude      dif                                   of
ferent points             of
                  land determined                          by
                                     the chronometers, with the
longitude     the same points ascertained
                 of                          the same way some            in
time afterwards.
   For instance: The longitude       remarkable point     of

the north-west coast         Spitzbergen, called Cloven Cliff, was
                                         of
found    by  a    mean         of
                      the observations taken with the chronometers
on  June 21, 1818,          10° 35' 27" E.; but the longitude

same  point
                  no of
                land     July 31, was 10° 15' 37" E., making         dif
ference     of less than about 20°       longitude     five weeks; that
                                                           of                  in
is, estimating the longitude with the same rates and errors           de                               as
termined     London before their departure. From this, therefore,
              in
it appears, they had been gaining           their former rates, on    had                            or
been  increasing   their gaining  rates,  and  diminishing   their losing
ones.
     An opportunity soon afterwards occurred     observing the ef              of
fect produced upon the chronometers       removing them          by
                                                            shore.                                on
On the 9th      August, the chronometers, nine
                    of                               number, were                   in
landed       onisland, where
                   an            temporary observatory had been
                                                      a

curately determined with     repeating circle made
                                              a        Troughton,                        by
when     was found that the acceleration
        it                                immediately  ceased; for
the longitude     the place
                          of                  it by
                              chronometers, August 12, was 9°42'
36"    E.
        but      the 27th,
                    on         was 10°        E., making difference
                                                                1'   0"                       a

   Since, therefore, the chronometers were getting easterly                                                   by
their removal             on
                   shore, the acceleration must have ceased; which
will appear  upon   consideration.
  A     similar circumstance                      was observed            by    Lieut. Franklin               to
                                                                                                          take

                   as determined             by Chronomelers at Sea.                                      251
take place with the chronometers on board the Trent, which were
four in number; and he observes,                               “It
                                             may be worthy of remark,
that the chronometers taken out by the Hon. Capt. Phipps showed
too great westerly longitude, and consequently gained on these
seas.    The fact of so many chronometers altering their rates
the same way, is curious; but I am not aware that any cause can
 be assigned.”
    The effect produced upon one or two of the chronometers by
 their removal to land, was very remarkable; a chronometer made
 by Baird was (by observations taken on shore near where the
 ships lay at anchor, by Lieutenants Franklin and Beechey, with

gen, the longitude of which was determined by a great many ob
servations of the distances of the sun and moon for several days
with Troughton's eight-inch sextants and reflecting circles. The
rates in the column entitled “Mean Rates at Sea,” are deduced
by dividing the difference of the errors by the interval.
   The rates in the column entitled “Mean Rates on Shore,” or
more properly what they would have had, are means between the
rates of chronometers on shore before leaving England, and those
obtained at Spitzbergen; and although a mean between the
rates of chronometers obtained at different times, may not accu
rately be the mean rate they would have had during the interval
of those times, from the continued variation to which they are
subject; yet, upon comparing the two last columns together, of
the rates thus deduced, it will be perceived, that in     the chro                 all
mometers their gaining rates had either been increased,        their                          or

    The first column in this table shows the pole of the magnet
 applied to the watch; the second and third, the rate or effect
 produced on each watch; the fourth column shows the figure on
 the face of the watch opposite to which the magnet was applied.
    The watch, No. 1, gained with both poles, and in every posi
 tion of the magnet but one.           No. 2 gained with both poles in
 every position. Nos. 3 and 4 gained in every position but two;
 and the quantities lost in the positions were far exceeded by the
 accelerations caused by the opposite poles, excepting one case
 in that of No. 4.
     The magnets were likewise placed in different positions out of
 the planes of the balances; the results were very similar to those
 above, but differing in quantity, according to the distance of the
 magnets from the planes of the balances.
     Upon placing the magnets very near to the rim of the balances,
 a  very   rapid acceleration took place with both poles, and in every
 position of the magnets, particularly in the watches Nos. 1 and 2.
 Upon too near an approach of the magnets, the watch No. 1,
 and chronometer No. 3, were rendered useless; the former, when
 the magnets were taken away, gaining no less than about 13
 hour, and the chronometer losing about 50" in 24 hours; and in
 again repeating the experiments in the plane of the balances,
 the rates of the chronometers (without the magnets) were so va
 riable, that it was necessary to determine their rates before and
 after each application of the magnets: the following, however, is
 a Table of the results upon the chronometers Nos. 3 and 4.

divided by cleaving into thin pieces; and these, after having be

a somewhat damp room; when 1000 grains of the alburnum of
the spring-felled tree were found to have gained 162 grains,

            HAVE the honour to make a communication to the
Society of Arts, &c., respecting the discovery, which I ori
ginally made two years and a half ago, of the chromate of iron
in the Shetland Islands, which substance is at present obtained
for the manufacturers of colours at a considerable expense from
the United States of America. Since a notice first appeared in
the journals relating to the discovery, considerable inquiries have
been made concerning

366             Discovery of Chromate of Iron in Shetland.
 but these are only from two to three inches in breadth, some
 times increasing to the breadth of five or six inches.  Many
 masses are elsewhere observable, extending a few feet and then
losing themselves in a general dissemination throughout the ser
pentine rock in which they occur.        This dissemination consists
in the diffusion of granular particles of the colour and size of
gunpowder.
   It is evident from this description that the most promising ap
pearance of the ore is adjoining the house of Mr. Edmonstone;

SIR,           -       Having

of which neither lead nor arsenic is admitted, I beg leave to
submit the same to the consideration of the Society of Arts, &c.
   The common glaze for porcelain and the finer kinds of earthen
ware contains a considerable proportion of glass of lead; this
ingredient however, on account of        being mixed with      certain        its                               a

its business: nevertheless, they venture      hope that,    those            to                              in
subjects which have come before them, they have laid the basis
for promoting future improvements and discoveries; which, <U+017F>ol
lowed       up
           with zeal and assiduity, must lead  the most beneficial                to

    cularly at low altitudes, where irregularities take place, when                         lit
    tle or no variation has taken place in the barometer or thermo
    meter:-observations on the tides, particularly in situations
    where the current is not influenced by any contiguous continent,
    as will be more fully alluded to in the sequel:—observations tend
    ing to determine the true figure of the sun, or of the earth:-
    and, in short, any observations which may be considered likely
    to advance and improve the science.
       But, it is not to observations alone that the Council would wish
    to confine the bestowing of the Society's medal.     The reduction
    of observations when        made is another and oftentimes a more                        la
    borious task:      and,   without the latter, the former would be of
     little or no service to the astronomer.        To this subject, there
    fore, the Council wish to invite the attention of the computer;
     as well as to the formation of more simple and easy tables, for
     the reduction of astronomical observations, than those at present
     in existence.      The formation of new tables for the more recently
*
     discovered    planets,    as well as more accurate tables of the sun,
     moon and other        planets,  together with those of Jupiter's satel
     lites, is a subject too important to need the recommendation of
     this Society.      The comparison likewise of the places of any of
    these bodies, observed in the present century at any of the prin
     cipal observatories, with their places deduced from the most ap
     proved tables, but more particularly those of the moon, is an ob
    ject worthy of encouragement.            In the latter case, however, it
     would be desirable that the numerical value of the arguments of
    the principal equations should be annexed to each comparison:
     and that, in          all
                         cases, the principles                  on
                                                   which the deductions are
     made should           fully and clearly stated. But, independent
                             be                                                               of
     these subjects, there are many other useful tables tending            fa           to
     cilitate astronomical calculations, some          permanent and others
                                                                    of   a
    to of   temporary            or

                                                                              a
       a  the practical   astronomer,   and   worthy  the  patronage      this         of
     Society. And, without particularizing such subjects, the Council
     wish   it   to   be
                     understood that these are amongst the objects which
     they are desirous         reward with the Society's medal.
                                      to
       The Council likewise wish   direct the attentiontothe diligent             of

    be there found of any of the more recently discovered planets or
    comets, but also with a view to the formation of a more complete
    catalogue of such stars as have, from time to time, disappeared
    from our sight.   These subjects, together with accurate and de
    scriptive accounts of the instruments used by eminent deceased
    observers, in order to estimate the reliance to be placed on their
    recorded observations, might fairly claim some mark of distinc
    tion.
      With respect to instruments,   the Council propose to bestow
    the medal for every improvement    which may tend materially to
    advance the science.   They  would mention however, as a few
    amongst the desiderata, an instrument for determining the ap
    parent magnitudes of the stars, or of ascertaining a correct scale
    whereby astronomers may be enabled to express themselves in
    one common language on this subject.        Likewise a simple but
    effectual contrivance for enabling an observer to determine the
    right ascension and declination of small stars, without the neces
    sity of illuminating the field of the telescope.     And a method
    of  applying  the reflecting telescope to transit or circular instru
    ments, in as convenient and useful a manner as the refracting
    telescope.
       It would be impossible in a report of this kind to enumerate
    all the subjects  which may be considered worthy of the Society's
    medal: neither can the Council establish any general scale for
    the precise distribution of the three kinds which it is intended to
    strike. Doubts may frequently arise on subjects of this nature:
    but, they trust they shall always act with liberality and impar
    tiality, yet at the same time with a due regard to the dignity and
    character of the Society, and the nature of the trust reposed in
    them. It may indeed appear extraordinary that no mention should
    yet have been made of the great desiderata of astronomy,      those
    questions which have exercised the curiosity and employed the
    time and attention of astronomers ever since the science has as
    sumed    itspresent character—such              as
                                             the parallax     the fixed      of
    stars, their proper motion, the motion     rest      or
                                                      our own system,
                                                                   of
    and its connection with the rest of the universe.    But these and
    many other points are too obviously suggested              by
                                                       their importance
    to need   any particular notice       or
                                       encouragement.     The man, for
    whom discoveries        of
                          this class are reserved, soars far beyond any
    distinction which this Society can bestow: the applause          the           of
    human race attends his labours; and                 no
                                                additional stimulus can

such subjects (unhappily too much neglected among the geome
ters of this country) they recommend the proposal of the Society's
gold medal and twenty guineas for the solution of the following
prize question :
        “For the best paper on the theory of the motions and per
    turbations of the satellites of Saturn.    The investigation to be
    so conducted as to take      expressly  into consideration the  in
    fluence of the rings, and the figure of the planet as modified by
    the attraction of the rings, on the motions of the satellites: to
    furnish formulae, adapted to the determination of the elements
    of their orbits, and the constant coefficients of their periodical,
    and secular equations, from observation: likewise to point out
     the observations best adapted to lead to a knowledge of such
    determination.     The papers to be sent to the Society on or
    before the 1st day of February 1823.”
And, in order to conceal the name of any unsuccessful competi
tor, the Council propose that each memoir should bear a motto;
and that a sealed paper, bearing the same motto, contain the
name of the author.       In such case, the name of the successful
 candidate only will be divulged, and the sealed papers of the rest
will be destroyed, unopened, in the presence of the Council. The
 successful paper must be left with the Society, to be published as
 they may direct; and the rest will be returned on proper appli
 cation of the authors.
     The pecuniary resources of the Society, although of course not
 large, are sufficient to answer every expense which may be         in
 curred by the adoption of the plans recommended by the Council.
 The number of resident members is 82; out of which, 12 have
 compounded for their annual payments; and there are 37 non
 resident members: so that the total assets of the Society arising
 from this source are 907 l. 4s. together with a present annual      in
 come of about 140l. subject to a further increase from the ac
 quisition of new members. The report of the auditors will state
 the sums actually received, and the sums paid by the Society,
 together with the balance remaining.         It may be proper however
 here to mention that the whole of the compositions are, by a re
 solution of the Council, to be invested from time to time in the
 Navy 5 per cents. in the joint names of the trustees; and that
 the payments of the non-resident members are at present invested
  in East India Bonds with a view to a similar permanent invest
  ment: it being conceived that these two sources of income should
  be kept distinct from the annual payments.
      The expenses of the Society, up to the present time, have been
  very trifling, principally owing to the very liberal spirit exhibited
   by the Geological Society, in granting the use of their commo
   dious  apartments for the meetings of the Council and the Mem

When Mars approaches either of these stars, the differences in
right ascension and declination, between the planet and the star,
must be taken as accurately as possible for several successive days,
with a micrometer; or their distances measured, in a straight
line: the time and place being correctly noted down.       Such ob
servations, compared with corresponding ones made in England,
will serve to determine the parallax of Mars.
   With the same view it was proposed to Captain Hall, to make
observations on Venus, at the time of her inferior conjunction in
March 1822, by comparing her with a Ceti, on the parallel of
which she will be a day or two before and after the conjunction:
a simple and easy method being at the same time suggested,
whereby Venus might be readily found in the day time, notwith
standing her proximity to the sun.
   The attention of Captain Hall was also directed to the subject
of refraction, in order to determine whether the quantity of re
fraction varies (caeteris parilus) in different parts of the globe;
or whether any new light can be thrown on this uncertain phae
nomenon, in the various places he might visit.
   Upon most of these subjects, it must be evident to the mem
bers of the Society, that there is a necessity of having correspond
ing and simultaneous observations in this country: otherwise the
labours of Captain Hall (should he be favourably situated for ob
servation) will be in a great measure lost to the public. Those
members, therefore, who possess the requisite instruments, are
called upon to co-operate on these points, and to register their
observations, in order that they may be compared at a future op
portunity.    Without this assistance the efforts of the Council will
have been exerted in vain, and the time of an active observer
employed to little or no advantage.      And here the Council can
not avoid  suggesting,  to those astronomers who possess the re
quisite instruments, the propriety of observing and recording the
 position (in right ascension and declination) of those stars which
                                                                  oº:

would serve as a mode of comparison            those observers who,                for
with less powerful instruments, might       more favourably situated          be
for making observations       this important point    at  the orbit                                 of                        of

   Since the last general meeting   the Society the Council haveof
considered the expediency     recommending           of
                                               few alterations                      a                              in

two successive years, should                             be    again eligible           to   the same situa

instead of three only : Thirdly, that any person who may be de
sirous of reading his own paper to the Society, may be at liberty
so to do: Lastly, that the mode of calling special general meet
ings should be so far altered, as to direct that the subject to be
discussed at such special meetings shall be previously laid before
 the Council; and, if the decision of the Council be not satisfac
tory to the members proposing the subject, to make it impera
tive on the Council to call a special general meeting within a
given period.    Distinct resolutions, on each of these points, will
be submitted   for your consideration *.
   During the last year the Council have considered the propriety
of appointing Committees for various purposes: amongst others,
one for determining on a set of questions to be proposed to per
sons possessing astronomical instruments, in order to ascertain
the inerits of the same ; and another to determine on the expe
diency of procuring tables of the apparent places of the 46 Green
wich stars for every day in the year. But, at present, nothing
decisive has been effected on these points.
   One of the objects of this Society being an examination of the
heavens in minute detail, the Council have likewise frequently
discussed this subject, but without being able to agree on a plan,
proper to be recommended for the adoption of the members. They
consider          it,
             however,    subject    a                     so

vours the separation of caloric from the electricity which does not
radiate; this result seems consistent with my hypothesis, that the
fluid as extricated by Volta's pile is a compound of caloric and
electricity”; but not with the other hypothesis, which supposes
it to be electricity alone.    The finest needle is competent to
discharge the product of the most powerful machine without de
triment, if received gradually as generated by them. Platina
points, as small as those which were melted like wax in my ex
periments, are used as tips to lightning rods without injury,
unless in sudden discharges produced under peculiar circum
stances       t.
   The following experiment I conceive to be very unfavourable
to the idea that galvanic ignition arises from a current -of elec
tricity.
   A cylinder of lead of about a quarter of an inch diameter, and
about two inches long, was reduced to the thickness of a common
brass pin for about three quarters of an inch. When one end was
connected with one pole of the apparatus, the other remained
suspended by this filament; yet it was instantaneously fused by
contact with the other pole. As                             all
                                      the calorific fluid which acted
upon the suspended knob, must have passed through the filament
 by which     hung, the fusion could not have resulted from
                  it                                              pure                                          a
electrical current, which would have dispersed the filament ere                                                          a
mass fifty times larger had been perceptibly affected.     According
to  my theory, caloric    not separated from the
                                      is              electricity until

circumstances very much favour a disunion, as on the passage of
the compound fluid through charcoal, the air, or a vacuum.
In operating with the deflagrator, I have found a brass knob of
about five tenths of an inch in diameter, to burn on the super
ficies only; where alone, according to my view, caloric is separated
so as to act on the mass.       Having, as mentioned in the memoir
on   my  theory of galvanism,  found that four galvanic surfaces acted
well in one recipient, I was tempted by means of the eighty coils
to extend that construction.      It occurred to me that attempts of
this kind had failed from using only one copper for each zinc
plate.     The zinc had always been permitted to react towards
the   negative  as well as the positive pole.      My coils being sur
rounded    by  copper,  it seemed  probable,   that, if electro-calorie
were, as I had suggested, carried forward by circulation arising
from galvanic polarity, this might act within the interior of the
coils, yet not be exerted between one coil and another.
    I had accordingly a trough constructed with a partition along
the middle, so as to receive forty coils on one side, and a like
number on the other.       This apparatus when in operation excited
a sensation scarcely tolerable in the backs of the hands.        Inter
posed charcoal was not ignited as easily as before; but a most
intense ignition took place on bringing a metallic point con
 nected with one pole of the series, into contact with a piece of
charcoal fastened to the other. It did not take place, however, so
 speedily as when glasses were used ; but soon after the ignition
 was effected it became even more powerful than before. A cy
linder of platina nearly a quarter of an inch in diameter, tapering
 a little at the end, was fused, and burned so as to sparkle to a
 considerable distance around, and fall in drops.       A ball of brass
of about half an inch diameter was seen to burn on its surface
with a green flame,      Tin foil, or tinsel rolled up into large coils
of about three    quarters of an inch thick, were rapidly destroyed,
 as was a wire of   platina  of No. 16. Platina wires in connexion
with the poles were brought into contact with sulphuric acid;
there was an appearance of lively ignition, but strongest on the
                   Excepting in
                                     be its
 positive side.                       power   of permeating charcoal,
the galvanic fluid seemed       to   extricated with    as
                                                         much force       as
when each coil was     in   distinct glass. Apprehending that the
                            a
partition in the trough did not sufficiently insulate the poles from
each other,     they were but few inches apart, moisture

lively scintillation took place when the poles were approximated.
Dutch gold leaf was not sensibly burned, though water was found
decomposable by wires properly affixed.       No effect was produced
on potash, the heat being inadequate to fuse                                         it.

  A piece of silvered paper about two inches square was folded
up, the metallic surface outward, and fastened into vices affixed
to the poles.   Into each vice a wire was screwed at the same
time.     The fluid generated by the apparatus was not perceptibly
conveyed by the silvered paper, as it did not prevent the wires
severally attached to the poles from decomposing water or pro
ducing ignition by contact.
    In my memoir on my theory of galvanism I suggested, that the
decomposition of water, which Wollaston effected by mechanical
electricity, might not be the effect of divellent attraction like
those excited by the poles of a voltaic pile, but of a mechanical
concussion, as when wires are dispersed by the discharge of an
electrical battery.   In support of that opinion I will now observe,
that he could not    prevent hydrogen and oxygen from being ex
tricated at each   wire, instead of hydrogen being given off only
at   one, and oxygen   at the other, as is invariably the case when
the voltaic pile is employed.      That learned and ingenious phi
losopher, in concluding his account of this celebrated experiment,
says, “but in fact the resemblance is not complete, for in every
way in which I have tried                  it,

 proceeding from the poles of a voltaic apparatus.      The particles
 were dispersed from, instead of being attracted to the wires, by
 which the influence was conveyed among them. This beng un
 deniable, it can hardly be advanced that we are to have one mode
 of explaining the separation of the elements of brass by an elec
 trical discharge, another of explaining the separation of the ele
 ments of water by the same agent; one rationale when oxygen
 is liberated from tin, and another when liberated by like means
 from hydrogen.     In the experiment in which copper was preci
 pitated by the same philosopher at the negative pole, we are not
 informed whether the oxygen and acid in union with it were at
 tracted to the other; and the changes produced in litmus are
 mentioned not as simultaneous, but successive. The violet and
 red rays of the spectrum have an opposite chemical influence in
 some degree like that of voltaic poles, but this has not led to the
 conclusion that the cause of galvanism and light is the same.
 Besides admitting that the feeble results obtained by Wollaston and
Van Marum with electrical machines, are perfectly analogous to
 those obtained by the galvanic pile, ere it can become an objec
tion to my hypothesis, it ought first to be shown that the union
between caloric and electricity, whi:h I suppose productive of
galvanic phaenomena, cannot be produced by that very process.
 If they combine to form the galvanic fluid when extricated by
ordinary galvanic action, they must have an affinity for each other.
As I have suggested in my memoir, when electricity enters the
pores of a metal, it may unite with         caloric.                its

in  operating  with the pile, it is not necessary, as in the processes
of Van Marum and Wollaston, to inclose the wires in glass or
sealing wax, in order to make the electricity emanate from a point
within a conducting fluid. The absence of this necessity is ac
counted for, according to my hypothesis, by the indisposition
which the electric fluid has to quit the caloric in union with                                                          it,

sand pairs.    The intensity produced by a single pair, must be
two thousand times less than that produced by the great pile,
and of course six hundred thousand times less than that produced
by a good electrical plate of thirty-two inches.            Yet a single pair
of about a  square   foot in   area, will  certainly   deflagrate  more wire
than a like extent of coated surface charged by such a plate.
According to Singer, it requires about one hundred and sixty
square inches of coated glass, to destroy watch pendulum wire;
a larger wire may be burned off by a galvanic battery of a foot
square.     But agreeably to the hypothesis in dispute, it compen
sates by quantity, for the want of intensity.            Hence the quantity
of fluid in the pair is six hundred thousand times greater, while
 itsintensity    six hundred thousand times less; and vice versd

  According to Singer, the electrical          accumulation is as great
when water is used, as when more powerful menstrua are em
ployed; but the power of ignition is wanting, until these are re
sorted to.      De Luc showed, by his ingenious dissections of the
pile that electricity might be produced without, or with, che
mical power. The rationale of these differences never has been
given, unless by my theory, which supposes caloric to be present
in the one case, but not in the other. The electric column was
the fruit of De Luc's sagacious inquiries, and afforded a beautiful
and incontrovertible support to the objections he made to the
idea, that the galvanic fluid is pure electricity, when extricated

   Fig. 5 is an exterior view of the instrument, and fig. 3 is a
section of the same, with the inclosed thermometer.
   The general form of the case is that of a cylinder or tube of
copper, one-eighth of an inch in thickness, and seventeen inches
in length; each end is open, and is bevelled off at the mouth for
the more free admission of water.
   v is the handle for the purpose of fixing it to the end of the
cord. This handle is moveable on two pivots, by means of which
it can readily be thrown on one side when it is necessary to take
out or put in the thermometer.
   At 2; inclies from the top, is the circular joint o 0, by means
                           water-tight joint with the body

   DEAR      SIR,-As I  understand you have advised Mr. Jamieson,
mathematical instrument maker of this city, to submit the model
of the Marine Thermometer Case constructed by him, for my use,
to the notice of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, &c.,
and that you have expressed a wish to have a written state
ment of the causes which led to my application to Mr. Jamieson,
in consequence of which he was led to undertake the construc
tion of that instrument, and also of my opinion of           utility for                      its
nautical purposes,                           comply with your wishes
                                                                I to
                       shall endeavour
                              I
 as concisely     as my power; though
                      I in                    am much afraid the de
tail into which     must necessarily enter will not admit-           the                            of   all

   The late celebrated Dr. Benjamin Franklin was,             believe,                            I
the first person who suggested the utility        the thermometer             of                                 as
 an indicator     the proarimity of,

coasts  of the United States, and the water upon the soundings
between the inner edge                   of
                             the stream and the shore.

   Colonel Williams recommends that the thermometer should be
slung, “    so   as  tow

tried this mode, and had three            my thermometers broken

tact with the ship. Some gentlemen, whose opinions respect                                       I
ed, suggested that while towed by the ship, her way through the
water would naturally cause the thermometer to rise to the sur-.
face, and that thus only the temperature of the surface water
could be obtained, and that they conceived this temperature                                                      lia
ble to be influenced by the effects of the solar rays.  To obviate
this objection, I saw the necessity of a case to inclose the ther
mometer, which would admit the water freely as long as it was
permitted to descend, but would shut as soon as it was begun to
be hauled up.
   After I was satisfied how useful a thermometer case, adapted
properly for these purposes, must prove, I applied to various me
chanics in different places to construct one for me; but they                                                       ei
ther did not sufficiently understand the matter, or considered the
safety of human lives and merchant ships and cargoes of too                                                      tri
vial importance to induce them to exercise their abilities. Be
this as it may, I was always disappointed of my object, until I
became accidentally acquainted with Mr. Jamieson, who readily
entered into my views, and made a case for my thermometer,
which completely answers my ideas, of which the model intended
to be sent to the Honourable the Society of Arts, &c.            you                                 is,    as

298                                    Description         of   the
time to avoid the danger (i.e. if his vessel is not so much crippled as
to render it impossible for him to use any means to get off shore);
and various circumstances induce me to hope that the thermo
meter will ultimately be found not only an indicator of an ap
proach to the coasts of the United States, but also, that it will
point out the proximity of land or soundings in all places to the
northward of the Tropics, and probably also to the southward of
thein, though my own experience does not warrant me in the
hope that it will within them.
   Besides these advantages, the use of the thermometer has                                                    al
ready been ascertained as illustrative of several of the oceanic
currents.          The venerable and indefatigable                           geographer,               Major
Rennell, in a letter to myself dated 6th of November last, ob
serves, “ The current from the Indian Ocean round the Cape of
Good Hope differs 10° from the Ocean water, i.e. is war MER ;
the EQUAtoRIAL CURRENT colder by 5 or 6 deg. than the Gui
nea current, which BRUshes it in passing, &c.” Thus            al                                       far
ready established.    We may surely venture    hope that     ther            to                       as
mometrical observations are multiplied, their utility will become
more obvious, and       more generally acknowledged.

   The present log-glass runs so as to answer for both the long
and short glass; the former is used when the ship's rate of going
is slow, the latter when she has great velocity.    It is intended
to be exhausted of air, so that no oxidation of the mercury can
take place, nor will it be influenced by the expansion, &c. of the
air, which is the case with the sand glasses. The fluid mercury
runs equally and more correct than sand, which always forms a
                                                 -
hollow cone as it is running.

   Those glasses have been much approved by nautical men;
they are manufactured by Messrs. W. and T. Gilbert, mathema

placed among those valuable instruments and machines in your
repository, which are so honourable to this country and to the

1.   Daturium.–M.    BRANDEs has given the name Dalurium
to a substance supposed to be an alkali obtained by him from the
seeds of the Daturium Stramonium. It is combined in the seeds
with malic acid, and is separated in the usual manner.         In water
and in cold alcohol it is nearly insoluble, but is soluble in hot
alcohol, from which it precipitates in flocculi on cooling. It
crystallizes with difficulty in quadrangular needles.         It forms
neutral salts with acids, but requires to be added in great quan
tity. Its sulphate is crystallizable, soluble in water, efflorescent,
and decomposed by fixed alkalies: the muriate forms square
plates easily soluble in water: the nitrate is crystalline and so
luble: the acetate deliquescent.      It acts on iodine in the man
ner of other alkalies, but freely.—Journal de Physique, xci.

M. Brandes in the Belladonna Atropia, which owes                  pecu                      its

              Steam-Engines at Consolidated Mines.           309
engines erected on the Consolidated Mines near Redruth, in Corn
wall, was put to work; and as two of these machines are of a
larger size than was ever before attempted, and as the concern is
one of great extent and interest, some account of it may be ac
ceptable to our readers.
     The undertaking includes four or five copper mines nearly ad
joining, and on the same veins, formerly worked very profitably
in distinct portions, until owing to difficulties in pumping the
water, and other circumstances, they were gradually abandoned
about 16 years since.
     The improvement in the use of steam power since that period
 is a prominent reason for expecting advantage to those who have
 had the spirit to renew the workings, though there are many others
 which are important, such as increased skill in the management
 of mining processes, and a reduction in the cost of labour and
those materials which are most largely consumed.        The present
company have engaged a capital of about 65,000l. in the con
 cern, and the whole is under the management of Capt. William
 Davey and Mr. John Taylor.
   . The extent of underground workings to be drained is very con
 siderable, running for about a mile in length, and reaching at the
 lowest part to a depth of about 130 fathoms under the adit, or
 level by which the water is discharged towards the sea.
     To keep the whole of these excavations dry, and to enable the
mines to be sunk deeper, three engines have been erected by
Mr. Arthur Woolf. One at the western extremity of the ground
having a cylinder of 70 inches diameter, which works a pump
about 60 fathoms deep, and two others, which we mean particu
larly to notice, are situated one near the centre, and the other
at the eastern end of the concern.
   These engines have cylinders of 90 inches diameter, the pis
tons make a stroke of 10 feet in the cylinder, and the centre of
the beams is so fixed that the rods make an eight foot stroke in
the pumps; thus they are able, at the common pressure, to raise
a load of 85,000 lbs. Each of the engines is furnished with six
wrought-iron boilers for producing high pressure steam, which
is applied in the mode usually called expansive by engineers, and
                                                                -
is condensed in the common manner.
  Three boilers are connected so as to be heated by two fires,
and are sufficient to work the engine, leaving three others to be
applied when those which have been in use are cleansing or re
pairing.
  These immense engines are executed in a very beautiful manner,
and exhibit remarkable instances of accurate workmanship and
sound calculation.    Though they exceed in power     all
                                                      others that

                                          INDIAN CORN.
  Dr. John Gorham, of Harvard University, Cambridge (U.S.),
has lately examined this grain, chemically, with great attention.
His experiments were made upon two varieties of maize, that
producing small yellow grain, and the large flat white kind, known
by the name of Virginian corn. The results were so similar, that
those only belonging to the former have been detailed.        Accord
ing to his analysis, the constituents of yellow Indian corn in the
common and dry state are:                            *

in   amethod peculiarly our own, from          conviction that we hada
discovered the causes of the material alterations which chrono
meters frequently make       their rates. This method

which have gone equally well.       We cannot offer a greater proof
that we are practical artizans, than by stating, that we are em
ployed by some of the trade to make their chronometers entirely
complete and ready for sale; and we have sold to different watch
makers twenty marine chronometers in one year, a number that
no private man could possibly make himself without employing
other workmen:—but still we trust he would be considered the
maker of them all, as being made under his direction, and he
of course being responsible for their performance.      We have for
the last five  years  made on an   average, forty marine chronome
ters per year, and our demand is considerably on the increase.
With the exception of eight or twelve, the whole of our chrono
meters for three years past have been made in our own house,
many of them sprung, and the whole without any one exception
adjusted in temperature, and finally completed and put together
by ourselves personally.     About five years ago, owing to a great
demand for    chronometers,   we applied to Mr. Molyneux (who was
 employed with others at that time by us in making escapements)
 to ascist us in springing.   He recommended us to a person who
 he informed us sprung for him, as it interfered too much with
 the operative part of his business to do them himself.    We sent
some to Mr. Molyneux to get done for us, who afterwards told
us that we had better send them to the person ourselves, as it
 would occasion less trouble.     This workman has been employed
both by Mr. Molyneux and ourselves ever since, to put chrono
meters in that state in which their more accurate adjustments may-
be perfected and completed by ourselves personally.
    The most important feature in the Polar chronometers (and
which we feel perfectiy justified in saying was produced by their
 mode of correction) was, that they took up steady and uniform
rates from the time they were put together, immediately after
their corrections were completed, none of them having been
going more than three weeks before they were delivered, and one
of them not ten days.
    In risking our property in the late hazardous enterprize, we
were actuated only by those motives which should stimulate men
 in every pursuit through life, “a desire to excel in their profes
sion;” and we cannot but feel mortified at any attempt to deprive
us of the credit as the makers.     The report existing in any other
quarter would have been unworthy our notice; but finding it very
generally circulated amongst gentlemen of science whose favour
able opinion we are anxious to cultivate, we have been induced
to make this statement.       We have the honour to be, sir,
                         Your most obedient humble servants,

   P. S.—Since we had the honour of drawing out the preceding
statement for your inspection, Mr. Molyneux has declared to
Mr. Frodsham, in the presence of a third person, “That he never
did see the chronometers we sent out with Capt. Parry,” but still
considers himself the maker for the following reasons, viz. that
a Mr. Hopkins had sprung them, who he said was his (Moly
neux’s) workman, and that he considered work done by the
workman, done by the master. In this principle we agree, pro
vided the work is done under the inspection of the master, but
not otherwise.  But we never did consider Mr. Hopkins in the
exclusive employment   of Mr. Molyneux; and even if he were,
the person who springs a chronometer cannot be regarded as the
maker, though it is an essential part of the work; for in this case
no master would be entitled to credit for his chronometers, as it
is the general practice to employ workmen to spring them; and
Mr. Molyneux does the same thing. The practical masters (amongst
whom we rank ourselves) finally adjust them, and without making
their final adjustments we could not deliver them with confidence.
   Mr. Hopkins receives only half the price for springing our
chronometers, that he is paid by other watchmakers who depend
entirely upon him to complete theirs.

 LIII.   On the atmospherical                       Refraction.                     By Mr.           J. Ivory.
                                          To the Editor.
Sir,   – Is       some researches on astronomical                                     refraction             I   found
the subjoined formula, which is not unworthy of the attention of
astronomers on account of its exactness, its convenience for cal
culation, and because it comprehends           the refractions from theall
zenith   tothe horizon      one  expression.
                                     in                not    empirical          It   is            an
formula,    or
             one obtained       altering       by
                                          the coefficients till they re
present with sufficient accuracy         certain number  a     observed                              of
places.     It  entirely theoretical, and,
                  is                             fact, borrows nothing  in
from astronomical observations.        The only elements that enter
 into its construction are the numbers that denote the refractive
force  of the air; the mean pressure                               of
                                             the atmosphere; and the
mean horizontal    refraction;  quantities   which have been taken                                                     as
they are laid down     the Mécanique Céleste.

state, the formula would therefore give the refractions for the
mean height     the barometer adopted
                      of                    the French astrono               by

  It appears from this comparison that the formula is in perfect
agreement with the French Table, at least as far as 80° from the
zenith, which includes    the useful part    suchall Table.                           of                               At

85" from the zenith the difference amounts only      1"; and the
greatest divergence                         at     0°    45' above the horizon                          is   short     of

  At 70° from the zenith the third term                                               of   the series      is   insensi

posed, if the heat decrease in the same proportion with the
pressure, the depression of 19 of the centigrade thermometer
will correspond to an elevation of nearly       or about 17;
fathoms.
   If we still neglect the effect of temperature, or, which is the
same thing, suppose the heat to be invariably the same in every
part of the atmosphere; but take into account the changes of
density arising from inequality of pressure according to the law
of Mariotte, we shall have another hypothesis very different from
that of Cassini; the air now expanding above the earth to an
unlimited extent.      In this case the thermometer, at whatever
elevation, would mark the same temperature;          or, in mathe
matical  language,   the elevation  necessary for one degree of de
pression would be infinitely great.

zontal refraction is 1824". All these quantities are very different
from the mean horizontal refraction determined by observation,
which is 2106" according to Laplace.     But there must be one
particular atmosphere in the series, which, while it possesses the
general property of representing the refractions near the zenith,
will likewise coincide with observation at the horizon. Now I
have found that this takes place in the atmosphere that has                                                               its

   As an algebraic   expression can be variable” only by changing
the numerical value of one or more of its elements, it seems most
natural and most scientific to consider the different quantities
that arise from increasing or diminishing the value of the va
riable quantity as a progression of terms.      They are sometimes
compared to the ordinates of a plane curve; the only difference
is,that   the one case we have progression

LV. Strictures on a Publication entitled “CLARK's Gas Blow
  pipe.” By Robert HARE, M.D. Professor of Chemistry in the
  Medical Department of the University of Pennsylvania, &c.
Dr.             has published a book on the Gas Blowpipe, in
            CLARK
which he  professes a “sincere desire to render every one his due.”
That it would be difficult for the conduct of any author to be
more discordant with these professions, I pledge myself to prove
in the following pages, to any reader whose love of justice may
gain for them an attentive perusal.
   In the year 1802, in a memoir republished in the 14th vol. of
Tilloch's Philosophical Magazine, London, and in the 45th vol.
of the Annales de Chimie, I had given the rationale of the heat
produced by the combustion of the aëriform elements of wa
ter, and had devised a mode of igniting them free from the dan
ger of explosion.    I had also stated in the same memoir, that
the light and heat of the flame thus produced were so intense,
that “the eyes could scarcely sustain the one, nor the most re
fractory substances resist the other,” and had likewise mentioned
the fusion of the pure earths and volatilization of the perfect me
tals as among the results of the invention.
   Subsequently in the first part of the 6th vol. of American                                       Phi
losophical Transactions, an account of the fusion of strontites,
and the volatilization of platinum, was published by me.
   About the same time my experiments were repeated before
Dr. Priestley, who gave them the credit of being quite original.
   Some years afterwards, Mr. Cloud, of the United States' mint,
who has distinguished himself by the discovery of palladium in
gold, having purified platina so as to make        gravity equal               its                    to

author of that work,    as the results of my experiments which I had
published are there quoted solely on my authority.
    The memoir of Professor Silliman, read before the Connecticut
Academy of Sciences, May 1812, and republished in Tilloch's
Magazine, but which Dr. Clark has not ventured to notice, af
fords the most unanswerable evidence that we had anticipated
him in almost every important experiment.
   Mr. Reuben Haines, corresponding secretary of the Academy of
Sciences, informed me in 1813, that in the laboratory of Dr.
Parish in this city, a mixture of the gaseous elements of water had
been inflamed while issuing in a stream from a punctured bladder
previously filled with them and duly compressed.         Any relaxa
tion of the pressure was of course productive of an explosion.
He on the other hand recollects, that at that time I proposed this
mode of supplying the blowpipe, interposing a small receptacle
(like a water valve) between the reservoir and the place of exit.
Cares more imperious prevented the execution of a plan which
did not promise to be better than -
                                       that I had before pursued suc
cessfully.
    Some time afterwards, Sir Humphry Davy's discovery of the
influence of narrow metallic apertures in impeding explosions,
encouraged Dr. Clark and others to hazard the tise of a mixed
stream of hydrogen and oxygen gas, ignited while <U+017F>lowing from
a common recipient, instead of allowing them, as I had done, to
mix only during their efflux. There is another immaterial dif
ference in the modes of operating.       In mine, hydrostatic pressure
is employed    to expel  the gases from a vessel into which they are
introduced, as generated, or by means of a bellows. In the new
mode, being pumped into the recipient by one aperture, they
flowed out at another in consequence of their elasticity.
   Dr. Clark pretends that the process he has employed is the
best. Admitting this, would it afford him any excuse for taking
so little notice of mine, or attributing the discovery of it to others,
especially while professing to give a fair history of the inven
tion   ?

the importance       employing the gases

would seem, where the highest heat is desired, evidently absurd
to employ them in any other way; because, if either gas were pre
sent in too great a quantity to be acted upon, the excess would
be worse than useless. Is it not universally an object with che
mists, to use ingredients in the proportions in which they saturate
each other, especially when within a given space and time the
 most intense reaction is to be induced   The author of this pro
fessedly candid publication would wish to convey the idea of my
 contrivance being so inferior in power to that adopted by hini,
 that in a history of the invention he does not deem it necessary
 to quote my experiments, but satisfies himself with obscure allu
 sions to them, rather in a manner to derogate than to do justice.
This procedure would be unjustifiable,   were the heat which he
has  produced  decidedly greater than that produced by me.     But
the fact is otherwise.    He fuses with difficulty oolite, Iceland
crystal, and pure native magnesia. The fusion of the best mag
nesia of the shops, and of quick lime from pure limestone, was
among my first efforts, and was mentioned in a preface, omitted
in republishing my memoir. Lately I have fused a piece of oyster
shell lime, which is perhaps as pure as any to be obtained by
artificial purification.

possibility of operating on a large scale without danger.  3d, The
power of varying the relative proportions of the gases so as to
oxidate, or deoxidate, as may be desirable.     This power is given
by the common blowpipe, though in a different way, and is well
known to be very useful.
   To me, it is ludicrous that the author should suppose any ana
logy to exist between the phaenomena of the gas blowpipe and
those of volcanoes.
        In order to put the gas blowpipe into operation, it is indispen
sable that there should be hydrogen and oxygen gases, confined
under moderate and equable compression, so as to flow out re
gularly from a common aperture, at which they may be ignited.
How are these requisites to be obtained in nature?      Whence the
pure hydrogen or oxygen        Has Dr.  Clark,  or any other person,
known them to be extricated in    purity ? Is not the former always
carburetted  crisulphuretted, and the latter never purer than in the
atmosphere       When obtained by art, fire is requisite to liberate
oxygen; but in nature, the fumes of the fire would contaminate
any gas which it might evolve; and it ought not to be forgotten,
that the circumstances which are favourable to the evolution of
oxygen, are inimical to the liberation of hydrogen.   Again, sup
posing the gaseous materials generated, where is the presiding
demon with the genius to design, and skill to regulate, that due
admixture of them which the author exults in having discovered
to be necessary And granting that there could be in nature any
competent substitute for human agency in a process so intricate,
by what means, in operations so rude and extensive, is that re
trocession of the flame to be prevented, to obviate which, in ope
rating with his minute apparatus, a capillary tube has been found
indispensable?    lu subterranean caverns, the gaseous elements
of water might create explosions, but could never support the per
manent heat requisite to fuse an ocean of lava.     The only diffi
culty this subject presents, is that of explaining the nature of
volcanic fires, of which the incessant existence is self-evident.
The   access of the atmosphere is necessary to fire in             all   its

moistening quicklime, may easily conceive that tremendous effects
might ensue from reaction between water and calcium, or any of
the same family of substances.       In this case hydrogen would be
produced, but there would be no     oxygen.—Of    the existence, how
ever, of subterraneous fires in volcanic regions there can be no
doubt, whatever may be the theory of their origin. The obvious
proximity of springs, rivers, and even of the sea itself, with the
well known force of steam, renders it easy to point out the proxi
mate cause of earthquakes, or of volcanic explosions and erup
tions, without calling in the gas blowpipe to our assistance.

his mode of operating, otherwise than as another method of doing
what I had previously accomplished, nor his experiments, unless

   Hare, page 306. “There is a peculiar species of native coal
found on the banks of the Lehigh in this State, which is extremely
difficult to ignite; which when exposed to a high degree of heat,
and a copious blast of air, burns, yielding an intense heat without
either smoke or flame, and leaving little residue.     By exposure
to the gaseous flame on this coal, both magnesia and lime ex
hibited strong symptoms of fusion. The former assumed a glazed
and somewhat globular appearance, the latter became converted
into a brownish semivitreous mass.”
   Silliman, page 109. “A piece of lime from the Carrara mar
ble was strongly ignited in a covered platinum crucible; one an
gle of it was then shaped into a small cylinder, about one-fourth
of an inch high, and somewhat thicker than a great pin. The
cylinder remained in connexion with the piece of lime.          This
was held by a pair of forceps, and thus the small cylinder of lime
was brought into contact with the heat without danger of being
blown away, and without a possibility of contamination.       There
was this further advantage, (as the experiment was delicate, and
the determination of the result might be difficult,) that as the cy
linder was held in a perpendicular position, if the lime did really
melt, the column must sink, and become at least to a degree
blended with the supporting mass of lime.     When the compound
flame fell upon the lime, the splendour of the light was perfectly
insupportable by the naked eye; and when viewed through deep
coloured glasses (as indeed              all

342                  Some Account       of the Dugong.
which I have succeeded in persuading him to send home to you
for dissection, and you will receive it by the next ships.
   The dugong which we examined measured eight feet and a
half in length, and afforded no less interest under the knife than
satisfaction on the table, as the flesh proved to be most excellent
beef. Our entertainment was truly marine; for we had on the
same day discovered those Neptunian sponges which General
Hardwicke has since described, and which served us as goblets.
   In form the dugong resembles the common cetacea, having,
like them, a broad horizontal tail, and two pectoral fins without
nails. The skin is smooth, thick, blueish above and whitish be
neath, with a few remote and scattered hairs.           The mammae (in
the two male individuals examined) are small, and situated on
the breast, immediately below the pectoral fins.
Head small in proportion, obtuse, and of a peculiar form. Upper
    lip very large, thick, and obliquely truncated, forming a short,
    thick, and nearly vertical kind of snout. The surface of the
    truncated portion is covered with soft papillae, and is also fur
    nished with a few bristles.       Two short tusks project straight
    forward from the extremity of the upper jaw, and are nearly
    covered by the upper lip, which is very moveable, and tumid
    at the margin.      The lower      lipmuch smaller, and resembles
                                             is
  a    round   or  oblong  chin.   The   margin     both lips

    with    strong  coarse bristles.   There are no incisors        either            in
   jaw (the tusks above mentioned being more properly defences),
    their place being supplied      by the rough bristly surfaces      the                 of
   palate and jaws, which serve             rasps,

Body rounded, diminishing to the tail, and without any vestige

  is supplied by fins, which offer no appearance of nails, but are
  somewhat verrucose on their anterior margin.     They are thick
  and fleshy, and neither from their form nor size capable of
  supporting or assisting the animal out of the water.

  usual mottled colour.     The trachea bifurcates very high up,
  and the two branches    diverge   to their respective lungs.
Heart situated on the left    side,   double; that is to say, having
  the ventricles entirely separate at their points, and only con
  nected at the upper part, or base. Each side possesses a ven
  tricle and auricle, with the usual valves, and without any com
  munication between the right and left sides. The left ventri
  cle, which gives off the aorta, is stronger and more muscular
  than the right, whose cavity is larger, and coats thinner.
Of the skeleton, a few observations will suffice.—The skull is
  remarkable by the peculiar manner in which the anterior part of
  the upper jaw is bent downwards, almost at a right angle, so as
      to form a kind of beak.   The lower jaw is truncated in such a
      manner as to  correspond, and become parallel with the elon
      gated portion of the upper jaw.    This portion of the lower
     jaw has eight alveolar excavations, which are sometimes empty,
      and sometimes contain the rudiments of teeth.
The vertebrae are fifty-two in number, seven to the neck, eighteen
   to the back, and twenty-seven to the tail.
Ribs, eighteen on each side.
Sternum nearly a foot long, bifurcate at the apex, and articulated
   to the cartilages of the upper ribs.
There is no pelvis or posterior extremities, but there are found
   opposite to the eighth or tenth lumbar vertebra two bones,
   one on each side, lodged in the flesh, which are narrow and
   flattened, and not above five or six inches in length. Scapulae
   broad and thick; humerus short and strong, as is also the
   radius and ulna.       The whole of these are firmly articulated to
   each   other;   and  though   externally the fins offer no appear
   ance of   fingers,       all
                            the corresponding bones are found com
   plete even    to the last phalanges.

and submarine      algae,  which    finds

spheric Phaenomena,” the Doctor has of late years recorded, the
number of his observations on small Meteors or Shooting Stars ;
                                         ñº
these, in the year 1820 were, in January 7, February 2, March 1,
April 2, May 2, June 1, July 15, August 80, September 10,
October 4, November 2, and                5; making 131 in this
year: In 1819 the annual number of such observations was 121.
   The singular fact, of the month of August having furnished so
very disproportioned a number of these observations, is accom
panied by the mention, that 35 of these were observed in one
hour, which preceded midnight on the 9th of August last—they
shot in different directions, and three of them, whose visible paths
lay between the constellations Lyra and Ursa Major, were cau
dated or appeared with tails; and the Doctor adds, “their spark
ling trains having been left brilliantly illuminated, for several se
conds of time subsequent to the disappearance of the ignited
bodies: this indeed was the grandest display of meteors we ever
remember to have seen in so short a period, arising from the very
gaseous or inflammable state of the air.”
   I have been induced to trouble you on this occasion, principally
on account of the sentence last quoted, with the hope that this
may meet the eye of Dr. Burney, and induce so indefatigable an
observer and able a calculator, to commence a series of more mi
nute observations on Shooting Stars and Meteors, with a view to
the scientific solution of the following Queries, viz.
1st. Whether a small degree of planetary Light, like that of the
   Moon when only one or two days old, be not sufficient to ob
   scure numerous of the smallest and medium shooting Stars : *;
   and the Full Moon able to obscure the whole of them, and also
   render invisible the smaller Shooting Meteors 2
2nd. With a clear Sky and the absence of planetary Light, are
   not Shooting Stars of very frequent occurrence, at           seasons     all             :

   and  in

                          these     not shoot           in    all

  atients were in the habit of drinking cold water, and that at
night; and nothing is more injurious than cold applied when the
body is warm, or hot.
    8. Have we any popular remedy for scrofula 2 Miss Smith,
daughter of Mr. Smith, at the Feathers, Brown-street, Edgeware
Road, had the glands of the neck affected, with other symptoms
of scrofula: she had been for two years under different surgeons,
without benefit, when she applied to me. I ordered the juice of
sorrel to be taken three or four times a day, and the same to be
applied on linseed meal to the wounds, which when sufficiently
drawn were to be healed by Turner's Cerate, or any simple oint
Inent.
    I have now before me a list of upwards of two hundred cures
performed with the juice of sorrel (Acetosa acetosella) taken
internally, and applied outwardly.      Mrs. Shoubert, of Hackney,
is now before   me,  who was   given over by Mr. Toulmin, of Hack
ney; but by inhaling the vital air her health was restored in a
 most extraordinary manner. A scrofulous wound near the clavicle
 appeared; but by means of sorrel juice this was removed. You
 may recollect, that this remedy we derived from the popular use
 of it in Ireland; and I have myself a little son, too young to  in
 hale the vital air, who, after being cured of water in the brain,
 which left him paralytic on one side, from debility became scro
 fulous; and having battled through the winter, with no healing
 of the wounds, I have stationed him on Highgate Hill, oppo
 site the Pound, where there is in front of the house a field filled
 with the wild sorrel, which he greedily eats, and he also drinks
 the juice; and it is applied to his wounds with the most manifest
 advantage : such is my confidence, from an experience of thirty
 years and upwards, in this simple remedy, so well adapted for
 very young children. When the wounds are sufficiently drawn
 with the sorrel juice mixed with the linseed meal, I after
 wards apply any common ointment, still continuing it internally.
     Hoping this communication may have the desired effect of
  extending the knowledge and use of the most mild, yet efficacious

                          LX.         On the American Sea Serpent.
The voyage     undertaken by Capt. Rich of Boston in 1818, for
the purpose  of taking the sea serpent of which so much had been
reported in 1817, but which voyage terminated in his catching
a thunny, or horse mackerel, served for a time to throw discredit
on    all
       the statements which had been published respecting this
wonder       of
           the deep. The subject, however, has undergone fresh
discussion, and Professor Bigelow       Boston has collected and   of
published           so
                  many documents                      of (in

   In   July, 1802, Mr. Cummings saw this extraordinary sea mon
            his passage          Belfast, between Cape Rosoi and Long
                                      at to

 that this whole appearance formed but one animal:                       seemed                              to
have         ascending and descending serpentine motion. The peo

A   few years before, perhaps               years [about 1794,] two           those                 of
 large serpents were seen                        by
                                          two other     persons        that island.  on

                      American Sea Serpent.                     357
About 20 years since, [about 1804,] two of them were seen by
one   Mr. Crocket, who then lived upon Ash Point.
    Mr. M'Lean states that a sea serpent was seen by the deceased
Capt. Paul Reed of Boothbay, about 30 years before 1804; and
another was seen in Muscongus Bay in the time of the American
war, two miles from the place where he then lived; and another
soon afterwards off Meduncook.
    Capt. Little states, that in May 1780 he was lying in Round
Pond, in Broad Bay, in a public armed ship, and at sunrise dis
covered a large serpent, or monster, coming down the bay, on
the surface of the water. “The cutter was manned and armed.
I went myself in the boat (says Capt. Little), and proceeded after
the serpent. When within a hundred feet, the marines were
ordered to fire, but before they could make ready the serpent
dove.” Judged to be from 45 to 50 feet long; largest diameter
of body about 15 inches: head about the size of a man's, and
carried from 4 to 5 feet out of the water—had every appearance
of a common black snake. “When he dove he came up near
Muscongus Island—we pursued him, but never came up within
a quarter of a mile of him again.”....“A monster of the same
description was seen in the same place by Joseph Kent of Marsh
field, 1751.    Kent said he was longer and larger than the boom
of his sloop, which was 85 tons.      He had a fair opportunity of
viewing him, as he was within 10 or 12 yards of his sloop.”
    Capt. Crabtree, then of Fox Island, in the Bay of Penobscot,     .
being informed by a neighbour that a large sea serpent was on
the water near the shore, just below his house, and having before
heard stories of the same kind, which he discredited, went to sa
tisfy himself, and “ saw a large animal in form of a snake lying
almost motionless in the sea, about 30 rods from where he stood”
—his head about 4 feet above water—apparent length 100 feet
--diameter about 3 feet.      He also states, that before that time
many people living on these islands declared to him that they had
seen such an animal.
    So far from the communication to Mr. Adams in 1804. These
statements Professor Bigelow follows up by other statements,
most of which having appeared in the newspapers, we shall notice
them very briefly :
    Capt. Perkins saw a monster of this description at Gloucester
in 1817.
   On the 6th of June, 1819, Captain Wheeler, then in his sloop
Concord sailing from New York to Salem, fourteen miles west
of Race Point, about five in the morning, saw a sea snake di
rectly a head,    about 100 yards from the sloop, moving in a
 S.W.  direction,  which it kept till it passed athwart the course
of the vessel, and appeared directly over the weather bow,
                                                               wº le

358                   American Sea Serpent.
he altered his course to S.E.     After being seen about five mi
nutes it  sunk,  and in about 8 minutes after appeared again       di
rectly over the weather quarter, about the same distance from
the sloop, and in about six minutes more he sunk and did not
rise again.—Had a distinct view of the creature: it was entirely
black; the head, which resembled a snake's, was elevated from
four to seven feet above the water, and his back appeared to be
composed of bunches or humps, apparently as large or larger
than a half barrel.    Tail not seen, but from head to last hump
apparently about 50 feet in length.-Capt. Wheeler's statement
is on oath.
   At   7  o'clock the same morning, G. Bennett, the mate of
the foregoing sloop, had his attention called to something along
side by the man at the helm : it was the same serpent, or one
similar to that seen by those on deck two hours before.         It was
not nore than 14 rods from the vessel: its head was about seven
feet out of the water: it was black, and the skin seemingly
smooth, without scales; the head as long as a horse’s, but         “a
proper snake's head”—there was a degree of flatness, with a
slight hollow on the top of his head—the eyes prominent, and
standing out considerably from the surface like those of a toad,
and nearer to the mouth than to the back of the head.             The
back composed of bunches about the size of a flour barrel, and
three feet apart—they appeared to be fixed, but this might be
occasioned by the motion of the animal, and looked like a string
of casks tied together.    The tail not visible, but it showed a ho
rizontal or  sweeping  motion,  producing a wake as large as the
vessel made. The part visible appeared to be about 50 feet in
length.    While the mate was ascending the rigging to get a bet
ter view, the animal sunk al:d did not rise again.—This account
is also on oath.
   On the 13th of August, 1819, a sea serpent was seen near the
Long Beach of Nahant, by James Prince, marshal of the district,
and more than 200 persons.       It had been seen the evening be
fore at Nahant beach     by   many people from Lynn.       It had the
general appearance already described—the bunches on his back
were 13 to 15—from 50 to 60 feet in length.          Mr. Prince had
more than a dozen distinct views of him with a good telescope
from the Long Beach, and at some of them the animal was not
more than 100 yards distant.          It was seen at intervals from a
quarter past eight till half-past
                            -       l l in the morning—the water
quite smooth.
   Mr. Samuel Cabot gives a similar description of the serpent
seen the 13th    of Aug. 1819.
   Mr. Cheever Felch, chaplain of the United States' ship Inde
pendence, of 74 guns, also describes the sea serpent as seen from
                                                                   the

the United States' schooner Science, off Gloucester, on the 19th
of Aug. 1819, within 20 yards of him. They followed him for
some time, and saw him very distinctly.      He describes it as dark
brown, with white under the throat.        Could not ascertain the
size, but the head appeared to be about three feet in circumfe
rence, flat, and much smaller than the body.        Did not see his
tail, but from the head to the end of the part seen was about 100
feet. Mr. Felch counted 14 bunches on his back, the first one 10
or 12 feet from his head, and the others about seven feet apart.
    Pontoppidan's account of the Serpens marinus magnus in his
History of Norway, published in 1747, seems to describe the
same kind of sea serpent seen on the American coast.            “It  is
usually seen in July and August, and when it is calm–º His
head was more than two feet above the water, and resembled
that of a horse. Beside the head and the neck, seven or eight
folds or coils of the animal were distinctly seen, and were about a
fathom apart.”       This is the statement of a Capt. de Ferry and
others, who saw the sea serpent with him.         Others state that
when it was calm it      lay on the water in  many  folds; and that
 there were to be seen above the water small      parts of the back
 when it moves or bends; and that at a distance these appear
 like so many casks or hogsheads, floating in a line, with a con
 siderable distance between each of them.”—The historian adds
 “ that many other persons on the coast of Norway had seen the
 sea serpent—and      thought it a strange question, when seriously
 asked, whether there was such an animal in existence; being as
 fully persuaded of the fact as of the existence of an eel or a cod.”
 LXI.    Third Report of the Commissioners appointed by His Ma
      jesty to consider the Sulject of Weights and Measures.
     May it please Your Majesty,
 Wr, the commissioners        appointed by Your Majesty for the   pur
 pose   of considering the subject of weights and measures, have
 now completed the examination of the standards which we have
 thought it necessary to compare.      The measurements which we
 have lately performed upon the apparatus employed by the late
 Sir George Shuckburgh Evelyn, have enabled us to determine with
 sufficient precision the weight of a given bulk of water, with a
 view to the fixing the magnitude of the standard of weight; that
 of length being already determined by the experiments related in
 our former reports: and we have found by the computations, which
 will be detailed in the Appendix, that the weight of a cubic inch
 of distilled water, at 62 deg. of Fahrenheit, is 252.72 grains of
 the parliamentary standard pound of 1758, supposing it to be
 weighed in a vacuum.                                               We

SiR,            explanation of the new method I have adopted for
communicating a knowledge of the Latin language, appears to
me not to be unsuited to your Philosophical Magazine.                I was
myself educated at a public school, in the usual mode, afterwards
of Trinity College, Cambridge; and having a son at Westminster,
I becamefully convinced that there required some other method of
teaching Latin than that at present pursued in our several places
of education.     I therefore have investigated in my preface to the
“Pastorals of     Virgil,”  which I published,       the different modes        all
invented for     making   youth  acquainted with the Latin tongue;
                                                                        I all
and   Ithink have demonstrated, that
                 I                              the several modes used
generally fail      the intended purpose.

SIR,    Os the appearance of the last part of the Transactions
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, I observed a communication
from General Brisbane, respecting a method of determining the
time, (which he of course conceived was either not generally or
not sufficiently known,) accompanied by a promise to transmit to
the Society an account of a method of determining the latitude
by observations made near noon. The method of determining
the time which he detailed in that inemoir, was exactly the same
as one which I had practised for a considerable period; and I
thought       it,
             therefore, probable that his promised method     de                                              of
termining the latitude might also      similar               be

“Celui   qui cherchoit a se procurer des Tables Astronomiques, pouvoit
   d'abord 6tre, avec raison, embarrassé à choisir les meilleures et les plus
   exactes ; ensuite il ne pouvoit acquérir celles qui lui étoient nécessaires,
   sans beaucoup de peine, de temps, et de dépense.”         “Un Astronome
   est donc obligé d'acheter une bibliothèque, tandis qu'il ne demandoit
   qu'un recueil choisi de Tables.    C'est pourquoi l'on souhaite depuis
   longtems que les Astronomes publient les résultats de leur travaux d'une
   façon plus commode et plus aisée." — Préface auw Tables de Berlin, war
   Bode, Lambert, et Schulze, 1776.
It has    long been      a matter   of regret with many persons, who,
though not professed astronomers, are in the habit of devoting
their leisure moments to the cultivation of celestial science; that
there exists not any catalogue of stars, the production of a British
press, upon which any reliance can be placed at the present day,
either for magnitudes or positions; whilst the foreign publica
tions of the kind are in general expensive and of difficult access,
and some of them are so to a very great degree.
   The above quoted remarks are therefore equally applicable
now, as at the period when they were originally made, at least
with regard to the Tables of the fixed Stars; since the lapse of
45 years has rendered entirely obsolete the Collection of Tables,
in three volumes, octavo, already referred to, which had been
assembled together by the laudable industry of the three distin
guished editors, under the patronage of the Royal Prussian Aca
demy.

published 32 years since, was received             by

   Being (like Wollaston's) a compilation from the whole of the
materials of which Astronomers were then in possession, this work
sufficiently indicates the rapid progress that had been made in
the course of 10 or l2 years towards supplying the deficiencies
of the other.              The arrangement is totally different from that of
Wollaston, the stars, &c. being classed in Constellations, the
number of which is augmented to 102.         Of the chief materials
employeditlits compilation, I shall give an account in the author's
own words.

   Notwithstanding the great extent and utility of Bode's Cata
logue, yet too many positions therein (particularly among stars
of the 4th, 5th, and 6th magnitudes) were inserted merely from
the authority of Flamsteed and other old observers, to give entire
satisfaction to astronomers. They therefore received with eager

                                                             to
 forany limited number                     of
                               terms, must give the depression too
great, and may sometimes make           much too great; since Mr.
                                                         it

had made the depression less instead of greater; but he has not
attempted in the slightest degree to invalidate the chain of argu
ments, by which it is undeniably demonstrated, in the Journal of
the Royal Institution, that the depression must le less than
•00418, for a tube of six-tenths of an inch in diameter, and that
it cannot therefore be either -00443 or .00431.
  While this simple computation remains uncorrected, it must
be allowed that Mr. Ivory's ingenious refinements have only fur
mished him with two methods, both of which are in error to the
extent of ten or twelve times the supposed unit, if not, like his
table in the Supplement, to the extent of twenty.     It may how
ever still be hoped, that his favourite “exponentials” may afford
him a third formula, which will again enable him to bisect this
error; and that he may have resolution to proceed in inventing
an infinite series of series, approaching by degrees to the accuracy

Every      person must recollect the anxiety—hardly mixed at last
even with a shade of hope—that was entertained for the fate of
this Expedition, when the season had once arrived that precluded
the possibility of a return without first passing a winter in the
Arctic region.     The vessels however, as our readers know, re
turned at   length  in safety, and in the volume before us we have
the record of their enterprise—a narrative which, considering the
monotonous scene in which the gallant men engaged in it were
obliged to put forth their energies, is indeed highly interesting.
Our limits necessarily compel us to be brief in our notice of this
work, so valuable to navigation and geographical inquiry.
    Capt. Parry has prefixed to his Journal a copy of his Instruc
 tions, which appear to have been drawn up with considerable
judgement.      They were in substance, that he should make the
 best of his way to Davis's Strait, and, when the ice was suffi
 ciently open to admit his approach to the western shores of the
 strait, that he should advance to the northward, as far as the
 opening into Sir James Lancaster's Sound; explore the bottom

thence, through the Russian governor, a duplicate of his journals
to London.     From Kamtschatka he was to proceed to the Sand
wich Islands or Canton, or any other place he might think pro
per, to refit the ships and refresh the crews, and then to return
to England by such route as he might deem most convenient.
Captain Parry was also allowed to winter in the Arctic regions, if
he deemed it necessary.    He was directed to make such obser
vations as might tend to the improvement of astronomy, geo
graphy, and navigation; and to collect and preserve such speci
mens of the animal, mineral and vegetable kingdoms as he might
meet with.    The Lords of the Admiralty, relying with a just and
liberal confidence on the well-known zeal and talents of Captain
Parry, left much to his discretion and judgement.
   The Hecla was commanded by Captain (then Lieut.) Parry;
the Griper by Lieut. Liddon. Both had been prepared with great
attention for the voyage, and supplied with every requisite that
could be anticipated as likely to prove useful.   The number of
persons on board both was ninety-four; the greater part of the
seamen had been employed in Captain Ross's voyage; and every
individual was allowed double the ordinary pay of His Majesty's
   º,
Navy.
          two vessels sailed from the Nore on the 10th of May 1819;
and on the 18th of June, when about lat. 58° 52' and long.48°12',
they fell in with the first “stream' of ice, and soon afterwards
they saw several icebergs.         On the evening of the 24th, some
curious effects of atmospheric refraction were observed, the low
ice being at times considerably raised in the horizon, and con
stantly altering         its
                         appearance.      The next day, the ice through

narrowest part of Davis's Straits, and had the opportunity of
confirming the accuracy of that celebrated and able navigator.
Streams of the purest water were often found flowing from the
icebergs; and from this time to the end of the voyage, snow-water
was exclusively made use of on board the ships for every purpose.
During the summer months it was found in abundance in pools,
upon the floes and icebergs; and in the winter, suow was dissolved
in the copper for their daily consumption.    On the 20th of July,
the  ships crossed a stream of  ice, of which the breadth scarcely
exceeded three hundred yards, and which occupied them con
stantly for five hours.    The next day they drifted towards an
iceberg, which was one hundred and forty feet high, and which,
from the soundings made near                  it,
                                      must have been a-ground                                    in

“bay-floes, which were from four                    to   six inches thick, ploughing
up the ice before the ship's stem,                   at     the rate        of

the line; but as, where the soundings exceed five or six hun

poses the actual depth to have been from eight to nine hundred
fathoms.   Sir George Hope's monument, which had been thought
an island in the former voyage, was now discovered to be a dark

animated the crew, Captain Parry thus speaks:
   * Being favoured, at length, by the easterly breeze which was
bringing up the Griper, and for which we had long been looking

attraction of the ship; so that the needle might now be properly
said to point to the north pole of the ship.   It was only, however,
in those  compasses   in which the  lightness of the cards, and great
delicacy in the suspension, had been particularly attended to,
that even this degree of uniformity prevailed; for, in the heavier
cards, the friction upon the points of suspension was much too
great to be overcome even by the ship's attraction, and they con
sequently remained indifferently in any position in which they
happened to be placed. For the purposes of navigation, therefore,
the compasses were from this time no longer consulted; and in
a few days afterwards the binnacles were removed, as useless
lumber, from the deck to the carpenter's store-room, where they
remained during the rest of the season, the azimuth compass alone
being kept on deck, for the purpose of watching any changes
which might take place in the directive power of the needle: and
 the true courses and direction of the wind were in future noted in
the log-book, as obtained to the nearest quarter-point, when the
sun was visible, by the azimuth of that object and the apparent
 time.”                                -
     On the following day (the 8th of August) the directive power
 of the magnet seemed to be weaker than ever; for the north pole
 of the needle, in Captain Kater's steering compass, in which the
 friction is almost entirely removed by a thread suspension, was
 observed to point steadily towards the ship's head, in whatever
 direction the latter was placed. An accidental circumstance con
 vinced Captain Parry that there was no current setting constantly
 in one direction.    A small piece of wood was picked up, which
 appeared to have been the end of a boat's yard, and which caused
 sundry amusing speculations among the gentlemen on board,
  who felt rather mortified to think that a ship had been there be
 fore them, and that, therefore, they were not entitled to the
  honour of the first discovery.     A stop was suddenly put to this
  and other ingenious inductions, by the information of one of the
  seamen that he had dropped it out of his boat a fortnight before.
     The vessels continued their progress, and several bays, capes,
  and headlands were discovered, and received names by the voy
  agers.   On the 22nd they had a clear and extensive view to the
  northward, free from ice; and they now felt that they had actu
  ally entered the Polar Sea. The magnificent opening, through
  which their passage had been effected, from Baffin's Bay to a
  channel dignified with the name of Wellington, was called Bar
  row's Straits, after the Secretary of the Admiralty.
     In latitude 75° 03' 12", long. 103° 44' 37", an island was dis
  covered, and Captain Sabine, with two other officers, landed on
  it near the east point, which was called Cape Gillman. Tire
  gentlemen reported, on their return, that
                                                                   T

     * The remains of Esquimaux habitations were found in four
 different places.   Six of these, which Captain Sabine had an op
 portunity of examining, and which are situated on a level sandy
 bank, at the side of a small ravine near the sea, are described by
 him as consisting of stones rudely placed in a circular or rather
 elliptical form.   They were from seven to ten feet in diameter;
 the broad flat sides of the stones standing vertically, and the
 whole structure, if such it may be called, being exactly similar to
 that of the summer huts of the Esquimaux, which had been seen
 at Hare Island the preceding year.      Attached to each of them
 was a small circle, generally four or five feet in diameter, which
 had probably been the fire-place.”
    The whole encampment appeared to have been deserted for
 several years; but very recent traces of the rein-deer and musk
 ox were seen in many places. The steering of the vessels now
 became very difficult, and, says our author,
    “The circumstances under which we were sailing, were, per
 haps, such as never occurred since the early days of navigation.
To the northward was the land; the ice, as we supposed, to the
southward; the compasses useless; and the sun completely ob
scured by a fog, so thick that the Griper could only now and then
be seen at a cable's length astern.     We had literally, therefore,
no mode of regulating our course, but by once more trusting to
the steadiness of the wind; and it was not a little amusing, as
well as novel, to see the quarter-master conning the ship by look
ing at the dog vane.’                                        -
    On the 2nd of September a star was seen, being the first that
had been visible for more than two months.         Two days after
wards, namely, on the 4th, at a quarter past nine P.M., the ships
crossed the meridian of 110° west from Greenwich, in the latitude
of 74° 44' 20", by which they were entitled to the reward of
5000l.     In order to comméhlorate the event, a bluff head-land
that they had just passed was called Bounty Cape. On the fol
lowing day they dropped anchor, for the first time since quitting
the English coast, in a roadstead, which was called the Bay of the
Hecla and Griper, and the crews landed on the largest of a groupe
of islands, which was called Melville Island.     ‘The ensigns and
pendants,’ says Captain Parry, “were hoisted as soon as we had
anchored, and it created in us no ordinary feelings of pleasure to
see the British flag waving, for the first time, in these regions,
which had hitherto been considered beyond the limits of the ha

bitable part of the world.”—They did not remain here many days,
before parties ventured on shooting excursions, and three men,
who had missed their way, were absent minety-one hours, and ex
posed during three nights to the inclemency of the weather.
   Captain Parry still attempted to gain a passage to the
                                                               Ward,

to some distance; but there being no hope of penetrating further
at that season, and the ice setting in very rapidly, he was induced
to return to Hecla and Griper Bay, which he regained on the
24th of September.       It was now necessary to cut a canal through
the  ice, and to draw the ships up it into the harbour. Two paral
 lellines were cut, distant from each other little more than the
breadth       the large ships, and the ice then divided into rectan
             of
gular pieces, which were again subdivided diagonally, and floated
out    of

the ardour of pursuit, forgot Capt. Parry's order that every per

     ‘John Pearson,   a marine belonging to the Griper, who was
 the last that returned on board, had his hands severely frost
 bitten, having imprudently gone away without inittens, and with
 a musket in his hand. A party of our people most providentially
found him, although the night was very dark, just as he had fallen
down a steep bank of snow, and was beginning to feel that de
gree of torpor and drowsiness which, if indulged, inevitably proves
fatal.    When he was brought on board, his fingers were quite
stiff, and bent into the shape of that part of the musket he had
been carrying; and the frost had so far destroyed the animation
in his fingers on one hand, that it was necessary to amputate

     nearly total darkness, in the middle of a severe winter, and in a
     climate where Europeans never wintered before :
        “The officers and quarter-masters were divided into four
     watches, which were regularly kept, as at sea, while the remain
     der of the ship's company were allowed to enjoy their night's rest
     undisturbed.    The hands were turned up at a quarter before six,
     and both decks were well rubbed with stones and warm sand be
     fore eight o'clock, at which time, as usual at sea, both officers
     and men went to breakfast.              Three-quarters of an hour being
     allowed after breakfast for the men to prepare themselves for
     muster, we then beat to divisions punctually at a quarter past
     nine, when every person on board attended on the quarter-deck,
     and a strict inspection of the men took place, as to their personal
     cleanliness, and the good condition, as well as sufficient warmth,
     of their clothing. The reports of the officers having been made
     to me, the people were then allowed to walk about, or, more
     usually, to run round the upper deck, while I went down to ex
     amine the state of that below, accompanied, as I before men
     tioned, by Lieut. Beechey and Mr. Edwards. The state of this
     deck may be said, indeed, to have constituted the chief source of
      our anxiety, and to have occupied by far the greatest share of our
      attention at this period.           Whenever any dampness appeared,
      or, what more frequently happened, any accumulation of ice had
      taken place during the preceding night, the necessary means were
      immediately adopted for removing it; in the former case, usually
      by rubbing the wood with cloths, and then directing the warm
      air-pipe towards the place; and in the latter, by scraping off the
      ice, so as to prevent                its

  On the probable existence and accomplishment of a north
west passage into the Pacific Ocean, Captain Parry expresses
himself thus:
   “Of the existence of such a passage, and that the outlet will
be found in Behring's Strait, it is scarcely possible, on an inspec
tion of the map, with the addition of our late discoveries, and in
conjunction with those of Cook and Mackenzie, any longer to
entertain a reasonable doubt.      In discovering one outlet from
Baffin's Bay into the Polar Sea, and finding that sea studded with
numerous islands, another link has at least been added to the
chain of evidence upon which geographers have long ventured to
delineate the northern coast of America, by a dotted line from Icy
Cape westward, to the rivers of Mackenzie and Hearne, and
thence to the known part of the coast to the north of Hudson's
Bay, in the neighbourhood of Wager River; while, at the same
time, considerable progress has been made towards the actual
accomplishment of the desired passage, which has for nearly three
centuries engaged the attention of the maritime nations of Eu

    “The success which attended our efforts during the season of
 1819, after passing through Sir James Lancaster's Sound, was
such as to inspire even the least sanguine among us with reason
able hope of the complete accomplishment of our enterprise,
before the close of the next season. In entertaining such a hope,
however, we had not rightly calculated on the severity of the cli
mate with which we had to contend, and on the consequent
shortness of the season (not exceeding seven weeks) in which it
is possible to perform the navigation of that part of the Polar
Sea. Although it must be admitted, that there is something pe
euliar about the south-west end of Melville Island, extremely un
favourable to navigation; yet it is also certain, that the obstruc
 tions we met with from ice, both as to           its
                                                thickness and extent,

 ter passing through Barrow's Strait. That we should find this
to   be  the case, might perhaps have been reasonably anticipated,
 because the proximity   to   a  permanently open sea appears        to   be
 the circumstance which,      of   all
                                    others, tends the most     temper

the meridian of Winter Harbour to the entrance of Sir James
Lancaster's Sound, a distance which it required five weeks to
traverse when going in the opposite direction, seems to offer a
reasonable ground for concluding, that an attempt to effect the
north-west passage might be made with a better chance of suc
cess, from Behring’s Strait, than from this side of America. There
are some circumstances, however, which, in my opinion, render
this mode of proceeding altogether impracticable, at least for
British ships. The principal of these arises from the length of
the voyage which must first be performed, in order to arrive at
the point where the work is to be begun.     After such a voyage,
admitting that no serious wear and tear have been experienced,
the most important part of a ship's resources, namely, the pro
visions and fuel, must be very materially reduced, and this with
out the possibility of renewing them, to the extent necessary for
such a service, and which can alone give confidence in the per
formance of an enterprise of which the nature is so precarious
and uncertain.
 ** Nor should it be forgotten how injurious to the health of the
crews, so sudden and extreme a change of climate would in all
probability prove, as that which they must necessarily experience
in going at once from the heat of the torrid zone into the intense
cold of a long winter upon the northern shores of America. Upon
the whole, therefore, I cannot but consider, that any expedition,
equipped by Great Britain with this view, will act with greater ad
vantage, by at once employing            its
                                   best energies    the attempt

Aristarchus, on the unenlightened portion of the moon's disc;
having the appearance of a small comet.          He presumes this has
been  mistaken,  by  many   observers, for a volcano. Mr. Ward also
gave an account of the occultation of the star 136 Tauri.
   A papet was next read from Professor Moll, of Utrecht, giving
an account of the late solar eclipse, as observed in many parts of
Holland.    It was annular at Amsterdam, contrary to the expec
tations of  many  persons.     The formation and dissolution of the
annulus  presented  that singular optical phaenomenon, so frequently
observed in annular eclipses: namely, an apparent adhesion of
the periphery of the moon to that of the sun, as if formed of a
glutinous substance.       This remarkable occurrence had been
pointed out by Mr. Baily, in his tract on this very eclipse, and
he had thereby excited the attention of astronomers to observe it
more particularly. It has been noticed by several persons in their
accounts of the eclipse.

   We believe but few astronomers will be found in this country,
who are not fully satisfied that a publication of such tables is
much wanted, since what we possess already of English produc
tion in this line sinks into insignificance, compared with the                                                          la
bours of foreign observers. The foreign publications of this kind
are       all
       very expensive; and what         still worse, the most important
                                                           is

    DEAR           SIR,--I am sorry
                             that it is not in my power this month,
to send the barometrical observations at this place, owing to a
mistake in the day, inadvertently concluding the 7th being the
proper day, instead of the 14th ; and not discovering my error
till too late to supply the defect.
  I have the pleasure to send you the observations made by                                              Col.

Cornfield I estimate to be about 63 feet lower than mine.

the following contrivances.

     GENTLEMEN,-On the 5th of September 1812, observing an
advertisement in the Times Newspaper, from the Regent's Canal
Company, offering a reward of 100 guineas for the best design
of a lock to save water, and give facility to passage, a copy of
which is annexed, I was induced to become a candidate.
   A design was accordingly prepared, similar to the one which
accompanies this letter, being dated the 14th of September 1812;
and feeling, from the wording of the advertisement, that I might
rely with perfect confidence upon the good faith and honour of
the parties to whose inspection the designs were to be submitted,
it was delivered at the office of Messrs. Edwards and Lyon, Soli
citors, Great Russell-street, Bloomsbury, by my brother Dr.
Gower, of Old Burlington-street. A fair time having elapsed
without receiving any intimation relative to the design, from the
tenor of the advertisement, I had reason to conclude it was not
approved; and in consequence requested Dr. Gower would have
the goodness to withdraw          He made his application accord
                                         it.
ingly,  atthe office   Messrs. Edwards and Lyon, which enabled
                              of
him     procure the design from the Regent's Canal Office, Queen
       to
Ann’s-street West, now Foley-place.
   The return          of
                   the design released me from dubiety.       was
the signal     dismission, that gave me clearly
                 of                                    understand    to

not the successful candidate.       How great then was my surprise,

it crosses the Mile-end Road         This was afterwards found         be              to

quantities. As far as 80° from the zenith, or even as far as 85°,
a greater degree of perfection can hardly be expected in this part
of astronomy.      But within 5° of the horizon, the Table is con
fessedly incorrect in theory, and does not agree so well with ob
servation.    The author of the Mécanique Céleste, by a single
artifice of calculation, both overcame the analytical difficulties of
the problem, and hit upon a law of the decrease of heat, which
affords a determination of the quantity sought, simple in         ex                                        its

    heat                                          decrease becomes

an artifice similar to that employed by Laplace for integrating
the expression of the refraction near the horizon.      The result is

   l.  Newton first discovered that certain bodies exercise on light
a peculiar attractive force.     When a ray passes obliquely from
air into  any  transparent   liquid or solid surface, it undergoes at
entrance an   angular   flexure,   which is called refraction. The
variation of this departure from the rectilineal path for any par
ticular substance, depends on the obliquity of the ray to the re
fracting surface; so that the sine of the angle of refraction, is to
that of the angle of incidence, in a constant ratio. Now New
ton found, that unctuous or inflammable bodies occasioned a
greater deviation in the luminous rays than their attractive mass
or density gave reason to expect.        Hence he conjectured, that
both diamond and water contained combustible matter, a sa
gacious anticipation of future chemical discovery.
   Dr. Wollaston invented a very ingenious apparatus, in which,
by means of a rectangular prism of flint glass, the index of re
fraction of each substance is read off at once by a vernier, the
three sides of a moveable triangle performing the operations of
reduction, in a very compendious manner.—Phil. Trans. 1802,

dispersion.           Now the mean refractive and dispersive powers                                   of
bodies are not proportional                  to

 of illuminating power may depend on this circumstance. The
 rays separated by one prism, are not capable of being further di
vided by being passed through another; and in their relations to
double refraction and reflection, they appear to agree with direct
light. An object illuminated by any of the rays in the spectrum,
 is seen double through island crystal, in the same manner as if it
 had been visible by white light.
    Under CALoRic, we have stated the power of heating which
the different coloured rays of the spectrum apparently possess.
Sir H. Englefield, and M. Berard, confirmed the results of Sir
W. Herschel, with regard to the progressive increase of calorific
influence from the violet to the red extremity of the spectrum;
and they also found with him, that a calorific influence extended
beyond the limit of the red light, into the unilluminated space.
M. Berard, however, observed, that the maximum of effect was
in the light, and not beyond                               it.

     This fine observation, due    M. Ritter and Dr. Wollaston,  to
proves, that there are rays more refrangible than the rays pro

       Davy found, that mixture        chlorine and hydrogen acted

least refrangible rays, and at last became black, but was not
affected in the most refrangible rays.    The same change was
produced by exposing it to a current of hydrogen gas. The oxide
of mercury from calomel and water of potash, when exposed to
the spectrum, was not changed in the most refrangible rays, but
became red in the least refrangible; which must have been owing
tº the absorption of oxygen. The violet rays produced upon
moistened red oxide of mercury, the same effect as hydrogen gas.
    Dr. Wollaston found, that guaiac, exposed to the violet rays,
passed rapidly from yellow to green; and MM. Gay Lussac and
Thenard applied to the same influence a gaseous mixture of hy
drogen and chlorine; when explosion immediately took place.
By placing small bits of card, coated with moist horn-silver, or
little phials of those mixed gases, in the different parts of the
spectrum, M. Berard verified the former observations of the che
mical power acquiring a maximum in the violet ray, and existing
even beyond it; but he also found, that by leaving the tests a
sufficient time in the indigo and blue rays, a perceptible effect
was produced upon them.          He concentrated by a lens         that                                      all
portion     the spectrum which extends from the green

is given to bodies, and the agency of rendering bodies inflammable
is exerted at the opposite surface; and similar chemical effects
are produced by negative electricity, and by the most refrangible
rays of the solar beam.    In general, in nature, the effects of the
solar rays are very compounded.       Healthy vegetation depends
upon the presence of the solar beams, or of light; and whilst the
heat gives fluidity and mobility to the vegetable juices, chemical
effects likewise are occasioned, oxygen is separated from them,
and inflammable compounds formed.         Plants deprived of light
become    white, and contain an excess of saccharine and aqueous
particles; and flowers owe the variety of their hues to the influ
ence of the solar beams.     Even animals require the presence of
the  rays of the sun, and their colours seem materially to depend
upon the chemical influence of these rays: a comparison between
the polar and tropical animals, and between the parts of their
bodies exposed, and those not exposed to light, shows the cor
rectness    of this opinion.

LXXIV.      Observations on certain luminous Meteors called                 Falling
           Stars.   By Dr. T. ForstER, M. B. F.L.S. &c.
SiR,   -I                       Hartwell, E. Grinstead, June 2, 1821.
            observed this morning the Queries of Mr. J. Fare
Sen., respecting Shooting Stars, as they are commonly called;
and I beg leave through your useful Magazine, to communicate
such information and references to this subject as at present occur
to me. I have for many years been an attentive observer of these
curious meteors, and have noticed their peculiarities, and the par
ticular states of the atmosphere in which they occur, with a view
to ascertain their nature, and their relation to electrical phaeno
in ena.
  On the large meteors, such, for example, as the great meteor of
August 18, 1783, many treatises have been written, to which I
have referred in a small work on atmospheric phaenomena”.      I
have there alluded to the probable connexion between these phae
nomena, and the aërolites called Meteoric Stones, and to the cu
rious observations of the late M. J. A. De Luc on this subject.
   How far the smaller meteors called Falling Stars may be re
ferable to similar causes, I am at present unable to say; neither
would I venture, in the present stage of the inquiry, to adopt any
particular hypothesis to explain them. The first object in me
teorology, as in     all
                    sciences, must           be

                        luminous            Meteors called Falling Stars.                                   419
thirteen years kept a journal of atmospherical phaenomena, and
at the same time have collected from the ancient writings of the
Greek and Roman philosophers, whatever I could find that might
bear on the object of my researches.               For, disregarding                                            all
theories, the extreme accuracy            the observations   of the Greek                   of
meteorologists renders them worthy            being referred to.    of
   My own observations                         on
                                falling stars have enabled me        divide                           to
them into three principal sorts. Of these three sorts, the largest
are very brilliant and give considerable light: they move                                                       in
curved     well

                                 in
and seldom    very   rapidly.    The colour         their light     brightof                      is
white, yellowish,      blueish, and very rarely copper coloured. They
                               or
occur mostly             on
                   fine warm summer evenings when waneclouds
abound; they seem                   to

    The next sort are much smaller, and occur               clear cold and             in
frosty nights, both      winter and summer; and also
                                      in                    warm                                      in

+}r,34.4% for the effect of buoyancy, amounting to 19:43 grains;
 and for the difference of temperature of the water and brass con
jointly, the densities being 999955 and ‘999810, the correction

grains for the whole correction of the weight, as reduced to a
vacuum at 62°, and making it 19024:46, which divided by
75,2398, the content of the cylinder, affords us 252-851 for the
cubic inch in a vacuum at 62°.
    The sphere was weighed in air at 67°, the barometer standing
at 29.74; the correction for buoyancy is here ##.”; 9.73-r, or
for 28673:51 grains, 29.72; while the temperature of 66° re
quires, for the difference between the expansion of brass and wa
ter, the addition of .00042–'000.126, or 000294 of the whole,
that is +8°43 grains, making the whole correction 38:15, and
the weight in a vacuum 28711'66; which, divided by 113,5264,
gives us 252.907, for the cubic inch in a vacuum.
    The mean of these three measures is 252,888, giving for the
three errors +-019, -'037, and +0.19; and this mean, re
duced to the Parliamentary Standard, makes 252-722 grains, for
the cubic inch of distilled water at 62°, weighed in a vacuum, or
 252'456 in air, under the common circumstances of the atmo
 sphere, when weights of brass are employed.                 In a vacuum at
 the maximum of density, that is at 39°, the weight of a true cubic
 inch will be 253 grains, and of a cubic decimetre 15440*. The
 proposed Imperial gallon, of ten pounds, or 70000 grains, of
 water, will contain very nearly 277.3 cubic inches, under com
 mon circumstances.

 SIR,          FIND in your last publication, another letter on the
 subject of the depression of mercury in capillary tubes, full of wit,
 and banter, and heavy charges of error, but containing nothing
 new in point of argument.
     In the Conn. des Tems 1812, Laplace published an article on
  the Depression in Barometer-tubes,           accompanied with a Table.
  The illustrious foreigner notices a similar Table, computed by
     [* It appears, however, from an official Report, obligingly communicated
  to us by Dr. Kelly, that the actual standard chilogramme   has been found to
  contain only 15433 English grains.]

    means of the Series, and published in England in Nicholson's
    Journal 1809. He objects to the English mode of computing,
    on the score of inaccuracy and the length of the calculations; and
    he therefore prefers another method, which is sneered at in
    the article Cohesion in the Supplement of the Encyclopaedia
    Britannica.   A translation of Laplace's article was immediately
    published in England in the same Journal 1810.      The translator
    makes no observations in words; but certain passages to be ani
    madverted on are distinguished by placing marks of admiration;
    the degrees of disapprobation being noted, in this symbolical
    criticism, by multiplying the signs. At the end of the transla
    tion, the English and French numbers are set against one another
    in hostile array: as much as to say: Here are the numbers of the
    infallible Series; and see there, the numbers of the blundering
    Frenchmen with all their refined methods of calculation.
       It was certainly to be expected that a grave philosopher, such
    I must suppose my antagonist to be, would take proper pains, be
    fore uttering injurious aspersions, to ascertain whether the charges
    he was sending forth into the world were just or not. Supposing
    him to have confidence in his series, he had in his own power a
w   sure way of verifying any suspicions of error he might entertain.
    He had only to take the elements from which I computed, or the
    elements from which the French computed; to substitute them
    in his own formula; and then to compare the results obtained
    with the results of the other methods.   I see no reason to think
    he has taken this precaution. The burden of his song is nothing
    but this: My   numbers are different from yours, and therefore
    yours must be wrong.
       I certainly have a great aversion to meddle with the clumsy
    series of my antagonist; but I must now take it in my own hands,
    and do with it what he ought to have done.         He has in fact left
    me no other mode of defence; for, if I pursue any other line of
    argument, I shall only be told that I have committed new errors.
    It were perhaps more prudent to trust the characters of the me
    thods to the opinion of the public; but still it may be worth
    while taking some pains to oppose so overbearing an attempt,
    even although the chance be small that the truth shall prevail
    against the weight of authority.
       Besides the letters in the series in the article CoHEsion in the
    Supplement of the Encyc.             Brit., I shall put y =   b   ar,   and   a   =   the
    depression:       then   a   =

q     =     196   =   14°, and   s   =    735.
      First, let 2x     =     0:5; then qr"— 12:25; which number being
    substituted   in   the series, we get this equation,
                  '735   =     3.546

  For the coefficients of this equation, 5 terms of the first series
were used; 7 terms of the second; and 5 of the third; but as
all   these last terms were diverging,                          I      reckon the coefficient about
half the true value. Means are afforded         forming      nearer                of                     a
estimate; but,     the cost would outgo

it slighted at home. It seems to have remained obscure in both
countries till 1699, when Savary, who probably knew more of
Morland's invention than he owned, obtained a patent; and in
the very same year, M. Amontons proposed something similar to:
the French Academy, I believe, as his own.            -
   The description of the manuscript in which Morland explains
his invention will be found in the improved Harleian Catalogue,
vol. iii. No. 5771; and it is also pointed out in the preface to
that volume, sect. xxii; but hitherto seems to have been as little
noticed as Morland himself.       But if he was the real inventor, as
these circumstances seem to render certain, it is highly mecessary
that his name should in future be recorded with all the honour
which an invention of such utility demands.                   -

  Case   of Mortification cured by the Application of Yeast out
           wardly, and ly the Form of Injection inwardly *.
                                                     Glasgow, June 7, 1816.
     DEAR    SIR,-My      son Robert (now a man) when a child about
 two years old, had the chicken pox, after which, in consequence
 of catching cold, in the course of a single night a mortification
 took place across his belly; on the outside it had the appearance
 of a mazarine blue ribband laid across from the one side to the
 other.     Immediately cloths dipt in barm or yeast were applied,
 repeating them as often as they began to dry, at the same time
 giving him injections of barm; they were given cold, to prevent
 them being thrown off too soon.            The reason of giving him the
 injections was, that he would not swallow the barm; and the
 Doctor assured me, the whole mass of blood was in a state of
 corruption; and indeed it appeared so, for in a few days after the
 first appearance of mortification there arose on one of his temples
 a gathering about the size of a pigeon's egg, of a very dark co
 lour, and when it broke it discharged a black watery kind of stuff:
before the first broke, a second began to gather on the other             tem
ple; it was longer in coming to maturity, but when it did break
it discharged a good thick yellow matter, when the Doctor pro
nounced him out of danger. After the application of the barm, the
blue part across the belly turned of a yellow colour, which the
Doctor took out, and then the wound had the appearance of a
mouth wide open; it could easily receive the side of a hand laid in.
The barm was continued for ten days or a fortnight, till every
appearance of danger was over; after that, there was some kind
of simple ointment applied to heal up the wound, which now has
the appearance of a deep burn after being healed.
     His diet during his illness consisted chiefly of fruit.
To    Mr. Tilloch.                                           JANET ALLAN.”
    * The last of these cases I communicated to Dr. Thornton, who thinks it
deserves to be made generally known.        The writer is a relation of my own.
When R. Allan was taken      ill,  an able medical gentleman of Glasgow was
instantly sent for. He frankly told the parents that there was no possibility
of the child recovering. It was in consequence of this; and of Mrs. Allan
having read, in one of the early volumes of the Philosophical Magazine, of
the curative powers of yeast in putrid cases, that this remedy, and with such
happy success, was resorted to.—A. T.

     Commons, on Weights and Measures. With an Appendir.
This    Select Committee appointed to consider of the several Re
ports which have been laid before this House, relating to Weights
and Measures, and of the Proceedings which have taken place for
determining the Length of the Pendulum vibrating Seconds, and
to report their Observations and Opinion thereupon to the House;
—Have considered the matters referred to them, and have agreed
to the following REPort :
    YOUR Committee concur entirely in opinion with the Com
missioners on Weights and Measures, as to the inexpediency of
changing any standard, either of length, superficies, capacity, or
of weight, which already exists in a state of acknowledged accu
racy; and where discrepancies are found between models equally
authentic, they deem it right that such a selection should be
made as will prove most accordant with generally received usage,
and with such analogies as may connect the different quantities
in the most simple ratios.
    They also concur in recommending, that the subdivisions of
weights and measures employed in this country be retained, as
being     far
            better adapted        common practical purposes than the
                                         to
decimal scale.
    For the reasons assigned                 by
                                    the Commissioners, your Committee
recommend that the        Parliamentary    brass standard       three feet,       of
              possession            of          Commons,     of                                  by

                     Report on Weights and Measures.                             43   l
drant of the meridian,       corresponds with 39.3708 inches of the
said distance.
   Your Committee recommend, that superficial measures remain
as they are now defined by law, namely, that the perch, pole or
rod, be a square of 164 feet, that the acre consists of 160 such
perches, and so of the rest.
   They further recommend, that the standard brass weight of
two pounds, also in the possession of the House of Commons, and
made in 1758, be considered as authentic ; that one half thereof
as gravitating in air at the mean height of the barometer and
with the thermometer at 62°, be henceforth the legal Troy Pound
of the British Empire, containing 5760 grains; and that 7000
grains troy be declared to constitute a pound avoirdupois.
   And it appears that a cubic inch of distilled water weighs in a
vacuum, opposed to brass weights in a vacuum also, at the tem
perature of 62 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer, 252.72 such
grains; and consequently a cubic foot of distilled water, under
similar circumstances, will weigh 62:386 pounds Avoirdupois.
   In proceeding to measures of capacity, which, for convenience,
your Committee have postponed to those of weight, they find
themselves embarrassed, as the Commissioners have been, not
only by various measures designated by the same name, but by
a discrepance in the multiples and sub-multiples of the same
measure.    They are on the whole, however, induced to believe,
that the gallon of England was originally identical for     uses;          all
and that the variations have arisen                in   some cases from accident,
and      in
       others from fraud.

Ali. the   elements indicated this passage. According to those
of  Dirksen, the immersion was to take place at 17° 30' 34", and
the emersion at 21° 5' 37" on the 25th June 1819; the hours
were reckoned according to true time, Milan meridian.      At 19"
 1S' 6" the eentre of the comet was only removed from that of
the sun 2' 8".    The aberration retards these phases 5' 31" and
the parallax half a minute for the observatories of Germany.
    In the Ephemeris of Berlin for 1822, 1 concluded (says
M. Olbers) from the observation of M. de Lindener, confirmed by
an observation made in Austria, that the comet had been invisible
on the disc of the sun; but it is now proved that the sun was
not without spots at that epoch; and if these spots were not re
marked by the two observers to whom I have alluded, the comet,
much more difficult to be seen, may also have escaped their no
tice, although a more attentive or more piercing eye might have
been able to discern       The following are incontestable proofs

recollects most    positively          of

near the south limb, or behind near the north limb, consider
ing that spots have never been seen in the neighbourhood of
the poles of the sun. This spot in the middle appeared some
what larger than double the size of the fourth satellite of Jupiter;
it was not an old spot; indeed, four days before M. Gruithuisen
had observed the following spots:
    “Near the west limb a large spot with nebulosity.
    “Towards the middle, but still a little to the west, three new
spots rather large, and some smaller ones.
    “And very near the east limb a small spot.
    “The large spots in the middle were on the 26th of June near
 the west limb, and had greatly diminished; that on the east
limb had disappeared; at least it is certain that it had not ar
rived at the middle of the sun in four days. It follows, that the
small black spot in the middle of the disc on the 26th of June
was a new spot, or the nucleus of the comet.”
    The observations of MM. Brandes and Gruithuisen appear to
indicate that between the 23d and 28th of June none of the          or
dinary spots seen before or after that period had reached the mid
dle of the solar disc; and the observation made at Hanover by
Professor Wildt, appears to confirm that made on the 26th of
                                                              -
June by M. Gruithuisen.
    “I   observed the sun,” says M.Wildt, “about the 26th of June,
one or two days sooner or later, and I saw an undefined spot, of
which I still recollect the size and the situation.    I believe it was
the comet I saw upon the sun; my observation was made towards
seven in the morning, and might have indicated the situation and
the size of the comet.     It is perhaps the only time that I did not
commit      my  observation to writing; but the spot was so faint,
 and so    indeterminate,  that it appeared to me of little interest.
 It is truly to be regretted that the idea of a comet had not oc
 curred to me. The fact of not having written down my observa
 tion leads me to think that it must have been on the 26th of
 June; for I am aware of circumstances which might have de
 prived me of the opportunity on that day.        If then the calcula
 tions of M. Olbers were confirmed by my observations, I should
 be inclined to believe that it was the comet which I saw on the
sun's disc.”
    “I will not   decide,” adds M.Olbers,” whether what MM.Grui
 thuisen and Wildt saw upon the sun (at the period of the passage)
 was really the comet, or an ordinary spot. However, none of the
 spots seen before the 26th of June could be on that day in the
  middle of the disc; and M. Brandes could not perceive at twelve
 o'clock the spot observed at eight by M. Gruithuisen: these
 two facts appear very remarkable.        It is to be regretted, that
  there has not been any decisive observation of a phaenomenon so

   A friend who called on me, to see the action of the apparatus,
observed, that if we should alter the position of the copper wire,
so as to enable us to bring a small needle between it and the
copper vessel, we should find that the under surface would either
attract or repel the needle, according to the position in which it
was held.    Accordingly, on altering the apparatus, it was found
to answer what he anticipated.
   The above apparatus is well calculated to show the rotatory
motion, as there is no twisting or untwisting of a thread, which
will alter by the addition of weight or moisture.

several letters were read from foreign astronomers detailing some
interesting particulars in the science. A communication was also
made from the venerable president (Sir Wm. Herschel) of a new
list of double stars. A paper was then read, from the Rev. Dr.
Pearson, relative to his prismatic eye-piece; being, in some
measure, a continuation of his former papers on this subject.

 viously true, that they admit of no dispute.     Nevertheless, philo
sophers on the mind, in conducting their inquiries, have relied
 too much on mere mental reflection; while physiologists, in
seeking to discover the functions of the brain, have resorted too
exclusively to dissection.    These facts explain the past and pre
sent ignorance of mankind in general, on these interesting points
in the philosophy of man; and point out, in the clearest man
mer, the necessity of resorting to a new method of inquiry, that
more perfect information may be obtained.            Dr. Gall was the
first to introduce the mode of comparing mental manifestations
with cerebral development; and this method has led to discoveries
which could never have been attained by the means previously
employed.      By this mode of philosophising, the Phrenologist has
 attained  knowledge   in place of ignorance, and system in place of
 hypothesis, in many points highly insportant in the philosophy
 of the mind, and the physiology of the brain; and while he per
 ceives, with a mixture of pity and regret, the determination with
which many sensible men adhere to the former defective systems,
he feels a perfect conviction that the new method requires only
to be studied to be highly appreciated; and that as it becomes
known the present opposition must disappear.         The ridicule with
which the new doctrines are        pursued  gives  the Society no un
easiness.     They  have experience  for their warrant in saying, that
 it is uniformly  in the ratio of the ignorance of him from whom
 it proceeds; and they know that no enlightened individual ever
 compared mental manifestations and development of brain, with
 a serious desire to discover the truth, who found it possible to
 continue to scoff.    Those who made the discoveries of Galileo
 and Newton objects of their wit, appear now to have been shal
low-minded indeed ; and those who have found subjects of ridi
cule in the constitution of their own nature, will probably be
judged by posterity to have been not more profound.         The Phre
 nologist knows that the organization and functions of the brain
 are as independent of human belief as the motions of the globe.
 individuals, therefore, may scoff at the doctrines of phrenology,
 and think them too ridiculous to merit an inquiry: but the So
 ciety are convinced, that nevertheless every human being will
 continue, although unconsciously to himself, to manifest his fa
 culties, by means of different parts of the brain, and with a power
 corresponding to their size and activity; and that mankind at
 large will believe the fact, as they did the revolution of the globe,
 whenever they turn their attention to the evidence. The Society,
therefore, hold the principles of Phrenology as no longer subject
 to doubt; and while they recommend an attention to the subject
to every reflecting and virtuous individual, who considers a know

  “One of the most obvious truths in the philosophy of man                                     is,
that the character and conduct of individuals are the results of
their innate dispositions and talents exercised     themselves, and   by
modified       by
              the circumstances      which they
                                              inare placed.     fol                   It
lows from this   principle, that crimes arise from unfortunate na
tural dispositions; from neglected education; from the influence
 ofunfavourable circumstances;         from the joint action
                                                   or                                     of   all
these causes.    The causes of crimes must be known before ef

   “No object is more interesting to Society, than the allotment
of particular professions or occupations to individuals most fitted
by nature to pursue them with advantage.      Phrenology, by means
of the cerebral development, affords a powerful help for discover

difficulty which remains, is to predict the effects of particular
combinations of the primitive powers, and of particular modes of
education upon them. Experience only can lead to certain know

by experiment and observation.      The Society, therefore, by the

obliged.
   Suppose a floating body of a cubical form, one-third of which
is above water, Where is the point situated, by which it can be
moved in a horizontal direction with the least effort?     If this
subject has been noticed by any writer, under what title is it to
be found?    By inserting this, and the answer, if it is favoured
with one, in your very valuable miscellany, you will much oblige

                            LARGE REFLECTING TF LESCOPE.
   Mr. J. Ramage, of Aberdeen, has constructed a 25 feet reflect
ing telescope, the speculum of which is 25 feet focal length, and                           .
15 inches diameter, bearing magnifying powers from 50 to 1500.
This is the largest telescope of the kind ever made, except Sir
W. Herschel's.    The mechanism by which the observer and the
instrument      are moved, is simple and well contrived.

   An English traveller of the name of Cochrane                       has reached
 Irkutsk on foot, on his road to America, by the north-east pro
 montory of Asia. On the 13th of September last, he had tra
 velled 8000 versts in 123 days entirely on foot. He sleeps in the
 open air, and wears nankeen breeches.                          --
    Mr. Campbell, the Missionary, has returned from a second
journey in South Africa. On this occasion he penetrated 800
miles from Cape Town, a greater distance than any other tra
veller had before penetrated, and considerably beyond Latakoo.
He has discovered several large towns; some containing 10,000
or 12,000 inhabitants.      The people were found friendly and
docile, possessing some skill in the manufacture of pottery, in
smelting of iron, and other arts, and so intelligent as to know the
value of and wish for the introduction of better informed artizans.
They likewise desire to have missionaries sent among them.

   The combinations of this metal with two others, namely lead
and iron, under different forms, have for some time found a place
in our catalogues of minerals.    A place must now also be made
for chrome itself in that division of mineralogical systems which
is allotted to the metals.  I am not aware at least, that the oxide
of chrome has yet been found by any one in a mative state; cer
tainly it has not been enumerated in any system of mineralogy.
   I have recently discovered it here in Shetland, in the island of
Unst. It is found in cavities in the chromate of iron, which
abounds in this island, so as, for the space of many miles, to be
scattered over the surface of the ground, and even to be used in
common with the loose stones which it accompanies in the building
of dykes.
   This oxide is easily recognised by                              its
                                                  beautiful green colour,

   Professor Sillinian having given a place to the foregoing in
his American Journal of Science, No. 5, subjoins to it the fol
lowing extract, translated from Count Bournon's Mineralogy,
as a fact still more interesting:
   “During the years 1786, 7, and 8, they were occupied near
Aix in Provence, in France, in quarrying stone for the rebuilding,
upon a vast scale, of the Palace of Justice.           The stone was a
limestone of a deep grey, and of that kind which are tender when
they come out of the quarry, but harden by exposure to the
air. The strata were separated from one another by a bed of
sand mixed with clay, more or less calcareous.           The first which
were   wrought    presented   no   appearance   of  any  foreign bodies;
but, after the workmen had removed the first ten heds, they were
astonished, when taking away the eleventh, to find               inferior                            its
surface,      the depth

   Major-General Beatson, a practical and experimental agricul
turist, has addressed his plan of culture to the farmers of the
three kingdoms, and has made an estimate of his expenses in
cropping 29 acres of wheat at Knowle Farm, near Tunbridge
Wells.    He states that his practice has proved, that the cheap
and universal manure of clay-ashes on calcined or roasted soil,
with the stubbles, &c. on the land, is sufficient and preferable for
corn crops on stiff soils, and much other land, to lime or dung,
and may be applied at the expense of 20s. an acre, instead of
the Sussex and Hampshire practice of lime and marl at 71., and
of dung or other manures of an equal or greater cost. He has
also invented a new implement of much power, and various ap
plication to the soil, as a general substitute for the ploughs and
harrows in common use.        This instrument pulverises the soil,
and  prepares  it     corn    for
                           crops,  with one horse instead      four,                                    of

The Indian and Chinese methods of well pulverising, without
turning the soil, may, it is thought, be practised with success to
a great extent in Britain.       One ploughing for wheat, though he
has not considered it necessary, has been adopted this year; and
ridge-ploughing in the winter, for the spring crops, which keeps
the land dry, and exposes it to the action of the air and frost.
The wheat stubbles, with a few faggots, have been used in burning
a considerable breadth of soil.          By using the wheat stubble as
fuel, 30 to 35 loads of soil and stubble ashes have been made per
acre on the land.         The same stubble, had it been collected and
carried at a   great   expense  from the land, would not have yielded
more than 10 loads of        dung   from the dung-heap.      Besides the
oeconomy of making manure in the field on which it is to be laid,
the operation of raking out the roots tends to clear the land
much; and it may in this manner, with the new implement, be
 made, in a very short time, as clean as a garden.        None can con
 tend that a conomy in the processes of cultivation is not the best
 means for completely relieving the agriculturist from the weight
 of that load that now oppresses him.
            CANAL BETWEEN THE ATLANTIC             AND RACIFIC.
                       [From the National Intelligencer.]
      Among many advantages of a commercial nature which would
 infallibly spring from the emancipation and attendant independ
 ence of South America, the greatest perhaps of all has hitherto
 been little noticed.      The most momentous event in favour of the
 peaceful intercourse of nations, which the physical circumstances
 of the globe present to the enterprise of man, is the formation
 of a navigable passage across the isthinus of Panama.               It is
  remarkable, that this magnificent undertaking, pregnant with
  consequences so important to mankind, and about which so little
  is known in this country, is so far from being a romantic and
  chimerical project, that it is not only practicable but easy. The
  river Chagre, which falls into the Atlantic at the town of the
  same name, about 18 leagues to the westward of Porto Bello,
  is navigable as far as Cruzes, within five leagues of Panama.
      But though the formation of a canal from this place to Panama,
  facilitated by the valley through which the present road passes,
  appears to present no very formidable obstacles, there is still a
  better expedient.      At the distance of five leagues from the mouth
  of the  Chagre,   it receives the river Trinidad, which is navigable
   to  Embarcadoro,      and from thence to Panama is a distance of
                                                             *:
  30 miles, through a level country, with a fine river to supply
  water for the canal, and no difficulty whatever to counteract the
  undertaking.—The ground has been surveyed; and not the prac
  ticability only, but the facility of the work completely
                                                                         e

The important requisite of safe harbours, at either extremity of
the canal, is also supplied to the utmost extent of our wishes.
At the mouth of the Chagre is a fine bay, which received the
British 74-gun ships in the year 1740, when Captain Knowles
bombarded the Castle of St. Lorenzo; and at the other extremity
is the famous bay of Panama.      Nor is this the only expedient for
opening the important navigation between the Pacific and                                                 At
lantic Oceans.   Further north, is the lake of Nicaragua, which
by itself almost extends the navigation from sea to sea. Into the
Atlantic Ocean it falls by a navigable river, and reaches to within
three leagues of the Gulf of Paparayo in the Pacific.
    Can we refuse to dwell for a moment upon the prospects which
the accomplishment of this splendid but not difficult enterprise
opens to the United States, as well as to Europe? It is not merely
the immense commerce of the western shores of South America,
extending almost from pole to pole, that is brought, as it were,
to our very doors; but immense would be the traffic which would
immediately begin to cover that ocean denominated Pacific. All
the riches of India and China would move towards America. The
riches of Europe and America would move towards Asia. Vast
depôts would be formed at the great commercial towns, which
would immediately arise at the two extremities of the central
canal.
   And is it too much to hope that China and Japan themselves,
thus brought so much nearer the influence of American and Eu
ropean civilization, much more constantly and powerfully subject
to     operation, would not
      its                         able     resist the salutary impres

sions, but would soon receive important changes          manners, arts,            in
ideas, and institutions      The hope rests        such strong founda         on
tions, that    seemsit   rise, upon contemplation, even
                                    to                             cer–                            to   a

   From the observations made on the 14th of May, that have
already appeared, it seems that the barometer was not so sta
tionary on that day in some parts of the country, as it was here,
and at Manchester. According to the observations of Mr. Cary
in page 400, it appears to have been steady from nine o'clock
to one, at the place where they were taken; but at Bushy-Heath,
and Northampton,                      its
                        fluctuations were frequent, and consider

   My Barometer is a very good one of the kind—it was the fa
vourite one of the late Mr. H. Andrews, of Royston, which he
used for his Weather Journal.
   The observations of your correspondents, made on the second
Monday in the month, will be of great use in finding out the
height of different places from the level of the sea; and will pro
bably lead to a more accurate knowledge of the causes of the
amazing changes that take place in the atmosphere, with regard  -
to     its
       weight, temperature, &c.
   Those who keep meteorological journals cannot but have re
marked the mildness       January; the dryness and amazing baro
                                        of
metrical pressure during the month        February”; the heat that        of
prevailed towards the end        April, with much lightning and
                                                          of

   Upon examining the construction of the best portable baro
meters, I have noticed one probable source of error in the posi
tion of the attached Thermometer which is fixed near the basin
of mercury, and possibly may give nearly the heat of that portion
of the mercury.     But when it is considered that    fluids com                                all
