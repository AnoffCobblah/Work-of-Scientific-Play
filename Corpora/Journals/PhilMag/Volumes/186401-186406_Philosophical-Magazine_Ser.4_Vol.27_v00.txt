proposition, he compares calculation with observation, and vainly
endeavours to explain the glaring discrepancy by assumptions
which are both gratuitous and untenable.
    The logical incompleteness of Newton's solution of the pro
blem of the motion of sound was first assailed (in 1741) by
Cramer of Geneva, who succeeded in showing that his reasoning
applied equally to other modes of oscillation than that which was
assumed.       It is true this contradicted the enunciation of the
47th proposition of the second book of the Principia; “but it
 confirmed and extended             the general resultsall    the demonstra                  of

                        it        velocity     sound unaltered, and thus   of
 showed that the velocity did not depend mechanically                      the                                        on

4    Prof.     J.    Le Conte       on the Discrepancy between                          the Computed
cesses which have been employed, others have assailed the phy
sical aspects of his explanation, and attempted to show that it is
entirely inadequate to account for the discordance between theory
and observation.
    Itappears to me that the obscurity which marks many of the
discussions relating to this problem arises from two distinct causes:
namely, first, from a misconception of the physical theory of
Laplace and that of Poisson, which is substantially the same;
and secondly, from the difficulties and obscurities which invest the
mathematical theory of partial differential equations in their appli
cations to physical questions.                         I
                                    shall consider each of these
causes separately.
   1. Under the first head may be included the speculations of
Winter, of Tredgold, of Farey, of Galbraith, and, more recently, of
Blake, on the supposed correction for the modulus of elasticity of
air, and on the presumed influence of barometricpressure and lati
tude on the velocity of sound+. It is certainly a curious illustration
of physical misconception, that it was not clearly perceived, as a
simple corollary from the investigations of Newton, as well as
those of Lagrange, Euler, Laplace, and Poisson, that, cateris
paribus, neither the density of the air nor the intensity of gravity
have any influence on the theoretic velocity of sound.           For,
according to the Newtonian formula, the velocity of sound in air
 =vgh,_g being the velocity generated by terrestrial gravity in
a mean solar second, and h the height of a homogeneous atmo
sphere.   Now, as the value of h depends on the ratio of the den
sity of mercury to the density of air, and as the latter varies,
according to Mariotte's law, as the height of the barometric
column, it is obvious that h remains constant, or is independent
of barometric fluctuations. Again, as the value of g increases,
the magnitude of h diminishes, and vice versd; so that the value
of gh remains constant in    latitudes,      all
                                               altitudes    the atmo

sphere, and consequently under      barometric     all
                                                 pressures,  provided

Now (D being constant),             by   Mariotte's law,             d   varies directly             as   b;   hence

that,     by

      do not   presume   to offer an    opinion    in relation to the legiti
macy of the mathematical processes by which these extraordinary
results have been reached; but the physical aspects of the sub
ject seem to warrant two queries.               First, is it admissible to
assume the law of force, according to which the molecules of the
atmosphere act on each other, to be that of the 4th power of the
inverse distance 2 The only reason given for this assumption                                                   is,
that      it “the lowest power

                                          the inverse distance which the
mathematical      eagressions   themselves would permit                     try.”              us    to

         and the Observed Velocity                           of Sound in Air and Gases.                      11
some experiments on sound, it was observed by persons stationed
at a distance, that the report of the cannon reached them before
they heard the command to fire; thus showing, as he thinks,
that the sound of the gun's report outstripped the sound of the
officer’s voice.    Subsequently, from the observations of Professor
C. Montigny of Antwerp, in a memoir printed in the Bulletins
de l'Académie Royale de Belgique, Mr. Earnshaw has been satis
fied that the thunder-clap comes fairly under his exponential type
of sound-waves, and that in such cases sound is transmitted
with a velocity far greater than he had imagined.           In one of
the instances recorded by M. Montigny, “the report of a thun
der-clap reached him after an interval of two seconds, which
according to theory should have occupied more than fifteen
seconds;” that                is,    its
                           velocity was about seven times     great                               as          as

                            the cannon used       experimentalists for       by

 12 Prof.     J. Le Conte   on the Discrepancy     between      the Computed
 ments of Dr. Olinthus Gregory prove that sounds produced by
 bells, muskets, and cannon are propagated with the same speed.
 Indeed, a candid and impartial examination of the evidence which
 has been adduced in relation to this point will, I think, warrant
 the assertion that Mr. Earnshaw has failed to produce a single
 unexceptionable fact, or a single satisfactory observation, in verifica
 tion of his theoretical deductions.
     Resuming the more immediate consideration of Iaplace's ex
 planation of the excess of the observed velocity of sound over
 that calculated by Newton, it should be borne in mind that the
 development of heat and cold by sudden condensation and rare
 faction, is not a mere hypothetical cause evoked to account for
 the phenomena, but is a well-known physical fact, proved by
 direct eaperiment.     Moreover, inasmuch as Laplace's formula is
 a  rigorous  deduction from this physical fact, “the only way,”
 to use the  language   of Professor Stokes, “ of escaping from the
 conclusion that the velocity of sound is really increased by the
 cause assigned, is to suppose that the heat produced by con
 densation passes away so rapidly by radiation, that the result is
the same as though condensation and rarefaction were incapable
 of changing the temperature of air.” Indeed, Professor Challisº
 has been driven to the adoption of such an assumption : he asks,
 “May it not be that the developed heat (whether positive or
 negative) is carried off too quickly by radiation to affect the tem
perature of the fluid?” Again, the same mathematician con
 tends that experiment only proves that heat is developed by
condensation “when the fluid is confined within narrow limits,”
and that it is an unsupported hypothesis to assume “that there
is increase of temperature in fluid of unlimited eatent.”        Let us
scrutinize this view more narrowly.
    In the first place, it will not escape attention that, inasmuch
as during the propagation of elastic pulses the condensations
and rarefactions are necessarily momentary, it is primá facie
physically improbable that the heat developed should escape by
radiation. The loss of heat by radiation requires time; so that
the condensation of the aërial molecules in the transmission of
 sound-waves is performed precisely under the circumstances most
favourable to the free and full production of the whole effect in
 question. It is obvious, that the condensations being so mo
mentary as to afford no time for the escape of heat by radiation,
an unlimited mass of air is really better adapted to give this cause
itsfull influence, than any experiments                on
                                               the compression                  of

       and the Observed Velocity                      of Sound in Air           and Gases.               13
investigation, and has succeeded in proving that, during the
propagation of sound-waves in the atmosphere, the compressions
and expansions of the particles of the elastic fluid take place so
rapidly, that there is not time for any appreciable transmission
of heat between different particles; and that consequently the
variations of the pressure and density are related to each other
as they would be in a non-conducting vessel.   In other words, he
has shown that Professor Challis's   supposition,  that the deve
loped heat is lost by radiation, is untenable, and that Laplace's
view has a real physical foundation.
    Hence it follows that the momentary disengagement of heat
during the transmission of aerial sound-waves must be regarded
as a really existing cause, a vera causa, which must act to increase
the velocity above what it would be were there no such thermal
change produced by the changes of density.                 Under this point
of view, it is clear that     any mathematical      theory   of sound which
fails to take cognizance of the development of heat in the propa
gation of pulses in the atmosphere                           is,
                                               primá facie, defective and
imperfect. On this score, the formulae expressing the theoretical
velocity    of  sound       air, given
                                 in           Challis,  by   Potter, and       by                        by
Earnshaw, are fatally assailable.          Perhaps the formula          Hera                   of

While Mr. Earnshaw denies the      sufficiency of Laplace's sugges
tion, he admits that it is a vera causa, and yet he obtains a
formula which professes to give accurately the velocity of sound,
without taking cognizance of this vera causa, this development of
heat during the transmission of acrial pulses!        Assuredly, if
this disengagement of heat is a real cause tending to augment
the velocity of sound-waves (however inadequate to account for
the whole discrepancy between theory and fact), it should cer
tainly have constituted an essential element in his mathematical
investigation.    As far as                     I
                               am able to understand, the whole
excess of  velocity given by his formula above that of Newton is
eaclusively ascribed to the circumstance that he has discarded
the assumption of continuity in the medium, and substituted in
its place the hypothesis of “particles separated by finite inter
vals.”    The thermic changes taking place during the propagation
 of acrial pulses are entirely eacluded from the investigation.
 Hence he concludes, “Thus we see that the error committed in
 calculating the velocity of sound was not the leaving out the
 consideration.of the development of heat, but the supposing the
 medium of air to be continuous.”
     Inow proceed to the consideration of the adequacy of the
various formulae which have been devised for computing the
velocity of sound, by a comparison of their results with those of
the best experimental determinations. The Newtonian formula
forms the basis of every expression for the theoretic velocity of
sound which the ingenuity of mathematicians               has elicited.
Without exception, they                    all
                                concur that Newton's velocity must
 be  multiplied            by

one litre of pure dry air, at the same place and temperature, and
under a pressure of 0-760 metre of mercury at 0° Centigrade,
weighs 1-2932227 gramme.         Hence it follows that at Paris,
60 metres above the sea, and under the physical conditions
above indicated, mercury is 10513.2163 times as heavy as
air.  Consequently the height of a homogeneous atmosphere
= h = 0-760 metre x 10513.2163 = 7990-044388 metres, or
26214:52864 British standard feet.
   Secondly, in relation to the value of g (the velocity generated
by terrestrial gravity in a mean solar second of time), it is well
known that it depends on the accuracy of the determination of
the length of the seconds' pendulum.    The suspicion of Newton,

a vacuum is very defective, and by no means expresses the whole
correction which ought to be applied—in short, that the coeffi

too small, in that it took no account of the influence of the mass

vibrations in a mean solar day above the old reduction numbers,
in each case the pendulum being assumed to make 86400 vibra
tions in a mean solar day#.      Hence it follows that by Bessel's
factor M. Biot's seconds'   pendulum    was 0.0596 millimetre too
short; by Baily’s factor it was 0.0551 millimetre too short.
Consequently the deduced value of g was 0.5881, or 0.5438
millimetre too small, according as the former or the latter cor
rection is employed.

22   Prof.    J. Le Conte        on the Discrepancy between the Computed
   The results obtained from Dr. Gregory’s experiments cannot
be regarded as comparable in accuracy with some of the others ;
for the distances were too small, and he was not provided with
adequate means of measuring with precision intervals of time to
a minute fraction of a second. Nevertheless they are interesting
as demonstrating that the violence of sounds does not exercise
any appreciable influence on the velocity.   The experiments of
Drs. Moll and Van     Beek, from the fact that the distance was
large, that they employed an instrument capable of measuring
intervals of one hundredth of a second, and that the signals were
strictly simultaneous, unquestionably furnish the most trust
worthy results.    Assuming, therefore, the mean result of these
experiments as the standard, the following Table will illustrate
the accordance of the several theoretical formulae with fact.  In
applying Laplace's formula,                     I
                                have taken the value of k to be
equal to l'41, in accordance with the recent experiments of

     With    these revised data,          it thus appears that Laplace's formula
gives a velocity which eaceeds that furnished by the most reliable
experiments, by about 0.074 of an English foot.     It is obvious,
therefore, that what Mr. Earnshaw characterizes as the great
defect of Laplace’s explanation, viz. “ that the result it gives
does not come up to experiment,” fails to be sustained by facts,
and fully warrants an emphatic endorsement of Sir John Her
schel’s judgment, that “in inquiries of such delicacy, and where
the effects of minute errors of experiment become so much
magnified, it seems hardly candid to desire a more perfect coin
cidence”*.
   It will be observed that Mr. Earnshaw's formula (for ordinary
sounds) gives a result which surpasses the experimental velocity
by 41.75 English feet; and yet the chief merit claimed for his
theory       is,
            that     gives  itvelocity for sound “which agrees
                                        a
accurately with the experimental value”!     With the results                                  of
         *     “Treatise         on   Sound”    in       Encyc, Metrop. Article 78.

            and the Observed Velocity                         of Sound in Air and Gases.                               23
modern and more accurate experiments before him, it is difficult
to imagine why he should adopt Dr. Young's estimate, “that
the true velocity of sound is about 1130 feet (344'42 metres) per
second.”   Assuredly it will scarcely be maintained that this is
the best-determined value for the velocity of sound at the standard
temperature of melting ice      And yet, after the warning he has
given experimentalists, it might be hazardous to suppose that
the mathematician has suffered himself “to be biased by a
desire to make experiment and theory agree.”
     Inow proceed to the consideration of evidence bearing on
this question derived from quite a different quarter. The deve
lopment and experimental verification of the “Dynamical Theory
of Heat” has furnished an unexpected and independent confirma
tion of the truth as well as the adequacy of Laplace's explanation
to account for the whole earcess of the observed above the New
tonian velocity of sound.    A few words will,     hope, place this                    I
in a clear light.

26        Prof.    J.    Le Conte on the Discrepancy between the Computed
is a vera causa tending to augment the velocity of sound above
what it would be by the Newtonian formula.
   2. That the accuracy of the physical reasoning upon which
Laplace's formula is based has not been invalidated by the recent
discussions on the mathematical theory of sound.
   3. That, using the most recent and trustworthy experimental
data, Laplace's formula is fully adequate to bring up Newton's
velocity to the observed or measured velocity of sound.
   4. That, making use of the data furnished by the most accu
rate thermo-dynamical experiments,            the entire adequacy of
Laplace's explanation to account for the whole earcess of the
observed velocity above that given by the formula of Newton
and Lagrange is confirmed in the most complete and satisfactory
Iºanner.
   Before bringing this paper to a close, it may be proper to add
a few remarks in relation to the propagation of elastic pulses in
mixed gaseous media, such as the atmosphere.             Three possible
cases present themselves: viz.                    (a)

      Some philosophers have thought that the aqueous vapour
     b.
of the atmosphere propagates sound quite independently                                    of    its
other gaseous constituents. The duplication            sound sometimes   of

formula for correcting the influence of aqueous vapour (which
assumes the mutual action of the gases) gives results so accordant
with those deduced from experiments in the Arctic regions (where
the tension of vapour is almost nothing), as to afford a strong
confirmation of the view that the aqueous vapour of the atmo
sphere does not transmit pulses independently of        other gaseous                            its

that consequently sounds are propagated in it in the same man
ner and with the same velocity as if it were a homogeneous gaseous
medium having the known physical properties of the mixture. In
fact, so far as the propagation of sound is concerned, some such
view is necessary in order to account for the fact that sounds are
not duplicated when heard at great distances.     The difficulty of
conceiving of such a mutual action between the nitrogen and
oxygen of the atmosphere, under the assumption that it is a
mechanical mixture, has led Mr. Herapath”, and perhaps others,
to conclude that the air must be a chemical compound.      And it
must be confessed that the physical evidence pointing in this
direction is much stronger than                        I
                                   had imagined previous to the
present investigation.   Let us look at this point more closely.
   It is proper to premise that the proofs which chemists have
adduced to show that the air is a mechanical mixture are mainly
negative.   They show that there are no evidences of chemical
action between the constituents of the atmosphere; that there
are no indications of chemical forces resisting the separation of
the nitrogen and oxygen; that Graham’s law of diffusion, which
secures uniformity of constitution, is a physical law depending
on the relative density of the gases, and having no relation to
their chemical properties, &c. At first sight this seems to con
stitute a strong body of evidence in favour of the Daltonian
view.    But it must be recollected that in liquid mixtures we have
every  gradation of manifestation of chemical phenomena, from
 extreme chemical activity to cases in which it is difficult, if not
 impossible, to detect any evidence of such action. Moreover it
 is well known that the more recent investigations of Prof. Graham
have demonstrated the existence of analogous physical laws
 governing the diffusion of saline solutions, in which Dalton's
idea, that the diffusibility is referable exclusively to the elasticity
or self-repulsion of the particles, is totally inadmissible.     Indeed
philosophers have for some time past recognized the necessity of
modifying Dalton’s views, in so far as to admit the existence of
a mutual molecular attraction among the particles of the diffusing
gasest.     In fact the late Mr. Ivory, in speaking of Dalton’s
hypothesis “that one gas is inelastic to           other gases,” says, all
“although          it intelligible
                        it    be       words,    incomprehensible
                                                   in                  is                        by
the understanding.”       Nevertheless, while physicists have thus
been compelled      acknowledge the mutual action
                             to                             the elastici             of

chemical action, but few have ventured to regard the atmosphere
in any other light than a mechanical mixture. But if such an
action exists among the particles of dissimilar gases during
intermixture, it is a legitimate question whether there are any
indications of the manifestation of feeble chemical forces not
hitherto recognized by chemists.       Let us see what bearing the
physical properties of the atmosphere have on this question.
   It is obvious that, the densities of the nitrogen and oxygen in
relation to air being known, the percentage of these gases can be
computed, provided the volume of the mixture is equal to the sum
of the volumes of the two constituents, which is the assumption
made by the theory of mechanical mixture.        The validity of this
assumption can be tested by comparing the results of calcula
tion with those of the best analyses.     The experiments of Reg
nault furnish the numbers in relation to density*.
          Let W = volume of oxygen,

best test of this question, not only because they are probably

numbers expressing the densities of oxygen and nitrogen are slightly dif
ferent from those given by Regnault in his memoir.   This arises principally
from an error which is made in the reduction of his first experiment

in both cases the assumption being that no alteration of volume

        Taking the results obtained by the volumetric method as the
    test, it seems, by a comparison of the numbers in the foregoing
     Table, that the densities given by the experiments of Dumas and
     Boussingault furnish results more nearly accordant with experi
    ment than those calculated from the densities afforded by the
     more recent experiments of Regnault.                       The methods of the latter
     experimentalist are so far superior to those of his predecessors,
     as to preclude the assumption that the densities given by the

earlier experiments are to be preferred. Hence we are led to
look for an explanation of the discrepancy between experiment
and calculation in the direction of a possible change of volume
taking place during the mixture of the two gases. Assuming
the values of the mean densities given by Regnault's experi
ments, a change of volume to the amount of only 0.0512 per

as that    of a man sitting upon a stool with a pair of compasses in
one hand and a string in the other. He will ask what led him
to make a copy of it of the very same size, and without any
change or improvement whatever.           He will ask what led him to
preserve such uninteresting sketches; but, above all, he will ask,
with a peculiar interest, what led him to place these two figures
side by side, and in such a manner that the instant they were
seen by an intelligent traveller, Dr. Crum Brown, he conceived
that they were intended to be brought into relief by binocular
vision, and actually brought them into stereoscopic relief by
retiring and combining the two separate pictures. The histo
rian of science will mot be satisfied even with the obvious answer
to these questions. He will inquire into the date of these draw
ings, and he will be struck with the fact that they were executed
at the time when Baptista Porta had called the attention of
philosophers to the subject of binocular vision, and had shown
in a diagram so far resembling a stereoscope slide, that external
objects, that is objects in relief, were seen binocularly by the com
bination of a right- and left-eye picture of them. He will also con
nect with these facts, though he may not yet give it much weight,
the statement of Professor Archer, the distinguished Director of
the Industrial Museum of Scotland, “that just before he left Liver
pool, in a turn-out of the Museum there, what appeared to be
a stereoscope was found, bearing the date of 1670. Being out of
                                                             .
order,” he adds, “it was laid aside at the time, and probably had
not been touched since.        It appeared, he said, to        of Roman
manufacture; and he suggested that an attempt should be made
to get it for examination, as having an important bearing on the
subject before the Society” +, namely the subject of Chimenti's
stereoscopic figures.                        -
    In  forming   his opinion from these various considerations, the
historian of science will not fail to notice that the binocular
theory of Baptista Porta was published in Italy in 1593; that
the stereoscopic drawings which so wonderfully illustrate it were
also made in Italy some time after this, between 1620 and 1640,
and that the probable stereoscope in Liverpool, with the date of
1670, is considered to be of Italian origin.

       the Philosophical Magazine for January 1851, Professor
 IN   Magnus has given an account of the “Trompe,” or Water
 bellows, in which a continuous blast of air is produced by a
 stream of water, passing down the axis of a vertical tube, of
 greater diameter than the stream, and in free communication
 with the atmosphere, by orifices placed just below, or on a level
with, the orifice from which the stream issues.
   According to Magnus, air is carried down by the stream owing
to the formation of concavities, which close and entrap air within
them, and which are produced at the point where collision be
tween the stream and a surface of water takes place
   The following experiments were made to determine the quan
tity of         air

   From the above experiments it is evident that the quantity of
air carried down by a stream of water is greatest when the colli
sion of the stream with water takes place at the point where
 the stream breaks up, and gradually diminishes as the distance
 between the orifice from which the stream issues and the point
 of collision decreases.

ished; the discs were of nearly equal size (C, fig.3); and when
the flow was very much diminished (that is to say during the
production of the most base notes), cylinders of air alternated
with discs of water (D, fig. 3).
     The air was collected in a half-litre flask, inverted over the
lower orifice of A, fig. 2, the exact time necessary to fill it being
noted, and the amount of air passing through the tube in a
 second calculated therefrom.
     When the flow of water was so small that impulses not                     fol
 lowing each other with sufficient rapidity to produce a musical
 note were heard, the eye could follow the air-cylinders in their
 passage down the tube, and by attaching a small divided scale to
 the side of the tube A, fig. 2, and simultaneously checking the
 flow and closing the orifices, the number of air-discs in an inch
 could be counted; and thus, the amount of air and of water
 passing through the tube per second, the capacity of the tube,
 and the number of air-discs in it at one time being known, the
 number of impulses produced per second could be roughly
calculated.
     When the flow had attained a certain degree of quickness, the
 air-discs coalesced into larger ones so rapidly that the number
in an inch could not be counted.
     All the notes were base; and the only variation capable of being
 produced was from a base note to distinct impulses incompetent
 from their slowness to produce a mote.
     The following Tables may serve as examples of some of the
 results obtained: it is obvious that the number of impulses per
 second could not be determined with any great accuracy:-

    the last November Number of the Philosophical Magazine I
INpublished  a brief “Note on Laplace's Correction for the Theo
retic Welocity of Sound,” the main point of which was to show
that the extraordinary radiant and absorbent power which recent
experiments have proved to be possessed by various gases and
vapours, would. in                          all
                           probability, affect the correction                                            to    be
applied     the velocity
                   to       sound through such gases and vapours.

       VII.       On the Absorption        of Light.      By A. WüLLNER+.
I.    a congratulatory paper, written on the occasion of Professor
     Gerling's fiftieth-year-Doctor Jubilee in Marburg, I communi
cated some experiments on the spectra of the incandescent vapours
of iodine, bromine, and hypomitric acid. I was led to these experi
ments by the notice of Mr. Thomson, in the Annales de Chimie
et de Phys. 3 sér. vol. lxii. p. 191, in which he communicates an
earlier idea of Mr. Stokes, which includes a mechanical explana
tion of the beautiful observations of M. Kirchhoff on the absorp
tion of light in flames, and of the absorption of light in general.
Mr. Stokes's reasoning is as follows:—The emission of light has
 its origin        periodic motion
                  in   a                         of
                                            the molecules        the body,
                                                                   of
which     iscommunicated          the aether surrounding them; the
                                      to
emission       of
                definite
                  a       quality      light proves hence that the mo
                                            of
lecules      of
             the flame are           definite periodic motion.
                                      in   a                        Incan
descent soda vapour, which emits yellow light corresponding                      to
the dark line          D,
                   will hence have such periodic vibratory motion,
                                                      a
 itsparticles will have     duration
                                 a          oscillation corresponding
                                                 of                              to
that    of
         the aether for  yellow   light.

 minate in red, yellow, and green. Blue and violet appear en
 feebled, it is true, especially if the iodine vapours were very
  dense; but bands could not be detected in this part of the
  spectrum. Corresponding to this, only red, yellow, and green
  showed themselves in the spectrum of iodine, and scarcely a trace
  of blue and violet. A similar agreement was observed between
 the spectra of bromine and hyponitric acid vapours, and the
  absorption spectra of these vapours.
     With iodine vapour it was possible to recognize bright and
  dark bands in the spectrum of the flame, but not to furnish the
 proof that the bright bands of the flame corresponded to the dark
 lines of the absorption spectrum and inversely, since in both
 spectra the position of the bands could not be ascertained by my
 apparatus.
     In the other flames no bands could be observed, since their
 light was too feeble to bear the necessary contraction of the slit.
     The observation of the iodine spectrum acquired for me an
 additional interest after having had, in Bonn a few weeks ago,
 the opportunity of witnessing the beautiful observations of M.
 Plücker on the spectra of the gases, which that gentleman had
 the goodness to show me.                    I
                                     When saw the nitrogen spectrum,
 designated “the first" by M. Plücker, I at once recognized that
 the iodine spectrum which          I had seen was not the second iodine
 spectrum previously observed by M. Plücker, but a first one,
 which M. Plücker since his discovery of the double spectra had
 predicted, and in the observation of which he expected the same
 proof for the new theory%.

—“In the well-known historical notice of Dr. Miller in London, “On
             Analysis,” the objection is made to my theory of the absorption
    light that the iodine spectrum, which    I had determined in 1859, stands
in no relation to that obtained if sunlight (or, better, light which for itself
gives a continuous spectrum) is passed through iodine vapour.       The spec
trum of iodine consists of bright lines on a dark background; the absorp
tion spectrum, of about fifty compartments which are peculiarly shaded by
dark lines.     Spectra of the first kind I have subsequently designated as
‘second spectra’; spectra like the one in question, “first spectra,” to which
the nitrogen spectrum, described in 1858, also belongs.
   “From the investigations made in the physical laboratory of this place in
August last year, by Professor Hittorf and myself in common, it was found
that certain bodies, which at present it would be rash to say were not simple
(nitrogen, sulphur, &c.), give, according to the temperature, two absolutely
different spectra—a first one that corresponds to the lower, and a second
one that corresponds to the higher temperature.       The transition from the
one to the other is discontinuous.         In consequence of this novel and
unforeseen fact, Miller's objection appeared to me under a new point of

confirmed in the most beautiful manner by the spectrum of in

the sun’s parallax.
   “Now the counterpart of the above is the simultaneous obser
vation at different parts of the earth’s surface, of the time occu

mode, in passing through a certain interval of space, say about
half a degree (the sun's diameter); but as this happens at night,
comparison stars are to be used, and the assumed interval to be
nearly equivalent to their distance. Thus, ev. gr., if the nearest
planet (Mars) be the object observed, and at Greenwich a mi
nutes are occupied by it in describing an arc which it requires
only y minutes to describe at the Cape of Good Hope, then will
the difference a            -y

 three-fifths of the other.    Secondly, the observations can be made

being part of the chain, suffers decomposition as a consequence of
the discharge above, and, as Davy would allow, the now liberated
gases react directly upon the free gases in the tube; and so a
constant supply of active material is furnished for the production
of fresh electricity, and hence the appearance of a current and of
circulation.   The antecedent chemical action and statical spark
is now no longer necessary, unless contact be broken, when                                             all
reverts     the original state, and the diffused and dissolved gases
             to
are again       requisition.
                  in            Fresh contact,     allowing discharge    by
 ofstatic electricity, will  again renew the voltaic    galvanic phe              or
InOmena.
    Such    I believe        to  true and philosophical account
                                   be  a                                  the                     of

 but not     inthe order           or

got   all  my information about various memoirs published     the                                in

Philosophical Magazine from other journals, and especially from
Poggendorff’s Annalen der Physik und Chemie.              Since, however,
many beautiful investigations constantly appeared in the Philo
sophical Magazine, I was at last induced to become myself a sub
scriber to your celebrated Journal, and a few weeks ago            received   I
the Numbers that have been printed from the beginning of this
year till the first of October.
     On looking over the contents                   I
                                               found several papers and
memoirs of great interest to         me;   but those of course are most
particularly interesting which treat of the new principle in rela
tion to the forces of nature, which in Danish is called “The prin
 ciple of the imperishableness or perpetuity of Energy (Principet
for Krafternes Uforgangelighed), the most important part of
 which is the Mechanical Theory of Heat; and the questions con
 nected therewith that have lately been taken into consideration
 in your Journal, and especially the historic notice of the mecha
 nical theory of heat by M. Verdet, in No. 170 of the Philoso
 phical Magazine (S. 4. vol. xxv. p. 467), induce me to send you
 the following remarks, and to ask you to decide upon a question I
 shall afterwards have the honour of laying before you, the favour
 able decision of which will give me very great pleasure.
     From the contents of the Numbers of the Philosophical Ma
 gazine which            I
                    have received (4th series, Nos. 165 to 175), may                 I
 suppose that you are aware, that M. Werdet and M. Helmholtz
 think it right, according to what is known to them of my inves
 tigations, to place me next to M. Mayer in relation to the dis
 covery of the new principle touching the forces of nature; but
 at the same time              I
                         learn that many of the readers of your cele
 brated Journal have only a slight notion of my investigations and
 memoirs on this subject, and that it may be presumed that most
 of them have scarcely any idea at                 all
                                              about them.
 I     regret very much that the Danish language                 little un
                                                                    is    so

entities whereof we are cognizant only by their mastery over
nature, these entities must of course be very superior to every
thing material in the world; and as it is obvious that it is
through them only that the wisdom we perceive and admire in
nature expresses itself, these powers must evidently be in rela
tionship to the spiritual, immaterial, and intellectual power itself
that guides nature in          progress; but    itssuch     the case,           if          is                              it   is

   the question was                        to

long's celebrated discovery respecting the heat disengaged                                                                       or

                     Principle of the Conservation of Energy.                                                  59
of different airs and          gases, and         I then showed
                                                     how perfectly these
experiments proved the truth of the said principle for bodies
of that kind. After having obtained this general confirmation
                                                       I
of the principle by elastic fluids, tried to show that the experi
ments of M. GErsted on the compressibility of (non-elastic) fluids
and the heat disengaged thereby were in perfect accordance with
my new principle; and after having shown this, the next step
for me was to show that the heat disengaged on the compression
of solid bodies also was proportionate to the quantity of mecha
nical energy expended; and from the experiments of Berthollet,
                                                   I
Lagerhjelm, &c. on this subject, found that here also everything
spoke in favour of this principle.
   After stating these facts,                 I
                                      proceeded to examine what had
been done and discovered       previously   to that time with regard to
the heat disengaged by friction, and I found here experiments
on a large scale carried out by Rumford, Haldat, Morosi, &c.,
and   I observed with great pleasure that           the results     which all                        at
these experimenters arrived throughout satisfied the new principle.
As these experiments were not made with               view      the deter    a             to
mination       the relation between the quantity

that  they  were not sufficient               to
                                      decide the  question        whether                      as   to

                                is                        the mechanical         to

                   friction, and therefore      thought      quite neces

   An apparatus was then constructed               which      was able  by            I                        to

action of the forces of nature is to liberate themselves from inti
mate connexion with matter; and whenever we make them act
in opposition to this law, we see that we only prepare for a state
that will afterwards be destroyed: we can hinder the straight and
direct action of the forces to some extent, but we cannot stop                                                     it.

                 beg leave           to

 enable them to compare it with the position of M. J. R. Mayer of
 Heilbronn, in the year before (1842), when he wrote his “Remarks
 on the Forces of Inanimate Nature.”          need scarcely say that            I
 such a   comparison  would be of great interest to me, as think it                                           I
 would convince your readers of the fact that M. Mayer wrote his
 “Remarks” in 1842 before he was able to support them by a
 single experiment, or by anything like a proof of their exactness;

   There can be little doubt that the chief value of the study of
Physical Science, considered as an agent of general mental cul
ture, is that it affords in a special degree the means of educating
the judgment, or the faculty of drawing correct general conclusions
from the particular facts of experience.      It possesses this value,
however, only in so far as it is caused to be an exercise in the expe
rimental method of inquiry, by which alone physical truths can be
discovered.    In order that physical science may produce     full edu                                 its

marine equivalent of the Middle Headon strata.
   The author gave an exposition of the current opinions upon the
correlation  of those English and Foreign “Upper Eocene” or
“Lower Miocene” strata, to which Professor Beyrich has given the
name “Oligocene,” and briefly sketched their distribution and limits
upon the continent.    He then gave a list of fifty-nine New-Forest
(Middle Headon) fossils, which he had determined, and stated that,
of this number, forty-six occur in the Lower Oligocene of Ger
many, and twenty-three are characteristic of that formation; twenty
one of these species occur in the Barton Clay, four in the Middle
Oligocene, and eight are peculiar to the Brockenhurst beds. He
therefore concluded that the Headon and Brockenhurst strata are on
the same horizon as the Lower Oligocene; and he confirmed the
opinion of previous observers—that the Hempstead beds are the
equivalent of the “Grès de Fontainebleau” and of the Middle Oli
gocene of Germany.

    In the neighbourhood of Belfast the following members of the
Lias formation were stated to occur, namely:-The Zone of Ammo
nites Bucklandi, the White Lias, and the Zone of Avicula contorta.
    The characters of these subdivisions in the district under con
sideration were described in detail by Mr. Tate, who gave sections
of the beds exposed in Colin Glen and at Cave Hill, at which loca
lities the three zones are seen; he also gave sections of the Avicula
contorta beds as exposed at Woodbarn and at Whitehead, and lists
of the fossils found in the strata of each subdivision at the localities
mentioned, noticing that, in the zone of Ammonites Bucklandi, that
Ammonite is replaced by A. intermedius, the other fossils being of
the same species as occur in that zone in England; and he con
cluded with some general remarks on the distribution of the members
of the Lias in the North of Ireland.

         REMARKS              ON    THE THEORY                 OF GASEs.                BY    J.     STEFAN.
Açºingture in a gas
                    to the new theory of gases a local excess of tempera
                    ought to disappear from its place almost instantane
ously; and on many sides this has been urged as an objection to the
theory. The objection was based on the consideration of the simple
case of the propagation of vis viva in a series of equally large elastic
spheres. Each sphere on a central impact with the next one inter
changes velocity with                    it,
                            and their excess    vis viva propagates itself   of
through the entire series    spheres with their velocity. The new theory
                                            of
gives very large values for the velocities with which the gas molecules
progressively move, by which the above objection seemed justified.
.  Clausius has answered this       his theory       in
                                                    conduction      gases.        of                         in

conclusion      the point
                      on     question.    On the contrary, Clausius lays
                                            in
considerable weight, and justly,            the consideration on    the irregular                  of
motions        of
               the molecules.      His calculation based upon this gives
very small value for the conducting power              gases. This result     of                                             he a
adduces        in
               refutation     the aboveof objection.     According        his view                          to

 76                         Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
the smallness of the conducting-power of gases, the above objection
 is not refuted.    For the case in which the consideration of the regular
 arrangementof the molecules is taken as basis, it is plain that the excess
 of temperature must travel from one layer to another with a velocity
which cannot be different from that of sound. And the same follows
 also from the investigation of the irregular motions.
    But even if heat is propagated in gases with the same velocity as
 sound, the above objection is still not justified.       It will only be so
when it necessarily follows from the new theory of gases, that an
excess of temperature in a given place of the gas is not only very
rapidly, but also completely and without loss imparted to the neigh
bourhood.      On the other hand, the objection is refuted if it can be
shown that the influence of an increase of temperature extends indeed
in a short time to great distances, but that the force of this in
fluence is continually weaker with an increase of distance, and for a
short time can be infinitely small, even for small distances.
    Theory leads to this result when it is remembered that the mo
tions of gas molecules take place in all possible directions, and, what
is essential, that this irregularity has      reason                 on its
                                                        the oblique impacts             in
 on each other                  of
                   the molecules.    For     oblique impact one molecule
does not interchange         velocity with another; the entire excess

 One end of a bar, the entire length of which is originally at 0°, is
 suddenly heated to 100° and kept at this temperature.            If a place
 is observed which is 1 metre distant from the         end, it will after an
 hour assume a temperature of 50°. But the same place had previ
 ously the temperature of 40°, before that the temperature 30°, still
 earlier the temperature 20°, and so on. Reasoning further from these
 data, we get the result, that an infinitely small increase of temperature
 at this place must have occurred after an infinitely short time—that
 thus the velocity of the propagation of heat is very large: it is even
 found to be infinitely large if the formula given for this case in Fou
 rier's theory of conduction is used. Hitherto neither experiment nor
 theory have given a useful datum to the question of the velocity of
 the propagation of heat.
    The difference between the propagation of sound and of heat is
 readily understood from the new theory of gases. A condensation
 is suddenly produced in a gas layer.        To exclude a simultaneous
 increase of the velocity of the molecules, we must suppose it to be
 produced by the fact that in this layer several molecules are placed
 which possess velocities equal to those present. Obviously more
 molecules emerge from this layer into the adjacent ones than the
 reverse; the condensation passes into these, from these to the next,
 and so on, without being enfeebled during the propagation, while
 from the equal velocities of the molecules, the oblique impacts are

 MR.  w. Thomson’s METHOD For MEASURING ELECTRICAL CONDUC
    TIVITY-APPLICATION TO FUSED METALS. BY M. DE LA RIVE,
    To Mr. W. Thomson is due a new method of measuring electrical
conductivity. By using an arrangement of conductors only one of
which is the seat of an electromotive force, the intensity of the cur
rent in a galvanometer wire may be made to depend on the ratio of
two electrical resistances which are compared. In this arrangement,
the two ends of the galvanometer wire terminate in two points taken
on two conductors of the system, and these points are determined so as
to divide in the same ratiothetotal resistances of these two conductors.
    Now it is seen that if this same ratio exists between two other
resistances, which are, on the one hand, the unknown resistance, and
on the other that which is taken as unity, the intensity of the cur
rent in the galvanometer is zero.      The method consists then in vary
ing the known resistance until the current is annulled.
    The principle is the same as in Wheatstone's method, which may
in fact be considered as resulting from a particular case of the more
general method devised by Mr. Thomson.            From the complication
of this   method,   that of Wheatstone will    usually  be preferred ; but
the latter becomes   inadequate  when the resistances to be measured are
small as compared with the accessory resistances, while in Thom

son's method the absolute value of the unknown does not affect the
exactitude of the determination.  This difference is explained by the
following remark. In Mr. Wheatstone's method, the equation by which
the unknown is determined is w-i-b =k; where a is                                                                    the   unknown

and what may        called    be
                              compensator.     These two apparatus are:
                                                 a
from the workshop        M. Fromart. The rheostat consists essen

resistance a, and by means of the divided rule it may be measured
almost to the tenth of a millimetre. The compensator serves to
 determine the value of the ratio k. This apparatus consists of two
identical series of bobbins formed of german silver wire of 0.17 millim.
in diameter, and offering great resistance. Each series consists of
nine bobbins; the first constitutes the resistance R.; and by the rest,
to a greater or less extent, kB may be constituted, and any values
given to k from 1 to 50.       A Ruhmkorff's galvanometer with a long
wire was placed at about 2 metres distance from the rheostat, and
was observed by means of a horizontal telescope and a reflecting
prism. By means of a key the current could be instantaneously closed.
By means of insulated wire, the rheostat, the compensator, and the
galvanometer could be connected either with each other, or with a
battery consisting of 2 or 3 Bunsen's cells (which was placed under a
shed), or, finally, with the resistance to be measured, which was placed
in a furnace-room.      To hold the melted metals, I used Bayeux por
celain U-tubes from Mr. Gosse's manufactory.         These tubes are 25
centimetres in    length by  5 millimetres internal diameter;   their two
parallel legs terminate in cylindrical cups 2 centimetres in diameter
and 4 in height. To effect the fusion of the metals and retain them
at a constant known temperature, I used vapour baths such as were
employed by MM. Ste.-Claire Deville and Troost in their researches on
the density of vapours; the tube was suspended in the interior of
the vessel in which the distillation took place.        Boiling mercury,
sulphur, and cadmium were used—that is to say, temperatures of 358,
440 and 860 degrees.
   Conductibility of a melted metal.—At first the resistance of a tube
full of mercury was measured; then, this tube being arranged in the
retort and filled with metal, the resistance was measured during the
distillation of the substance employed. This resistance remained con
stant in the vapour of mercury, and also, though to a less extent, in
that of cadmium; but the density of sulphur is too small to maintain a
constant temperature in a metallic mass, and the results thus ob
tained leave much uncertainty as far as temperature is concerned.
A determination is obtained from the mean of two observations,
differing from one another by the relative positions of the two -series
                                                                      - -

of bobbins of the compensator.
   Change of resistance in the passage from the solid to the liquid state.
—The metallic column was allowed to cool and a series of observa
tions made noting the corresponding times.        Curves were thus ob
tained whose ordinates were the resistance and whose abscissae the
time, and on which the passage from one state to the other is an
almost vertical branch.       The results deduced from these curves,
taking the two points where the curvature changes to determine the
resistances at the point of fusion, may be considered, in consequence
of the magnitude of the variation, as being the approximate measure.
   The metals are—tin (stannic acid reduced by charcoal), lead (ace
tate of lead calcined), bismuth (submitrate of bismuth reduced by
charcoal), cadmium (distilled cadmium), zinc (distilled zinc), and anti
mony (tartarized antimony calcined with nitre).       The mercury used
had stood for some time under sulphuric acid. - The conductivities
refer to pure mercury at 21 degrees.

   T  is conceivable that the various kinds of matter, now recog
      nized as different elementary substances, may possess one
and the same ultimate or atomic molecule existing in different
conditions of movement. The essential unity of matter is an
hypothesis in harmony with the equal action of gravity upon                                     all
bodies.   We know the anxiety with which this point was inves
tigated        by
            Newton, and the care      took             he
                                              ascertain that every

kind     substance, “metals, stones, woods, grain, salts, animal
          of
substances,             &c.,” are similarly accelerated                in   falling, and are
therefore equally heavy.

82               Mr. T. Graham’s                   Speculative            Ideas respecting
 motion of an atom being inalienable, light matter is no longer
 convertible into heavy matter. In short, matter of different
 density forms different substances—different inconvertible ele
 ments as they have been considered.
    What has already been said is not meant to apply to the
 gaseous volumes which we have occasion to measure and practi
cally deal with, but to a lower order of molecules or atoms.                  The
combining atoms hitherto spoken of are not therefore the mole
cules the movement of which is sensibly affected by heat with
gaseous expansion as the result.              The gaseous molecule must
itself be viewed as composed of a group or system of the pre
 ceding inferior atoms, following as a unit laws similar to those
 which regulate           its
                          constituent atoms. We have indeed carried
 one step backward, and applied                         to
                                            the lower order         atoms, ideas        of
 suggested       by the  gaseous   molecule,                         as

parted to a portion of the fluid medium enlivens that portion of
matter with an individual existence, and constitutes it a distinct
substance or element.
   With respect to the different states of gas, liquid, and solid, it
may be observed that there is no real incompatibility with each
other in these physical conditions. They are often found together

a hot object placed in hydrogen is really touched 3-8 times as
frequently as it would be if placed in air, and 4 times as
frequently as it would be if placed in an atmosphere of oxygen
gas. Dalton had already ascribed this peculiarity of hydrogen
to the high “mobility” of that gas.         The same molecular pro
perty of hydrogen recommends the application of that gas in
the air-engine, where the object is to alternately heat and cool a
confined volume of gas with rapidity.

        SIR,
                  courtesy with which you received my letter “On
THEthekind    Dynamical    Theory of Heat,” inserted in the Philoso
phical Magazine for August last, encourages me to hope that
 you will be so good as to give to the following remarks, in con
tinuation of the subject, an opportunity of meeting the notice of
 scientific men through the same channel. My only object is to
 elicit truth.   I  have neither time nor inclination nor ability for
 scientific  controversy,   and  I long shrunk back from the idea of
 making public the results of my researches on a subject to which
 I  have given much attention during a large portion of the term
 of a medium lifetime; but at length my conviction of the truth
 of some of the glimpses of light which have been afforded me in
 these intricate researches forced itself into utterance; and my
 anxiety to see the difficulties which have baffled me removed by
 abler hands has caused me to persevere in the effort to induce
 some one of the eminent men who have distinguished themselves
 in the development of the new science of thermo-dynamics to
 reconsider these knotty points, and clear away if possible, once
 for all, the doubts and obscurity which still cloud some parts of
the subject.
     Since the date of my last letter     I have read your excellent
 “Lectures on Heat as a mode of Motion,” and            I feel that the
 highest praise is due to the ability with which the subject has
 been divested of technical and mathematical intricacies, and
 brought within the grasp of mind of every earnest reader of
 average intellect.     By thus exhibiting the results of deep and
 involved researches in “that simple form in which great truths
 present themselves to those who thoroughly understand them,”
 an inestimable boon is conferred on numerous readers possessing
 a knowledge of physics quite sufficient to handle subjects fairly
 within the range of physical reasoning, though wanting the ma

 densities contains a variable quantity of heat in proportion to
 the work it can perform; and this inference obtains some slight
 support from the results of experiment, showing that the total
 heat of steam increases with increase of density, but by no means
 enough to account for the greater amount of work it can perform
 by expansion.

94                                Prof. Challis on the Theory of
tion appears to me to depend on a property of elastic fluids rela
 tive to heat which has been experimentally ascertained by Prof.
 Tyndall. The experiments show that certain fluids, as atmo
 spheric air and simple gases, are, like rock-salt, permeable to
heat-undulations, just as transparent substances are permeable
to light-undulations.       Consequently in these fluids the addition
or abstraction of heat-undulations is not accompanied by such
 disturbance, or breaking up, of the undulations as would pro
 duce change of temperature and radiation.              Now if we may
 suppose that the heat-undulations from the atoms of these same
fluids always remain in like manner undisturbed when the atoms
 are caused to approach each other by compression, or to recede
 from each other by dilatation, we shall have reason for conclu
 ding that the sudden changes of density in vibrations of the
fluid do not give rise to changes of temperature and elasticity,
but only produce the changes of caloric repulsion to which are
 due the changes of pressure.         By this process of reasoning we
 are evidently conducted to the inference that the actual velocity
of sound should be mathematically deducible, at least very ap
proximately, on the supposition that the elasticity of the fluid is
the same in a state of vibration as when it is at rest. I have,
 in fact, obtained in this way a velocity very little less than that
 given by direct observation.
    It however,
          is,                     an
                         ascertained fact that sudden condensations

sudden condensation or rarefaction of air contained in space
limited by partitions which prevent the dispersion of the gene
rated heat and cold into the surrounding space.       The tendency
to such dispersion is proved in the common experiment by which
German tinder is ignited.      It may, however, be admitted that
the effects of the development of heat in the condensed part of
a wave, and of cold in the rarefied part, do not completely destroy
each other, and that there is a residual gradation of temperature
and elasticity from point to point of the wave, sufficient to
account for a slight augmentation of the velocity of propagation.
If my mathematical argument be good, this is        that    have                        all              we         to

98       The Rev. S. Earnshaw on                some Remarks              of Dr. Le Conte
mathematical result with observation is entitled to at least equal
weight. The coincidence of the numerical result obtained from
experiments made for ascertaining the mechanical equivalent of
heat, adds nothing to the evidence, because these experiments
are apparently only another form of those by which the ratio of
the specific heats is determined.
     I
     take this occasion to advert to a result respecting the velo
city of sound which             I
                        have given at the end of an article in the
Philosophical Magazine for April 1862.            have there found    I
that the rate of   propagation   depends,  in some degree, on the
loudness of the sound.      But after  taking  into account that                                          I
had previously demonstrated the component character of the
waves of elastic media, it appeared to be a necessary consequence
that the greater or less magnitude of waves depends only on the
greater or less number of the components, and hence that the
velocity v in the cited formula is the maximum velocity in an
uncompounded wave.        Now as there is no antecedent reason for
supposing that the maximum velocity is greater for one such
wave than for another, the right conclusion seems to be that                                           all
the component waves, and therefore that           waves, great and    all
small, are propagated with the same velocity.         may, however,         It
happen that      two disturbances, made
                   of
                                                                                                       in at at

100             The Rev. S. Earnshaw on some Remarks of Dr. Le Conte
different types with different velocities.              On the contrary, they
show that the difference of velocities is a            strictly  legitimate and
necessary consequence of the difference between the wave-types,
one being exponential and the other circular; and it is in fact
exactly analogous to this—viz. that 4 (e"+e-") can never be less
than 1, and #(e”/-i-H e-rv-i) never greater than 1, whatever
value be given to w. It arises from this that the velocities of
transmission of one type of wave range from V to infinity, and
those of the other type from V to 0.                I hope that after this ex
planation Dr. Le Conte will not continue to think that my
“results set at nought                          all

    quite plain that Dr.            Conte has never considered the nature
of is
    the evidence.        Let       take one          Prof. Montigny’s facts.
                                                                           of
There were two         observers,   who were about equidistant from each
other and from the point struck.             That distance was such that,
according         the commonto      theory,     would take sound about
                                                                  it                                              15
                     to   go                                                                  Le
seconds             from one        the other.  to  Now Dr.           Conte shall
have      flash
            a        lightningof      long          aslikes,   and    as   he
                                                                       ask him                I                   to

      in his paper on the Problem           of the Velocity of Sound.                         101
show how it could strike one corner of the equilateral triangle so
as to be heard at each of the other corners (where the observers
stood) in 2 seconds.    Surely he will be able to see that it is a
mathematical    impossibility that the flash should fall in any way
whatever so as to be heard    by each of the two observers, accord
ing to the common theory, in less than 7% seconds.        But it was
heard  by each of them in 2 seconds.      Here then is a proof that
the sound was transmitted in this case nearly four times as fast
as the common theory allows.        And yet with this unanswer
able fact before  him, supported   by other confirmatory observa
tions by Prof. Montigny, Dr. Le Conte asserts that              have                 I
“failed to produce a single uneaceptionable fact, or a single satis
factory observation, in verification of my theoretical deductions.”
Such assertions as this are easily made, even in the presence of
plain evidence to the contrary; but they should never be intro
duced into inquiries after scientific truth.
   And again, with regard to Captain Parry’s record of the word
“fire” having been heard after the report of the gun in his expe
riments on sound.      How does Dr. Le Conte dispose of that
fact    There are persons now living who were present at the
experiment and noticed the fact.     There was no room for doubt
ful opinions. The fact is of such a nature that they could not
be mistaken. They testify that they distinctly heard the word
“fire” after the sound of the gun’s report had passed them.
But Dr. Le Conte gets rid of this well-authenticated fact in a
very simple and summary way, a way by which any other un
pleasant fact may also be got rid              of.
                                             He tells     that “the       us
records  of the most trustworthy experimentalists concur       esta                  in
blishing the general fact that        all
                                    sounds travel                  at
                                                     the same rate.”
Captain Parry’s officers we see, then, were not trustworthy experi

represented by the quantity of absolute molecular force.     The
mathematician who has to deal with forces, takes account of the
Quantity of heat existing among the particles when he assigns a
magnitude to his absolute molecular forces; and if these forces
continue unchanged through his investigations, this unchange
ableness is the mathematical expression of the physical fact that
no heat escapes during the compression, and that none is gained
during the dilatation that takes place in the passage of a wave.
now in my investigations the absolute molecular forces remain
constant throughout; and consequently the physical hypothesis
is perfectly taken into account that no change in the quantity of
heat in a given molecule or element of the atmosphere takes
place; which otherwise expressed, in the language of the physi
cist, is this: the heat developed during condensation, and the
cold of rarefaction, are fully taken account       Dr.     Conte       of.              Le

element of the medium can be kept at an elevated temperature
for the gºth or ºth of a second, during which it is within the
limits of a sound-wave, without some heat being lost by radia
tion in that comparatively long time.                                 If
                                                    some heat is lost, then
the finite-interval   theory  will give  a   velocity   of sound which will
be in excess of experiment, because that theory essentially sup
poses that no heat is lost.      The velocity to which my investiga
tions lead is therefore the    superior    limiting value of sound-velo
city, and in practice must be reduced by an allowance made for
the loss of heat—that                  is,

ing that the object was more distant than would be given by a
calculation with the velocity of sound ordinarily used.         This is
explained by the velocity being slightly greater over still water
than over the rough surface of the land; and we know that sounds
are heard much further over still water than over land.            The

on oxide of silver to obtain propylic alcohol, in accordance with
the equation
              2C3H7 I+Ag° 0 + H2O=2C8H8 9-1-2Ag I.
He accordingly heated iodide of propyle with moist oxide of silver
in a flask connected with a condensing arrangement.      He ob
served the disengagement of a gas which a subsequent experi
ment showed to be propylene, the formation of which may be
thus expressed:—
                 2C3H7 I+Ag°9=2C3H6+2AgI+                               H29.

                  propyle.
The contents of the flask consisted of iodide of silver with two
liquids.   After adding water, the flask was heated until the ther
mometer rose to 100°.      The distillate consisted of two separate
layers, an aqueous inferior layer, on which swam a mobile
body with a peppermint odour. Water was added to the two
liquids, whereby a larger quantity of this lighter liquid was sepa
rated. Washed with water, dried over chloride of calcium, and
rectified, it passed over completely between 60° and 62°, and was
found on analysis to consist of propylic ether, C9H149.        The
formation may be expressed as follows:—

The formula of the dehydrated acid is C*H*0°, which is the
same as that of oxybenzoic and salicylic acids.   Its formation
may be thus expressed:—

   The new acid differs essentially from salicylic acid, more espe
cially in that it does not give with perchloride of iron the violet
colour characteristic of the latter acid. It also differs from oxy
benzoic acid, although it stands nearer to it in many respects
than to salicylic acid. Saytzeff names it Paraoaybenzoic acid.
It is a strong acid, and forms with the oxides of zinc and cad
mium and with the alkaline earths well-defined salts.
   When crude nitrobenzole, prepared from benzole containing
toluole, is treated with dilute soda lye, and the alkaline liquid
supersaturated with hydrochloric acid, an acid precipitate is
obtained, which, after being purified by recrystallization, has
much similarity with benzoic acid.       Fischer, who made this
observation*, had the opportunity of examining a specimen of
this substance which had been obtained as a by-product in a
manufactory.      It was found on analysis to have the composition
of nitrobenzoic acid, C*H*NO", and is obviously a product of
oxidation of toluole;            its
                           formation may     thus expressed:—  be

cylic acids.          These acids he names paramidobenzoic                                and       paroay
benzoic acids; and the interesting result was obtained, that the
paroxybenzoic acid formed was identical with that obtained                                                   in
another way by Saytzeff (vide stºpra).
   The method by which the base piperidine has hitherto been pre
pared, by the decomposition of piperine by potash, is so unproduc
tive as to make investigation of the former base very expensive.
Wertheim has now” found that when the alcoholic solution of
 pepper is directly treated with potash, the whole of the piperine
 which it contains is converted into piperidine; after distilling                                            off

116                       Prof. Odling on the Hewatomicity
atoms of ferricum and aluminium are considered as hexatomic. It
seems to me, however, that, in the present state of knowledge,
the arguments for and against this hexatomicity are pretty evenly
balanced, or at any rate that those in   favour    not preponde     its                  do
rate     decidedly

established motions.
   As understand them, the chief arguments for the hexatomi
        I
 city   offerricum and aluminium are deducible from the vapour
 densities      the two chlorides (2), from the existence
                 of                                                     certain                 of
 basic and   complex    salts    ferricum (8), and from the properties

   What conceive to be the arguments opposed to the hexato
micity of aluminium and ferricum are drawn from the specific
heat of aluminium (2), from the non-existence of any inferior
chloride of aluminium (3), from the improbability of an incre
ment of chlorine combining two molecules of ferrous chloride
into one molecule of ferric chloride (y), and from the series of
iron chlorides requiring a trichloride for       completion (8).                  its

  The formulae of the extreme perissad compounds M Cl and
MC17 being indisputable, that of the intermediate perissad com
pound MC1" would seem to be at any rate not improbable.
    I
    will venture to add yet one more argument on this side of
the question, based, I must confess, rather upon a personal im
pression than a demonstrable fact.                            I
                                             am inclined to think that
alumina is an    analogue   of boric  anhydride;     that boracite and
spinelle belong to the same type; and that in several complex
aluminous silicates a portion of the alumina is replaced isomor
phously by boric anhydride, or rather that a portion of the alu
minium is replaced by boron.       If this view is correct, the mole
cule of aluminic chloride     ought  probably to be represented by
the formula Al    Cl”, similar to the well-established formula for
the molecule of boric chloride, BCP, despite the want of relation
between the observed vapour-densities of the two compounds.
I  say “ought probably,” because isomorphism does sometimes
obtain between elements of different atomicities, as instanced by
silver blende, Ag” S, and galena, Pb" S, for example; whence it
is quite possible that B”0° may be isomorphous with Allvi Oº.
In reference to this point, it is perhaps worthy of notice that the
difference between the atomic weights of boron (11) and alumi
nium (27°5) is substantially the same as that between the atomic
weights of fluorine and chlorine, oxygen and sulphur, nitrogen
and phosphorus, carbon and silicon, glucinum and magnesium,
lithium and sodium, and sodium and potassium respectively.
    I have put together these few remarks, not at             with the       all
view      deciding the matter, but merely
         of                                        calling attention

water and caustic potash for example.
   He affected to teach us that the molecules of the chemical
elements are divisible in the act of combination, and that all
gaseous molecules, elementary or compound, occupy the same
bulk; the former doctrine satisfactorily established by the re
searches of more than a dozen years ago, and the latter, after a
much chequered career, recognized for some time past as a very
corner stone of chemical science, notwithstanding that in a Royal
Institution lecture to a very general audience I endeavoured to
explain it incidentally by what Mr. Waterston complimentary
terms “ridiculously clear’ illustrations.

 XXIV.     On Róber’s Construction of the Heptagon.  By Sir                                        WIL

 1.       TN        a recent Number of the Philosophical Magazine, obser
                   vations were made on some approximate constructions of
 the regular heptagon, which have recalled my attention to a very
 remarkable construction of that kind, invented by a deceased pro
fessor of architecture at Dresden, Friedrich Gottlob Röbert, who
 came to conceive, however, that it had been known to the Egyp
 tians, and employed by them in the building of the temple at
Edfu. Röber, indeed, was of opinion that the connected triangle,
in which each angle at the base is triple of the angle at the ver
tex, bears very important relations to the plan of the human
skeleton, and to other parts of nature.       But without pretending
to follow him in such speculations, attractive as they may be
to many readers,                  I
                      may be permitted to examine here the accu
racy of the proposed geometrical construction, of such an isosceles
triangle, or of the heptagon which depends upon             The close               it.

and these last agree so nearly with the values (A) of sin p and
cos $, that at this stage a doubt may be felt, in which direction
does the construction err.        In fact, Röber appears to have believed
that the construction above described was geometrically rigorous,
and had been known and prized as such from a very remote
antiquity, although preserved as a secret doctrine, entrusted
only to the initiated, and recorded only in stone.
     4. The following is an easier way, for a reader who may not
like so much arithmetic, to satisfy himself of the extreme close
ness of the approximation, by formulae adapted to logarithms,
but rigorously derived from the construction.               It being evident

    * Among these the best by far appears to be Horner's method, for prac
tically arranging the figures in the use of which method, a very compact and
convenient form or scheme was obligingly communicated to me by Professor
De Morgan, some time ago. We arrived independently at the following
value, to 22 decimals, of the positive root of the cubic mentioned above:

   9. My own studies have not been such as to entitle me to express
an opinion whether the architectural and geometrical drawings
of Röber in connexion with the plan of the temple at Edfu, and
his comparisons of the numbers deduced from the details of his
construction with French measurements previously made, are
sufficient to bear out his conclusion, that the process had been
anciently used: but             I   wish that some qualified person would
take up the inquiry, which appears to me one of great interest,
especially as         I  see no antecedent improbability in the supposi
tion that the construction in question may have been invented
in a very distant age. The geometry which it employs is in
no degree more difficult than that of the Fourth Book of Euclid”;
and although            I have no conjecture to offer as to what may have
suggested the particular process employed, yet it seems to me
quite as likely to have been discovered thousands of years ago,
perhaps after centuries of tentation, as to have been first found
in our own time, which does not generally attach so much im
portance to the heptagon as a former age may have done, and
which perhaps enjoys no special facilities in the search after such
a construction, although it supplies means of proving, as above,
that the proposed solution of the problem is not mathematically
perfect.
     10. If Róber’s professional skill as an architect, combined
with the circumstance stated of his having previously invented
the construction for himself, did really lead him to a correct
interpretationt of the plan of the temple at Edfu, which he
believed to embody a tradition much older than itself, we are
thus admitted to a very curious glimpse, or even a partial view,
of the nature and extent, but at the same time the imperfection,
of that knowledge of geometry which was possessed, but kept
 secret, by the ancient priests of Egypt.                 I say the imperfection,
 on the supposition that the above described construction of the
 heptagon, if known to them at all, was thought by them to be
 equal in rigour, as the elder Röber appears to have thought it to
 be, to that construction of the pentagon which Euclid may have
 learned from them, rejecting perhaps, at the same time, the
         º
    * The! ...!!
              segment p' of the     side p of the pentagon,  and the fourth   propor
                                                                                  -
 tional          to the three radii, which enter into the equations (A), and of which
 the latter is the greater segment of the third diameter, 2r", if this last be
 cut in extreme and mean ratio, may at first appear to depend on the Sixth
 Book of Fuclid, but will be found to be easily constructible without going-
 beyond the Fourth Book.
    t  It ought in fairness to be stated that Röber's interpretation of Egyp
 tian antiquities included a vast deal more than what is here described, and
 that he probably considered the geometrical part of it to be the least inter
 esting, although still, in his view, an essential and primary element.

that is to say, by a quantity decreasing with the temperature t,
and therefore with the altitude.
    Seeing the incompatibility                  of the received formula with the
observed       facts,  it has appeared to me worth while to inquire to
what formula for computing heights from barometric observa
tions Mr. Glaisher’s results lead.                         In another paper I will en
 deavour to       investigate         the formula for atmospheric refraction
 deducible from the same results.
    The decrease of temperature of the air from the earth to the
 different elevations found by Mr. Glaisher, taking the mean -of
his eight ascents, is shown in the following Table+:—

   Whatever be the value of b in (1), provided it is positive, the
correction to be applied to Laplace's formula is always negative.

The Mathematical and other Writings of Robert Leslie Ellis, M.A.,
  late Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Edited by W.WALton,
  M.A. With a Biographical Memoir, by the Very Rev. HARVEY
  Goodwin, D.D., Dean of Ely.       Cambridge, 1863. 8vo, pp. 427.
                 is of a memorial rather than of a strictly scientific
Thischaracter.
       volume
                   It contains in a collected form the miscellaneous
memoirs and notes of a man of rare promise, but who was taken
away prematurely and under peculiarly painful circumstances.     Mr.
Ellis, the youngest of a family of six children, was born at Bath,
August 25, 1817. He was carefully educated at home, and it may
be mentioned that one of his mathematical tutors was the late Mr.
T. S. Davies. He entered as a pensioner at Trinity College, Cam
 bridge, and went into residence in October 1836. He appears to
 have brought a large stock of mathematical knowledge with him to
 Cambridge, and pursued his studies there without the aid of a pri
 vate tutor until his last year, when he read with Mr. Hopkins, who
 remembers that he possessed an extent and definiteness of acquire
 ment and a maturity of thought so unusual “that I could hardly con
 ceive when he could have been a boy.”        He took his B.A. degree
in  January  1840,  when he was Senior    Wrangler,   Dr. Goodwin being
 second in the same   year.   In the following  October he was elected
Fellow of Trinity College, and continued to hold his fellowship till
 1849, when, as he did not take orders, he vacated it in due course.
He inherited from his mother a highly nervous constitution and
extremely feeble health—circumstances       which prevented his enter
ing any active profession. He was, it is true, called to the bar; but
though he had paid great attention to the principles of Civil Law, he
did not study long with a view to practice.      In like manner he once
thought of attempting to enter Parliament, and his name was pub
licly brought forward as a possible candidate for the representation
of Bath, but was withdrawn on the score of his             ill
                                                        health.   Neither
ill health, however, nor nervous constitution impaired his powers
                he                                                                 of as

gory in starting the ‘Cambridge Mathematical Journal,' and edited
the third and fourth volumes of that periodical.          In conjunction
with Mr. Spedding and Mr. D. D. Heath, he undertook the task of
bringing out a new edition of Lord Bacon's works; the portion
comprising the philosophical works fell to his share. In the autumn
of 1849, after vacating his fellowship, he left England, apparently
with the intention of ultimately settling down in a warmer climate.
After a short stay at Nice he went on to Mentone, where he slept in
a damp bed; on the evening of the next day but one he was seized
by a rheumatic fever.     For some days the attack seemed fatal, but
unhappily for him it was otherwise ordered. He continued for nearly
ten years, literally dying by inches.     All this time his nervous sys
tem seems to have been undergoing a process of slow disorgani
zation.    He was a cripple from the time of the fever, and his
remaining bodily powers failed one by one during the ensuing years.
His mental powers, however, continued bright to the end; and as
he found some relief in the society of intellectual friends, he returned
to the neighbourhood of Cambridge, where he passed the last six
years of his life.   His religious feelings, originally strong, were
deepened by his sufferings, which he bore very meekly; and though
longing for death, he was content to wait till it came. Dr. Good
win has recorded many interesting recollections of his last years;
but on them we must not dwell.        He was, it is said, a man of some
what reserved manners, but in the company of friends showed great
conversational powers; he seems to have been eminently a “full
man,” and what he had to say was expressed in singularly clear
and appropriate diction. The portrait prefixed to the volume is
stated by Mr. Walton to be copied from an admirable likeness; to
those who remember Mr. Ellis it may seem that it fails to render
adequately the palid hue of sickliness with which his face was marked
even in the days of his comparatively good health.          This paleness
was in strong contrast with the extreme blackness of his hair; and
the general impression of sickliness was heightened by a feebleness
of gait quite remarkable in a man so young.         We may also notice
that the artist has not rendered, or rather has disguised the receding
character of the lower part of his face, and the thinness of his face
generally.    His countenance was marked by rare intellectual beauty;
and this is adequately   rendered.    Resemblance of character and fea
ture between persons in no wise connected is always to be understood
with great abatement; that premised, we may say that he seems to
us to have borne in both respects considerable likeness to Pascal :
the early tendency towards mathematical studies, the clearness
of expression and subtilty of thought, the deep religious feeling, the
early closing in of a melancholy latter life, were the same in both.
Differences in abundance there were—a great difference in power and
genius; but perhaps the most striking point of difference is that sug
gested by Mr. Ellis's own words, “He who loves truth earnestly
will be slow to believe that the cause of truth is to be served by
irony”*.

     We have dwelt so long upon the man, that our remarks upon his
writings must be brief. The title-page of the present volume would,
we think, justify the expectation that it contains at least all Mr. Ellis's
printed works; this, however, is not the case. That part of his
writings which is contained in the edition of Bacon's works is not
given here, an omission not to be wondered at, but to be regretted;
at least we should be glad to see the General Preface to Bacon's
philosophical works printed separately.         We quite agree with Dr.
Goodwin that it is the most valuable of his writings. We may add
that it contains a singularly able exposition of the more difficult
points of Bacon's philosophy, and particularly of the meaning of his
chief technical terms.
   The most important article in the present volume is perhaps the
“Report on the Recent Progress of Analysis” (pp. 238–323), pre
sented to the British Association in 1846.        It contains an account
of the progress made in the   Theory of Elliptic Functions and the Com
parison of Transcendentals in the twenty years preceding the writing
of the Report. Next in prominence, if not in importance, is a series
of articles on the Theory of Probabilities, and on the Method of
Least Squares.     These articles Dr. Goodwin considers to represent
Mr. Ellis's special tendency in regard to mathematics:—“He de
lighted to discuss the principles of investigations already known, to
trace the history of processes, to examine the philosophy of a sub
ject, to hunt up          its
                      literature,       simplifyor    treatment.” They

following a long train of analytical reasoning without so much as
seeing the symbols.    A few essays and remarks on other subjects
are inserted, partly on account of their intrinsic merit, partly, we
suppose, with a view to exhibiting the extensive range of Mr. Ellis's
learning. We may particularize the following:—an essay “On
Roman Aqueducts,” written for the purpose of determining the
amount of hydraulic knowledge exhibited in the arrangements made
for distributing the water, so far as they are known. “Some
Thoughts on Comparative Metrology”—an attempt to determine
historically the connexion between the measures of land used by dif
ferent European nations.        It would appear from internal evidence
that this  essay  could not have been composed before the end of 1852.
If this circumstance is borne in mind, it may be justly thought that
the learning and out-of-the-way knowledge displayed in the course of
it render      its
               composition one             of

portance of spectrum analysis, states that among the numerous
spectroscopes which were exhibited in the International Exhibition
of 1862, there was one which had been specially constructed by
 Messrs. Spencer, Browning, and Co., philosophical inctrument
makers in London, which at the time excited considerable attention.
This spectroscope had two prisms, with a magnifying power of 40,

On the Direct Correlation                                of Mechanical               and Chemical Forces. 145
   The Bakerian Lecture.—“On the Direct Correlation of Mecha
nical and Chemical Forces.” By Henry Clifton Sorby, F.R.S.
   Perhaps it may be thought somewhat strange that a geologist should
undertake such a subject as the correlation of forces; but the very
fact of my being a geologist has led to the investigations of which
I  now purpose to give a short preliminary account.       In studying
general chemical and physical geology, and especially in examining
the microscopical structure of rocks, I have for a number of years
been greatly perplexed with a class of facts which pointed both to a
mechanical and to a chemical origin. At first I attributed them either
to a mechanical or a chemical action, or to the two combined; but in
most cases no satisfactory explanation could be given.      At length,
however, facts turned up which altogether precluded any supposition
not involving direct correlation; for they most clearly indicated that
mechanical force had been resolved into chemical action in the same
way       as,
                                                                                          as be
           under other circumstances,           may       resolved into heat,
electricity,      any other modification
                     or                        force,                   of it

On the Direct Correlation of Mechanical and Chemical Forces. 147
                                                            I
class of facts to be taken into account, shall base my conclusions on
my own experiments.       The volume with which salts exist when in
solution, assuming that of the water to remain unchanged, varies
greatly in the case of different salts, and also according to the
amount in solution and the temperature.        Thus, taking sal-am
moniac as an example, when there are 3 per cent. in solution the
volume is as if it expanded 3:40 per cent, on dissolving; whereas
when 25:55 per cent. are in solution, the expansion is 11:36 per
cent. ; and when nearly concentrated at about 13°C., an additional
quantity expands on dissolving 1578 per cent. In by far the greater
number of cases, however, there is a contraction on dissolving,
and the amount gradually diminishes for each additional quantity
entering into solution, so that the mean result is very different from
what occurs when the solution is dilute or is nearly saturated.    It is
this contraction or  expansion when a small additional quantity  is dis
solved in a nearly concentrated solution that must be taken into
account in the following calculations.
   In determining the influence of pressure on the solution of salts,                                       I
found it requisite to adopt somewhat different methods according to
the peculiarities of the salts. In some cases sealed up in a saturatedI
solution portions of the salt in clean, solid crystals, and determined
the effect due to pressure from their loss in weight; whereas in other
cases I sealed up solutions containing more salt than could be dis
solved at the temperature at which the experiments were made, and
determined the effect of pressure from the difference in the weight
of the crystals deposited; being of course careful to make allowance
for any difference in the amount of solution in the tube with pressure
and in that without, and to avoid any error that might be produced
by a different temperature.      In     cases         all
                                                have had      tube with
                                                                 I                        a
pressure and another without, treated from first        last    precisely          to         in
                                                                                                    so so
the same manner, and kept        exactly the same temperature,
                                        at                           that
pressure was the only difference; and usually the effect was         well
marked that there was no doubt about the result.          In the case of
chloride     of
             sodium, solution goes                    on    so
                                               slowly, and the mechanical

adopt the last expression as the measure of the total amount of
mechanical work done by the solution of salts which expand in dis
solving, and which may conversely be looked upon as the measure
of the mechanical force rendered latent and, as it were, expended
in the act of crystallization when crystals are deposited. The value
of this mechanical equivalent of course varies with the strength of the
solution, as already remarked.
   In the case of salts which occupy less space when dissolved than
when solid, pressure, like an increase in temperature, causes them to be
more soluble ; mechanical force is lost when they dissolve, and                                                                   is,   as

on those  of
           Scotland and Sweden.”  By the Rev. Samuel Haughton,
M.D., F.R.S.
  The author discussed                  in   detail the mineralogical                composition    of

    Mr. Poole    on the recent Geological Changes    in Somerset.     155
each of the fifteen Donegal granites, and described the method
usually employed by him in solving lithologico-chemical problems,
coming to the conclusion that nearly half of these granites are not
composed altogether of the four minerals (Quartz, Orthoclase, Oli
goclase, and Black Mica) which are found in them in distinct
crystals, and that the remaining varieties, even if they be composed
of these minerals, must have a paste composed of the same minerals,
but with a slightly different composition.      Prof. Haughton then dis
cussed the composition of the syenites of Donegal, and instituted a
comparison between the granites of that district and those of Scotland
and Sweden, remarking that those of the last-named region have the
same stratified structure as the granites of Donegal.
    3.  “On    the recent Earthquake at Manila.”       By J. W. Farren,
Esq.     Communicated    by  the  Foreign Office.
    In two letters to Earl Russell the author described the damage
done by this earthquake, observing that 289 persons were killed,
and a large number more or less injured.
   4. “Extracts from letters relating to the further discovery of
Fossil Teeth and Bones of Reptiles in Central India.”        By the late
Rev. S. Hislop.      Communicated by Prof. T. Rupert Jones, F.G.S.
    The remains alluded to consist of (1) a series of Reptilian bones,
some bearing teeth, mostly Labyrinthodont, and some probably
Dicynodont, from the (Triassic *) red clay of Maledi, in which teeth
of Ceratodus occur; and (2) several teeth similar to one from the
Eocene clays of Takli, near Nagpore, and another like a conical
tooth from the Eocene beds (with Physa Prinsepii) of Physura, from
the same neighbourhood as that in which the set No. 1 was found.
    At Phísdura (Tertiary), large Reptilian bones (including a femur
 1 foot across at the condyles,      and a vertebral centrum 7 inches
across) have been found associated with large coprolites, Physa
Prinsepii, and Paludina Deccanensis.
     Mr. Hislop stated his belief that the Mangali beds, the Korhadi
shales, and the red clay of Maledi, should be placed above the
 plant-bearing beds of Nagpore instead of below them, as heretofore
 supposed.

     l. “On the recent Geological Changes in Somerset, and their
 date relatively to the Existence of Man and of certain of the
 Extinct Mammalia.” By G. S. Poole, Esq.
     In describing the general physical features of the district treated
 of, which lies between Clevedon and Taunton, the author noticed
 especially the embankments which protect the land from periodical
 inundations, stating his belief that they were constructed by the
 Romans; he also described the “turbaries” or peat-moors, en
 deavouring to explain their mode of formation, and noticing their

relation to the alluvium and the sand-banks of the district. Mr.
Poole then endeavoured to prove that the area under consideration
had been subject to considerable changes of level in comparatively
recent geological times, and that Man existed in the district prior,
and some of the extinct Mammalia subsequently, to the last of such
changes, asserting, in support of the last conclusion, that the re
mains of Elephas primigenius, Rhinoceros tichorhinus, &c., had been
found in a stratum above that containing the bones of Man and
pieces of pottery; and he concluded by examining the evidence of
the extent and date of the last subsidence.
   2. “On the Structure of the Red Crag in Suffolk and Essex.”
By Searles W. Wood, Jun., Esq.
   By reference to a tabulated description of about fifty sections
taken from various parts of the Red-crag area, the author showed that
the deposit is structurally divisible into five stages, of which the
1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th (counting upwards) were not deposited
under water; but from their being regularly laminated, at angles
varying between 25° and 35°, and possessing (with the exception of
the 2nd) an unvarying direction in every stage, he regards them as
the result of a process of “beaching up,” by which was formed a
reef extending from the river Alde on the north, to the southern
extremity of the deposit in Essex.      Of these four stages, the 4th
is the most constant and important, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd being
frequently either concealed by, or destroyed during the formation                                   of,
the succeeding stages.    At Walton-on-the-Naze alone       any   the               do         of
four lower stages contain' evidence      being    subaqueous deposit;

able atmospheric circumstances, are so wonderfully different in their
appearance from those presented by the diminished apertures for
merly and necessarily in use, that it would not be very surprising if
some observers, unaware of what had previously been seen and de
scribed, should imagine that the phenomena revealed by their newly
acquired and powerful telescopes were really new discoveries.    And
this is what, there is good reason to believe, has in some instances
actually occurred.    Such a mistake may also be more likely to be
made when a new name has been applied by some recent observer to
an appearance long familiar to others, though previously unnamed.
A name, no doubt, has the advantage of affording a convenient
handle whereby to grasp the thing described; but, unless it is very
correct and appropriate, it conveys an erroneous impression of the
appearance to which it is applied, and may become far more injurious
than advantageous.      It seems to me, therefore, to be desirable to
direct attention to what has been long ago observed and described,
and also to put on record some results of a pretty constant scrutiny
of solar phenomena with powerful and excellent telescopes during
the last twelve or fifteen years.
   The mottled appearance of the solar surface requires no very large
amount of optical power to render it visible.   I have often observed
it with a good refractor of only 2% inches aperture and a power of
60.   Examined with a large aperture, such as 6 or 8 inches, it
becomes evident that the surface is principally made up of luminous
masses imperfectly separated from each other by rows of minute
dark dots, the intervals between these dots being extremely small,
and occupied by a substance decidedly less luminous than the gene
ral surface. This gives the impression of a division between the
luminous masses, especially with a comparatively low power, which,
however, when best seen with high powers, is found to be never
complete.    The masses thus incompletely separated are of almost
every variety of irregular form—the rarest of all, perhaps, being
that which is conveyed to my mind by Mr. Nasmyth's appellation
of “willow leaves,” viz. long, narrow, and pointed.   Indeed the only
situation in which I have usually noticed them to assume anything
like such a shape, is in the immediate vicinity of considerable spots,
on their penumbrae, and frequently projecting beyond it irregularly
for a small distance on to the umbra,—an appearance with respect
to which, in my “Description of a new Solar Eyepiece,” which I
read before the Society in April 1852 (see “Memoirs, vol. xxi. p. 161),
I employed the following expressions:—“The interior edge of the
penumbra frequently appears extremely jagged—the bright ridges on
 itssurface, which are directed nearly towards the centre    of the spot,
being seen projected      irregular distances           cloudy

straw, the edge    ofwhich has been left untrimmed.”        After nearly
twelve years  of careful observations   of  the same phenomena,   I    do
not think that could improve upon this description.

   Of the general appearance    of  the sun's surface, I  have met with

 158                    Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   no more accurate description than is contained in Sir John Herschel’s
   “Outlines of Astronomy,' art. 387, where he says, “The part of the
   sun's disc not occupied by spots is far from uniformly bright. Its
   ground is finely mottled with an appearance of minute dark dots or
  pores, which, when attentively watched, are found to be in a constant
   state of change.      There is nothing which represents so faithfully this
  appearance as the slow subsidence of some flocculent chemical precipi.
  tates in a transparent fluid, when viewed perpendicularly from above.”
  The only part of this admirable description which I should be at all
  disposed to modify is that relating to the “ constant state of change”
  in the pores. The plan I have uniformly adopted in the minute
  scrutiny of the solar surface has been to employ very small perfora
  tions in the diaphragm-plate of my solar eyepiece (viz. from 20" to
  60" in diameter), using the highest magnifiers which circumstances
  would permit.        In this way I have frequently kept the same lumi
  nous masses and the intervening pores in view for an hour or two
  together—and        have rarely observed any decided change in either,
  even when well seen with powers from 400 to above 600.                       Yet very
  slight atmospheric tremors suffice to give an appearance of almost
  perpetual variation; and unless the view is confined within the nar
  row limits of a very small field, the eye is apt to become confused in
 its  judgment        the relative positions

projected on to the umbra of a large spot, its superior brightness
usually prevents the cloudy stratum from being discerned at all,
even when the umbral portion only is included in the small field of
View.
    With respect to the highly interesting subject of the origin or
cause of the solar spots, I wish to direct special attention to the black
nucleus which in most of the large and symmetrical spots is found to
occupy some part of the umbra.         I cannot but regret that, though
nearly twelve years have elapsed since I announced the frequent ex
istence of such a black spot, and that it would be highly desirable to
restrict to it the term nucleus, yet I believe the distinction has never
been made by any other observer—the umbra having been univer
sally, so far as I know, designated as the nucleus, and the existence
of the true black nucleus within it either forgotten or ignored. My
earnest desire that the distinction should be-recognized and esta
blished does not arise merely from the conviction that accuracy is
preferable to inaccuracy, and that where a decided difference really
 exists it is desirable to express it by a difference of terms, though
 I should imagine that such a ground would generally be deemed
 sufficient of itself; a still more cogent reason is found in the fact,
 that the whole series of my observations for twelve years past has
led me to the conclusion that generally, if not universally, the exist
 ence or absence of the black nucleus is sufficient to determine, or at
 least to throw much light upon, the origin of the spot, and that the
 origin of those in which the nucleus exists is widely different from
 the origin of those from which it is absent.      To do justice, however,
  to this view of the   subject would  unduly lengthen  the present paper ;
  and I therefore   hope  to be  able, in a future  communication,    more
 fully to lay before the Society the conclusions at which I have arrived.

       ON THE RAYS OF THE ULTRA-VIOLET           SOLAR SPECTRUM.
                           NOTE BY M. MASCART.
     I have the honour to lay before the Academy a drawing of the
  ultra-violet solar spectrum with most of the rays which it contains.
  The method used to obtain it is the exact copy of that which serves
  for the observation of the luminous spectrum.       A collimator gonio
  meter was used, the two lenses of which are of quartz cut perpendi
  cularly to the optic axis, so that the rays traverse it only slightly
  inclined in reference to this axis. The refracting prism is also of
  quartz, cut parallel to the axis; and I generally observed the extra
  ordinary spectrum, which is the most divergent.        Such a system of
  lenses is not achromatic; but this does not prevent a pure spectrum
  being obtained, and has no other effect than that of causing a consi
  derable change of position in passing from the less to the more refran
  gible rays. In the mounting of the eyepiece of the telescope is a cross
  wire, and at the inner extremity of the eyepiece is a photographic

        XXIX.     On the Optical Properties     of the Metals.
                        By G. QUINCKE*.
W HILST          physicists
          themselves with the
                              have for some time back occupied
                                  properties  of the light reflected
from   metals,  they  have paid very little attention to light pass
#ng through metals—a circumstance partly to be ascribed to the
technical difficulties of the preparation and manipulation of thin
transparent metallic plates. The little that one knows about
the light transmitted through metals, as, for instance, the results
of Faraday'st recent researches, refers almost entirely to the       in
tensity and colour of the light. The latter shows itself to be so
very inconstant for the same metal, that one would be disposed
to seek the explanation of the irregularity in the presence of
holes in the metallic plate, if Faraday had not demonstrated
this property of a thin metallic film, viz. that when placed ob
liquely between two crossed Nicol's prisms, it illuminates the
field and acts “just like a glass plate.”
   This property of thin transparent plates of metal was, so far
as the author knows, first observed by Warren De la Ruef with
regard to gold-leaf, and afterwards by Faraday in thin trans

day’sº, however, that he and Warren De la Rue found the colour
of the light transmitted by gold to be altered by the employ
ment of polarized light and a set of gypsum plates, it follows
that the metallic plates must act somewhat differently from glass
plates. The author has arrived at the following results in the
course of his research on the properties of the light transmitted
through metals.
   When a ray of plane-polarized light is reflected from a metallic
surface, the two components of the ray polarized parallel and
perpendicular to the plane of incidence undergo a different alte
ration in phase by reflexion. Jamint has shown that the differ
ence of phase of the components increases from 0 to Tr (corre
sponding to a difference in the path of the components vary

angle of incidence increases from 0° to 90°, i. e. from a perpen
dicular to a grazing incidence. The investigation, carried out
with the aid of Babinet’s compensator, showed that the compo
nent polarized parallel to the plane of incidence was always acce
lerated in relation to the component polarized perpendicular to
the plane of incidence.      If the components of the incident light
polarized parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence
were of equal intensity (that                         is,

the transparent metallic leaf is bounded on both sides by air, or
on one side by air and on the other by a highly refracting me
                                                                              -

    When the components of an incident ray, polarized parallel
and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, have an equal                in
tensity, then in the transmitted light the intensity of the com
ponent polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence prepon
derates.
    As yet it is only in the case of gold that the author has suc
ceeded in obtaining leaves which were bounded on both sides
by air, and at the same time sufficiently uniform and even.               For
this   purpose   gold-leaf  of a convenient      shape   was  placed    upon
distilled water and allowed to straighten itself out.           It was then
lifted off by means of a small frame of brass which had been
previously burnt black, and of which the inside measure was
4 millims. in breadth and 28 millims. in length. After the
evaporation of the water there thus remained in the frame a
transparent gold plate which could be fastened by means of the
frame to the axis of a goniometer and examined.                Such a plate
is never   quite   flat, and  consequently     there is   always   an error
in the measurement of the angle of incidence, and this error may
amount to several degrees.
    The goniometer had a perfectly similar disposition to that
which Jaminº employed in his researches.                Two brass tubes
blackened    internally   could be turned on a     graduated    circle about
the axis of the goniometer, to which they were directed perpen
dicularly, and carried at their extremities two circles with Nicol's
prisms, in order to allow of the determination of the plane of
polarization of the incident and emergent rays. The rays re
flected from or passing through metal were received by a Babi
met's compensator previously to their entry into the Nicol's prism
used as the analyzer, in order to neutralize the difference of phase
of the components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the
plane of incidence. The rays emerging from the compensator
were then polarized in a straight line, and the azimuth & of their
plane of polarization could be measured by means of the analy
zing Nicol's prism, by turning it until a black band again ap
peared between the parallel lines of the compensator; at this spot
the light emerging from the compensator was fully extinguished.
    The brass tube which carried the polarizing Nicol's prisms.
was provided with two diaphragms with cross lines, and the en
tire apparatus was so placed that the shadows of both cross lines,
received on a plate of ground glass, covered one another when
a heliostat projected sunlight upon the Nicol's prism and then

through metal and then through glass, or first through glass and
then through metal. The difference of phase               however, much                                is,

        Observations made upon other transparent plates of platinum
    furnished similar results.    Here again, just as for silver, the
    difference of phase and the azimuth & (under the same incidence)

    influence which they exercise upon reflected or transmitted
    light, there was observed the widest differences—and, indeed, not
    alone as regards silver, which one might suppose to undergo
    oxidation, but also with regard to gold and platinum, of which
    this supposition is inadmissible.

 l?0             M. G. Quincke on   the Optical Properties
 matic lens. The rays emerged nearly parallel from the lens, and
then encountered a system composed of two plane-parallel plates
 of glass of exactly equal thickness (8.66 millims.), and placed
 200 millims. apart. The second plate of glass was a very little.
 inclined towards the first, so that the rays reflected from the
posterior surface of the first and from the anterior surface of the
 second plate might interfere with the rays reflected at the ante
rior surface of the first and the posterior surface of the second.
A screen cut off the rays reflected from both anterior or from
both posterior surfaces of the plane-parallel glass plates. The
rays admitted by the screen fell upon a flint-glass prism with a
refraction-angle of 60° and a vertical refracting edge, in which a
spectrum having thick black bands of interference could be seen
with the naked eye.       By regulating the breadth of the slit and
the distance of the same from the lens, it was possible to make
Fraunhofer's lines clearly visible. The interference-bands were
eaused to fall parallel to Fraunhofer's lines by a proper adjust
ment of the plane-parallel plates of glass.
    In the following experiments, both interfering rays of light
were inclined at an angle of 45° or 30° to the anterior surface of
the plane-parallel glasses, and had a great intensity in this
arrangement of the apparatus. A very slight difference in the
path of the rays, even when it fell short of gº of an undula
tion, could be recognized with certainty by an alteration in the     .
position of the thick interference-bands—especially when this
alteration was restricted either to the upper or to the lower
part of the spectrum, the other portion remaining unaltered.
Besides, the displacement could be observed against the Fraun
hofer’s lines.
    The section of each of the interfering rays (or, more cor
rectly, bundles of rays) was very nearly a rectangle, the longer
side being vertical.     In the path of both bundles of rays, which
were about 4 to 6 millims. apart, there was now placed a plane
parallel glass plate, on which there was a rectangular transparent
metallic film.     One side of this film was placed horizontal, the
other   vertical, so however that the latter lay between the two bun
dles of interfering rays. Assuming that the upper part of the
bundle of rays I. passed through metal, and that the upper
part of the bundle of rays II. passed through air, then the
upper part of the spectrum would be formed of rays which would
have a difference of path proportional to the thickness of the
metallic plate, if light travels through metal with a velocity dif
ferent from that at which it travels through air.
    Since the metallic plate, and hence the upper part of the spec
trum, was sharply bounded by a horizontal line, it was possible to
observe the situation of the interference-bands in the lower part

      through the glass plate bearing the metal, they would            re                                          all       be

 172                   M. G. Quincke            on the Optical Properties
which passed through the metal; hence the velocity of light in
these metals is greater than the velocity in air.
    Gold may be investigated without the use of any support of
glass, if a rectangular piece of gold-leaf be suspended vertically
in the air. The experiment gives the same result either with.or
without glass.
    Since, in order to be transparent, the metallic films must not
be thicker than about one-fifth the length of an undulation, it
follows that the displacement of the interference-bands never
exceeds 0°l or 0:2 of the interval between the interference
bands.
   But, as Faraday has shown, silver and gold occur in very dif
ferent modifications.   Transparent silver of a yellow or grey
colour causes a displacement which is neutralized by an accele
ration of the ray passing through the metal; that     the light                       is,
passes with less velocity through the metal than through air.

  Owing to the imperfections of the Nicol's prisms employed,
in which the incident and emergent rays were not parallel, the
values of A and H are affected by small errors.
   The transparent brown gold-leaf was prepared by spreading a
solution of gold, such as is employed for gilding in the porcelain
manufactories, on a piece of looking-glass and heating it in an
alcohol flame. In this instance, as also in the case of the platinum
films, the glass support was strongly heated and then badly
annealed. In order to eliminate the error arising from this, the
metallic films were detached from the glass plates by the employ
ment of a method of E. Mitscherlich's*, consisting in immersing
the plates in pure hydrochloric acid and then bringing them into
contact with pieces of zinc.       The zinc with the other metal
formed a galvanic pair, and the hydrogen which was thereby dis
engaged at the surface of the gold detached the latter from the
glass and it swam in the liquid. The liquid could then be
poured out with care, and replaced by distilled water. Having
washed the metal free from every trace of hydrochloric acid,
it was placed on a plane-parallel plate of polished glass, freed
from distilled water by evaporation, and finally lay flat on the
 glass surface.    By using a clean knife it was easy to give to the
film the requisite rectangular form.
    A determination of the thickness of a silver plate, and of the
 displacement which it produced in the interference-bands, gave
 the index of refraction n=0.5.      Since, however, in the determi
nation of the thickness of the metallic plate the specific gravity
 of the silver is assumed to be known, and it may vary, we must
look upon this number as an approximation only.
    However, the method above described does not admit of a
 very accurate determination of the indices of refraction of metals,
 since only very thin films of metal can be employed. This method,
 however, is independent of the presence of holes in the metal;
 for these affect only the distinctness of the interference-bands.
    The displacement of the interference-bands might, however,
 arise from air which is condensed at the surface of the metal
 or the glass. Although a very great absorption of air at the sur
 face of solid bodies must be assumed in order to explain the
 observed displacements of the interference-bands, nevertheless

 174            M. G. Quincke    on the Optical Properties
the author has repeated       the experiments in vacuo. The plate
of glass with the film of   metal, or the free suspended gold-leaf,
 was in these experiments   contained in a brass box which was closed
 in by two plane-parallel    and accurately parallel plates of glass.
By means of a cock the interior of the box, dried by means of bits
of chloride of calcium, was placed in communication with the air
pump and exhausted. After exhaustion, the height of the baro
 meter was 4.5 millims.
    The appearances were the same in the atmosphere and in vacuo.
This, therefore, was the experimental proof that the velocity of
light in the above-named modifications of gold and silver is
greater than in vacuo, whilst in platinum it is less.
   Were the transparent metallic plates inclined towards the trans
mitted rays, and these, therefore, not at perpendicular incidence
to the same, then the conditions of the experiment become very
complex.     For, at the same time, the thickness of the plate
is  augmented,    and thereby the difference of velocity of the rays
passing through metal and air is increased, and the consequent dis
placement of the interference-bands in the spectrum is increased
also; and further, if Cauchy’s theory be true, the index of refrac
tion would increase with an increasing angle of incidence, which
in the case of metals which at perpendicular incidence have an
index of refraction n > 1 would bring about an increase, and in
the case of those which have n < 1 would bring about a decrease
in the displacement of the interference-bands.       Indeed one sees,
                                                   -
from the form of the expression for v (equation 4), that the index
of refraction in the latter metals may become        1, and then, for
the angle of incidence at which this takes place, the displace
ment of the interference-bands must pass into one in the opposite
                                                               -
direction.
    To this must be added the displacement which is due to the
elliptic polarization of the light which passes through metals. For
light which is polarized in the plane of incidence of the metal,
there is produced, according to what has been said before, an
acceleration in relation to the light polarized perpendicular to
the plane of incidence of the metal. The displacement of the
fringes in the instance of metals having an index of refraction
n > 1 will therefore be greater for light polarized perpendicular
to the plane of incidence, than for light polarized parallel to the
 Same.
     Experiment supported this conclusion perfectly when the
 metal plates with the glass which carried them were placed
 obliquely against the incident rays. When the interference
 bands of the spectrum were observed through a Nicol's prism,
 the displacement for light which was polarized parallel or per
 pendicular to the plane of incidence of the transparent plate of

                                      of the Metals.                      175
metal could be determined. It was observed that both in the
case of transparent gold and of transparent silver plates, for
which n-1, the displacement of the interference-bands (in the
sense of retardation of the rays passing through metal), for light
polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence of the metal,
increased with increasing incidence, and under an incidence of
85° amounted to 0-3 of the space between the interference-bands.
For light polarized parallel to the plane of incidence of the metal,
the displacement was 0, or at most 0.1 of the space between the
bands, in the sense of a retardation of the ray passing through
metal.
     Thence it would follow, regard being had to the above, that, for
rays of light passing through metal, the component polarized
parallel to the plane of incidence is accelerated relatively to that
polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence, and that the
acceleration increases with increasing incidence. This agrees
with the above-given experiments upon the elliptical polariza
tion of the light going through metals, the experiments having
been made with Babinet’s compensators.           These experiments
leave it in uncertainty whether the component polarized perpen
 dicular to the plane of incidence is retarded continuously with
 increasing incidence, or whether the component polarized parallel
 to the plane of incidence is continuously accelerated. Now, since
 the greater displacement of the interference-bands for light
 polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence arises from the
 superior thickness of the layer of metal passed through at large
  angles of incidence, it is apparent that the component polarized
 perpendicular to the plane of incidence suffers a smaller altera
  tion of phase on account of simple refraction than the component
 polarized parallel to the plane of incidence, and that this altera
 tion of phase for the last component increases with increasing -
                                    -
  angle of incidence.
      This circumstance admits of the same considerations in the case
 of transmitted or refracted light as in that of reflected light,
 with which the author, in a former communication*, sought to
 estimate the position of the oscillations of the particles of the
 luminiferous aether in relation to the plane of polarization. For
 the oscillations which take place perpendicular to the plane of
 incidence, the position of the paths of the luminiferous particles
 remains the same towards the refracting surface when the angle
 of incidence is altered.     But in the case of the oscillations which

178        Mr. T. Tate              on the Magnitude           of a Drop of Liquid
   Here the near coincidence of the results in the second and
third columns shows that the weight of the drop is in propor-
tion to the diameter of the tube.
   When the diameter of the tube exceeds seven-tenths of an
inch, the continuity of the liquid seems to be broken by the
agitation occasioned by the falling of the drop, and then the
whole volume of the liquid in the tube -falls, but not in the form
of a regular drop.
   The law just enunciated has a remarkable relation to that of
capillarity.   Since the height to which water rises in a tube, by
the action of capillarity, varies inversely as the diameter of the
tube, it follows that the weight of water rising in any tube from
this cause varies directly as the diameter: hence the weight of
the drop is in proportion to the weight of water which would be
raised in that tube by capillary action.
   When the liquid drop is formed upon a flat circular surface,
                                                                                                          in In

   Here the near coincidence of the results in the second and

periment.
  A    circular horizontal surface                    of   indefinite diameter gave              a   drop

                        formed under different circumstances.                                                     179
of water weighing 2*10 grains.     This is therefore the weight of
the maximum drop formed on a flat surface, and it will be seen
that it very nearly coincides with the weight of the drop formed
upon a surface seven-tenths of an inch diameter. The drop in
this case is always formed at the centre of the surface, this being
the centre of the greatest molecular attraction amongst the liquid
particles.
   It will be observed that the drop formed in this manner is
considerably less than that which is formed in the tubes, the
reason of which is too apparent to require any explanation.
   The weight of a drop of liquid, other things being the same, is
diminished                      of temperature. With a tube 3
                    by an augmentation
inch diameter, the weight of a drop of water at 40°F. was found
to be 1.65 grain; whereas at 150° it was found to be only T-45
grain, that           is,

  A long list of such concurrences might be adduced; but my
                                   I
object being brevity, refer to the annexed Map, and invite the
closest and most rigorous comparison of it with the Ordnance
sheets: it is an exact epitome of what will be found there, only
that the faint or obscure inequalities and the conspicuous ones
are necessarily represented by me alike.           The continuation of
the arcs  through    the fens  may   even in that apparently  dead level
be distinctly continued or connected by the true test of the river
beds there.
   Although the valleys of the more eastern part of the area
mapped derive their force mainly from the denudation that has
eroded them, yet it will be found that this denudation has ope
rated according to the direction imparted to it by the configura
                              I
tion of surface that have been describing; and before adverting
to the denudation,                I
                           will therefore advert to the causes that
have  apparently    produced    this configuration.     The aspect pre
sented by both series of circles is such as a pasty or doughy
mass spreading by                 its
                          own weight would take, except that there
the diverging circle would          singular, and not repeated succes
                                               of It be
sively  as    we
               have        it
                        here.       appears      me that we have hereto
the result      of
                 the  yielding       soft strata     the lateral force,   to
caused   by  the protrusion          boss     of                of
                                              matter from beneath the
                                                   a
respective circle-centres.     The annexed hypothetical sections                                of
each series will show      my   meaning.     The lateral force exerted
would    be  proportional                to
                                the amount         strata elevated andof
thrown over.       Upwards        4000 feet   of strata have been eleof
vated over the Isle      Wight centre; but the greater part
                              of                                    that                  of
has resulted from the subsequent and rectilinear movements
there thatI   shall presently notice. On the other hand, we can
not accurately estimate the amount over the Kentish centre:
assuming, however, that the whole thickness             the Eocene pre          of
sent on the Essex side of the Thames was once recumbent
over this centre        elevation, the thickness
                              of                           the displaced         of
strata will not   greatly  exceed 1000 feet above the sea-level.
The lateral pressure thus exerted may               illustrated       the  be             by
rumpling         up   of
                     table-cloth.

commences; and that process               repeated         each wrinkle
                                                           is                    as

speedily     the more distant wrinkles appear.          Supposing that
pressure     radiate from      centre, the wrinkles would emerge

Inasmuch as the lateral displacement should be greatest in the
case of the uppermost beds, from the greater length of the exte
rior curves over a dome of elevation to those more interior, as
shown by Mr. Hopkins in the case of the Weald, the greatest
results would be looked for where the uppermost beds were pre
sent.   But against that we have the greater mobility of the
soft sandy Eocene strata over the more rigid chalk; so that the
latter, with a less displacement than the former, might produce
at greater distances equal or even greater flexures than the latter.
The same observation applies equally to the varying rigidity of
the lower cretaceous and oolitic beds.     We have a concurrence
of evidence to show that these movements took place when the
sea of the upper drift covered the island; and it would be a
subject of much interest to discuss how far the influence of a
superincumbent sea would conduce to an increase in the pasty
or pliable condition of the strata beneath     did space permit me               it,

if the  impervious   clays  did not   completely      overlap  the sandy
beds, the pressure                   of
                        the water must reduce the         porous  beds                                           of

  can be shown, and it there exists; and so far as I have been
  able to test the inland hills, the same thing exists there also
  invariably.      Along the Suffolk and Norfolk coast short faults
  and the broken condition of the strata attest the pressure pro
  duced by the North Sea circles opposing those of the Isle of
  Wight; and inland similar faults and breaks frequently occur.
     The operation of the denudation has been to deepen greatly
 all  the synclinals, leaving the crests                   of
                                                      the anticlinals         some           in

                                     in         strata),  where the drift clay
  remains      onthem, almost     intact;   and       others (and most parti
                                                           in

  the rest of the anticlinal but little denuded. That would be the
  result ofa    sea bed, wrinkled           have described, emerging from
                                           as  I
  the sea.    The crests     ofthe   anticlinals,   once clear         the water,  of
  would   be  safe from    denudation;      but that action would continue
         synclinals    until the land was altogether free
Itin the                                                              the waters.  of
     should also follow from this that the denudation has been
 greatest where the troughs have been deepest; and                       we omit    if
  the immediate centres          ofthe circle, where the denudation has
  been greatest, from the greater fracturing, and omit the actual
 Walley   of  the Weald, which with the southern edge                  the isles   of               of
 Purbeck and Portland and           Wight    has  undergone       separate    aand
 local upheaval and denudation, subsequent,                         as

 now considered, we shall find that the denudation has followed
 that law. The greatest inequalities have (taking equal distances
 from the centres) been produced where the two series                      circles       of
 have come into direct      conflict,  and the least where the     angles    made
 with each other are greatest; and comparing soft beds with soft
 beds and hard with hard, the amount                   denudation has coin

186          Mr. S. W. Wood     on the Formation     of the River
    The presence of arcs of the Kentish circles, almost uncon
torted, among the Isle of Wight arcs near to their centre in
Hampshire, and occupying their normal position, while the Isle
of Wight arcs in Essex and the rest of East Anglia, bearing the
same relative position to those of the Kentish series, are warped
into a double flexure, would appear inconsistent.              I, however,
entertain no doubt that a third series of circles has emerged
from a centre in the North Sea, about 70 miles east of Flam
borough Head, and that it is to them that the hills of North-east
Lincolnshire are due, as well as those ranging from Lincoln past
Grantham to Stamford.          The pressure from these circles opera
ting almost, but not quite, opposite to those of the Isle of Wight
series has caused the double flewure possessed by the third or           in
vading group of inequalities.         The conflict of this third series
with that of the Isle of Wight has also produced the confused
condition of the Norfolk valleys; but the most remarkable result
of that conflict is the contorted and intermingled condition of
the cliffs of North-east Norfolk, which occurs most at the point
where the arcs are directly opposite to each other (i.e. between
Cromer and Sherringham), disappearing as the angle made by
the arcs crossing each other increases.          The same cause has also
produced the forcing up of the chalk inliers of Sudbury and
Claydon in Suffolk.        In the absence, however, of the same satis
factory means of tracing from their centre this third series of
                                                            I
circles that exists in the case of the other two, have for the
present left such of the arcs belonging to them as do not oppose
those of the Isle of Wight series, shaded in the Map as though
belonging to the Kentish series; and such as do oppose and
form a compound or double flexure, shaded as though belonging
wholly, instead of (as they really are) in part only, to the Isle of
Wight series*.
    The influence of these circles upon the Valley of the Weald
demands a special though brief notice.            It will be seen that the
openings in both the North and South Downs, that were regarded
by Mr. Hopkins as the result of fissures caused by the doming
of the strata along the rectilinear elevation of the axis of the
Weald Walley, do not occupy the position that on such an hypo
 thesis they should do; instead of being rectilinear, as fissures so
 caused should be, they are curvilinear.          They, it will be found,
 form, as to some of them, regular and corresponding fragments of
    * It would be more correct to describe these invading inequalities as the
 result of the squeezing together of the strata by the North Sea circles op
 posing those of the Isle of Wight, than, as is done in the text, to describe
 them as belonging to the latter series. The North-east Lincolnshire hills
 are inaccurately represented in the annexed Map; their direction should
 be concave towards the sea, instead of the reverse.

                     and other Valleys      of the East of England.                        187
arcs of the Kentish series, with precisely the curvature that their
position in those circles should present; and as to others, they
are similarly exact portions of the arcs of the Isle of Wight
circles. A close examination of the common Ordnance sheets will
disclose these features more decidedly than on the small scale of
the annexed Map it is possible to distinguish them.               Further, .
these sheets will show other         fragments   of these arcs over the
centre of the Weald Walley, preserving their distinct character
through the enormous denudation to which that valley has been
exposed; and            I
                     invite this close examination by the light of the
annexed Map as a guide.
    It appears to me, from the evidence of the great denudation in
the Weald Walley (which has, with these fragmentary exceptions,
destroyed the plications of the circles crossing that valley) having
accompanied the rectilinear upheaval which is independent of the
curvilinear plications that I have been describing, that such rec
tilinear upheaval was of subsequent date to the operations have                        I
been discussing.        The operation of that local denudation has
been to denude and extensively remove the arcs crossing the
 valley, and to deepen into their present state the gorges through
which the rivers of the Weald escape to the sea; and it has
therefore been undoubtedly posterior to the formation of those
 arcs. And as the rectilinear elevation has, as it would seem,
 been contemporaneous with that local denudation,              cannot but    I
 regard the denudation which has given                        its

   To prevent misconception, would also observe that the same
rectilinear movements which in the Weald Walley supervened on
the circular divergences described, appear to me to have also su
pervened on the same divergences in the south of Hampshire and
Dorsetshire, by which much of the elevation there appearing at
first sight as due to the focus of the Isle of Wight circles has
been added to the elevation that introduced these circular phe
momena, and that it is by a combination of the two that the
present highly inclined condition of the central line of that isle,
and the consequent enormous denudation over that line, have
resulted.         I

 sions, pretty nearly in the condition that their respective seas
had left them,-the only exception, and that of a very moderate

by Mr. Prestwich.
                      I
    In concluding, wish to withdraw an opinion expressed by
 me in a paper published in the Philosophical Magazine for
April 1863, that the departure of the Wealden Valley between
 Maidstone and Dover from the linear east and west direction was
 due to the influence of a production of the palaeozoic barrier of
 the Pas de Calais beneath that part of Kent. It is evident,
from the views put forward in this paper, that such an opinion
 is no longer tenable by me. At the same time that I adhere
fully to the other views there expressed as to the direction of the
 extension of that barrier,  I  can no longer attribute that depar
ture to  any   other than the causes shown in the Map, that is to
 say, to the rectilinear upheavals of the South of England having
never reached in Kent further east than the verge of the innermost
 Kentish circle—a part of whose periphery forms the Dover extre
mity of the Downs between that place and Maidstone, while
the other, or Maidstone extremity, is formed of a powerful
example of the series of inequalities of the third group, caused
by the invasion of the Isle of Wight circles into those of
Kent.
    I have little doubt, from the investigation that      I have already
been able to give to the subject, that the river- and other val
leys of the secondary and tertiary basins of Northern France
and of Belgium have been formed by the action of that portion
of the arcs of the two series of circles which are (after allowing
for the hiatus of the British Channel) complementary to those
delineated in the coloured Map.          I have not, however, yet had
the time to    perfect  my  evidence    sufficiently to embody it in a
satisfactory form.
    P.S. Since the   above went to press, the Map of the Geological
Survey for the north-west side of the Weald has appeared.               It
shows the Isle of    Wight  arc made     by  Chobham    ridges distinctly
formed by the upper Bagshot brought out by denudation, pre
cisely as I have by survey myself ascertained to be the case in
the Kentish arcs in Eastern Essex, where the lower Bagshot is
brought out over the London Clay by denudation. The Kentish
arc running through Leith Hill and directly opposing Chobham
ridge, is also brought out by the lower tertiary outliers upon the
chalk that follow the curve. The continuation of the Kentish
arc across the Weald is also to be followed by a ridge of Paludina
limestone in the Weald clay.        I look with interest to the future

  three such centres between the Sun and Mercury, at distances
 originally Tºth,     ºths, and ºths of that of Mercury. But of
 these, according to Mr. Drach's calculation, the two first must
 have been swallowed up by the Sun; so that we can expect to
 find one only, namely the third, which, though originally within
 the limit, would have been driven beyond it by the great expan
 sive force arising from the heat generated in the later stages of
 the process of condensation. It is interesting that M. Leverrier
 should have recently expressed the belief that such a planet
 exists, and has been observed,     between  Mercury and the Sun.

       SIR,                                           (Würtemberg).
 Yolº        book has awakened my interest for that wonderful
         body ice; and     I have devoted the recent cold weather to
 a more accurate determination of its coefficient of refraction for
 ordinary and for extraordinary light, as well as to the observa
tion and measurement of the coloured rings of polarized light.
 In particular your interesting observation upon the layer of snow
which sank away from the roof of the greenhouse and curved
itself below (page 202), led me to make a direct experiment upon
 the deformation of ice—an experiment which answered perfectly,
and a description of which will perhaps be more interesting to
you than to anyone else.                            -
    A  plate of clean  ice,  A about 100
                               B,
millims. in length, 12 to 15 millims. in
breadth, 3 to 4 millims. in thickness,
prepared by sawing and subsequent
rubbing with a warm metal plate, is
laid in the loops SS of a cotton or
silken string which pass above over
two pegs, N, N'; a third loop, T, carries
a weight of about 200 grms. The
temperature of the circumambient space
should not much exceed 4° to 6°C.
After the lapse of 20 to 30 minutes
a bending may be plainly seen, which
is at first regular, but afterwards greater in the middle, in
consequence of the middle string be
coming imbedded in the ice, and of the
diameter of the plate being diminished.

determine the constants of elasticity and rigidity (Festigkeit)
for ice. Putting 2P for the greatest weight in the middle, 21
for the length SS, b for the (horizontal) breadth, h for the
(vertical) thickness of the plate of ice, A for the greatest tension
in the outermost layer, we have

h = 3 millims.; 21 = 100 millims. ; P = 107 grims. ; 2P = 214
grims.          If
             about 300 grms. be suspended from the middle, the
plate would therefore soon bend, owing to the melting away
consequent upon that degree of pressure.            believe that this            I
experiment could be carried out in summer.

in a paper of mine of the same date).
    For the purposes of the present paper, it is unnecessary to
 state the second law of the mechanical action of heat in its most
 abstract form.    It will be sufficient to state the form which it
takes when applied to a perfect thermo-dynamic engine: viz.-

absolute temperature and rejecting heat at a lower absolute tempe

reprecipitated by potash, and thus separated from every metal
except iron.     By boiling the acid solution after saturation with
acetate of soda the iron is precipitated, and the filtrate contains
much of the indium, but a still larger quantity is carried down
with the oxide of iron.
   The best separation was effected by precipitating the iron
carefully by bicarbonate of sodium.      If there is a large excess of
iron  present,  it is best to precipitate  this metal at first incom
pletely, to filter, and then to complete the precipitation of the
iron in the filtrate by a gradual addition of a very dilute solu
tion of the bicarbonate. On boiling the filtrate and addition of
a little more sodium-salt, the indium is precipitated as hydrate or
carbonate.
   The solution of the chloride of indium produced with ferro
cyanide of potassium a white precipitate, tinged slightly blue by
a trace of iron.
   Ferricyanide of potassium gives no precipitate. Sulphocyanide
of potassium produces a pale red coloration due to a trace of iron.
   As the oxide possesses many properties in common with alu
mina (from which, however, it is distinguished by      insolubility its
in potash, and       its
                     reducibility before the blowpipe),          well it     is         to
mention that when heated on charcoal and moistened with
cobalt solution     does not yield

               their elastic force, issue directly forwards from the
points, and endeavour          expand themselves, but meeting with
                                            to
some resistance from the     air,  force the wire      move backwards             to
ina    contrary direction—much         the same manner that Catha
                                                        in                                         a

    Soon after this experiment was made known, Mr. Kinnersley*
repeated    itwith negative electricity, “expecting the needle                                                 to
 turn the   contrary  way, but was extremely disappointed, for                                                 it
 still went the same way          before.”     He then endeavours
                                                 as                                                            to
 account for the fact      the following manner. He says, “When

               the other side. When electrified negatively,                                                  I

   Kinnersley attempts         justify this view
                                            to          the following                  by

   Mr. C. Tomlinson's Eaperiments                          on the Electrical             Fly.              207
causes the movement by a true recoil, analogous to that produced
by liquids or gases upon reacting machines during their escape.”
- Pouillet.* refers the motion to a recoil exactly similar to that
produced in the hydraulic tourniquet.                              -  - -
   Ganott denies the truth of this            statement,   and falls back
upon the explanation given by the electricians of the last cen
tury.     “This motion,” he says, “is not an effect of reaction
comparable to that of the hydraulic tourniquet, as many physi
cists suppose, but it is an effect of repulsion between the electricity
of the points and that which they communicate to the air. The
electric fluid, accumulating towards the point, escapes into the
air, which thus becomes charged with the same electricity as that
of the points; it thus repels the points, and is at the same time
repelled by them.       It is admitted that the tourniquet does not
rotate in vacuum and if we approach the hand near it whilst it
                      ;
is turning in air, a slight wind will be felt, occasioned by the
                                                                             -
displacement of the electrified air.”
    Eisenlohri also refers the motion to the repulsion occasioned
by the electrization of similar particles.                       -
    In the   foregoing   statements we have no less than five theories
to explain the action of the electrical fly.           First, there is what
may be called the recoil theory, advocated by Hamilton, Priestley,
the Encyclopædia Metropolitana, Despretz, Lardner, Pouillet, and
 Harris. Secondly, the attraction theory, advocated by Kinners
ley.     Thirdly, the expansion theory, advocated by Beccaria.
 Fourthly, the repulsion theory, advanced by Cavallo, Cuthbert
 son, Riess, Ganot, and Eisenlohr.               Fifthly, the atmospherie
pressure theory of Biot, Roget, Becquerel, and De la Rive. .
    Among these five sets of theories, the repulsion theory seems
 to me best adapted to represent the truth; but there are so
 many interesting points of electrical science involved in the
 behaviour of the            fly
                           under various circumstances, that          seems                  it

          the action, if I read him correctly, appeared to be this:—When a
          metal point projects from an insulated charged conductor, the
          particles of air at and about the point become more highly polar
          ized than at the parts of the conductor where the lines of induc
          tive force cannot so readily accumulate.       The particle of    next                                                 air
          the last particle      metal      the point thus becomes

          similarly electrified     the point,    repelled and acts inductively

          second   particle, taking  the  place    the first,  becomes    highly    of                                      so

   When the wires of the universal discharger were not more
than 2 inches apart in turpentine, the effects were very ener
getic. A point held over the vessel at the distance of some feet
produced a regular upward rain of turpentine; and even when
the machine was turned slowly, the turpentine played and
discharged upon the point as we must suppose air to do. A
knob held over the vessel produced a complete waterspout; and
many seconds after the machine had ceased to be worked the tur
pentine retained    charge,       its
                               was evident    the pit produced

 zations from alcohol, yielded long prismatic crystals, colourless
 and transparent, but presenting a silky lustre when dried and
 matted together: they were perfectly soluble in alcohol, and
 contained no adherent sulphate of potassium, for they yielded no
 precipitate with chloride of barium until after their ignition.
 With this substance the experiments subsequently to be men
 tioned were made.
     It could scarcely be doubted that the body originated with
 the alcoholic solution of potash; yet in order to avoid the chance
 of error having crept in by means of the complication with the
 wax-alcohol, or the ethylic alcohol with which        sulphuric solu    its

 in which the carbon is to the hydrogen in the ratio of 2 : 522;
 and thus, notwithstanding the discrepancy in the carbon, I can
 not but think that the substance is an isomer of sulphethylate of
 potassium.    It is not ordinary sulphethylate, nor is it isethionate.
‘Several circumstances in the foregoing account correspond with
 the behaviour of neither of these salts; and it is especially distinct
 from either in fusing at 188°to 190°C., the sulphethylate*begin
 ning to melt at 100°, the isethionate not fusingt until between
 300° and 350° C. Although therefore I cannot yet consider                                                               its

Researches on the Solar Spectrum and the Spectra of the Chemical
   Elements.     By G. KIRchhoff.-Second Part. Translated by H.
   E. Roscoe, F.R.S., &c. Macmillan and Co., 1863.
 IN survey
      this second paper we have the completion of Prof. Kirchhoff's
              of the solar spectrum, furnishing us with maps and cata
logues  of the lines in the extreme parts of the spectrum from A to
D, and from near F to G. We have before had the pleasure of
noticing the first memoir treating of the intermediate region of the
spectrum.     In his extended survey, indeed, Kirchhoff was obliged
to commit the practical observation to his pupil Mr. G. Hofmann, his
own eyesight having been unfortunately weakened by constant appli
cation to the spectroscope.      But the method of observation      is the
same as before.
   We may again point out that these maps are indispensable to any
observer of the spectrum.       There are great numbers of scientific
men now independently engaged upon the subject, and there will be
vast confusion and loss of labour unless all observations be referred
to one uniform scale or ground-plan, such as it seems to be the
chief purpose of these maps to afford. Though the wave-length is
the ultimate criterion of position of a spectral line, the variation of
refracting power deprives us of any natural scale of practical refer
ence.    Kirchhoff's arbitrary scale should then be adopted by general
consent, both in deference to him, and in order to avoid the confu
sion of nomenclature or notation in which this rising and beautiful
science will otherwise be involved.
   From the text we learn that the evidence for the existence of
potassium in the sun’s atmosphere has broken down under closer
examination, but that additional evidence has been obtained of the
existence of iron, nickel, barium, copper, zinc, strontium, cadmium,
&c. No additional elements have been found in the sun.

THE“On       Ozone.” By E. J. Lowe, Esq., F.R.A.S.,          F.L.S.
   This paper consists of two parts,    viz.:-
   1. On the precautions necessary in ozone observations, and on cer
tain corrections requisite before the actual amount can be determined.
   2. The discovery of dry ozone powders as a substitute for the ordi
nary tests; an investigation into the ozone paper tests of M. Schön
bein and Dr. Moffat, the determination of a proper formula for the
tests, with an account of various observations and experiments made
on the subject.

 the precautions and corrections requisite in order that a more perfect
 knowledge of ozone might be obtained. These precautions comprise
 uniformity of observation, each observer using the same box and the
 same tests, suspended at the same height, and as nearly as possible
 placed under the same circumstances.       The corrections necessary
 are:—1st, For the velocity of the air; 2nd, for the height of the
 barometer; 3rd, for temperature; 4th, for the hygrometrical state
 of the air; 5th, for elevation above the ground.
    1. Velocity of the Air.—The greater the speed the more ozone
 will be apparent, and this seems to be owing more to the increased

S.W. winds than with N.E. winds.
     3.Temperature.—Temperatures        between 30° and 40° will give
less ozone than when between 40° and 50°, and the latter less than
when between 50° and 60°. The same holds good when the ozone
box   isartificially warmed. This does not extend        very high tem                           to

  2. Direction              of   the Wind.—There                   is most ozone with the wind
between S. and   S.W., and least when between N. and N.E.
  3. Protection of the test from light.—It is absolutely requisite
that the test should be in a dark box; and no box has been found
to answer so well as that constructed by myself, and known as
 “Lowe’s Ozone box,” an account of which has been furnished to the
 Royal Society” and to the British Association. This box, if freely
exposed, and made to veer with the wind, so as always to present the
opening to the direct current, is everything that could be desired.
    The foregoing observations will be sufficient to show that precau
tions are requisite in these records, and that certain corrections are
necessary before we can declare whether ozone is present in a certain
fixed amount, or whether it changes from hour to hour. These correc
tions have yet to be found out; those for the height of the barometer
and the force and direction                   of the wind will be considerable.

   The ozone tests heretofore used have appeared to me to be un
satisfactory, and, on close examination,                           I
                                           found them to be faulty in
many respects. The paper used had a glaze upon             which pre                           it,
vented the solution from penetrating it; substances, moreover, had

therefore made starch from rice, potato, sago, and wheat.

     With regard to the calico or paper used for the tests, both stained
  when impure.         However, Mr. Joseph Sidebotham of the Strine
  Works    prepared                                             I
                      for me some chemically pure calico, and was also
  enabled to    procure   a very porous chemically pure paper, both of
  which answer    perfectly.
     Having succeeded with the ozone slip tests, I tried as a first ex
  periment a mixture of 10 parts of starch to 1 of iodide of potassium
  as a “dry-powder test;” this, when well mixed in a mortar, was
  bottled ready for use. A small portion was placed in the open air,
  and ten minutes' exposure showed that powder tests were an un
  doubted success, being more sensitive than the test slips.      My next
  determination was what      strength would colour quickest, and accord
 ingly a number of strengths were prepared, varying in the propor
 tions from 1 of iodide of potassium and 1 of starch up to l of iodide
  of potassium and 30 of starch, the starch used being made from
 wheat.      From these experiments it was found that the proportion of
  1 of iodide of potassium to 5 of starch was invariably the darkest,
 the degree of darkness diminishing in either direction when other
 strengths were used; thus 1 of iodide of potassium to 44 of starch,
 or 1 to 5}, were neither so dark as with a strength of 1 to 5.
     On repeating these experiments with potato-starch, the pro
 portion that coloured soonest was 1 to 2% ; and this second series
 of experiments proved that with each starch a special formula is
 requisite.
     My next experiments were with the view of ascertaining the effect
 of various acids and chemical substances on the ozone powder tests.
                     I
 For this purpose procured a number of cups for solutions, and small
 pill-boxes to hold the powder tests, and these were placed together
 under separate bell-glasses.        The result was that the following
 coloured the powder tests very rapidly:-Hydrochloric acid, nitric
 acid, nitrous acid, chloride of lime, phosphorus, iodine (in scales),
iodine (dissolved in alcohol), carbonate of iron on which sulphuric
acid was poured, carbonate of iron on which glacial acetic acid was
poured, limestone on which sulphuric acid was poured, limestone on
which glacial acetic acid was poured, matches lighted under the
bell-glasses.    The following did not colour the tests:–Sulphuric
acid, glacial acetic acid, carbonate of lime, carbonate of iron, am
monia, matches not lighted.
    The substances used in the manufacture of ordinary starch of com
merce gave the following:—
    Chloride of lime coloured the tests instantaneously.
    Sulphuric acid did not colour the tests.
    Lime did not colour the tests.
    Lime and sulphuric acid mixed eoloured the tests rapidly.

      There are advantages in the powders over the ordinary tests. They
  are more sensitive, and therefore more rapidly acted upon ; they re
  tain their maximum colour, not afterwards fading, as with the tests
  of Schönbein and Moffat. (However, my calico and porous-paper
  tests are not nearly so liable to fade, owing to the solution penetra
  ting into the fabric used, instead of being merely a surface-covering.)
  There is also a more important advantage still to be mentioned from
  the use of powders.      By the aid of powder tests we shall ascertain
  what colours the tests; in the experiments it was found that a dif.
  ferent colour was imparted to the powder, and that the colour pene
  trated deeper with some substances and acids than with others, so
  that differences of effect took place, from which the different mate
 rials used might be recognized.      Thus:–
      1. Iodine, although coloured a brown-black, was merely a surface
 colouring, below the powder remained colourless.
     2. Phosphorus, bluish black on the surface     º
                                                      only, below almost
  colourless.
     3. Chloride of lime, deep brown on the surface only, the powder
 below slightly yellow.
                                                   -                       .
     4.  Hydrochloric   acid, grey-pink  on the surface only,   the powder
 beneath orange.                            -
     5. Nitric acid, dark-red brown extending slightly into the powder,
 beneath that colourless.
     6. Carbonate of iron with glacial acetic acid, yellowish brown to
 the thickness of cardboard, below that buff.
     7. Limestone with sulphuric acid, pale brown to the thickness of
 cardboard, beneath slightly coloured.
     8. Carbonate of iron with sulphuric acid, black to the depth of a
 quarter of an inch.
     9. Nitrous acid, dark brown more than the eighth of an inch
 deep, beneath yellowish brown.
     10. Nitric acid mixed with exposed ozone powder, blue-black to
 the sixth of an inch deep, below that reddish brown.
     11. Nitric acid mixed with unexposed ozone powder, blue-black
 to the sixth of an inch deep, below that reddish brown.
     These experiments may require some modification, yet they point
out the fact that striking differences are apparent, differences which
must open up a new method of investigating ozone.                            -
     Not only have the tests hitherto used been made without due re
gard to the pureness of the chemicals and fitness of the material
used, but the paper box in which they have been kept is not sufficient
for their perfect preservation; a dark, dry, air-tight box is essential;
and this should not be opened in a room where there is iodine,
chlorine, nitric acid, phosphorus, hydrochloric acid, or other che
micals likely to be injurious to the tests.   I am now manufacturing the
tests, which will be distributed by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra, and
I   have constructed a proper box in which in future they will be sent.

   “On the Diurnal Inequalities of Terrestrial Magnetism,  as deduced
 from observations made at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from
 1841 to 1857.”    By George Biddell Airy, F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.
    The author describes this paper as one of the class which gives
 the epitomized results of long series of voluminous observations and
laborious calculations, of which the fundamental details have been
printed in works specially devoted to these subjects. It exhibits in
curves the diurnal inequalities of terrestrial magnetism, as obtained
by the use of instruments essentially the same, through the whole
period of seventeen years, during the last ten years of which the
magnetic indications have been automatically recorded by photogra
phic self-registration, on a system which has been continued to the
present time, and is still to be continued.
    From the last months of 1840 to the end of 1847, the observations
were made by eye, every two hours.       From the beginning of 1848,
for the declination and horizontal force magnetometers, and from
the beginning of 1849, for the vertical force magnetometer, the mag
netic indications are recorded by Mr. Brooke's photographic appa
ratus.
    In preparing the reductions of the magnetic records from 1848 to
1857 (which are printed in the “Results of Magnetical and Meteoro
logical Observations for 1859,” bound in the volume of ‘Greenwich
Observations,’ 1859, and also issued separately), the days of unusual
magnetic disturbance had been separated from the rest, and the re
ductions applied to the mass so diminished.      For unity of plan, it
appeared expedient to follow the same course for the reductions from
1841 to 1847.     In consequence of this, the numbers which are used
here differ in some cases by small quantities from those printed in
the “Greenwich Magnetical Observations from 1841 to 1847.        The
numbers in the reductions from 1848 to 1857 are adopted without
change.
  #.    author remarks that, taking the number of omitted days as a
rough measure of the amount of magnetic disturbance, there is no
appearance of decennial cycle in their recurrence, and no distinct re
lation to the magnitude of diurnal changes.
   The author then proceeds to the description of the curves. The
first four sheets contain the curves in which the horizontal abscissa
represents the declination at each hour as compared with the mean
for the twenty-four hours, and the vertical ordinate represents the
horizontal force at each hour as compared with the mean for the
twenty-four hours.    On the different sheets the days are differently
grouped, thus:—On sheet I.      allthe observations  at each nominal
hour throughout the year are combined; this sheet contains the
separate curves for 1841, 1842, 1843, 1844, 1845, 1846, 1847. On
sheet II. similar curves are formed for 1848, 1849, 1850, 1851,
1852, 1853, 1854, 1855, 1856, 1857. On sheet       III. all the obser
vations at each nominal hour through    allthe months January from
1841  to 1847 are combined    to form the January curve; all those

through the months February to form the February curve, and so
on.   On sheet IV. similar month-curves are formed from the period
1848 to 1857.    It is remarked that the origin of coordinates neces
sarily represents the mean declination and mean horizontal force in
each month.
   The author then points out that the means for each month are
themselves subject to an annual inequality, which can be ascertained
with little difficulty. The values of these inequalities are exhibited,
for declination and horizontal force, separately for the period 1841–
1847 and for the period 1848–1857; those in the first period far
exceed in magnitude those in the second (as holds also with regard
to
  If all
       the diurnal inequalities).

other advantage       gained by this step.

come upon the earth, particularly affecting terrestrial magnetism.
On comparing these year-curves with the month-curves, especially
with those for the period 1848–1857,           appears that the change it                                      of
the year-curves from 1848            1857 nearly resembles that                                          of

Mr. Waterston.
  My apparatus consists                of
                                 metallic reservoir formed

 perpendicularly, a thermometer with a blackened tube is introduced,
 on which strike the solar rays directed on the axis of the cylinder.
 A thick glass closes the posterior opening of the cylindrical tube, the
 other remaining free; but with a diaphragm of suitable aperture the
 entire apparatus is protected from solar radiation.     The entire appa
 ratus is mounted on a parallactic foot provided with very regular
 movements.       For the other details, and for the mode of using this
 instrument, the Bulletin de l'Observatoire du Collège Romain, vol. xi.
 p. 14, may be referred to.      I may simply mention that the thermo -
 meter-scales are divided into fifths of a degree.
   By means of this arrangement there are eliminated (1) the agitation
 of the air, and (2) the radiation of surrounding objects, the influence
 and force of which may always be known, and varied at pleasure by
 changing the temperature of the water of the envelope. There only
 remains the radiation of the sun, and that of the portion of the hea
 vens visible from the place of the thermometer, and which can be
 diminished at will by placing in front of the instrument a diaphragm
 scarcely larger than the bulb of the thermometer.        As regards the
 influence of the absolute     temperature   of the  envelope,  it is well
 known by Mr. Waterston’s observations that it has no influence on
 the increase of temperature which solar radiation produces on the
 blackened thermometer; and I have assured myself, by varying the
 temperature of the water between 7 and 70 degrees, that when the
 temperature of the two thermometers is stationary, their difference
 remains constant whatever their absolute value; so that this differ
 ence (at least within certain limits) does not depend on the tempera
 ture of the envelope. This at first sight appears very singular; for
it is curious to see that if the black thermometer rises to 19°6 when
 the water is at 7°, when the temperature of the latter is at 70° the
black thermometer rises to 82° in the sun, the difference always
remaining 12 degrees. The practical difficulty of verifying these
facts depends on the rapidity of variation which the thermometer
placed in water undergoes for high temperatures; but there is an
indirect verification in the fact that, after a certain limit, both ther
mometers rise together, their difference always remaining con
stant.
    With this apparatus I made     a great number of observations during
summer, and     I  have repeated them in the present season in the per
fectly bright days from the 22nd of November to the 8th of Decem
ber, exposing the apparatus to the solar radiation under the dome of
the observatory until the relative temperature was constant for a
considerable time. The following are the principal conclusions at
which I have arrived.
    1. During summer, observing near the meridian and near the sol
stice, the relative temperature has varied from 14 to 11 degrees; the
mean of several observations gives 12°06.
    2. Continuous observations during the month of August give
values from 13 to 11 degrees. Their mean is still 12 degrees.
    3. Those of November and December give 12°5 and 11°5, and
the mean has not appreciably changed.

      4. Observing in summer near the horizon, at an elevation of 30
to 34 degrees, the temperature rises merely to 6°5.
   5. The rapidity with which the blackened thermometer mounts
is scarcely different in summer and winter up to 10 or 11 degrees;
but after this limit the maximum is sooner obtained in summer than
in winter.
    The results obtained in the latter season were quite unexpected;
for I believed I should have in winter, observing with a sun's height
of about 28 degrees, a temperature at most equal to what I had in
summer at 32 degrees of elevation, for the atmospheric height was
almost the same; but it was not so. In the meridian, I obtained
almost the same value as in summer, although the rays traversed
double the thickness of atmosphere, while this double thickness in
summer diminishes the force of radiation and reduces it to the half.
    These phenomena would be inexplicable if the absorbing power of
aqueous vapour were not known”.           In fact, if we compare observa
tions made at the same height in summer and in winter, we find the
radiation of summer one-half, even though the atmospheric thickness
is the same; but aqueous vapour, which in summer in our climate
has a tension of 13 to 14 millims., in winter has only 7 to 8. It is
difficult to estimate the absolute quantity of vapour which exists in
the path of the rays, for the psychrometer only gives the quantity
near the ground, which differs materially from that above. Moreover,
the level of vapour is in summer much higher than in winter. Yet
it would not be far from the truth to admit that in summer there is
at least double as much as in winter. Thus we find that with an
equal height the radiation is reduced to one-half in summer, as the
quantity of vapour requires.                                                 -
    Two interesting conclusions follow from these facts:—(1) That in
summer the radiation in the meridian is greatly enfeebled by aqueous
vapour, so that without it we should have double the radiation                                                      (it
would           be

                                       to
in is be
     well worth the trouble). (2) That the absorbing force            vapour
    very great; for we see that quantity                                                               in of

    Since the metals of which the thermo-piles are usually con
structed possess, from their crystalline structure, a kind of porous
nature, it was conceivable that it was in consequence of this that
the pile exhibited the phenomena in question.           But when thin
platinum-foil was laid upon the pile and alternately a current of
dry and of moist air directed against          the same depression and  it,

soon became apparent that other metals, when they were sub
stituted for platinum, occasioned          similar elevation a    tempe                                 of

the temperature of the pile and of the air was the same.                 This
experiment was therefore always available to ascertain whether
this equality of temperature was present or not. If the air of
the room, previously very far off saturation, were then saturated
with moisture, so great an elevation of temperature resulted, that
(the pile not being covered with a plate) the deflection of the mirror
could no longer be observed, since the image of the scale vanished
out of the field of the telescope.        To an equal extent, but in an
opposite direction, the deflection took place when the air of the
room, previously moist, was dried and then admitted to the pile.
   When the pile was shielded by a plate, the deflection of the
galvanometer was less; and on employing different plates, the
deflection was of various extent, according to the nature of the
plates, their thickness, and their extent.          But it was visible with
all the  plates which could

from the circumstance that these substances condense aqueous
vapours in far larger quantity than the surface of the pile, and
that they therefore become more heated or more cooled than that;
and hence their action on the pile is as great—or, according to
their thickness, greater than the direct action of the vapours
when they are immediately absorbed by the pile.
   The thickness of the plates must not exceed a certain measure
if the alteration of temperature is to be appreciable; but expe
riments establish the conclusion, that                              all
                                             substances, however dif.

  A   plate of copper l'5 millim. in thickness was first used.
Immediately on lighting the candle, after the lapse of an interval
of time which was hardly measurable, the deflection began.
Whereupon many such plates were employed, being placed one
close to the other up to eight, and which together formed a layer of
12 millims.inthickness. The deflection began in about one minute.
After ten minutes the light was extinguished. At this time the
deflection amounted to from 150 to 200 divisions of the scale.
Thereupon this increased still during the following ten minutes
from 100 to 200 divisions further, and then began to decline.
When afterwards the plates, separated from one another, were
disposed as is figured (fig. 4), whereby their distances from
middle to middle of the plate amounted to 15 millims., and the
light stood at 25 millims. from the outermost plate, then the de
flection commenced in little more than one minute after lighting
the candle.     Yet in this instance, after the lapse of ten minutes
after  extinguishing  the candle, it amounted to 40 or 50 divisions
of the scale. After this it increased gradually for half an hour,
until it reached about 30 divisions more.
   Plates of wood behaved just like the copper plates.     On taking
a board of beechwood of 27 millims. in      thickness, the deflection
of the galvanometer began in two minutes after the lighting of
 the candle.    In nine minutes it amounted to 750 divisions of the
scale.   On putting out the light, the deflection increased yet
during the next three minutes about 40 divisions, and then
became so great that the scale did not admit of further observa
tion of it. After an hour the deflection was still 200 divisions.
   Even through a beechen board of 65 millims. in thickness the
propagation of heat was still very plainly to be made out. The
deflection began eight minutes after lighting the candle, and
attained in ten minutes after the light had been extinguished 28
divisions on the scale, and still continued to increase until,
after the lapse of half an hour, it had attained to 290 divisions.
    Not alone with the thermo-pile, but also with the above
 described air-thermometer could the passage of heat through
 many plates be perceived.   In a          large box of pasteboard there
 was a partition with an opening             in  it,
                                                   and before the opening
 two very thin plates  of                                                        of

 15 millims. from one another.             On one side       the same the
 light was fastened  at
                     a  distance          of   60
                                       millims. from the nearest
 plate.   On the other was placed the air-thermometer,    which          of
 the blackened bulb was       as
                              near    possible

 scope.   Shortly after lighting the candle the blackened bulb
 began   torise intemperature, whereby       alterationan about         of       4

millims. in the level of the liquid was occasioned.    It results
from this, that the double shades of Melloni, which are so much
used, afford a sufficient protection only at low temperatures, such
as occur in the common thermo-electrical experiments; for if
in such experiments the source of heat has sometimes a tolerably
high temperature, still it operates from so great a distance that
the heat which passes from it to the shade is always minute.
   In the analytical theory of heat, the alteration of temperature
of a point situated at a distance from a constant source of heat
is regarded as a function of the distance and of the time elapsed
since the presentation of the source of heat.      Also the means
are given for estimating this heating           numerically; these
estimations are, however, only relative to the heating which
would take place in another substance under similar circum
stances.   The absolute measurement of the time which is requi
site for the attainment of a certain temperature in a point does
not enter into the account. After the publication of his Théorie
de la Chaleur, Fourier proposed to measure the conductivity of
thin plates by placing them on a bed of constant temperature,
and laying his contact thermometer (consisting of a mass of
mercury in which there is a very delicate thermometer), after it
had been heated, upon this plate, and noting the times which
must elapse in order that the thermometer, by the employment
of different plates, may become cooled to a like difference of
temperature.
   Here the times, which are taken up by each cooling, are indeed
directly observed; but Fourier gives no information about the
duration of these times in the few experiments which he has made,
and, except himself, so          far
                                  know,as I                 no
                                           one has employed his
method.
   Moreover the theory               of
                                the propagation         heat will gainof
nothing from the above-described experiments. Nor are they
adapted for the measurement                  of
                                       the times which elapse before

bodies—wax, paraffin, glass, quartz, mica, gypsum, and the most
dissimilar salts, also the metals, whether rough or polished, or
even   covered with varnish—condense on their surface aqueous
vapour from the surrounding air which has the same tempera
ture as themselves, and in consequence of this condensation
undergo elevation of temperature; and that when the surround
ing air is changed for air containing less moisture, then a part
of the previously condensed moisture should evaporate and cool
the surface of the body.
   Results perfectly similar to those obtained with vapour of
water were obtained by using vapour of alcohol, or of ether, or
other vapours.
    Generalizing, the most various vapours condense on the surface
 of solid bodies in such quantity as to cause appreciable elevation
of temperature.                                 -
   From this it follows that at   times there        all                          at   the surface      of

by means of a comparison*, viz. that he weighs on a balance
which weighs to the milligramme,                                          whilst       I       on one which can
only weigh poundst.
     I must  leave it to others to judge how far Dr. Tyndall is right
in making      such a comparison between his work and mine.                                                                    I
think it is certain that the apparatus which I employed, both
the thermo-pile and the galvanometer, were at least as sensitive
as his; and my method, to which              the objections raised       all                                                 by

perpendicular, or at any constant angle.        Lines meeting in a
point in one figure form a closed polygon in the other.
   In figures in space, the lines in one figure are perpendicular
to planes in the other, and the planes corresponding to lines
which meet in a point form a closed polyhedron.
   The conditions of reciprocity may be considered from a purely
geometrical point of view; but their chief importance arises from
the fact that either of the figures being considered as a system of
points acted on by forces along the lines of connexion, the other
figure is a diagram of forces, in which these forces are represented
in plane figures by lines, and in solid figures by the areas of
planes.
   The properties of the “triangle” and “polygon” of forces
have been long known, and the “ diagram ” of forces has been
used in the case of the funicular polygon; but I am not aware of
any more general statement of the method of drawing diagrams
of forces before Professor Rankine applied it to frames, roofs,
&c. in his “ Applied Mechanics,” p. 137, &c. The “polyhedron
of forces,” or the equilibrium of forces perpendicular and pro

portional to the areas of the faces of a polyhedron, has, believe,
been enunciated independently at various times; but the appli
cation to a “frame” is given by Professor Rankine in the Phi
losophical Magazine, February 1864.
    Ipropose to treat the question geometrically, as reciprocal
figures are subject to certain conditions besides those belonging
to diagrams of forces.
                        On Reciprocal Plane Figures.
   Definition.—Two plane figures are reciprocal when they con
sist of an equal number of lines, so that corresponding lines in
the two figures are parallel, and corresponding lines which con
verge to a point in one figure form a closed polygon in the other.
   Note.—If corresponding lines in the two figures, instead of
being parallel are at right angles or any other angle, they may
be made parallel by turning one of the figures round in          its
                                                                  own
plane.
   Since every polygon       one figure has three
                             in                        ormore sides,
every point  in the other figure must have three        ormore lines
converging   to   it;
                   and since every line      the one figure has two
                                                  in
and only two extremities        which lines converge, every line
                                  to                                    in
the other figure must belong        two, and only two closed poly
                                       to
gons. The simplest plane figure fulfilling these conditions              is
that formed       by
                  the       six
                           lines which join four points      in pairs.
The reciprocal figure consists              six
                                       lines parallel respectively
                                       of
these, the points    the one

     General Relation between the Numbers of Points, Lines, and
                   Polygons in Reciprocal Figures.
  The effect of drawing a line, one of whose extremities is a
point connected with the system of lines already drawn, is either
to introduce one new point into the system, or to complete one new
polygon, or to divide a polygon into two parts, according as it is
drawn to an isolated point, or a point already connected with the
system.    Hence the sum of points and polygons in the system
is increased by one for every new line. But the simplest figure
consists of four points, four polygons, and six lines.   Hence the
sum of the points and polygons must always exceed the number
of lines by two.
   Note.—This is the same relation which connects the numbers
of summits, faces, and edges of polyhedra.
     Conditions      of indeterminateness       and impossibility in drawing
                                     reciprocal Diagrams.
   Taking any line parallel to one of the lines of the figure for a
base, every new point is to be determined by the intersection of
two new lines.   Calling s the number of points or summits, e
the number of lines or edges, and                    f
                                      the number of polygons or
faces, the assumption               of the first line determines two points, and
the remaining              s–2      points    are    determined by            2(s-2)    lines.
Hence if                                  e=2s—3,
every point may be determined.         If e be less, the form of the
figure will be in some respects indeterminate; and if e be greater,
the construction of the figure will be impossible, unless certain
conditions among the directions of the lines are fulfilled.
   These are the conditions of drawing any diagram in which the
directions of the lines are arbitrarily given; but when one dia
gram is already drawn in which e is greater than 28–3, the
directions of the lines will not be altogether arbitrary, but will
be subject to e—(2s—3) conditions.
   Now if      e',   s',
                      f'       be
                       the values           and     of the reciprocal

                     e=s+f–2, e'=s'+f"–2.
Hence   if s   =f, e=2i–2; and there will one         condition con be
necting the directions     the lines of               of
                                         the original diagram, and
this condition will ensure the possibility    constructing the reciof
procal diagram.             If
                     s   >f,     e   >    2s—2, and           el- 28–2;
so that the construction               of     the reciprocal diagram will              be   pos
sible, but indeterminate               to    the extent    s—f variables.

  If  s = f; the construction of the reciprocal diagram will be
impossible unless (s—f) conditions be fulfilled in the original
diagram.
  If  any number of the points of the figure are so connected
among themselves as to form an equal number of closed poly
gons, the conditions of constructing the reciprocal figure must
be found by considering these points separately, and then ex
amining their connexion with the rest.
   Let us now consider a few cases of reciprocal figures in detail.
The simplest case is that of the figure formed by the six lines
connecting four points in a plane. If we now draw the six lines
connecting the centres of the four circles which pass through
three out of the four points, we shall have a reciprocal figure,
the corresponding lines in the two figures being at right angles.
   The reciprocal figure formed in               Fig. 1.
this way is definite in size and
position; but any figure similar
to it and placed in any position is
still reciprocal to the original
figure.   If the reciprocal figures
are lettered as in fig. 1, we shall
have the relation
   In figures 2 and II. we have a
pair of reciprocal figures in which the lines are more numerous,
but the construction very easy. There are seven points in each
figure corresponding to seven polygons in the other.

   The quadrilateral D E G F corresponds to the point of qua
druple concourse degf.
   The pentagon A C K L H corresponds to the meeting of the
five lines a c k l h.
   In drawing the reciprocal of fig. 2, it is best to begin with a
point of triple concourse.      The reciprocal triangle of this point
being drawn, determines three lines of the new figure.           If the
other extremities of     any  of the lines  meeting in this  point  are
points of triple concourse, we may in the same way determine
more lines, two at a time. In drawing these lines, we have only
to remember that those lines which in the first figure form a
polygon, start from one point in the reciprocal figure.        In this
way we may proceed as long as we can always determine               the     all
lines  except two               of
                       each successive  polygon.

   In       figures 4 and          IV. the      condition that the number of polygons
is equal to the number of points is not fulfilled.                     In fig. 4 there

are five points and six      triangles; in fig. IV. there are six points,
two  triangles,  and three quadrilaterals.          Hence if fig. 4 is given,
fig. IV. is indeterminate to the extent of one variable, besides
the elements of scale and position.            In fact when we have drawn
A B C and indicated the directions of P, Q, R, we may                                                           fix   on

  When the conditions are fulfilled, the pieces of the frame can
support forces, but in such a way that a small disfigurement of
the frame may produce infinitely great forces in some of the
pieces, or may throw the frame into a loose condition at once.
   The conditions, however, of the possibility of determining the
ratios of the forces in a frame are not coextensive with those of
finding a figure perfectly reciprocal to the frame. The condition
of determinate forces is     e=2s—2;
the condition of reciprocal figures is that every line belongs to
two polygons only, and    e=s+f—2.
    In fig. 7 we have six points connected by ten lines in such a
way that the forces are                all
                                 determinate; but since the line                                L    is

                    On Reciprocal Figures in three dimensions.
    Definition.—Figures in three dimensions are reciprocal when
they can be so placed that every line in the one figure is perpen
dicular to a plane face of the other, and every point of concourse                                                                .
of lines in the one figure is represented by a closed polyhedron
with plane faces.
    The simplest case is that of five points in space with their ten
connecting lines, forming ten triangular faces enclosing five
tetrahedrons.      By joining the five points which are the centres
of the spheres    circumscribing     these five tetrahedrons, we have a
 reciprocal figure of the kind described by Professor Rankine in
the Philosophical Magazine, February 1864; and forces propor
tional to the areas of the triangles of one figure, if applied along
the corresponding lines of connexion of the other figure, will
 keep      its
           points      equilibrium.

This condition is sufficient to determine the possibility of finding
a system of forces along the edges which will keep the summits
in equilibrium; but it is manifest that the mechanical problem
may be solved, though the reciprocal figure cannot be constructed

262                    Prof. Clausius on the Difference between
 and the oxygen thus altered was called ozone.       But, together
 with an    oxidizing action, a deoxidizing  action was also then
 observed for the first time, the deoxidation of binoxide of lead;
 and it was the publication of this observation* that led to the
  communication of my views on ozone.
      Since them numerous and important experimental observa
  tions on ozone have been made.     Schönbein himself has com
  pleted his very important discovery of ozone by proving the dif
  ference between ozone and antoZone.         Among other researches,
  I   must   specially   mention the   highly   interesting publication
  of Meissner, Untersuchungen über den Sauerstoff; further, the
  continued investigation of Andrews and Taitt, and the beautiful
  observations made by Baboi and Soret $.
      The results of these mewer investigations have in a surprising
   manner confirmed the chief part of my explanation; but in two
   points, of inferior importance however, they do not quite agree
   with       These deviations may perhaps with many readers raise
            it.

  the atoms are not separated, but are joined         pairs forming mo       in
 lecules,        conclusion which also
                  a                      agrees   with the views enunci
 ated       by
           Gerhardt “On the Constitution          the Molecules     Gas,”
                                                                       of                             of
 excepting that Gerhardt has spoken less definitely about oxygen
 than
        I; for          he
                    only says", “the free oxygen-atom        composed                     is                    of
 several         (at
               least two) atoms.”    Resting      this conclusion, whichon
I   had previously drawn,       explained the active oxygen contained

forming molecules, which are dispersed among the ordinary
molecules.

    Comparing this explanation with the then known facts, and
 considering first the most important of the methods for pre
 paring ozone,          I
                    had occasion to enter upon the condition of the
 two atoms contained in an ordinary oxygen-molecule, and to
 express my opinion on the subject.                                 I
                                                said that the process
 which takes     place when ozone is      produced   by placing atmo
 spheric air in contact with moist phosphorus, may be conceived
 to take place in the following manner+:—By the combination
 of the phosphorus with the surrounding oxygen, a number of
 the molecules coming in contact with it must be decomposed
 into their two atoms; and it may thus happen that it does not
unite with both, but that one is removed by the motion of heat
from         its
            sphere     operation and then remains isolated.
                             of                                                                     It
possible that another circumstance operates also          this case.                  in         It is
    known from electrolysis that,                                             of
                                                       of in
                                        the union     dissimilar atoms
to is
    form one molecule, one part          the molecule becomes posi
tively, and the other negatively electrical. This perhaps takes
place also when two similar atoms unite—for example, twooxygen
atoms—by one                of
                     these becoming positive and the other negative.
But since, the oxidation
                   in                       of
                                 phosphorus, oxygen certainly enters
 as  negative constituent into the compound,           may       that            it        be      of
the two    oxygen-atoms   resulting  from one   molecule,  the negative
is  preferably retained                by
                            the phosphorus, and the positive, being
unrestrained,           or        all
                          events less restrained, can escape.

        In
        these sentences, and repeatedly throughout the paper, the
view has been expressed—as far            know, for the first time, and
                                                       as
                                                        I
at     time when there were
        a                            experimentalno data which neces
sitated it—that the atoms         the ordinary oxygen-molecules are
                                             in
in  opposite electrical conditions.                          By
                                            the discovery made shortly
after, that there are two kinds      active oxygen, which Schönbein
                                                  of
has called ozone and antozone, and that these two can unite                                        to
form ordinary oxygen, this view has been remarkably con
firmed.
     With regard      the circumstance that active oxygen can
                             to
exert        an
         oxidizing and also      deoxidizing action,
                                             a           gave the fol              I
lowing explanation.     Isolated atoms can form compounds with
other bodies more easily than such        are already joined   aspairs,                     in
and must first              be
                   liberated from this union before    they  are fitted
for combination with other bodies; the former will therefore exert
a stronger oxidizing action than the latter.        Suppose, further,
that         an
         oxide, for example      peroxide, which readily gives                                     up

264               Prof. Clausius on the Difference between
atoms, by which the oxide is reduced and at the same time the
active oxygen is transformed into ordinary oxygen.
    With reference to this double action of oxidation and deoxi
dation,  I   compared active oxygen as it may be contained in
ordinary oxygen, with that oxygen which is loosely united in
certain peroxides, or in the oxides of the noble metals; and
taking peroxide of hydrogen as an example, said*, “Peroxide                I

readily gives up       its

the noble metals,          with certain metallic peroxides,
                            or                                      mutual                    a
reduction takes    place.   Here      may      it           be
                                               assumed that the    oxygen
atoms which separate from peroxide               hydrogen unite
                                                             of        form                        to
molecules with those which are liberated from the metallic oxides
or  peroxides.”

oxygen-atoms contained                        an            peroxide unite

which   I   considered possible for answering this question occurs

make the atoms          ofone   compound      more suitable for uniting

expressed     anopinion which        one   point  resembles my own, but
    others essentially different.        Brodie assumes that the oxygen
of in
             is
     the two  compounds     which act                  on

chemical conditions. He says, oxygen               “chemically polar”
                                                                 is                                          in
the compounds, and           distinguishes the positive polar and the
                                 he
 negative polar condition.        Two quantities          oxygen           of
                                                                       these                   in

 drogen can unite. The question, upon what does the chemical

 however, inclined           to
                            the view that the substances which                                               in

                •         Active and Ordinary Oaygen.                                               265
    My explanation, on the contrary, definitely refers the pheno
mena to a simple molecular constitution; for it starts by assum
ing that the molecule of ordinary oxygen is diatomic, and that
the atoms have the tendency, when they are free, again to com
bine in pairs to form molecules. When there is an electrical
opposition between two oxygen-atoms, their union will thereby
be promoted; but even when this opposition does not exist, the
tendency to union is still present, and the electrical opposition
is then spontaneously produced by their union.
   In this manner it is explained why the oxygen-atoms of a
compound unite more readily with the oxygen-atoms of another
compound which are in another electrical state, but that, under
suitable conditions (for instance, with increased temperature), the
oxygen-atoms of an individual compound may leave it and unite
to form molecules, and that thereby oxygen is formed of the
same kind as when two quantities of oxygen contained in different
compounds come together.         Brodie's view, according to which
only such quantities of oxygen as have opposite chemical pola
rity seek to unite, leaves this last process unexplained; and even
also in the other processes there is a greater indefiniteness than
in my explanation.
    From what I have said, I can express so much of the expla
nation contained in my former paper                                as,
                                             after recent discoveries,
I  conceive  myself  justified    adhering    in   the following two     to,   in
sentences, one       which formed from the first the chief point
                     of                                                                              of
my explanation, and the other        the course    in
                                                   the discussion was          of

                           to                 which   consider           in              I          I

the explanation                    I
                  originally gave, is connected with the changes
in volume which  oxygen    undergoes when part of it passes from
the ordinary into the active condition.
   In the paper above cited, “On the Nature of the Motion
which we term Heat,”                             I
                          have referred all volumetrie relations of
gaseous bodies to one theorem, “that for the same temperature

other combination.
     Inmy first explanation          have assumed that the separated

indeed     at
            that time the     experiments          Andrews and Taitºk    of                                     on

   Since then the same gentlemen have continued their investi

              the same point.       By these investigations,         the de                         in

ordinary oxygen, has become completely confirmed;                   and the
special result has been obtained that the difference between the
two volumes        just    great
                           is              that part

in the condition of ozone did not exist.
  It   becomes now the question whether, and                 what manner,               in
my explanation, that active oxygen            distinguished from ordinary

I        will make some observations                         as   to   how,     on    my view, the             com

plicated molecules in pure oxygen which contain the active oxygen
may be supposed to be constituted.             I
                                       But must here expressly
mention that   Ido not consider that which can be said upon this
point as necessary for my explanation, but think that the expla
nation so far as it is contained in the preceding may be taken
even where different opinions are held as to the specialities of the
molecular constitution.    Hence before I pass to these observa
tions, I will once more   briefly summarize the essential part of
my explanation in a form corresponding to the recent disco
veries.   The molecules of ordinary owygen are diatomic, and each
contains an electro-positive and an electro-negative atom.  Active
owygen consists of unpaired atoms, which may either be free or
loosely united; and according as the atoms are electro-positive or
electro-negative, they form antozone or ozone.
   All the above-mentioned observers, who have found that ozo
nized oxygen occupies a smaller volume than ordinary oxygen,
are agreed that in the first the molecules must be more complex
than in the latter. This is in fact, as already said, to be regarded
as a direct result of those observations, if we consider as esta
blished the law that the volume of a gas is proportional to the
number of its molecules.     But regarding the mode in which the
composition of the molecule is to be imagined, they are of differ
ent opinions.
   Andrews and Tait connect their consideration with experi
ments which they have made with compound gases, especially
nitrous oxide and carbonic oxide. When they produced in these
gases the same electrical discharges by which they had effected
the excitation of oxygen, they observed, as in this case, a diminu
tion of volume, which they explain by assuming that the consti
tuents of the gases in question under the influence of the dis
charges are partially liberated from their previous compounds
and transformed into others which occupy a smaller volume.
Founded upon this, they make a supposition that oxygen is not,
as now assumed, a simple body, but a chemical compound, whose
constituents may also variously unite with one another. This
explanation deviates so widely from the generally received view,
that, as   I think, it can only be entered upon when no other
explanation is possible.
   Won Babo holds to a view, formerly expressed by Weltzienik,
which is opposed to my explanation, since it tends to consider
ordinary oxygen as composed of simple, and ozonized of diatomic
molecules; and he promises to develope his reasons in a subse
quent paper.        I
                   cannot at

comparison     ofthe volume      oxygen with the volumes          of   its
compounds led me, quite independently         of
                                             ozone,    the assump

not see how the actions of ozone, and the mutual union of ozone
and antozone to form ordinary oxygen, are to be explained if the
molecule of oxygen is presupposed to be monatomic.        Before                                                            I
can further proceed to a discussion of this view, I must of course
wait to see what reasons von Babo adduces for it.
     Soret expresses no defined view as to the mode of the compo
 sition of the molecules.         He gives it first as a result of observa
 tion, that ozone must have molecules of more atoms than ordi
nary oxygen; and in mentioning that a great number of chemists
and physicists now assume that in ordinary oxygen the molecules
are already diatomic, he says that, according to this assumption,
more than two molecules must be assigned to the molecules of
ozone.       He first discusses, as an example, the simplest case, that
a molecule consists of three atoms, and then continues,                     est                             “Il
clair querien dans les faits connus ne prouve que l'ozone résulte
du groupement de 3 atomes plutót que de 4, 5, &c.; pour dé
terminer ce nombre il faudrait connaitre la densité de ce corps.”
In a note he says that, according to the experiments of St.-Claire
Deville and Troost, and of Bineau, the density of sulphur vapour
near   its   boiling-point        three times
                                        is           great          very high

temperatures; and that there                perhaps        analogy between
                                                          is                         an

molecules of ozone are hexatomic.

   Assuming that in ozone the active atoms have united with the
ordinary oxygen-molecule to form new complex molecules, the
stability of ozone when kept at lower temperature, and especially
the stability of the electro-negative condition of the active atoms,
is more easily explained than on the assumption that the active
atoms remain isolated. For as in general in chemical compounds
each atom has a certain electrical condition, which is not arbi
trary and variable, but belongs to the characteristics of the com
pound, so this may be presupposed of the oxygen-atoms united
to a molecule; and it may be assumed in the present case that
the active atoms are contained as electro-negative in the mole
cules, and must retain this electrical condition as long as they
are in the compound.
   It is not necessary in this case that the ozonized oxygen shall
exhibit an electroscopically perceptible negative electrical tension.
It may be assumed, as is done in the case of other chemically
composed molecules, that the electrical conditions of the indivi
dual atoms of a molecule stand in such a relation to one another
that the entire molecule is unelectrical; inasmuch as the alge
braic sum of the quantities of free positive and negative electricity.
which the individual atoms of a molecule possess are exactly zero.
        I
      must now speak of antozone.
   In his investigations on oxygen, Meissner has made observa
tions from which he concludes that, in the excitation of oxygen
by electrical induction, along with ozone another substance is
formed, which exerts a very remarkable action on aqueous vapour,
and thereby betrays                  its
                               existence.    By further developing the
subject,         he
              believes              he
                           has convinced himself that this substance
is nothing more than the modification                     of
                                                   oxygen described                   by
 Schönbein as antozone.

                                                        ordinary oxygen

                                          which Meissner conceives the

XLVII.       On the Application of the Vapour-density system of No
     tation to express Chemical Reactions.   By       WATERston,            J. J.
     Esq.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
          GENTLEMEN,
    the following communication I give an example of the ap
INplication  of the vapour-density system of notation to express
chemical reactions; and to place it in comparison along side of
Gerhardt’s system, I have selected the formulae from M. Wurtz's
memoir on the glycols (Ann. de Chim. vol. lv.), where that system
is applied with great distinctness, and accompanied with vapour
density measurements.      It appears from a passage in M. Wurtz's
lecture on the Oxide of Ethylene, delivered before the London
Chemical Society, June 5, 1862, that he considers Gerhardt’s
system as only provisional.      * * * “car les barres qui ne sont
point superflues dans ce moment de confusion, ne sont que provi
soires et devront disparaître par la suite” (Ann, de Chim. Nov.
1863, p. 361).
     I
     have appended some remarks on the so-called hydrates of
metals of the new school of chemists, as one of M. Wurtz’s ex
periments has the appearance of favouring their views, but                                              is,
in  my opinion, rather       example    anthe liability ofbeing led                       of
astray          by
            defective symbolism—defective because founded                                               on
substitutional rather than                   on

particle of steam; but it is not likely that this argument has                                                            .
now much weight with chemists who agree with him otherwise
because the intense heat given out during the union of the water
with the oxide shows that a high degree of chemical action has
taken place between them, and it cannot be expected under such
circumstances that the physical characteristics of the water
molecule should be retained. The only way       can imagine the                    I
idea Hº           O'K'
                  to have taken root is from incompleteness in the
conception of a compound molecule as an absolute entity. There
is at least one distinct case where a compound molecule splits up
like a simple molecule, N#C# appearing in compounds, but un
known in a separate form.       There is also the organic proteus
CH*, which not only divides into two, C3H, which does not exist
in a separate form, but also appears in an indefinite number of
multiple forms. There may be others, too; but no one upholds
the possibility of              HO:       being divisible into two atoms, H% O3, Or

the transference is made from the embrace of the oxygen to the
embrace of the metal without any appearance of the full equi
valent of force that would be generated if the metallic molecule
had descended from the vaporous or separate-molecule form.
   An atom of metal seems almost as indisposed to exist in a
state of isolation as an atom or half-molecule of gaseous element.
   To attempt to express such conditions by modifying the nota

the burnt or unburnt, the clasped or raised condition of atoms,
should be kept well in view while studying chemical reactions;
otherwise we shall be apt to lose sight of their real potential
nature and wander into a maze of false analogy, barren of any
result but an unmeaning jargon of words.       For the same reason
I submit that chemical notation should be founded on physical
relations only, now that the classical labours of modern physi

pleased, although they might be unable to calculate the chord.

286                  Mr.    James   Croll   on the Influence   of the
the subject, it will be necessary, for the following reasons, to
enter somewhat minutely into one or two points regarding the
cause of the tides.                                       -
  The existence of the tidal wave depends upon the action of
two forces, viz. centripetal and centrifugal force. In the pro
duction of the lunar wave, for instance, we have to consider, first,
the influence of the attraction of the moon on the water of the
ocean; and secondly, the influence of the centrifugal force of the
earth's motion round the common centre of gravity of the earth
and moon. Or rather, we should say, we have to consider the
combined effect of these two forces on the waters of the ocean.
Although in every mode of explaining the production of the tidal
wave the element of centrifugal force must be recognized, yet it
is not generally stated under that particular form best adapted
to exhibit the influence of the wave on the vis viva of the earth's
rotation.   That clear conceptions on the relation of centrifugal
force to the tidal wave are necessary, is evident if we but reflect
that the very subject of our present inquiry is the retarding                 in
fluence exerted by the wave on the centrifugal force of rotation.
   The earth’s mass is to that of the moon’s as 87.7 to 1. The
mean distance between their centres being 237,000 miles, the
centre of gravity around which they both revolve is situated
2702 miles from the earth's centre, or 1261 miles below        sur      its
face    onthe side next the  moon,     Let ABCD      represent  the
earth’s equator, and            O             IB                 -

                    found  is
that the centrifugalforce
occasioned         by
               the earth’s
rotation     its centre O,
              on

earth on the centre O causes the water of the ocean to rise 84,950
feet at the point B, then a rotation on the centre O' must also
cause the water to rise at the same point.           The same mechanical
cause which produces the effect in the first case must operate in
the second.      This is perfectly evident. As O', the common
centre of  gravity   of the earth and moon, is situated in the inte
rior of the earth,        partsall             of
                                     the earth must move round this

                                           at    than anywhere else. This
rise constitutes what         called the tidal wave. The wave
                                 is                                   course                             of

        the earth will appear evident from the following con
siderations.
    Let   us   suppose that our globe consists entirely                                    of   a     fluid mass
revolving with       uniform velocity round the common centre
                      a                                                                                               of
gravity    ofthe earth and moon once month. We shall           a    the                                       in
mean time leave out of consideration the diurnal motion of rota
tion.  It can      easily demonstrated that such fluid mass would,
                     be                                                            a

spheroid with         its
                     greater axis pointing        the direction      the in                                   of

                                             the side furthest from the
moon would, under the influence                             of
                                          centrifugal force, recede                                                   to
a  certain extent; and the waters            the opposite side would,

moon      to
           the same extent.     Here we have the rise constituting
the tidal wave            on
                      both sides     the earth.     Suppose now that
                                                    of

288               Mr. James Croll            on the Influence         of the
does,   of a solid body or nucleus surrounded by a fluid mass.                                It
is evident that the fluid mass surrounding the solid earth would
assume identically the same shape as it would do supposing there
were no solid matter.    Now in order to know whether the tidal
wave rises to the same   height on both sides of the globe or not,
we have merely to determine whether or not the centre of gravity
of the surrounding fluid mass coincides with the centre of gra
vity of the enclosed  solid mass.    That the two centres must
coincide is evident from the fact that the centre of gravity of any.
mass moving uniformly round a distant centre must remain
always at the same distance from that centre, whatever form the
mass may assume.      The distance of the centre of gravity of the
mass from the centre of rotation is determined by the velocity of
the motion of the former centre round the latter. Now the centre
of gravity of the surrounding fluid, and the centre of gravity of
the solid mass, are in the present case moving with the same
velocity.  Hence both centres must be at the same distance from
the centre of rotation, and consequently the solid mass must be
exactly in the centre of the surrounding fluid mass.   It follows
that the depth of the waters, or, which is the same thing, the
height of the tidal wave on the opposite sides must be the same.
   The following is a very simple mode of calculating the height
to which the tidal wave will rise at the point B. The distance
of the point B from the centre O' is 6665 miles, and it performs
one revolution in 27 days 7 hours 43 minutes and 11 seconds.
This point therefore moves round the common centre of gravity
O', of the earth and moon, at the rate of 93.6 feet per second.
The same point in           its
                         diurnal motion round the earth’s axis                                O

when raising the water. In regard to the extent of the rise at
the equator, occasioned by the earth's diurnal motion, it is of
little consequence whether the earth be uniformly covered with
water or not, for in this case the water remains permanently
raised; but in regard to the rise occasioned by the earth's rota
tion on the centre O' the case is entirely different.                 Here the
rise only exists at the two places B and D in the form of an
exceedingly broad wave, fixed in relation to the position of the
moon; and as the waters at these places are continually shifting
at a rate of upwards of a thousand miles an hour, there must be
a constant rise and fall so as to maintain the tidal wave in its
proper place. But whatever breaks up the continuity of the
 ocean, such as an island or a continent, must stand as an ob
 stacle in the way of the waters rising, and will thus prevent the
 wave attaining anything like the height corresponding to the
 centrifugal force.
     That which makes the waters rise at B                      we have seen,        is,   as
 the centrifugal force occasioned                                    by

transferred to the solid particles of the earth against which they
 rubbed, then the earth, as a whole, would not have lost any of
 its vis viva of rotation.      But the motion of the molecules is
 transformed into heat-vibrations, and thus -lost in so far - as rota
                                                          -
 tion is concerned.                                                   . .
    It will be observed that at the time when the molecules of the
 water are losing their motion, they are moving round both the
 centre O and the centre O'. The question now suggests itself,
 whether is the heat produced at the expense of the motion round
 the centre O, or round the centre O'?                             If
                                                  we assume that it is
 at the expense of the latter, that is to say, at the expense of the
 earth's motion round the common centre of gravity of the earth
 and moon, then we must conclude that the velocity of the earth's
 motion round this centre is diminishing; and if diminishing,
 then the earth must be falling towards this centre; or, in other
 words, falling towards the moon. And if the earth and moon
 are approaching toward each other, then the velocity of their
 motion round this centre must be increasing.            But to assume
that the friction of the waters in this case could have any influ
ence on the general motion of the earth and moon round their
common centre, seems to be in opposition to the principle that
the general motion of a system cannot be affected by the relative
motion of       its
                 parts.    Hence we infer that the entire heat pro
duced      in
            the  present  case    derived from the motion round the
                                          is
centre O;         other words, from the diurnal rotation
                 in                                         the earth.                 of

balanced by the earth's gravity pulling them back. The side
turned towards the sun, however, is moving in a path nearly
4000 miles nearer to the sun than that of the earth’s centre.
Hence, in order to prevent the waters at this place from falling
towards the sun, they must move with greater velocity than the
centre. But instead of this, they move with less velocity, and

  * A stiff frame is one in which the distance between any two
  points cannot be altered without altering the length of one or
 more of the connecting lines of the frame.
   . A frame of s points in space requires in general 88–6 con
 necting lines to render it stiff. In those cases in which stiffness
 can be produced with a smaller number of lines, certain condi
 tions must be fulfilled, rendering the case one of a maximum or
 minimum value of one or more of its lines. The-stiffness of
 such frames is of an inferior order, as a small disturbing force
 may produce a displacement infinite in comparison with itself.
     A frame of s points in a plane requires in general
                                                  -     28–3 con

 necting lines to render it stiff.
     A frame of s points in a line requires s—l connecting lines.
     A frame may be either simply stiff, or it may be self-strained
by the introduction of additional connecting lines having ten
'sions or pressures along them.
.    In a frame which is simply stiff, the forces in each connect
ing line arising from the application of a force of pressure or
tension between any two points of the frame may be calculated
either by equations of forces, or by drawing diagrams
                                                 .. .     of forces
according to known methods.
     In general, the lines of connexion in one part of the frame
may be affected by the action of this force, while those in other
parts of the frame may not be so affected.                         -

    Now no more positive refutation of this notion can be imagined
than the artificial construction of substances in every respect like
those obtained from the animal and vegetable kingdoms; and hence
some of the philosophical interest attached to the problem which
forms the subject of this discourse.                          -
    The first definite example of the construction of an organic body
from inorganic materials was given by Wöhler in 1828, when he
made the organic base urea from cyanate of ammonia.
    Let us trace the steps of this process. Cyanide of potassium—a
body which can exist at a red heat [some cyanide of potassium was
 exhibited in the form of tabular masses which had been fused], and
which can moreover be formed directly from                              its
                                                     constituents (carbon,
nitrogen, and potassium)—was oxidized by means                  peroxide                  of                  of

Kolbe availed himself      the observation which had been made by
                                      of

  302      . .   .  .      Royal Institution:-
  Melsens—that treatment of trichloracetic acid with potassium-amal,
  gam and water converted it into acetic acid.
      Kolbe was fully sensible of the scope and importance of his disco;
  very.    The following passage occurs in his paper, published in Lie
  big's Annalen for 1845:—“From the foregoing observations we
  deduce the interesting fact that acetic acid, hitherto known only as
  a product of the oxidation of organic materials, can be built up by
  almost direct synthesis from its elements. Sulphide of carbon, chlo
  ride of carbon, and chlorine are the agents which, along with water,
  accomplish the transformation of carbon into acetic acid.           If we
  could only transform acetic acid into alcohol, and out of the latter
  could obtain sugar and starch, then we should be enabled to build
  up these common vegetable principles, by the so-called artificial
  method, from their most ultimate elements.”         Thus it appears that
  Kolbe looked forward to the building up of organic bodies in gene
  ral, and that he was quite alive to the fact that the synthesis of
 acetic acid completed the synthesis of the derivatives of acetic acid.
     Among these derivatives may be enumerated acetone, the product
 of the destructive distillation of acetates; marsh-gas, obtained by
 distilling an acetate with a caustic alkali; ethylene, obtained by
 Bunsen, by heating kakodyle, which itself results by the action of
 arsenious acid upon an acetate.         The electrolysis of acetic acid,
 which Kolbe    accomplished   a few  years   afterwards, yielded methyle
 and oxide of   methyle,  which  latter, in its turn, could be transformed
 into any other methylic compound.                                        .
     Marsh-gas was moreover prepared by Regnault, by treating C Cl*
 with nascent hydrogen; and the common methylic compounds appear
 to have been produced by Dumas from marsh-gas, the chloride of
 methyle having been obtained by Dumas by the action of chlorine
upon marsh-gas.
     Before 1854,   all the foregoing syntheses were fully completed,
 i. e. there was no step missing between the elements themselves and
 the most complex compound reached; but, in addition to these com
plete and definite syntheses, there had also been a good deal of build
 ing up of an incomplete or of a less definite character before 1854.
     It was known in a general way, that organic bodies of tolerably
simple composition sometimes gave complex products on destructive
distillation. Thus alcohol was known to give naphthaline, benzole,
 and carbonic acid when it was pressed through a red-hot tube.
Formiates were also known to yield hydrocarbons when they were
subjected to destructive distillation. The precise dates of these
different observations I cannot give; but hand-books of chemistry,
published before 1854, contain a statement of the facts.
    A few years after 1820, before Wöhler's celebrated Synthesis of
Urea, a very remarkable instance of passage from a simpler to a more
complex compound was given by Faraday and Hennel. This exam
ple is placed along with the indefinite syntheses, because it was gene
rally disbelieved in by chemists, and only within the last few years,
when it was confirmed by Berthelot, received their general assent.
Faraday and Hennel found that olefiant gas was absorbed by sul

         Prof. Wanklyn on the Synthesis of Organic Bodies.                                                                 803
phuric acid and gave sulphovinic acid, from which of course alcohol
and the ethers might be procured.     Liebig denied what Faraday and
Hennel had   asserted; and the latter did not insist upon the correct
mess of their work, and did not take the necessary steps for ensuring
                                                                      -
the reception of their results.
   Shortly before 1854, a most capital addition to the art of organic
synthesis was borrowed from the doctrine of the homologous series.
I will endeavour             to explain                it.
   Organic bodies repeat themselves; thus common alcohol has                                                                   a

   This synthesis by series was an incomplete synthesis, there was a
gap requiring to be filled up, in order that the regular march might
be made up the vinic series.
   From the foregoing, it will be seen that by the year 1854 very
considerable progress had been made in the building up of organic
bodies from their ultimate elements.
   We now pass on to the consideration of the period comprising
the last ten years, from 1854 up to the present time.
    During this period we have had new methods of accomplishing
 some of the syntheses which had been effected previously.     Thus
formic acid, which, as we have seen, had been formed from inorganic
materials so long ago as 1831, was built up by Berthelot by means
 of carbonic oxide and caustic potash,
                                 CO+KHO=CH KO",
and again by Kolbe by using carbonic acid, moisture, and sodium
(the moisture and sodium giving nascent hydrogen),
                                           H+-Na-CH NaO”.

Again, also, the passage from an alcohol to the next higher acid
was repeated.   Carbonic acid and a compound of an alcohol radical
with an alkali-metal coalesced and formed a salt of a fatty acid,
 thus:–
                            CO”--NaC*H*=C*H*NaO2%
                                       *

                                        ethyle.               of   soda.
    Still these reactions, however interesting they might be, were not
new syntheses; they were only new methods of effecting old syn
 theses.
   The great problem, how to step from one alcohol to that next
above    it,has received    general solution from Mendius.
                                 a                             Mendius
used cyanogen compounds—those           hydrocyanic ethers which had
already done such good service         organic synthesis—and exposed
                                               to
them     tothe action       of
                         nascent hydrogen, and       obtained amides    so           of
alcohol radicals higher than the alcohol radicals started from.    The
reaction bears        close similarity
                       a                   the one which takes place
                                                     to
between the cyanides and alcoholic solution         potash, and which, of
 as will      be

steps in his synthesis are these :—
                          Hydrocyanic Acid to Methylamine.

alcohol to cyanide of methyle, well-known processes being employed
to effect this,
                          Cyanide           of Methyle to Ethylamine.

   From ethylamine it is easy to get cyanide of ethyle, from which, by-
a third repetition, we arrive at the propylic stage:—
     (3)              CNC*H*-i-Hº-C*H7NH”.
   Thus, the vinic series may be ascended; thus there is reason to
think we may begin with so simple a body as prussic acid, and step
by step proceed from one alcohol to the next above    until we reach                    it,

synthesis     the alcohol series, but none
                of                             them seem                  of                        to       be       so

FURTHER   REMARKS ON THE TELESCOPIC APPEARANCE OF THE

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                  307
have used the term pores for the extremely minute openings found
in them. This I adopted from Sir John Herschel's description of
the phenomena.       It may, however, be necessary to guard against
the supposition that these pores are always or even usually quite
round. When best seen, under circumstances which are unfortunately
of very rare occurrence, they sometimes have rather the appearance
of very small fissures, such as might be caused by several exceedingly
small dots running together into one short dark line, which is never
black, but at most of a dark grey.       I have been strongly impressed
with the conviction that their       visibility  varies greatly at different
times, even under circumstances too similar to account satisfactorily
for the difference.    Indeed      I
                                  have on some occasions been able to
find none, or scarcely any; while on others, not remarkably more
favourable, they have come out by pretty steady views in a suffi
ciently certain and positive way.
   Perhaps this variation in their visibility may be connected with
another fact to which I should wish to draw special attention,
namely, that the proportion of the area of the less luminous spaces (in
which the pores are sometimes found) to that of the most luminous
masses is subject to very considerable change.         Though they are at no
time  very  small or  narrow,  yet  of late  they  have struck me as occu
pying a decidedly greater space than I used to assign to them.             If
such changes really exist, and are also great, they would seem ne
 cessarily to produce differences in the quantity of solar light, and
 might thus place our sun among the slightly variable stars, and also
afford a plausible way of accounting for the variation in others.           I
 have indulged   the hope  of being   able to   give  a more decided opinion
as to the actual proportion between the masses of different lumi
nosity; but I can only say that at the present time my impression is
that the area occupied by the less luminous masses is even greater
than that of the brighter ones, but that the proportion in different
parts of the sun is by no means always the same at the same time.
These conclusions may, however, be considerably modified by better
and more continuous observations (with this special object in view)
than  I  have been able to procure, especially during the last eight
months.     Might it not be reasonably expected that photography
would here step in most efficiently to our assistance         As an ap
                                        I
proximation to what is wanting, may refer to the very remarkable
print of the sun's surface from an electro-copper block obtained from
the original negative taken by Mr. Warren De la Rue. The dark
interstices in that plate seem to represent the less luminous portions
of the surface, which may possess far less photographic power.
How such a picture can be reconciled with the idea of an interlacing
of an infinite number of willow-leaf-shaped masses of equal bright
mess I am at a loss to conceive.         The brighter parts are in that
picture, as I have always seen them, of               all
                                                  imaginable forms, and
                                                 interlacing.

when becoming a trifle loose. The brightest masses seem to be
higher and therefore thicker than the others; the brightness of the
lower and thinner parts being modified by the decidedly inferior

strengthened               by
                 the fact that the remarkably bright streaks called
faculae are undoubtedly ridges, being elevated

sun's rotation.
  However plausible this conclusion may appear, there are two facts
which strongly militate against                                             is,
                                    One            of it.
                                           that the less luminous
masses are seen      the very edge
                                to     the sun, both near the equator and
at the poles, except when, near the equatorial edge, they are concealed
by obvious faculae.      This seems                              be
                                             quite inconsistent with their

ness. The second fact                     is,
                              that the boundaries between the two kinds
of masses referred        are too abrupt, and the change
                                     to                           brightness                       of
too  sudden,    allow to   anything   of
                                     like  gentle  undulations.    The sides
of the brighter portions must                      be

views we obtain                 of
                      them under the finest circumstances.
   From these facts have been led to the conclusion that the masses
                                 I
of   inferior brightness, though self-luminous like the brighter, are                                                     so

account be more    transparent,   and perhaps also less dense, and there

removed from above the penumbra; leaving in general only the
elongated forms of the brightest self-luminous clouds of the photo
sphere, which, converging towards the nucleus, are seen projected on
the penumbra, and extending often beyond its interior edge on to
the umbra, like bright straws, as I have previously described them.
   The rotatory motion of a profound spot may be produced by the
exploded gas having acquired a whirlwind sort of action, and thus
carrying round the parts of the different strata affected by it in the
same direction. But though I have observed this motion with cer
tainty on two or three occasions, I believe it to be exceedingly rare
—at least in this class of spots.
   2. The superficial spots.—These appear, from the general tenour
of my observations, to be almost always produced by convulsions of
some kind in the photosphere itself, or at a small depth below                                                            it.

               ON THE HYPOTHESIS OF MOLECULAR WORTICES.
        To the Editors          of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
   As the article on Thermo-dynamics in the North British Review
is perhaps the most complete history of that science which has
yet appeared, and is written with a scientific precision which is
unusual in journals not specially devoted to science, I wish to cor
rect an oversight that the reviewer has committed in describing the
“Hypothesis of Molecular Vortices,” or “Centrifugal Theory of
Elasticity,” as proposed by me in 1849*. He speaks of atmospheres
of aether surrounding nuclei of ordinary matter; whereas in the
hypothesis as I put it forward, the nuclei perform the functions of
aether, and the atmospheres those of ordinary matter.       Radiance is
supposed to consist in oscillations of the nuclei, transmitted in waves
by means of the forces which they exert on each other at a distance;
and thermometric heat is supposed to consist in an agitation of the
atmospheres, producing outward pressure according to the known
laws of centrifugal force.     Emission of radiance takes place when
the atmospheres whirl faster than the nuclei oscillate, so that the
nuclei are undergoing acceleration, and the atmospheres retardation;
absorption of radiance takes place when the nuclei oscillate faster
than the atmospheres whirl, so that the nuclei are undergoing retar
dation,  and the atmospheres acceleration.        In perfect gases, the
nuclei oscillate with little  impediment     from the atmospheres, and
the transmission of radiance is   rapid;  in substances in a more dense
                                       in is,
condition, each nucleus           were, loaded with     part    its atmo                       of

sphere (like    pendulum
                     a          resisting medium), and the transmis
sion    of
        radiance    slower.
                         is         this peculiar view
                                                It is      the respective            of
functions     the nuclei and the atmospheres that constitutes the main
                of
distinction between the hypothesis put forth        me, and other hypo      by
theses involving  atomic nuclei and   atmospheres  (as that    Mossotti),                  of
or accounting for the phenomena          heat           of         by

The apparatus, which is called the “electrical valve,” and which is
analogous in construction to the apparatus known as the “electrical
egg,” consists of a small hollow glass cylinder of about the size of
an ordinary drinking-glass, and closed below by a metal cap by which
it can be screwed on the air-pump, while the top is closed by a
tightly-fitting glass plate.  In this plate there is a platinum wire
which terminates flush with the lower surface of the plate, and
externally can be joined to any conduction arrangement.        In the
inside of the cylinder there is a brass disc 25 millims. in diameter,
supported on a brass stem, parallel to the covering plate, and at a
distance of 2.3 millims. from             When the valve,         it.

richest blue colour, it forms a thick incrustation upon a tender killas.

always real, between the length of the principal and of the conjugate
focus of a point situated at two inches from the lens are only
   About 1 millim. in the ox and sheep, 4 millim. in the pig,     to #
millim. in the human subject.
    Hence, to pass from distant vision to the vision of objects of 2
inches' distance, the eye needs an apparatus which, in the case of
man, makes the interior conjugate focus traverse a distance of 2.5 to
3 millims. between parallelism of the incident rays and the diver
gence corresponding to 2 inches.
    II. The optic centre of the entire eye, and even that of the crys
talline isolated in the air, are behind the posterior face of the crys
talline. In the eye of the albino rabbit, the only one in which the
position can be accurately determined, the optic centre is exactly in
the centre of figure and of motion of the globe.
    A decisive physiological experiment shows the exactitude of this
coincidence in the human eye at the time of the regular exercise of
 sight. The pupil is dilated by means of atropine; then by means
of a fixed binocular ophthalmoscope, the sharp image of the flame of
 a candle is observed on the choroid by Knapp's method.         The sub
ject retaining his head quite fixed, his eye is caused to make regular
 and slow motions from one angle of the orbit to the other.
    During these movements the image neither varies in magnitude
 nor in position, as can be established by a micrometer placed in the
 very point occupied by the inverted image.          It follows evidently
 from   this, that the optic centre coincides with the centre of motion
 of the globe.
    This experiment further gives rise to the following accessory ob
 servation: if the narcotic used is weak enough not to have extin
 guished or materially impeded the accommodation, and the subject is
 led to make an effort directing his attention to a distant point in the
 same direction, as in Crammer's experiment, the image of the lamp,
 at first quite definite and sharp in its contours, suddenly becomes
 extended, confused, and badly defined.       The change in the dioptric
 state during the adaptation of the eye is thus demonstrated once
In Ore.
    The situation of the optic centre of the eye in the very centre of
 its rotation, behind and beyond the crystalline, evidently renders
illusory the skilful calculations    which Listing bases the construc

LIII.   On the Physical Cause of the Glacial Epoch. By E. FRANK
   LAND, F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution*.
AMºº              the causes that have profoundly influenced the
        present physical condition of our earth, the action of
ancient glaciers upon a scale of almost inconceivable magnitude
has gradually but irresistibly forced itself upon the notice of
philosophers, since their attention was first called to it by Venetzt
in Switzerland, and Professor Esmarkt in Norway. . There are
few elevated regions in any quarter of the globe which do not
exhibit indubitable evidence of the characteristic grinding and
polishing action of ice-masses, although at present perhaps they
are scarcely streaked by the winter's snow.           The researches of
Dr. Buckland and others first revealed the evidence of this
ancient glacial action in Great Britain; but it is especially to
Professor Ramsay that we are indebted for our present extensive
knowledge of the effects produced in this country during the
glacial epoch.      His explorations have demonstrated that the
 Highlands of Scotland, and the mountains of Wales and Cumber
land, to which     I  would add the limestone crags of Yorkshire,
abound in these roches moutonnées, which leave no doubt that the
valleys of these mountain-ranges were once filled with glaciers of
dimensions unsurpassed, if even equalled, by those which at the
present day stream down the sides of their gigantic Swiss rivals.
Not only was there this development of perennial ice where no
such phenomenon is now observed, but the glaciers of the pre

322              Prof. Frankland on the Physical Cause
sent age existing in Switzerland, Norway, and elsewhere are
evidently but the nearly dried-up streamlets of ancient ice-rivers
of enormous size. These glaciers have eroded the alpine valleys
of which they once held possession, have scooped out the lochs
and kyles of Scotland, as well as the grander fjords of Norway,
and have contributed in a most essential manner to the present
aspect of our mountain scenery.           Ramsay” and Tyndall have
recently called attention to this action of ancient glaciers, and
have contended, the former that the lake-basins, the latter that
the valleys of the Alps have been scooped out of a comparatively
uniform surface.
    In no part of the world perhaps can the problem of the glacial
epoch be more advantageously studied than in Norway, on whose
ice-scarred coasts and fjords two of the essential portions of the
glacial apparatus—the ocean and the mountains—are constantly
and contemporaneously under the eye of the traveller. 2000
miles of coast, from Christiania to the North Cape, afford almost
uninterrupted evidence of the vast ice-operations which, during
the epoch in question, moulded nearly every feature of this re
markable country.       In this respect Norway has already invited
the researches of    Esmark,    Won Buch, and especially of Professor
James Forbes, whose laborious explorations and acute philoso
phical reasoning have most materially increased our knowledge
of the physical phenomena of Scandinavia. To his work on
Norway and           its
                   glaciers     am indebted for many

    Starting from Christiania coastwise, the traveller cannot fail                to
remark the peculiar appearance           the gneiss and granite rocks
                                               of
composing the coast and the innumerable islands which, forming
a  natural breakwater, protect the mainland from the heavy seas
rolling     from the Atlantic. These rocks, here rarely rising
           in                                                                     to

 waves have had little           with this smoothing and polishing
                                to   do                                           of

tegrates the more soluble and friable parts, producing a cellular
or fissured surface according to circumstances, instead of the
smoothed and comparatively polished condition which obtains on
this coast. Such a weathering of the rocks can in fact be plainly
seen in many places superposed upon the polishing due to the
more remote agency of moving masses of ice.            In short, it may
be stated as a  general  proposition,   that the action of the sea and
weather upon rock produces a corrugated, irregular, and especi
ally a fissured surface; whilst that of glacier-ice occasions a
rounded, comparatively smooth and uniform appearance.                            If
further proof of the exclusively glacial origin of the surface of
the Norwegian coast-rocks be needed, it may be found, first, in
the frequent occurrence of the scratchings and fine markings
which so incontestably characterize rocky surfaces that have
formed the bed of a glacier, and, secondly, in the circumstance
that the smoothing action has evidently come as a rule from the
direction of the land.     All the surfaces inclined towards the land
                                  I
are invariably, as far as have seen, rounded and polished, whilst
in some places, where the rock descends precipitously towards the
sea, it has been protected from the abrading action and presents
merely a weathered surface.
   Doubling the Naze and proceeding northward, the coast pre
sents, with slight exceptions, the same general features until the
arctic circle is approached, when the character of the scenery
rather suddenly changes. The rocky hills acquire the dignity
 of mountains, and tower up in rugged, sharp, and fantastic
peaks, contrasting strongly with the rounded summits of the
lower latitudes. But these arctic peaks owe their immunity from
 the abrading action of ice solely to their height; around their bases,
 and even high up their sides, the slow surges of the moving sea
of ice have made their unmistakeable marks, having ground and
 even undercut them into most extraordinary forms,           as instances
 of which      I
              may mention the Seven      Sisters,  and  Torghatten   with
 itssingular tunnel, south      the arctic circle, the Hestmand stand
                                       of
 ing upon the circle, and the mountains                of
                                                   the Folden and West

through regions much colder than others. According                        this
hypothesis, the glacial epoch occurred during the passage                 our                   of to
system through          comparatively cold portion            space.    Some of

                                      of the Glacial Epoch.                                  325
have imagined that the heat emitted by the sun is subject to
variation, and that this epoch was the result of what may be
termed a cold solar period.   Mr. W. Hopkins believes that a
different distribution of land and water, and especially a different
direction of the currents of warm water which set from the tro
pical towards the polar oceans, would render the climate of cer
tain localities colder than it is at present, and would thus suffi
ciently account for the phenomena of the glacial epoch. Finally,
Professor Kämtz* considers that at the time of the glacial period
the mountains were much higher than at present, Mont Blanc
reaching an altitude of 20,000 feet for instance, the secondary
and tertiary formations having been removed from their summits
during the glacial epoch.
    The two last assumptions are attended with formidable geolo
gical difficulties, especially when it is considered that the phe
nomena of the epoch in question extended over the entire surface
of the globe; they have therefore never acquired more than a
very partial acceptancet.       The first two hypotheses, again, have
been recently shown by Tyndall to be founded upon an entirely
erroneous conception of the conditions necessary to the pheno
mena sought to be explained. The formation of glaciers is a
true process of distillation, requiring heat as well as cold for                              its
due performance. The produce                still would   of  diminished,

 ration into greater activity.      Professor Tyndall does not sug
 gest any cause for such exalted differentiation during the glacial
 epoch; but        proves conclusively that both hypotheses, besides
                    he

   This will be apparent from a consideration of the functions of
the three essential parts of the great natural glacial apparatus,
viz. the evaporator, the condenser, and the receiver.   The part
performed by the ocean as the evaporator is too obvious to need
description.    The two remaining portions of the apparatus, how
ever, are generally confounded with each other. The mountains
are in reality the receivers or ice-bearers, and are only in a sub
ordinate sense condensers. The true condenser is the dry                                                                        air

ice-bearer, which last occupies in fact the position of the receiver
in ordinary distillation; and hence so long as the temperature of
the ice-bearers, inclusive of the surrounding atmosphere, does
not rise above 0°C., their functions remain intact. Other things
equal, an ice-bearer at 0°C. is scarcely surpassed in efficiency
by one at — 15° C. But it must be borne in mind that the actual
efficiency of an ice-bearer, on an annual average, is dependent
upon the length of time during which                        it

   All these conditions would be the natural sequences of a
gradual cooling of the ocean from a higher down to     present                                            its

obtains       at  present.
     This hypothesis rests chiefly upon the two following proposi

increased evaporation, and consequently             augmented atmo                to   an
spheric precipitation.
    2nd. That this increased atmospheric precipitation would
augment the average depth             permanent snow upon the ice

depression of the snow-line itself from the attendantcircumstances
just enumerated: viz., 1st, from increased precipitation, which
would cause such an accumulation of snow during the winter
months, as would defy the heat of the succeeding summer to
melt; for it must be borne in mind that the amount melted is
proportional, not to the mass, but to the surface exposed to the
thawing influence; and 2nd, from the reduction of summer
temperature, owing to the interception of the sun's rays by an
overcast sky.       But it is evident that this lowering of the snow
line   by  increased oceanic temperature could only occur within
certain   limits;   for although the mean temperature of the snow
line might rise from 21° (its present position in Norway) to 35°,
its  height under the equator, and perhaps even still higher,
without any elevation           the snow-line itself, yet further rise

 Now only two cosmical causes                       of

 that our solar system may have passed through portions                  space               of
 in  which    itwould receive more heat-radiations from the stars,
  has been elaborately reviewed                       by
                                            Mr. Hopkins           the memoir       in

332                  Prof. Frankland on               the   Physical Cause
 already quoted, and he has conclusively shown it to be quite
 untenable on astronomical grounds.           The second requires some
 consideration, since it is by no means improbable that the sun
 was once a more active radiator of heat than he is at present,
 although the assumption that this should have been the case to
a marked extent so recently as the close of the glacial epoch is
in the highest degree improbable.          It might be anticipated that
an augmentation of solar energy would increase the temperature
of the oceanic surface, and probably not interfere much with the
functions of the radiating condenser, the luminous heat-rays of
the sun not having yet been proved to be much absorbed by
aqueous vapour.        But it would doubtless greatly impair the effi
ciency of the ice-bearers, whose powerfully absorbent surfaces
 would, under increased solar radiation, be less able to maintain
the necessary low temperature.          Fortunately, however, it is not
necessary to rely upon conjecture in this matter, for the demon
stration is constantly before us, in the comparative effects of solar
radiation upon glacial phenomena in the different terrestrial
zones.     The solar radiation within the tropics is augmented as
compared with that of the temperate and frigid zones, but this
augmentation does not bring on a glacial epoch in the torrid
zone; on the contrary, although the snow-line              above stated,is,   as
depressed        regards the line
                as                       32°, yet both are irresistibly

   It is necessary to mention that the surface of the tin-plate
cube in contact with the hot plate was coated with a film of
lampblack, and that the surfaces of the granite were only roughly
ground and not polished; in fact all the experimental conditions
were in favour of the transmission through water, and yet the
surface temperature of the latter did not rise with much greater
rapidity than that of the former.    Now taking into account the
specific heats and gravities of water and granite, the amount of
heat transferred from the base to the summit of each block will
be in the following proportion for equal times:—
                                          Granite: Water.
                                                   1        :    2-36.
   Although these determinations can only give a rough approxi
mation to the respective velocities with which heat passes through
strata of granite and water, yet they show that the convection of
heat through the latter is by no means so rapid, when compared
with   its conduction through granite,                 commonly supposed.   as   is
There can         be      no

 winter, yet the corresponding heavy fall of rain in summer would
  again liquefy the excess of snow so deposited. In reply to this
  objection, it might perhaps be sufficient to oppose the facts above
  given, regarding the comparative height of the snow-line in ad
                                              I
 jacent moist and dry localities; but may also add in explanation
 of these facts, that a comparatively very large quantity of even
  warm water is required to melt snow or ice.      In fact, as is well
 known, the amount of heat requisite merely to melt them would,
 if no melting occurred, raise their temperature to 174°F. Let
 us suppose that upon any given ice-bearer the precipitation
 throughout the entire year was doubled, that during six months
 of the year this increased precipitation occurred in the form of
 snow at 32°F., and that during the remaining six months it fell
 in the form of rain at 50°F.; still, even with these conditions,
 so manifestly unfair towards the ice-bearer, very little more than
 one-eighth of the additional snow would be melted by the warm
rain.     In fact it requires nearly eight tons of water at 50°F. to
 melt one ton of snow or ice, even when the latter is already in a
thawing condition.       Forbes considers that not more than one
fiftieth of the snow    upon  the snow-fields of Norway is liquefied
by the rains of summer; whilst M. Durocher has calculated, from
observations made at the convent of St. Bernard in Switzerland,
which is slightly below the snow-line, that not more than one
ninetieth of the annual snow is dissolved by the rain. Thus the
effect of summer rain in melting the snows of winter is compa
ratively insignificant.
    2. Is it not a necessary consequence of this hypothesis that
the ocean must have possessed a temperature incompatible with
animal life at the comparatively remote protozoic period?        This
question doubtless raises the most formidable of the objections that
can be brought against my view; nevertheless there are several
considerations which deprive it of much of                    its
                                                    force. Judging
from purely geological evidence, the period which has elapsed
 since marine life first made   itsappearance, compared with that             in
tervening between the glacial epoch and the present time, would
probably not    be   under-estimated        1000:
                                              at              1;
                                                        consequently          it
would   appear to   beevident that     the ocean has cooled through,
                                      if
say 20°  F. during unit
                      a     of  time,     must have been
                                         it                     boiling  at
                                                                         a
temperature   at
              a    far less distant   period  than 1000 such units.
There are three circumstances, however, which forbid such                     an
unqualified deduction.     In   the first place, the excessive evapo
ration of water  at  temperatures   not far removed from the boiling
point would rapidly reduce the ocean and           floorits   compara
                                                                    to
                                                                     a
tively moderate temperature. Secondly, the excessive precipita
tion which must have occurred            the preglacial periods must
                                      of in
have accelerated the    deposition     most        of
                                                the sedimentary rocks

                              of the Glacial Epoch.                                   337
to such an extent as to render the proportion above given between
the pre- and post-glacial periods considerably too great. Thirdly,
the advent of the severer portion of the glacial epoch would ne
cessarily effect a rapid refrigeration of the ocean, and thus mag
nify the cooling effected during the post-glacial unit of time.
   The experiments of Dalton on the rate of evaporation at dif
ferent temperatures serve to illustrate the truth of the first of
these considerations.    He found, and his results were afterwards
confirmed by Daniell, that the rate of evaporation increases in a
geometrical progression with equal increments of sensible heat.
From the same cause, the deposition of most of the pre-glacial
sedimentary rocks must have also proceeded at a much more
rapid rate than that which has obtained since the glacial epoch;
in fact the rate of deposition depends so essentially upon the
amount of precipitation, as to render it by no means improbable
 that the rate of decrease from a certain point down to the glacial
 epoch was also approximately a geometrical one: thus the pro
 portion between the pre- and post-glacial zoic periods would be
 considerably reduced.     Finally, the descent of the snow-line to
the level of the sea along an immense length of coast during the
 glacial epoch must have had the effect of very rapidly reducing
 the temperature of the ocean, since the precipitation upon the
land, instead of reaching the sea after being warmed at the ex
pense of solar heat, would now be thrown into the ocean, partly
 as ice-cold water, but chiefly as ice itself; and every ton of the
latter in melting would cool more than fourteen tons of sea-water
through 10°F. It must also be borne in mind that this ice
 cold water would not float on the surface, as in a freshwater
 lake, but would at once sink into the subjacent warm water,
because the point of maximum density of sea-water             accordingis,
to    Despretz+, 6°-6     below the freezing-point
                          F.                                pure water.
                                                                      of
Thus, taking       all
                     these circumstances into consideration, and
assuming that the ocean has lost       much       as
                                                   20° as         F.   of

the glacial epoch,  I  conceive    possible that there would still
                                         it                                            be
a  sufficient interval, between     temperature incompatible with
                                              a
marine animal life and that epoch, for the development               the         of
various organisms inhabiting the pre-glacial seas.              the case   In
of   land animals and plants                 no
                                    such difficulty arises, since,                     as
already explained, the surface temperature was, during the whole
of  the period contemplated, very little affected                 by
                                                           the internal
heat      of
          the earth.
     3. Recent research has led some geologists                  to
                                                         the conclusion
that glacial action existed             in
                                 the Miocene and even          far back    so
as  the Permian    period;  and although   the evidence     upon  which
this conclusion rests         is   by    no

am here advocating.           It is in fact a necessary consequence of
these   views,    that the so-called glacial epoch should not be a
 sharply limited period, although                                its
                                             termination, for the reasons

as   little distant from      may be desirable. When it is intended
                                    b as
to stop the galvanic heating and to ascertain the final pressure
of the gas, it would be only necessary to allow the ingress of air
from some reservoir connected with a manometer and with C, its
pressure being adjusted beforehand, by means of preliminary
trials, so as to endow it with sufficient force to press down the
mercury column from d to b.                        If
                                         this first means should not
seem    practicable,  secondly,   the tube B might have the shape
shown in the       adjoining  figure 2, the tube C
abutting at d, and a representing a thin plate of
some suitable substance lying on the top of the
mercury column.        In this case, again, the range
of the   mercury  column may be made very small,
the plate 2 acting as a stopper; the volume of
 the gas will again remain constant, and the
 final pressure be capable of measurement, as
before, by obvious means.
     4. The next important condition implied in the preceding
 illustration is the caloric impermeability or neutrality of the en
 closing vessel.    In reality, this condition is impossible to fulfil,
 the heat   engendered   by the spiral being actually communicated
 in part only to the gas, whilst the remainder will be communi
 cated to the vessel, and thence again, in part, to the medium sur
 rounding the vessel.       But, on the other hand, it is really not
 required to fulfil this condition, but only properly to distinguish
 and evaluate these several portions of heat.         For this purpose,
 in the first place, the globe A might be immersed in a vessel
 containing water, whose temperature might be measured, and
 might also be taken to indicate the temperature of the globe A,

      the Philosophical Magazine for June 1861 there is an
IN   account of a presumed law of liquid expansion which repre
sénts the proportionate             differential      of volume dv            **            at a given
temperature t, as being simply proportional to the inverse of the
distance of that temperature from a fixed upper limiting tem
º
perature y.   Expressed as an equation, this presumed law is
     ocy—t; and the integral equation corresponding to this dif
ferential showed a seeming relation to the law of vapour-density
by an apparent constancy in the value of F (see above-mentioned
paper, § 3), the product of the coefficient of saturated vapour
density of a body by the exponent of the liquid density of the
same body.       I
                 have for some time past been employed in testing

liquid dilatation, taken in conjunction with those on vapour
tension by M. Regnault, lately published in his second volume

both, and chemically pure, so that the data are valuable for

stant ratio to this coefficient, depends on the value of the second
differential of expansion; so that if the series of observations are
not sufficiently correct or regular to give a tolerably approximate
constancy of value to the second difference, they will fail to afford

But instead of this value of F being maintained, after examining
graphically and otherwise a considerable number of M. Pierre's

that on an average              it is less at the lower than at the higher

tunately previously overlooked entirely, although two of the
liquids chosen, viz. sulphurous acid and muriatic ether, are per
haps the best that could be selected for testing a theory, as they
expand upwards of one-third of their volume on being heated to
about 130°, and below this limit of temperature the difference in
the march of the thermometers of air and mercury is too small
to cause embarrassment. Also they are specifically distinct in
their chemical relations—one               having      its   elements       O   and

   It will be remarked that P. =P, very nearly in these two
liquids; but this must be an accidental coincidence, as the nume
rical value of P obviously varies inversely as the numerical value
which may be arbitrarily given to the volume at 0°.
   There are various considerations with respect to molecular
volume, and the relation of h and y reckoned from the zero of
gaseous tension, that it would be proper to enter upon if it were
decided that this is the true general law of liquid-expansion;
but, as in the former case, we may be too hasty in this.     only                           I
hope that what is here set forth may lead to further inquiry.
The simplicity of the new differential equation is greater than
the previous one—a material point in      favour, since true pro     its
gress and simplicity seem always        together.            to    go

854         Dr. Williamson on the Dynamics of the Galvanic Battery.
made in an evening discourse delivered before the British
Association at Newcastle, “On the Dynamics of the Galvanic
Battery.”
   Mr. Napier quotes from my discourse a paragraph illustrating,
in the very simple case of aqueous hydrochloric acid, some general
facts respecting the atomic motions which occur in electrolysis.
He does not deny the continuous evolution of hydrogen at the
negative pole, and of chlorine at the positive pole; nor does he
point out any fault in my reasoning upon these well-known facts,
But he         proceeds to apply what he mistakes for the principle of
my explanation to an example of his own selection, and finding
himself at fault, endeavours to throw the blame on me.
   His experiment is the passage of a galvanic current through a
solution of sulphate of copper divided by a porous diaphragm
into two equal portions, one copper pole being immersed in one
portion, while the other copper pole is immersed in the other
portion.   He asserts that, according to my “assumed theory,”
there must be through this diaphragm a transfer of copper
towards the negative pole equal to the transfer of the chlorous
element towards the positive pole; whereas experiment shows an
exhaustion of          all
                   the salt  the negative division, and corre
                                  in                                               a
                                                                                   -
sponding accumulation         the positive division.
                                                                                   -
                               in
  Not only have made      I      no
                               statement implying        equal velocity
                                                                    an

to of
   movement            of                                     have yet     I
   learn that the existence            of
                                    such  equality  would     any de          in
gree favour my argument,              or
                                 that the absence        such equality.
                                                                    of
would militate against my argument.
I    said that the atom      hydrogen which has given
                               of                                 chlo        up   its
rine     the positive pole combines with chlorine from the next
          at
molecule      hydrochloric acid; and this
                of                               equally true whether
                                                          is
it moves towards the     chlorine,              or
                                        whether the chlorine moves
towards          certainly never took
                it.   I                   for granted,
                                                     it     Mr. Napier   as
imagines, that the atoms make equal advances towards each other.
Indeed Mr. Napier quotes my very words:                         “It
                                                           unnecessaryis

motion takes place, but there          doubt
                                           is   nothe fact,” &c.

 an equation of the nth degree in c, the coefficient of each power
 of c being a symmetrical function of the n values of p. This
 result contains only one element of arbitrariness; whereas if we
 had proceeded by resolution and separate integration, we should
 have introduced n unconnected constants or arbitrary functions.
    3. These two kinds of solution—the solution at large, and the
 connected or systematic solution, as they may be called—may
be illustrated by any example which admits of being dealt with
both ways.       Take, for example, the equation of the second

I have   subjoined to this paper a note containing an independent
discussion of this somewhat remarkable partial equation.
   10. There are, it is obvious, some cases in which the partial
equation admits of a particular solution being easily found, so
as to be available for the solution of the ordinary differential
equation; and it may also in many cases be solved under some
restrictive hypothesis, the result indicating whether the hypo
thesis is a legitimate one. In fact, it follows the analogy of the
partial equation of the first order which we make use of in the
integration of equations of the first degree.    (See Boole's Diff.
Eq. chap.           v.)

                   Prof. Magnus on the Constitution of the Sun.                                           377
the remark that the photosphere defined the outermost border
of the sun, but that the sun, as he inferred from observations
on the protuberances seen during a total eclipse, is surrounded
by a transparent atmosphere.      Herschel said that the photo
sphere was neither a liquid nor an elastic fluid, but that it con
sisted of luminous clouds*.     According to our present know
ledge of the radiation of light and heat, it is difficult to suppose
that the photosphere, which sends out the heat of the sun, should
not have the nucleus which it encloses heated to ignition.                                                The
reflecting atmosphere assumed to exist between it and the nucleus
may indeed hinder the illumination of the latter, but not its
becoming gradually heated.                Kirchhofft is therefore right when
he   says  that this     hypothesis     for the explanation of the spots on
the sun is so completely in opposition to the higher physical
principles that we must abandon                  even      it,

trum have led Kirchhoff                the  supposition
                                            to            that the sun      com                  is

   Whether the soda exists in the luminous flame in the form of
vapour, or whether single torn off pieces of this body increase
the illuminating power, will not here be considered; for the sake
                 I
of brevity. will choose the designation soda-vapour. When,
instead of this vapour, a piece of platinum was brought into the
part of the flame which was experimented upon, a still greater
radiation of heat occurred. Obviously the platinum plate abs
tracted more heat than the soda, and yet the radiation was
greater.    By taking a plate 55 millims. in diameter, the radia
tion from the flame amounted to nearly double as much as pre
viously, when the flame was non-luminous. Whether a platinum
plate somewhat thicker or thinner was used made no apparent
difference, provided that it had always the same diameter. But
if, instead      of
                  making the plate thicker,          was covered with car
                                                         it
bonate     of
            soda,   then the radiation would increase afresh, and                         so
considerably          asbecome half
                           to               much greater
                                                   as              as
                                                               before, when
the plate without sodium was used.
    The radiation rose still higher when,                in

as  the non-luminous flame.
    Lithium and strontium-salts acted like sodium-salts.
    These experiments show that gaseous bodies radiate very much
                             liquids;        can therefore hardly      main   be

-     GENTLEMEN,                          Madras, March 11, 1864.
    HAVE only lately seen a paper which appeared at p. 156
     of No. 166 of this Journal.  This paper contains one or two
errors which M. Dufour,                       I
                            have no doubt, will be glad to have
corrected.
   The contribution to which he refers was made by Troop
Quarter-Master                J.
                   Mitchell, of the Madras Horse Artillery; and
the fuses were not burned at the Himalayas, but at the Artillery
Depot at St. Thomas's Mount near Madras, at Bungalore on
the tableland of Mysore, and at Kotagherry and Ootacamund
on the Neilgherries, at the respective altitudes of about 180,
3000, 6500, and 7300 feet above the level of the sea.
   The experiment made here was on too limited a scale to do
more than show that the combustion of fuses is retarded at con
siderable elevations; but that was        that was sought.      Our    all
fuses had burned too  long    the annual practice
                                              at      Bungalore  on                     at
two following years, and     pointed out the difference

           On the Cooling Effect produced on Solids by Tension.                                                    381
force is exerted so as to pull them separate from each other.
But the cooling effect which takes place shows that more force
disappears than simply what is exerted by the weight; for the
cooling effect is caused by the disappearance of force in the shape
of heat from the body itself. The force exerted by the weight
disappears in performing work against the cohesion of the par
ticles of the body stretched. But what becomes of the force in
the form of heat which disappears from the body at the same
time? It must be consumed in performing work of some kind
or other. The force exerted by the weight cannot be the cause
of the cooling effect. The transference of force from the weight
to the body may be the cause of a heating effect—an increase of
force in the body; but this transference of force to the body
cannot be the cause of a decrease of force in the body.                         a                                  If
 decrease of force     actually  follows the     application   of  tension,   the
weight can only be the occasion, not the cause of the decrease.
    In what manner, then, does the stretching of the body by the
weight become the occasion of                 losing force   its  the shape               in                            of

THE“On   the Distillation of Mixtures: a Contribution to the Theory
of Fractional Distillation.” By J. A. Wanklyn, Esq.
   There are many points in the boiling of mixtures which are ob
scure.   The tension of the vapours at the temperature whereat the
mixture boils, and the proportions in which the constituents of the
mixture are present, are not the only factors which determine the
relative rates at which the constituents distil. There have, for in
stance, to be taken into account the adhesion of the liquids to one
another, and the vapour-densities of these liquids. On the present
occasion I have to call attention to the influence of this latter ele
ment, which influence seems to have been lost sight of by most of
those who have applied themselves to this subject.
   Leaving out of account for a moment the influence of adhesion,
and simplifying the influence of the proportion in which the ingre
dients are present by taking equal weights of two liquids of different
boiling-points, we may set down the rates at which these ingredients
will distil as determined by the tensions of the liquids and the den
sities of the vapours.   In the first instant of time the quantity of
each ingredient which distils will be found by multiplying           ten                   its
         the boiling-point         of                         by   its
                                                     vapour-density.
                                                                                                 of It
sion  at                        the mixture
thus appears that the liquid with the highest tension will not
necessity distil the quickest, for what the other liquids want       ten                   in
                                  by
                          so up
sion they may make            the greater density     the vapours which

they give off. And         when we mix         more volatile with
                                                         a           less                  a
volatile liquid and proceed        distil the mixture, we shall now and
                                        to
then find that the less volatile liquid distils faster than the more

which shows that in this                case the less volatile constituent                  had boiled
the faster, the less volatile iodide of ethyle having a very much
higher vapour-density than methyl-alcohol.
   It will be obvious that when the vapour-densities and tensions
are inversely proportional, the mixture must distil over unchanged.
This influence of vapour-density goes a great way to explain why
homologous bodies are so difficult of separation by means of frac
tional distillation. The more complex the formula the higher the
boiling-point, but also the higher the vapour-density, and therefore
the greater the value of the vapour.   Why, oils, &c. distil so readily
in steam is also explained; for aqueous vapour is one of the lightest,
 while oily vapours are generally heavy.

  “Notes, principally on Thermo-electric Currents of the Ritterian

   The electromotive force of a thermo-electric couple is a function of
the nature of the metals of which it is composed, and of the tempe
ratures of the junctions.  It is expressed in this paper by

the sun's disc is nearly double that from             borders, and that the              its
equatorial regions are somewhat hotter than the polar, whilst

same extent as the upper end, and the column thus becomes
shorter.  The fall will continue until the column is reduced
to that length which the atmosphere is capable of support
ing, and the scale attached thus registers what is ordinarily
termed the height of the barometer.
   From the above description it will be evident that,
by merely varying the proportion in the size of the two
parts of the tube, a scale of any length can be obtained.
For example, if the tubes are very nearly the same size in
bore, the column has to pass through a great distance
before the necessary compensation takes place, and we
obtain a very long scale, say 10 inches, for every 1-inch
rise and fall in the ordinary barometer.                   But if the lower
tube is made much              larger   than the     upper,    the mercury
passing into it quickly compensates, and we obtain a
small scale, say from 2 to 3 inches, for every inch. To
ascertain how many inches this would rise and fall for
an ordinary inch of the barometer, I attach                              con         it,   in

  March 4, 1864.—“On the Discrimination of Organic Bodies by
their Optical Properties.” By Professor G. G. Stokes, M.A., D.C.L.,
Sec.  R.S.
    The chemist who deals with the chemistry of inorganic substances
has ordinarily under his hands bodies endowed with very definite
reactions, and possessing great stability, so as to permit of the em
ployment of energetic reagents.    Accordingly he may afford to dis
pense with the aids supplied by the optical properties of bodies,
though even to him they might be of material assistance. The pro
perties alluded to are such as can be applied to the scrutiny of
organic substances; and therefore the examination of the bright
lines in flames and incandescent vapours is not considered. This
application of optical observation, though not new in principle (for
it was clearly enunciated by Mr. Fox Talbot more than thirty       years
ago), was hardly followed out in relation to chemistry, and remained
almost unknown to chemists until the publication of the researches
of Professors Bunsen and Kirchhoff, in consequence of which it has
now become universal.
   But while the chemist who attends to inorganic compounds may
confine himself without much loss to the generally-recognized modes
of research, it is to his cost that the organic chemist, especially one
who occupies himself with proximate analysis, neglects the immense
assistance which in many cases would be afforded him by optical
examination of the substances under his hands.      It is true that the
method is of limited application, for a great number of substances
possess no marked optical characters; but when such substances do
present themselves, their optical characters afford facilities for their
chemical study of which chemists generally have at present little
conception.
   Two distinct objects may be had in view in seeking for such infor:
mation as optics can supply relative to the characters of a chemical
substance.   Among the vast number of substances which chemists
have now succeeded in isolating or preparing, and which in many
cases have been but little studied, it often becomes a question whether
two substances, obtained in different ways, are or are not identical.
In such cases an optical comparison of the bodies will either add to
the evidence of their identity, the force of the additional evidence
being greater or less according as their optical characters are more
or less marked, or will establish a difference between substances
which might otherwise erroneously have been supposed to be
identical.

well-marked dark bands in the yellow and green.] These bands, first
noticed by Hoppe, are eminently characteristic of blood, and afford a
good example of the facilities which optical examination affords for
following a substance which possesses distinctive characters of this
nature.    On adding to a solution of blood a particular salt of copper
(any ordinary copper salt, with the addition of a tartrate to prevent
precipitation, and then carbonate of soda), a fluid is obtained
utterly unlike blood in colour, but showing the characteristic bands
of blood, while at the same time a good deal of the red is absorbed,
as it would be by the copper salt alone.           On adding, on the
other  hand,  acetic acid to a solution of  blood, the colour is merely
changed to a browner red, without any precipitate being produced.
Nevertheless, in the spectrum of this fluid the bands of blood have
wholly vanished, while another set of bands less intense, but still
very characteristic, make their appearance.      This alone, however,
does not decide whether the colouring matter is decomposed or not
by the acid; for as blood is an alkaline fluid, the change might be
supposed to be merely analogous to the reddening of litmus. To
decide the question, we must examine the spectrum when the fluid
is again rendered alkaline, suppose by ammonia, which does not
affect the absorption bands of blood.    The direct addition of ammo
nia to the acid mixture causes a dense precipitate, which contains
the colouring matter, which may, however, be separated by the use
merely of acetic acid and ether, of which the former has been already
used, and the latter does not affect the colouring matter of blood.
This solution gives the same characteristic spectrum as blood to which
acetic acid has been added; but now there is no difficulty in obtain
ing the colouring matter in an ammoniacal solution. In the spec
trum of this solution, the sharp absorption bands of blood do not
appear, but instead thereof there is a single band a little nearer to
the red, and comparatively vague [this was shown on a screen].
This difference of spectra decides the question, and proves that hae
matine (the colouring matter prepared by acid, &c.)              Hoppe                    is,     as

 Discrimination         of Organic     Bodies by their    optical Properties. 391
[The spectrum of sulphocyanide of peroxide of iron was shown, for
the sake of contrasting with blood.]        Hence the appearance of such
a  peculiar  system  of bands of  absorption  in blood would negative the
supposition that its colour is due to a salt of iron as such, even had
we no other means of deciding.         The assemblage of the facts with
which we are acquainted seems to show that the colouring matter is
some complex compound of the five elements, oxygen, hydrogen,
carbon, nitrogen, and iron, which, under the action of acids and
otherwise, splits into haematine and an albuminous substance.
   This example was dwelt on, not for its own sake, but because
general methods are most readily apprehended in their application
to particular examples. To show one example of the discrimination
which may be effected by the prism, the spectra were exhibited of
the two kinds of red glass which (not to mention certain inferior
kinds) are in common use, and which are coloured, one by gold, and
the other by suboxide of copper.        Both kinds exhibit a single band
of  absorption  near the   yellow  or green;   but the band of the gold
glass is situated very sensibly nearer to the blue end of the spectrum
than that of the copper glass.
   In the experiments actually shown, a battery of fifty cells and
complex apparatus were employed, involving much trouble and ex
pense.     But this was only required for projecting the spectra on a
screen, so as to be visible to a whole audience. To see them, nothing
more is required than to place the fluid to be examined (contained,
suppose, in a test-tube) behind a slit, and to view it through a small
prism applied to the naked eye, different strengths of solution being
tried in succession.      In this way the bands may be seen by anyone
in far greater   perfection  than when, for the purpose of a lecture, they
are thrown on a screen.
     In order to be able to examine the peculiarities which a substance
may possess in the mode in which it absorbs light, it is not essential
that the substance should be in solution, and viewed by transmission.
Thus, for example, when a pure spectrum is thrown on a sheet of
paper painted with blood, the same bands are seen in the yellow and
green region as when the light is transmitted through a solution of
blood, and the spectrum thrown on a white screen.                 This indicates
that the colour of such a      paper is in fact due to  absorption,     although
the  paper  is viewed    by  reflected   light.   Indeed,   by   far the greater
number of coloured     objects   which are    presented   to us,   such as green
leaves, flowers, dyed cloths, though ordinarily seen by reflexion, owe
their colour to absorption.        The light by which they are seen                   is, it
   true, reflected, but         not     reflexion that the preferential selec

from, or absorbed by, fibres lying more deeply.        At each reflexion
the various kinds of light are reflected in as nearly as possible the
same proportion; but in passing across the fibres, in going and
returning, they suffer very unequal absorption on the part of the
colouring matter, so that in the aggregate of the light perceived the
different components of white light are present in proportions widely
different from those they bear to each other in white light itself, and
the result is a vivid colouring.
   There are, however, cases in which the different components of
white light are reflected with different degrees of intensity, and the
light becomes coloured by regular reflexion.       Gold and copper may
be referred to as examples. In ordinary language we speak of a sol
dier's coat as red, and gold as yellow. But these colours belong to
the substances in two totally different senses.       In the former case
the  colouring  is due to   absorption, in the latter case to reflexion.
In the same sense, physically speaking, in which a soldier's coat is
red, gold is not yellow but blue or green.         Such          fact, the                is,   in

 fluorescent substance (as distinguished from a mixture) is examined
 in a pure spectrum, it is found that on passing from the extreme
 red to the violet and beyond, the fluorescence commences at a cer
 tain point of the spectrum, varying from one substance to another,
 and continues thence onwards, more or less strongly in one part
 or another according to the particular substance.      The colour of
 the fluorescent light is found to be nearly constant throughout
 the spectrum.    Hence, when in a solution presented to us, and ex
 amined in a  pure  spectrum, we notice the fluorescence taking, as it
 were, a fresh start, with a different colour, we may be pretty sure
 that we have to deal with a mixture of two fluorescent substances.
     It might be inferred a priori, that fluorescence at any particular
 part of the spectrum would necessarily be accompanied by absorp
tion, since otherwise there would be a creation of vis viva; and
experience shows that rapid absorption (such as corresponds to
 a well-marked minimum of transparency indicated by a determinate
band of absorption in the transmitted light) is accompanied by
 copious fluorescence.      But experience has hitherto also shown,
 what could not have been predicted, and may not be universally
true", that conversely, absorption is accompanied, in the case of a
fluorescent substance, by fluorescence.
     From what precedes it follows that the colour of the fluorescent
light of a solution, even when the incident light is white, or merely
 sifted by absorption, may be a useful character.      To illustrate this,
the electric  light, after transmission through  a deep-blue   glass, was
thrown on solutions in weak ammonia of two       crystallized substances,
aesculine and fraxine, obtained from the bark of the horse-chestnut:
the latter of the two occurs also in the bark of the ash, in which,
indeed, it was first discovered.      Both solutions exhibited a lively
fluorescence; but the colour was different, being blue in the case of
aesculine, and bluish green in the case of fraxine. A purified solu
tion obtained from the bark exhibits a fluorescence of an interme
diate colour, which would suffice to show that aesculine would not
alone account for the fluorescence of the solution of the bark.
   When a substance possesses well-marked optical properties, it is
in general nearly as easy to follow it in a mixture as in a pure solu
tion. But if the problem which the observer proposes to himself
be, Given a solution of unknown substances which presents well
   * Fluorescent substances, like others, doubtless absorb the invisible
heat-rays lying beyond the extreme red, in a manner varying from one sub
stance to another.    Hence, if we include such rays in the incident spectrum,
we have an example of absorption not accompanied by fluorescence.           But
the invisible heat-rays differ from those of the visible spectrum (as there is
every reason to believe) only in the way that the visible rays of one part of
the spectrum differ from those of another, that         is,   by
                                                              wave-length, and
consequently by refrangibility, which depends      on  wave-length.   Hence it
is not improbable that substances may       be  discovered which absorb the
visible rays in some parts   of  the spectrum less refrangible than that    at
which the fluorescence commences; and mixtures possessing this property
may    bemade at  pleasure.   Nevertheless the speaker has not yet met with
a pure fluorescent substance which exhibits this phenomenon.

marked characters with reference to different parts of the spectrum,
to determine what portion of these characters belongs to one sub
stance, and what portion to another, it presents much greater diffi
culties.  It was with reference to this subject that the second of the
objects mentioned at the beginning of the discourse had been spoken
of as that the attainment of which was by far the more difficult.
The problem can, in general, be solved only by combining processes
of chemical separation, especially fractional separation, with optical
observation.   When a solution has thus been sufficiently tested,
those characters which are found always to accompany one another,
in, as nearly as can be judged, a constant proportion, may, with the
highest probability, be regarded as belonging to one and the same
substance.    But while a combination of chemistry and optics is in
general required, important information may sometimes be obtained
from optics alone.   This is especially the case when one at least of
the substances present is at the same time fluorescent and peculiar
in      its
       mode    absorption.

   Hence, for one and the same source of heat, the proportion of rays
which pass (eliminating a constant quantity of heat which fails
directly on the plate) diminishes as the distance from the source
increases,   and the more rapidly the greater the diffusive power
of the screen.
   7. By conveniently arranging the experiment, it is possible to
cause this transmission in greater abundance of the rays from a source
at 100°, compared with those of a lamp (mentioned in No. 1), to dis
appear, and even, conversely, to bring about a greater transmission
of the heat of the lamp.

   1. In the passage of calorific rays through rock-salt covered by
lampblack, an elective absorption (suspected by Melloni) is pro
duced.   A diffusive effect (supposed by Forbes) is never produced
by the rough surface of the layer of lampblack, but sometimes in
consequence of a tarnishing of the plate of salt during        being                          its

unpolished surface diminishes as the angle of incidence increases, and
passes finally into regular reflexion.
   2. Between polished plates, and plates roughened on their two
surfaces, there are intermediate states such that a calorific coloration
of the transmitted rays is produced, quite independently of the effect
produced in the interior of the substance, and solely in consequence
of the mechanical properties of the surface.
   3. Hence in reference to unpolished or turbid media, it is neces
sary to discriminate between a diffusion which always takes place,
and an elective absorption which sometimes occurs.
   4. Fused common salt produced a diffusion, but no calorific colo
ration.
   5. A piece of old rock-salt, found to be chemically and mechani
cally impure, exerted a diffusive action as well as an elective absorp
tion. Analogous conditions explain the divergent observations which
have been made in various experiments with rock-salt.—Poggen

then again follows a period of rapid augmentation.
    With the cast-iron bars, the second period of rapid increase is also
observed, but in a less marked degree, but with the wrought iron it
does not exist.
    The author believes he may conclude from his experiments, that
the magnetic properties of iron are developed suddenly at a determi

LXIV.     On the Measurement of Heights by the Barometer, and on
     Atmospheric Refraction, having regard to the Constitution of the
     Atmosphere, resulting from Mr. James Glaisher's Observations.
     By Count PAUL DE SAINT-RoberTº.
                                                                                            Maga
IN zine
    a former brief paper, published in the Philosophical
         for February 1864, I pointed out the incompatibility
of the barometrical formula, generally used for the computation
of heights, with the constitution of the atmosphere as found by
Mr. James Glaisher in his balloon-ascents, and showed the
modification that it must undergo in order to take into account
the conditions of temperature actually observed in ascending
into the atmosphere.
   Having since calculated the density of the successive strata of
the atmosphere arising out of Mr. Glaisher's results,        have                           I
noticed that the density of the                           air
                                  decreases nearly uniformly                                     as
the height increases.       This law        density being admitted, the

  402           Count Paul de Saint-Robert on the Measurement
  of the results to which it leads with those observed; but I think
  it was never confirmed by direct observations of the density of
  the successive strata of the atmosphere; nor do I think that it
  has been used heretofore in the formula for the measurement of
  heights by the barometer.
                           I.   Constitution of the Atmosphere.
    The condition of any stratum of the atmosphere depends upon
 five quantities—namely, the temperature t, the pressure p, the
 elasticity or of the aqueous vapour, the density p, and the dis
 tance r from the earth’s centre. These quantities are linked
 together by two equations; of which the first is the equation of
 equilibrium,

     Now      if     we

 other relations among the five quantities above mentioned, the

                                 to  the   vapour  mixed with the air,
 then only one relation, either theoretical        experimental, added  or
     the two first, would                 be
 of to
                               sufficient                      to

   In order to avoid a vicious circle, we must put aside the heights
calculated by Laplace's formula grounded on a law of decrement
of heat inconsistent with that found by Mr. Glaisher, and we
must have the pressure corresponding to each temperature and
state of humidity.          This is easily done by an inverse operation
from that employed by Mr. Glaisher to calculate the heights.

  A   glance at Table           III.
                            will enable one to see that the law of
uniform decrease is a  pretty   near approximation to the true law
of decrease. We perceive indeed that the diminution of density
is slower the higher we ascend, but the law of uniform decrease
holds very nearly the whole way from the level of the sea up to
30,000 feet; while Bessel's assumption deviates much more from
the results of actual observations.                           I
                                         think that, without looking
for a more complicated law, we may well adopt this for calcula
ting by the barometer heights, that never reach that limit, and
for determining atmospheric refraction, which, as we shall see
further on, is for the most part dependent on the first envelope
of     air
       not extending very                     far
                                from the earth’s surface.

the higher strata, which do not materially affect the inquiries we

the remainder of the atmosphere.
   It might be objected to this explanation of Biot, that, in order
to reach the angle of 74°, it is necessary to ascend to a very great
elevation. For instance, the luminous trajectory which arrives
horizontally at the earth's surface must be retraced to the height
of ºth of the earth's radius in order to arrive at an angle of
incidence of 74°.       Very likely the atmosphere does not extend
so far.    But we must remark that, once arrived at a certain ele
vation, the extreme tenuity of air renders the amount of refrac
tion so small that it may be well supposed to depend only on the
density of the air at that place, though the angle of incidence
should not yet be reduced to the limit of 74°.
   To exemplify this,                let     us
                                   consider the luminous trajectory

     Laplace was the first to observe that, if a mixture of vapour
  with dry air diminishes the refractive power by making the den
  sity less, the greater action of the vapour upon light is found
  almost exactly to compensate the defect.        This was confirmed
  experimentally by Biot and Arago.        The consequence    of this                                                                 is,

                             is often repeated that the refraction
computed on the hypothesis of uniformly decreasing density is
less than the truth.   But I may observe that this happens only
when the rate of the decrease of density is taken too small.     All
works which treat of astronomical refraction on the assumption
of an equable decrease of density take the height of the atmo
sphere at double that of a homogeneous atmosphere.             Now
although this height is that derived from the condition that the
pressure and density are reduced to zero simultaneously at the
upper limit of the atmosphere, yet it does not correspond to the
real decrease of density observed in the inferior strata. The
consideration of the higher strata of the atmosphere, which have
no sensible effect on refraction, is of little importance to                            us.

    The value of the refraction corresponding to this difference of
level comes out 2'33", viz. about 11th of the angle at the centre
of the earth.
    In the Mesure d'un Arc du Parallèle Moyen, the altitude arrived
at is 3798"2, which corresponds to a refraction of 1'46", or
#5th nearly of the angle at the centre.     It is presumable that
the zenith-distance there given is rather too great; for the alti
tude of Monviso is 3836 metres according to Coraboeuf, and
3840 metres according to the Etat Major Piémontais. In rea
lity the distance between Turin and Monviso is too large for the
 base of a hypsometrical triangle: an error of 1" in the zenith
 distance produces an error of about 19 metres in the altitude.
Even neglecting the refraction, the altitude of Monviso with
these data would only come out 3833.4 metres.

426           Mr. C. Tomlinson      on a new Variety   of
if  not chemically pure, of the same liquid, produced in various
countries and under different conditions; (2) the examination
 of such specimens, with the view of obtaining standard co
hesion-figures;     and (3) the effect of admixtures of different
liquids in various proportions on such figures.        I had already
taken considerable pains in ascertaining the figures of a number
 of liquids; and not being able to bestow the time required for
                                    I
further investigation, even were able to command the speci
 mens, it seemed best to lay the subject before such societies as
 those named, many of the members and students of which had
 remarkable facilities for carrying it out; and besides this, as the
journals of those societies circulate largely among persons       in
 terested in the possession of a ready test for determining the
 purity of commercial oils and other liquids, the subject was
 likely to attract the attention of practical men.
    Most of the figures described in my papers are produced by
 placing a drop of liquid on the surface of chemically clean water
in a chemically clean glass; and the phenomena are confined to
 the surface.    If the drop be placed on any other surface than
 water, such as sulphuric acid, acetic acid, alcohol, benzole, &c.,
the figures vary, because the adhesive force, the diffusibility, &c.
 vary.  If  the drop be considerably heavier than the liquid which
forms the adhesive surface, it will sink and diffuse more or less
through the body of the liquid, producing a new set of figures,
                                        I
 of great variety and beauty, which propose to consider in the
present communication.
    A good typical example of this class of cohesion-figures by
submersion (not on the surface, as in the former experiments) is
furnished by a solution of cochineal in distilled water. Three
solutions were made, one with 15 grains, another with 20 grains,
and a third with 40 grains of cochineal, in one fluid-ounce of
distilled water. The solutions were filtered, and, after each had
run through, half an ounce of water was poured on the filter;
and three other solutions were thus obtained, and were kept
apart. A single drop of one of these solutions was delivered
from a pipette to the surface of water contained in a cylindrical

surface,it   expands into a   ring, sinks   ashort distance further,
and then becomes poised (see Plate IV. Cochineal, No.       1).  The
more diffusive   portionsof   the colouring  matter stream  upwards

 few years ago, sent him a copy of a paper on this part of my
 subject.      I lost no time in reading this paper in the American
 Journal of Science for September 1858*, and was delighted at
 the ingenious mode in which the subject had been treated. An
 apparatus was constructed, from which rings of the vapour of
 sal-ammoniae could be shot out into the air at pleasure, while

have attempted to combine both cases in the figure, where the
globule a may be either a bubble of PHs about to burst and
project a ring of smoke into the air, or it may be a drop of liquid
about to descend in water, benzole, ether, &c., as in the previous
experiments.    The ring of smoke, or the liquid ring, acts as if
rolling up or down the inside of a hollow cone, and the direction
of rotation of the particles will be found according to this view.
In both cases the tendency of the ring is constantly to enlarge
by diffusion, and the rate at which it does enlarge is regulated by
the resistance of the liquid column or of the air. The resistance
of the liquid column is much greater for the liquid ring than of
the     for the smoke ring; and hence the liquid rings
        air                                                 not                                            do           ex

from my researches on the displacement of the interference
bands by means of thin metallic plates.
    At the same time, however, the theory of elliptical polariza
tion, as developed by Cauchy, Beer, and F. Eisenlohr, leads to
this, that the refractive index of the metals, just like the ex
tinction-coefficient, is a function of the angle of incidence; and
 indeed it follows that (see Phil. Mag. vol. xxvii. p. 169)

   From this it appears that, as a rule, the displacement for
light polarized parallel to the plane of incidence is about 0.1 of
the distance of the fringes greater than for light polarized per
pendicular to the plane of incidence,—or that, in accordance
with my experiments with the Babinet’s compensator, the rays
polarized in the plane of incidence are before the others. These
last rays polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence un
dergo at I=70° no more displacement; hence, according to
equation (5),       m=70°, cosm–n=0.342.
It is here indeed supposed  that the rays polarized perpendicular to
the  plane   of incidence  undergo     no alteration in phase by
traversing the metal   plate;  and this, according to other experi
ments of mine, seems to be not in                      all

          LXVIII.    On Kirchhoff's Theory    of Solar Spots.
                         By P. A. SEcchiº.
          theory of solar spots proposed by Prof.         Kirchhoff, in
THEplace      of the one hitherto received, was briefly      noticed by
us in the Bull. Meteorologico   dell’Osserv. Romano (No. 2, vol. ii.).
The proposer having by his beautiful spectrum discoveries,
meritoriously acquired an immense popularity and esteem, his
theory has attracted considerable attention; a few remarks on
the subject, therefore, based on the various researches which
have recently been made, will not be out of place.
   Prof. Kirchhoff rejects the theory of W. Herschel as well as that
of Wilson; which two theories, we may here observe, are so far
distinct that the confutation of the one does not necessarily in
volve the fall of the other. Herschel imagined the solar nucleus
to be solid and dark-coloured, but surrounded by two strata of
luminous clouds, separated from one another by a non-luminous
stratum, and he attributed the spots to the rents in these enve
lopes. According to him, the nuclei consist of the compara
tively dark body of the sun itself seen through apertures in both
atmospheres; and the penumbrae are occasioned by the larger
rents of the second luminous stratum.        Prof. Kirchhoff objects
to these two atmospheres—which, we admit, always appeared
objectionable to us also, on the ground of their being unneces
sary, and of their necessitating a simultaneous rent in both.
Numerous careful observations made with powerful instruments
led us some time ago to the conclusion that the penumbrae were,
for the most part, formed either by filaceous currents of the
matter which constitutes the sole photosphere enveloping the
sun, or by the attenuation of the latter until it became trans
parent; at the same time we drew attention to the presence,
within the spots, of veli and cirri, more luminous than their
nuclei, but less so than their penumbrae—thus confirming the
discovery of Dawes, who justly complains that hitherto attention
has not been paid thereto by those who have occupied themselves
with the subject.

           P. A. Secchi              on Kirchhoff's                    Theory       of Solar     Spots.             441
   The attention of observers has recently been drawn to the
willow-leaf structure of the sun’s envelope, indicated by Nasmyth.
To this gentleman—who used a large reflector provided with
oculars, not darkened, but in which the intensity of the light
was diminished and rendered tolerable to the eye by reflexion
from a glass plate—the sun appeared to be formed of innume
rable bright elliptical patches, in the form of leaves, and super
posed on each other; at the contours of the penumbrae they
appeared to be more isolated, and resembled interlaced leaves,
which projected separately into the interior of the nucleus itself.
  Circumstances have not been sufficiently favourable as yet to
permit us to recognize this structure; in this respect, indeed,
Mr. Dawes            has not been more fortunate, for he found the solar
structure, described by Sir                            J.
                                 Herschel as consisting of a kind
of luminous flakes, more in accordance with the phenomena ob
served by himself during many years of research; and with re
spect to the penumbrae, he admits that there are bright portions
like currents, which, commencing in the nuclei, traverse the
penumbrae, and retain     the brilliancy     all
                                              the photosphere rather           of
than    the penumbrae. This agrees with our own observations;
           of
for we have always insisted upon the three distinct constituents
observable    every spot—i.e. the real nucleus, the penumbrae,
                     in
and the semiluminous cirri.     To explain this phenomenon                                                         it    is

of the least luminous?         The conclusion, therefore,       altogether                    is
untenable that the parts which form the solar nucleus must                                                    be

not           either that the so-called nucleus must

                                                 be

that specific vivid action which characterizes the photosphere
does not exist. As Loret well observes, the analogy with other
planets indicates                 to       us
                               that the denser parts must             accu                           be

and amongst the latter are the gases and more subtle materials
 from whose modifications the solar light results. Thus there                                                 is
 no  absurdity whatever involved           the assumption that, under

   Again, to treat Wilson's theory as absurd shows that the same
is confounded with that of Herschel, from which, in reality, it
differs essentially. Wilson merely pronounced the spots to be
cavities; and subsequent observations have proved this to be a
fact. But no one said that these cavities were absolutely empty;
on the contrary, the cirri seen across them show that the cavities
 are filled with less incandescent gaseous matter, which occasionally
is visibly agitated, and thrown into vortices and currents. This
 being the case, what else can these cavities be, if not spaces full of
 less luminous and consequently less incandescent matter? Prof.
 Kirchhoff considers them to be clouds or masses at a lower tem
 perature. When well considered, there is in reality not much dif
 ference between the two hypotheses, provided the terms are well
 defined. This difference is still further diminished when we find
 the origin of these clouds attributed to vortices and cataclysms,
 to which causes we, too, have frequently attributed the origin of
 spots.
    The only controverted point which remains to be decided is
 whether the dark spot termed the nucleus is a portion of the
 general mass under the photosphere, or whether it is produced
 by the opacity of a cloud or more refrigerated mass, which inter
 cepts from us the rays emitted by the subjacent luminous portion.
    This question cannot be decided a priori; it will require an
 examination of the forms and phases of the spots themselves.
Now their forms do not at      agree with thoseall clouds—so                   of
far,  least,
      at       we can judge
                      as     from the  phenomena      our own                       of
atmosphere, and from the properties which        incandescent             an
atmosphere, like that    the sun, mayof   reasonably supposedbe
to   possess.

      fact      the commencement the spots resemble black pores,
                 at

often  remarked,    the nucleus does not always   present  exactly  the

thermoscope. At the same time it is manifest that the source
of these gaps is rather an eruption proceeding from the interior
of the nucleus, than a simple refrigeration produced in the pho
tosphere by causes analogous to our own meteorological ones.
In fact it is difficult to imagine the existence of the latter in
the sun, whilst internal eruptions cannot fail to exist under the
conditions to which that body is exposed.
   Again, just as Herschel, in order to explain the penumbrae,
was induced to assume two strata in the photosphere, so Prof.
Kirchhoff requires two strata of clouds, necessarily coexistent and
superposed one on the other.             This hypothesis of two strata is
in truth a mere expedient for the explanation of the penumbrae,
whose constitution we have already described, and to explain
which it is not necessary to introduce more than a simple pho
tosphere, together with the accessories inseparable therefrom.
The cloud hypothesis has often been reproduced, but always by
those who have either observed the spots with imperfect instru
ments, or who have not studied them very carefully.                  By those
who have had at their disposal better methods of observation,
 the hypothesis has always been rejected.

 appears to evolve oxygen gas when fused.                           -
    The following inferences may be deduced from these experi
 ments. The most negative substances in fused salts are generally
 platinum, gold, carbon, and silver; the most positive substances
 are generally magnesium, aluminium, and zinc.,          Silicium is
 generally electro-positive to carbon; and is strongly positive and
 quickly corroded in fused alkalies, alkaline carbonates, or fluo
 rides. Carbon is not generally very positive to iron.
     The following facts may also be noticed. Copper and silver
  dissolve rapidly in fused sulphide of potassium, tersulphide of
  antimony, or iodide of lead; silver also dissolves freely in iodide
 of barium, or bisulphide of arsenic. Platinum, copper, and silver
 rapidly melt in fused arsenite of soda.      Electric currents were
  repeatedly observed whilst one (or both) of the electrodes was
..coated with unfused salt, and on the fusion of the saline coating
  strong currents in an opposite direction generally occurred.
     The investigation was very suggestive of new experiments; it
  suggested the examination of the various phenomena which acted
  as sources of interference, which  I have already enumerated; it
  also threw light upon the desirable object of obtaining a cheap
  source of electricity by the combustion of coke or gas-carbon.
  The discovery of some suitable fused salt or mixture in which
  carbon is highly electro-positive at a high temperature to iron,
  nickel, or other infusible and suitable conductor, would probably
 prove a cheap and powerful source of electricity; cheap because
  of the low equivalent number of carbon and the low price of
  coke and gas-graphite, and powerful because of the intense affi
 nity of carbon for oxygen at high temperatures, sufficient indeed
 to set the alkali-metals free from their oxides. The nearest
 approach to this object in these experiments was with carbon and
 nickel in a fused mixture of soda, lime, and silica.

     HE  theory of Double Refraction on the hypothesis of undu

not necessary to discuss fully the results obtained relative to the
latter theory. On subsequently testing by numerical examples

pose   it is necessary to take account of the proper elasticity of the
refractive medium in investigating an expression for the accele
ration of an individual atom due to the dynamical action of the
aethereal waves.   In seeking for such an expression, I supposed at
first that the atoms were fixed, and assumed that the condensa
tion or rarefaction of the aether in contact with any atom is always
proportional to the condensation or rarefaction of the wave at the
position where the atom is situated, but is distributed unequally
about the surface, the excess being on the hemisphere on which
the waves are incident, and the distribution being symmetrical
about an axis drawn through the centre in the direction of inci
dence. As the resulting accelerative force in that direction would
thus be proportional to the condensation, and consequently to the
velocity of the incident waves, the expression assumed for it was
                         km sin
                                  *: (cat-a-H c),
k being   a constant factor multiplying the velocity.       At this
point of the reasoning       I
                           omitted to  inquire whether that factor
is a function of A, and subsequently treated it as if it were inde
pendent of that quantity.     This inquiry           I
                                              now propose to enter
upon.
   The whole investigation, it will eventually appear, turns upon
the solution of the following hydrodynamical problem:-A series
of waves defined by the equations
                    V=kaa–m

is incident in a given direction on a fixed smooth sphere of given
radius : it is required to find the condensation at any point of the
surface of the sphere at any instant.    Since in the view I take of
theoretical  physics  this problem is of the utmost importance,                    I
have given to it especial consideration; and though                  I seem  to have
succeeded to a considerable extent in solving              it,
                                                            I        do  not profess
to have completely overcome the difficulties. The                    process I  have
adopted depends       part

          I    have been compelled, for reasons which will appear                 in
the sequel,    to have recourse      inferences drawn from the new
                                       to

 determination of the motion and propagation of plane waves,
 when deduced from only two fundamental equations, presents
 contradictory results which disappear when the third equation is
 also employed, it is not allowable to dispense with the use of this
 equation in any case.     That one instance suffices to prove that
 inferences from the two equations alone, even if not self-contra
 dictory, are not necessarily true.   For the purpose of exhibiting
 clearly the distinction between the two processes, and giving the
 opportunity of judging of their respective merits,      shall attempt                        I
 the solution of the    proposed  problem,  first, by employing   only
 the two usual fundamental     equations, and then    by joining  with
 them the third.
    The reasoning being restricted to the first powers of the velo
 city and condensation, we have the usual equations
            a*do      du                      a?dor     dw                       a*da             dw

                                     #######–0.
 Differentiating the last equation with respect to t, and                                                   substi
 tuting from the other three, we obtain
                                               (d’a

Now, from the conditions of the problem, the condensation at any
given point must be a periodic function of the time, the period
being the same as that of the incident waves.      Hence we may
assume generally that a = f(t)q 1(a, y, z) +f;(t)q 2(a, y, z)+&c.,
provided the functions                   f, f,

   Since from the same three approximate differential equations,

combined with the fourth expressing the principle of constancy
 of mass, a linear differential equation, having constant coefficients
 and a for principal variable, was obtained antecedently to any
supposed case of motion, it follows that the mutual action of the
 parts of the fluid is such as to be consistent with the coexistence
of small motions.
     Having thus indicated the processes of reasoning which con
 ducted to rectilinear awes of motion, to vibratory motion, and to
the coexistence of vibrations, prior to supposing any case of mo
tion, and having elsewhere given in full the investigation of exact
 analytical expressions for the vibrations parallel and transverse to
the rectilinear axis (see the Philosophical Magazine for May
1849), I have now to add a remark of essential importance in
the present inquiry.      On passing from these antecedent general
inferences to the consideration of particular cases of disturbance
of the fluid, it is necessary to proceed on the principle that the
state of the fluid as to velocity and condensation is both initially
and subsequently consistent with the previously demonstrated
general characteristics.      Thus, for instance, a series of plane
waves must be conceived to be composed of vibrations parallel and
 transverse to rectilinear axes unlimited in number and all per
 pendicular to the plane fronts of the waves. This instance          I
have especially considered in the article on Double Refraction
in the December Number, where reasons are also given for con
cluding that in consequence of this composition of vibrations
lateral divergence is prevented, and the motion might be com
prised within a cylindrical space of very small transverse section.
 This result from the mathematical theory of undulations is sin
 gularly in accordance with the phenomenon of the transmission
of a thread or pencil of light, a very remarkable fact, of which
I  am not aware that any theoretical explanation had previously
been given.     The result is also worthy of notice as presenting
an instance of small vibrations for which uda + way + wale is
clearly not an exact differential. Further, it is to be observed
that for this composite motion, supposing it to be wholly parallel
to the axis of a, the dynamical equation becomes
the factor k” being introduced, as     I have shown in the Philoso
phical Magazine for November 1853, in passing from free to
constrained rectilinear vibrations.
    In the case for which the vibratory motion is central and is
supposed to be a function of the distance from the centre, ac
count must still be taken of the same law of the composition of
vibrations.    Since, as in the preceding case, the resulting motion

satisfy the condition of making a vanish for large values of r.
This equation gives, by putting r=b, the pressure at any point
of the sphere, from which the acceleration of the sphere by the
total pressure might be calculated.      It is not necessary, for the
present purpose, to perform this calculation.
   According to the above solution the absolute velocity of each
fluid particle in contact with the sphere is directed from or towards
the centre of the sphere, and is equal to T cos 6. Hence at
points for which          6= # the velocity is                    zero.       This result stands
in direct contradiction to the corresponding one of the former
solution, according to which the velocity for the same value of 6
is at the surface of the sphere half that of the sphere itself and
in the contrary direction.    Also since at any point for which
6–3          the velocity is transverse to the same plane, and varies
inversely as the cube of the distance from the centre of the
sphere, it follows that at each instant just as much fluid is flow
ing backwards as in the direction of the sphere's motion, and
that there is absolutely no transfer of the fluid by the impulse
of the sphere.       Certainly the condition of constancy of mass is
satisfied  by this  result,  the general equation expressing that con
dition   having, in  fact,  formed an essential part of the basis of the
reasoning.     But when it is considered that the fluid is unlimited
in  extent,  and that the impulse is propagated indefinitely into
space, the result clearly involves an incompatibility which indi
cates that the premises of the reasoning are either false or insuf
ficient.   According to the views                        I
                                          am maintaining, they are                                  in

As this equation has been obtained by perfectly general consi
derations, it is applicable to any instance of small motions. In
the case of symmetrical motion relative to an axis, produced by a
vibrating sphere, as also in that of the like motion due to the
reaction of the first hemispherical surface of the fixed sphere, it
was found that the motion was wholly in lines normal to the sur
face of the sphere, and the dynamical equation employed is that
which the above equation becomes when the condition of central
motion is satisfied.  But in the present question there is no other
condition than that the motion is symmetrical about an axis; in
which case a, u, v, w are functions of the polar coordinates r and
6.   Let u and o be respectively the velocities parallel and per
pendicular to the axis, so that o”=v°+w”, and

which results from the mutual action of the parts of the fluid,

          alloy between 0° and 100° C. is to that calculated between 0° and
          100° C. as the observed conducting-power at 100° C. is to that cal

   The peroxide of cumenyle is procured by a process strictly analogous
to that by which the peroxide of benzoyle is formed; it has the con
stitution C, H, O,.
   The peroxides of butyle and valeryle are prepared by the action of
hydrated peroxide of barium on the anhydrous acid. . It is only
necessary to mix in a mortar equivalent quantities of the two sub
stances. The peroxide is separated by solution in ether from the
water in which it is dissolved and suspended. These substances are
dense oily fluids, exploding slightly when heated, but not so readily
decomposible as the peroxide of acetyle. The analysis of the peroxide
of butyle, dried by chloride of calcium, gave results corresponding
with the formula C, H, O,.

The mode of formation of these peroxides is given in the equation
                         2R, O-H-Ba,     O,-2 Ba RO--R, O.
These substances          are decomposed as well as formed by the action                -

the alkalime    peroxide,      according to the equation
                            R, O,--Ba,0,-2Ba RO-FO,
giving a striking example of those consecutive actions referred to in
a former paper as the cause of certain catalytic decompositions.
    The action of the bibasic anhydrides on the alkaline peroxides is
of special interest.
    When anhydrous succinic acid, lactide, or anhydrous camphoric
acid is mixed with an equivalent of hydrated peroxide of barium, a
solution is obtained possessing the most powerful oxidizing properties,
which bleaches indigo, evolves chlorine with hydrochloric acid, and
oxidizes the protosalts of iron and manganese, but which does not
 discolour permanganic acid, or give with chromic acid the blue colour
formed by peroxide of hydrogen. When boiled, the solutions evolve
oxygen, and afterwards contain a salt of the acid employed—in the
case of succinic acid, giving a crystalline precipitate of succinate of
barium, and in the case of camphoric acid, giving with acetate of
lead a precipitate of camphorate of lead. These solutions are in a
state of continual decomposition.                  Only in one instance, that of cam
phoric acid, was it found possible to analyse the substance, and that
only by indirect processes.               The oxygen contained in the organic
peroxide was estimated in a measured portion of the solution by means
of a standard solution of iodine; the camphoric acid formed on
boiling was determined by precipitation with acetate of lead in another

necessary to state the arrangement adopted at Greenwich.        There
are two wires proceeding from the Observatory, one ending near
Croydon and the other near Dartford (nearly at right angles); and
these are well insulated throughout their entire length, and have
good earth-connexions at their extremities.
   From these, by means of galvanometers, the intensity of earth
currents is recorded for two very favourable directions; and from
these again the intensity of those currents which flow in the magnetic
meridian, and in a direction perpendicular to      may      very easily            it,            be

                                 such discussions.      has been found by          It
General Sabine that        the disturbances of declimation be divided into
                                  if
two categories, easterly and westerly, these obey very different laws
of  daily variation, and also that this difference         not     the same             is         of
description for            all
                     stations;      that we are compelled

netic disturbance as the resultant effect of two disturbances of differ
ent character, superimposed upon one another.                 General Sabine has
likewise stated his opinion that this duality                 action may perhaps  of
be   due    to the disturbing force entering the earth                 two       more        at         or
points, one denoting magnetism                 more permanent kind, and the

same hour        of
                  the second.       When, however, we confine our attention
to  very abrupt changes                    of
                                    force, we find that the disturbance-type
which these display retains more                           of
                                               the same character throughout
a   disturbance.            In
                           order      explain this, we may perhaps suppose
                                                to
that there are two sets            magnetic particles
                                           of                  the earth—one set   in
being   of the nature        soft iron, and the other similar
                                  of                                        hardened               to
steel.    Now only the first                    of
                                        these would         acted           any very

sudden    change       the indisturbing    force, since     would   require   time

order  to  influence the second set. We may thus perhaps account
for the fact that any very sudden change                   one type, since
                                                                         is   of only                       it
influences one set               of

                                                   now consider what will take

disturbing force during that time. The magnetic needle, therefore,
will now be acted on by the joint influence of these two sets of par
ticles, whereas at the beginning of the disturbance it was only acted
on by one of them, namely, the soft-iron ones. The type of force
will therefore have changed if the hard-iron particles are differently
distributed in our globe from the soft-iron ones; and      instead                                           if,                of

 ing strata of the earth's surface, just as a current can only move
backwards or forwards along an insulated wire.        Indeed a little re
flection will show us that earth-currents are not local phenomena; so
that if we endeavour to estimate quantitatively their influence on the
magnet according to the hypothesis of direct action, we must first ex
tend our field of observation, and obtain their value in other countries
besides our own.                        -
    But to return to our comparison of curves. We see that                       the                  for
greater part      of  the disturbance both the horizontal force and                                         the
 declination were very much above their normal lines, while                      the                  on
other hand the currents were frequently crossing their zero lines, and
that both currents were simultaneously and for                    long portion   a                          of
their time very near zero, although during this time the magnetic
disturbance was considerable.
    Next, with respect         to
                                a very abrupt disturbance which commenced
about      50",
           8"      the  corresponding    earth-current curves are exceedingly
powerful, alternately passing and repassing the zero line                     nearly             to
the same distance on both sides, while the absolute disturbance                  the                  of
horizontal   force,   and  probably      the  of
                                              declimation,  was not   very   great.
   We have thus,           the first place,
                          in                    very sluggish action

currents, while the magnetic disturbance was considerable, and                                              in
the next place        very violent action

disturbing force was           by    no
                                    means excessive; and             may add that     we
at    9°50" both earth-currents were near zero, while both elements                                         of
the earth's magnetism were much disturbed.
   For     all
            these reasons this comparison                  of
                                                    the curves       unfavourable     is
to  the hypothesis        of
                           direct action.
   Let     us
           now consider the other hypothesis,            that          or
                                                                   induced action,of
and we shall find the       following   points       infavour,   its
    1st. That     in this disturbance, for      least one hour, both elements
                                                    at
of   the earth’s     magnetic    force remained                  at
                                                          considerable distance

from their normals, and that during this time the earth-currents
observed were exceedingly small. Now,                      on
                                                     the hypothesis         induced             of
action, the earth-current effect depends not                           on
                                                          the absolute value                                of
the disturbing force, but                on

                                                  change; and          during this     if
period      we examine the horizontal-force curve,                shall find the we
abruptness       of change not           so

strong earth-currents, alternately positive and negative, those                  the                  of

 the other hand the corresponding magnetic disturbances were                                          on

                                         the normal lines.
    On the other hand, the following fact seems              first          at
                                                                       tell against        to
 the theory      of
                  induction.      An inspection             of
                                                     the curves will show that
 we have currents remaining                   on
                                         one side                 of
                                                        the zero-line for some

  theless changed in both directions.      When, however, we reflect on
  this circumstance, we are led to see that since we have two sets of
  disturbances taking place simultaneously, so we must also have two
  sets of earth-currents.    Now one of these disturbances, which we may
  perhaps call the soft-iron one, reproduces those small and rapid
  changes which take place in the primary force, while on the other
  hand the hard-iron disturbance averages these small changes and
  presents us with a disturbance-wave of long period.       Precisely, then,
  as in the magnetic curves we have waves of short period superim
  posed upon waves of long period, so will it be in the earth-current
  curves.    Those currents due to the soft-iron disturbances will be
  superimposed upon those due to the hard-iron ones, with this
  difference, that we are not entitled to assume that the proportion in
 intensity between the two simultaneous earth-currents must be pre
 cisely that which exists between the rates of change of the two cor
 responding simultaneous disturbances.        It will be apparent that this
 feature of duality ought also to be presented by the aurora; and here
 it is well known that we have at least two phenomena, one of a more
 fitful and the other of a more permanent character, namely, the
 streamers and the auroral arch.      We may suppose the first of these
 phenomena to correspond to the soft-iron, and the second to the hard
 iron disturbances.      Indeed it is questionable whether the different
  varieties of aurorae are confined to these two; for General Sabine
 has informed me that he himself, along with the late Sir Edward
 Parry, observed at Lerwick in the Shetland Isles in 1818, at the
 same instant, two auroral arches crossing one another at an angle.
 But, be this as it may, when we reflect that there are many kinds of
 particles in our earth, some of which may be affected more rapidly
 than others by a primary magnetic force, we shall cease to wonder
 that the phenomena presented are of a complicated description.
     All these considerations have induced me to think that it is lost
 labour to attempt a quantitative     comparison when our observation
of    the magnetic disturbances and their corresponding earth-currents
is confined to one locality; and it will be seen from this paper, that
 while endeavouring to uphold the hypothesis of induced action,            I
have done so by a comparison of a general and qualitative rather than
by one of a quantitative nature.

Atmospheric Air, between 32°F. and 212°F., and on the Tempe
rature of the Freezing-point       of Mercury.”       By Balfour Stewart,
M.A., F.R.S.           -
    The author gave a detailed description of his apparatus, and of
the method employed in drying the air.
    The result of his experiments gave as the coefficient of increase of
elasticity of air of constant volume for 1°F. 0.002040, this being
slightly different from that given by Regnault, which is 0.002036.
    He also finds that the temperature of the freezing-point of mercury
is constant, and that its value on Fahrenheit's scale, as given by an
air-thermometer, is –37°93, while as recorded by a standard mercu
rial thermometer it is –38°00.         It is probable that this difference
is  owing   to an anomalous contraction of mercury before it freezes,
similar to the corresponding expansion of water; but this effect in the

 case of mercury   seems   to be very small, and it may be said that a

temperature, even down to the freezing-point of the mercury itself.

    1. “Observations on supposed Glacial Drift in the Labrador
Peninsula, Western Canada, and on the South Branch of the Sas
katchewan.” By Professor H. Y. Hind, M.A., F.R.G.S., Trinity
College, Toronto.
    During an exploration of a part of the interior of the Labrador
peninsula, in 1861, the author had an opportunity of observing the
magnitude, distribution, and extraordinary number of the boulders
on the flanks of the tableland of that area; and he commenced
this paper with a detailed account of the results of his observations,
referring also to the forced arrangement of blocks of limestone,
shale, and Laurentian rocks in Boulder-clay at Toronto, and on the
south branch of the Saskatchewan.
    Professor Hind then described briefly the Driftless Area, in Wis
consin, discovered by Prof.     J. D. Whitney, and the conclusions to
which that   geologist   has been led by the study of this district.
He next adverted to the beaches and terraces about the great
Lakes, and considered their origin to be similar to that suggested by
Mr. Jamieson for the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy. The formation
of anchor-ice in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and at the heads of rapids
in the great river itself was alluded to as one of the means by which
river-beds may be excavated.        The parallelism of escarpments in
America, at great distances apart, and at elevations varying from
600 feet to 3000 feet above the sea, was next described, and their
symmetrical arrangement suggested to be the result of glacial rivers
undermining the soft strata of sedimentary rocks in advance of the
glacial mass itself.   These escarpments were also thought to repre
sent different and closely succeeding glacial epochs.
   2. “Notes on the Drift-deposits of the Valley of the Severn, in
the neighbourhood of Coalbrookdale and Bridgenorth.” By George
Maw, Esq., F.S.A., F.L.S.
   The patches of Drift occurring in the Valley of the Severn from
about four miles below Bridgenorth up to Shrewsbury, including a
north and south range of about twenty miles, have been carefully
examined by the author, and were described in detail in this paper.
   Commencing with Strethill, a hill close to the entrance of Coal
brookdale, the author described the several beds which make up the
Drift-deposits of which it is composed, and gave a list of the rocks
which he had found in them.        In the same manner he described in
succession the neighbouring districts in which the Drift-deposits are
exhibited, and gave a list of the fossils which had been found in the
beds at the different localities.

  In conclusion Mr. Maw put forward some hypotheses as to the
period when the degradation of the older formations (the materials
of which compose the Drift) took place, the manner in which the
Drift was deposited, the extent of the submergence of England and

   Dr. Rankine      right  is pointing out my inadvertence
                                       in                           overlook                             in

            on THE HEAT OF THE SUN's RAYs.                                       By M. HAGEN.
   M. Hagen made communication     a        the Berlin Academy   to the                                      on

   1. That the height      the atmosphere, assuming that the layers
                                        of                                                                          of

part    of
        the earth's radius.
  2.  The amount               of
                      the heating effect possessed       the sun's rays                by

          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                                                      479
on entering this atmosphere may be expressed by saying that a
bundle of rays having a section of a square inch would in one minute
raise the temperature of a cubic inch of water by 0.733 of a degree
Centigrade.
   3. The loss of heat in the passage of the rays through the atmo
sphere, according to measurements made on different days and in
different seasons, with apparently clear days, diminishes by amounts
which materially differ from one another.      The logarithms of the
factors which denote the absorption on a path the length of the
earth’s radius vary between —3 and -38.
   These results were finally compared with those of Pouillet, and it
was found that for the factor mentioned, the latter denote indeed
much narrower limits, but still values which coincide with those de
veloped here.    Pouillet, on the other hand, found the heat of the
sun's  rays to be one-eighth less; and this difference appears to be

   STATE OF METEORIC scIENCE.           BY A. S. HERSCHEL, Esq.
   It is a saying of Arago, founded originally upon observation, and
confirmed by constant experience in later years, that the earth en
counters more shooting-stars in going from aphelion to perihelion
than in going from perihelion to aphelion.       In point of fact, be
tween the north latitudes of 49°5 and 54°2, Dr. Julius Schmidt,
the indefatigable Director of the Observatory at Athens, observed,
during eight years, from 1843 to 1850, on an average 470 meteors in
every year.    His observations were distributed in the several months,
according to the following average of the entire series:–
          Anomalistic                                            Shooting-                Total

 more general assumptions, however, of the orbital velocities of me
 teorites, it follows that a more or less powerfully determined current
 of falling stars must arrive upon the earth, owing to its planetary
 motion, from a constantly prevailing direction ninety degrees in lon
 gitude behind the sun.
     On this account a season of frequency of aerolites, shooting-stars,
 and bolides must be expected to succeed, in all latitudes, three
 months later than the summer season of the sun; but, on the other
 hand, a dearth of meteors, in the spring, one quarter of a year later
  than midwinter.        In general, and in all latitudes, the meteoric sea
 sons, or seasons of meteoric frequency, must strictly follow the tropi
 cal seasons, and three months later in the year.                Thus in the earth's
 northern hemisphere the northern pole remains directed to the sun
 from the equinox of March until that of September, and to the
 course of meteors from the solstice of June to the solstice of De
 cember.     The greatest frequency of the meteorites will fall about
 the   equinox   of autumn, in September and October.                    This most
 nearly agrees with European observations.                   The meteoric season of
 Arago may, therefore, be drawn as a consequence from his pla
 netary hypothesis, if it be permitted to change the limits which he
 assigns to it by a small quantity, namely, from the earth's apsides
 to its solstices in its orbit.
    The same fact, which appears strongly marked with regard to
 shooting-stars in the eight-year summary of Dr. Schmidt, is found
 repeated in a striking manner in the existing Northern Catalogues
 of Star-showers, Fire-balls, and Aéroliths. The following references
 may be taken as examples:—

    The time appears therefore at length to have arrived when obser
vations of meteors in the southern hemisphere may greatly contribute
to establish the planetary theory of meteorites. Should the same se
quences of meteoric seasons, after the tropical seasons, be observed
in the southern hemisphere which are followed in the north, the
record of meteors in southern observatories will become at once a
confirmation of the planetary motion of the earth, and a proof of
the correctness of the existing theory of shooting-stars.               A sufficient
number of data can only be collected in the course of time; but the
observations of shooting-stars at Melbourne, in South Australia,
already preserved for some years, in great numbers, by Dr. Neu
mayer, appear actually calculated to give to this question, before
long, a satisfactory solution.—From the Monthly Notices of the Royal
Astronomical    Society,   April 8, 1864.

currents, rivers, or torrents; the others, amongst whom we
find some justly celebrated English and Italian physicists and
geologists, have lately proposed to accept the intervention of the
erosive action of glaciers.
   Each of these views is justified by the facts which take place
before our eyes,                 for
                     nature frequently makes use       very different

at the opening out of the Alpine valleys. This difficulty, against
which the genius of von Buch, De Luc, Escher, and others had
to struggle during the first and greater part of the present cen
tury, has been one of the principal causes of the readiness with
which the hypothesis of the great extension of the ancient glaciers
has been welcomed.        In this theory, the Alpine blocks have
been transported over the depressions between the Alps and the
Jura, solidly supported upon ice, instead of being suspended in
the air or in water at several thousand feet above the ground.
This general coat of ice, which covered         the valleys and      the          all                                          all

and that subsequently, these moveable materials being unable to
resist the pressure of the glaciers, the basins were cleared out
and filled with ice up to the period of the thaw, and of the retreat
of the glaciers into the high Alps. M. Desor% supposes the
lakes to have existed until the arrival of the ice, to have been
temporarily filled by the glacier which transported the gravel
blocks on its surface, and to have returned to the condition of
lakes when the glaciers retreated. M. Ombonit combines these
two solutions in one. The glaciers, according to him, advanced
to the lower extremity of the lakes, replacing the water with ice;
torrents issuing from the long-stationary glaciers deposited the
ancient alluvium; and, lastly, the glaciers, again advancing,
worked up the soil of this alluvium and deposited the moraines
and blocks which repose upon                      it.

convex rocks or roches moutonnées, whilst the second gives rise
to cavities.  The hollows or marmites which occur as an excep
tion to this rule in what appears to us to be the rocky bed of
ancient glaciers, are justly ascribed to the friction of gravel set
in rotation by falls of water through the glacier, or to the
moulins.
     Mr. Ramsay rightly assumes that the basins of our lakes can
not have been hollowed out by running water. A certain incline
is necessary to enable rivers, even with a muddy bottom, to hol
low out their bed; and this slope does not occur either in the
lakes of the Jura or in those of Zurich and Constance. Other
wise, if only a great mass of water were necessary, why do we
not find the Nile and the Ganges in their great floods hollowing
out basins for themselves 7 And even if a great inclination be
added to the mass of water, and the soil is favourable to erosion,
deep holes or marmites only are produced, and their extent never
exceeds the radius of the direct action of the impact of the water
and of the pebbles which it sets in motion. Of this we have the
proof in our waterfalls, in those of Italy, and in the cataract of
Niagara, so well described by M. Desor, as quoted by M. Mor
tillet. How, moreover, could we suppose that the Rhine, at so
great a distance from the high mountains, has had sufficient
force to hollow out a basin like that of the Lake of Constance 2
On the same principle one might suppose the Caspian Sea to be
due to the erosion of the Wolga, or the Dead Sea to that of the
Jordan, and regard these great depressions as mere effects of the
erosion of the rivers which traverse them.         And if we assume
that the basin of the Lake of Constance extended as far as the
Schollberg near Sargans, and that it was subsequently filled up
by detritus as far as Rheineck, how can we suppose that the
same river, which in the first place hollowed out                   its
                                                         bed from the

summits, we may still doubt whether they could have acquired
and retained the force necessary to hollow out valleys of the
depth of our lakes, and of from 20 to 30 Swiss leagues in length.
   However, since the appearance of the classical works of Sir
Charles Lyell, these great efforts of the imagination are no longer
popular, and the great débâcle, which was admitted chiefly in
order to explain the transportation of boulders, has given place
to the calm and slow movement of the glaciers.        It is also by
means of the glaciers that De Mortillet, Ramsay, and their ad
herents suppose the basins of the lakes to have been hollowed
out. After what has been said as to the erosive action of gla
ciers, it is useless to return to this question.        I
                                                      shall confine
myself to remarking that upon the bed of gravel and detritus of
unknown depth which extends in front of our great glaciers at
Chamouni, at the glaciers of Arolla, Ferpècle, and the Aar, and
in front of all the others, we do not see the least trace of the
asserted tendency of the glaciers to bury themselves by digging
out the soil. We also know that in those regions where the gla
ciers attain the sea-shore, they are prolonged above the water,
and do not sink below its level.
   Having thus ascertained the insufficiency of erosion for the
explanation of the origin of the valleys and lakes of the Alps, we
can hardly choose but recognize, with C. Escher, an intimate
connexion between a great number of Alpine valleys and the              in
clined position of the strata in the chains which they separate.
These are true orographic valleys, such as M. Desor has pointed
out in the Jura; and to the two kinds described by him—the
synclinal and isoclinal valleys—we must add, according to Escher,
for the Alps the anticlinal valleys, of which the Justithal to the
east of the Lake of Thun presents a fine example.           As to the
cluses, with which we shall join those rocky ravines which cut
the interior beds of the chains in the direction of the dip, and to
which Thurmann has given the name of Ruz, these are evidently
ruptures, often enlarged by erosion. We shall likewise add the
valleys of sinking (vallées d'affaissement), which indeed donot occur,
as far as I know, in the Jura, but play a great part in volcanic
countries; and perhaps some flat-bottomed circular valleys in the
Alps may be referred to this type.
   However, a classification of valleys founded upon the oro
graphy of the Jura can only find a very limited application in
the Alps.   Most of the Alpine valleys, and indeed     thoseall          of
any extent, are valleys    rupture which cut the strata
                          of                                      at

or less oblique angles; frequently also they are complex, and
pass from one type   toanother; and many      of
                                               them are combined
with great faults. Even longitudinal valleys       of
                                                    small size, and

the Jurassic classification. The valley of the Bas-Simmenthal
may be classed among the synclinal valleys; but what a difference
there is between it and the valleys of the same kind in the Jural
At the bottom of the latter the beds are horizontal, and rise to
 the two sides; in the Simmenthal they are vertical, and diverge
upwards like a fan—it looks like a synclinal valley folded up
 (refoulée) by lateral pressure.      The valley of the Pays d'Enhaut,
 from Gessenay to Château d'Oex, also appears to belongitudinal;
 nevertheless it cuts obliquely through three zones of Flysch and
 two intermediate ranges of limestone which run from N.E. to
 S.W. The Walais in the neighbourhood of Sion is an isoclinal

of Annecy to Faverges. As the latter circle appears to be de
pendent on Mont Blanc, so that of Eastern Switzerland bounds
the spreading foot of the Verrucano of Glaris.
   Those valleys which have cracked the Alpine strata are gene
rally regarded as traces of the upheavals, dislocations, and twist
ings which that country has undergone; and one of the most
powerful of these revolutions must be more recent than the Mio
cene period, as the strata of the Nagelflue and Molasse have
been so much affected by it as to have acquired greatly inclined
and even vertical positions.      On the other hand, we cannot over
look a certain connexion between the basins of the lakes and the
valleys in which they are situated. These basins appear as the
remains of the original depth of the valleys, before their bottoms
were partially filled up by rivers.       It has always been admitted
that originally the basin of the Lake of Geneva extended on one
side as far as St. Maurice, and on the other beyond Carouge;
it has also been supposed that the two basins of the lakes of
Brienz and Thun only formed a single one, which extended up
 wards as far as Meiringen, and downwards to the vicinity of the
 Belpberg, and perhaps further; and, lastly, that the three lakes
 of the Jura were not separated as at present by marshes, and
 that the great basin which contained them must have extended
 from Entreroches and Payerne as far as below Soleure.
    The connexion between the basins of the lakes and the tilting
 of the calcareous and Miocene beds of the Alpine and Jurassic
 ranges being admitted, we find ourselves face to face with the
 difficulty already indicated, namely, the transportation of the
 ancient alluvium beyond the Alps across the lakes; and after
 having got rid of the proposed solutions, we have only, it seems
 to me, two ways to escape from this difficulty—two solutions,
 moreover, which do not mutually exclude each other, and which
 may be applied according to the configuration presented by the
 different localities.                                                  -
    We may suppose the deposits of the ancient alluvium to have
 been produced by rivers which have no lakes to traverse; and
 these rivers having frequently changed their course, this expla
  nation may be adapted to cases which at the first glance seem to
  be opposed to    it.  The beds  of    sand and gravel which,    at the
  mouth  of  the Kander  in   the Lake   of Thun, support the moraine
 of  Strätligen, are undoubtedly    an   ancient deposit of  the Kander
 and the    Simme;    the  great plain  between Thun and Thierachern
  must have had the same origin.         All the pebbleson
                                                                       to of
                                                            the shore
  the lake,   asfar as the  Schadau,   are derived from the valleys
  the westward     of
                    the   lake;  the  ridges  of  Nagelflue east  of  the
  Aar have not furnished single one.
                              a                    Inthe same way the

position of a great part of the ancient gravels below Geneva is
explained by the deposits of the Arve, and a portion of those
of the Lake of Zurich by the deposits of the Sihl and the Linth.
     Ido not, however, conceal from myself that this solution can
not be generally admitted. It does not apply to the ancient
alluvia to the south of the lakes of the Italian slope of the Alps;
it does not explain the lignitic formation of Uznach, the level
of which is considerably above that of the Linth; nor the stra
tified gravels, older than the glacial deposit, to the north of the
Lake of Constance.      Even for the Lake of Thun the explanation
given does not suffice, inasmuch as we find between Uttigen and
Kiesen, two leagues below Thun, vast accumulations of ancient
gravel rising to more than 100 feet above the level of the Aar.
In these cases we must necessarily have recourse to depressions
which have taken place after the deposition of the gravel.   M.
Guyotº prefers this solution to any other for explaining the
origin of the lakes of the Jura, without being driven to it by
deposits of ancient alluvium, which do not occur on the left bank
of the lakes.     In the ridge of Molasse known as the Molle,
which rises from the bottom of the Lake of Neuchâtel to within
30 feet of the surface of the water, as also in that which, in the
Lake of Bienne, unites the Jolimont to the island of St. Pierre, he
sees submerged ridges of the same order as those of the valley
and the Jolimont still occupying their original position. These
sublacustrine ridges, moreover, cannot well accord with the sup
position that the lakes had their origin by erosion, whether by
means of currents of water or of glaciers, the molasse not being
sufficiently solid to resist this.
     If
      we admit the formation of the basins of our lakes by de
pressions,  the deposits of ancient alluvium beyond these basins
compel us to assume that the bottom of the great crevasses which
form our valleys has been entirely filled up, as is still the case
with that of the Arve, that of the Sarine, and others.           Although
there can have been no     deficiency  of débris after one of the most
terrible convulsions, this filling up undoubtedly requires that an
exceedingly long time must have elapsed between the formation
of the crevasses and that of the ancient alluvium.             Fortunately
another   consideration, which has    nothing      hypothetical   about     it,
             the same conclusion, namely, the great difference be

        after an investigation of tungsten+.
   From the constitution and properties of       oxygen compounds,   its
tungsten belongs       the group

is 153.3—W.
  It  forms two oxidized compounds; tungstic oxide, WO", and
tungstic acid, WO".
   By their combination these two compounds can form third                                     a

a sealed tube and heated from 120° to 140° for several               hours.
The tube was then opened, the chloroform evaporated, and the
contents of the tube brought into a small stoppered retort, which
was then placed in an oil-bath and the cyanide of phosphorus
driven into the neck of the retort by being heated to 160° to
190° in a current of carbonic acid.  The cyanide of phosphorus
forms then brilliant white needles an inch in length, or else
hexagonal plates.    When these crystals are slightly warmed,
they inflame in the air and burn with a bright light. They
decompose with water, alkalies, or acids, with the formation of
hydrocyanic and phosphorous acids.       The crystals melt and
volatilize at 190°: their composition, as determined by analysis,
is P(GN)”; further experiments are required to ascertain if
there is a compound P(GN)*.
   Hahn has investigated” the nature of the products which are
formed when cast iron is dissolved, more especially with a view
to ascertaining the compounds and forms into which the carbon
passes in this case.   He has also investigated some of the com
  ounds of silicon with iron.
   Schafhäutl had supposed that among the gases disengaged
when iron was dissolved, olefiant gas and hydride of ethylene
might be present. Hahn collected some of the gas liberated when
grey iron was dissolved in HCl, and, after it had been washed with
solutions of potash and of copper to remove SH and PH*, it was
treated in a long tube with a coke bullet soaked with sulphuric acid.
A slight diminution in volume was observed, which indicated the
presence of a gas of the formula C*H*.         In order to ascertain
which of these it   was, the gas  disengaged  from white iron, after
being washed by water, KO, and CuO, was passed into bromine,
which was thus converted into a heavy oily liquid, which was
washed with potash and dried over CaCl.         On subsequent frac
tional distillation and   analysis  of the various fractions, it was
found to be a mixture of the bromides of ethylene, C*H*Br”,
of propylene, Gº Hº Br”, of butylene, Gº Hº Br”, of amylene,
C*H*Br”, and of caproylene, Gº Hº Brº. A direct experiment
was made to see if the gas contained any acetylene, by pasing it
into ammoniacal solution of copper; but no explosive compound
of cupride of acetylene was obtained.
   The presence of the above compounds is explained by the
fact that, as white iron is difficultly soluble in cold dilute acid,
the flask in which it was contained was heated; hence the gases
atatemperature of 100% had carried several of the liquid hydrocar
bons, amylene, caproylene, and probably onanthylene, through
the wash bottles to the bromine. In the retort, after rectifica

bromoform was dropped into zincethyle the action was very brisk.
The products disengaged were passed through               artificially              an
cooled tube,  and then into    bulb apparatus

                                    M. Reboul     on Valerylene.                            501
            The bromide of propylene was treated with ethylate of soda,
         and the disengaged gas led into an ammoniacal solution of pro
         tochloride of copper.  The yellow deposit characteristic of ally
         lide of copper was  obtained; hence it may be doubted whether
         the propylene formed synthetically by the addition of the two
         radicals GH and C*H* is identical with ordinary propylene.
           The   bromides of the hydrocarbons of the general formula
         G"H"Br” can lose a molecule of hydrobromic acid and form a
         brominated derivative of the primitive hydrocarbon, and then
         a second molecule in becoming changed into a hydrocarbon
         G”H”     which differs from the original by two of hydrogen.
         By this method the following hydrocarbons have been obtained:
                                 Acetylene,   C*H*         Berthelotº.
                                 Allylene,    C3H4         Sawitzschf.
                                 Crotonylene, C*H*         Caventouf.
           To this series Reboul            S has added,    by the same method, the
         fourth member, valerylene, C*H*.                 He obtained it by heating, for
         several hours in closed tubes at 140°, brominated amylene with
         a saturated alcoholic solution of potash.   Water added to the
         product of the reaction separated a mixture of valerylene,
         alcohol, and brominated amylene.      This was washed with cold
         water to remove the alcohol, and the valerylene separated from
         the brominated amylene by rectification, which was very easy, as
         the boiling-point of the former is at 44° to 46°; that of the
         latter at 114° to 116° C.
            Valerylene is a colourless mobile liquid, much lighter than
         water, and with a penetrating alliaceous odour.      It does not
         affect an ammoniacal solution of    protochloride of copper. It
         combines with bromine with    great energy, forming a bibromide,
         C*H*Br”, which is not, however, volatile without decomposition.
         When treated with potash, this compound is decomposed into
         bromide of potassium and a liquid with an alliaceous odour,
                                                                        -

 502           M. Strecker            on a new class      of Nitro-compounds.
 into     NH”          Strecker has now found that by the action
                  (amide).
 of sodium on nitro-compounds, oxygen is simply removed, and
 thus a class of entirely new compounds is formed.        The first
 experiments were made with nitrobenzoic acid, which was pre
 pared by Gerland’s method.
    When a concentrated solution of this acid was treated with
 sodium-amalgam, no trace of hydrogen was given off, and the solu
 tion became so much heated that it had to be artificially cooled.
 The liquid became transiently yellow, and finally assumed an
 orange-yellow colour; no trace of ammonia was liberated.
 When dilute acid was added to the boiling solution to which
 alcohol had been added, a pulverulent precipitate was obtained,
 which could be readily collected on a filter and washed. This                                            |
is a new organic acid; Strecker names it Azobenzoic acid. It is
very difficultly soluble in water, alcohol, and ether; so that it
cannot be recrystallized from these media.     It dissolves in sul
phuric acid, and is reprecipitated on the addition of water.     It
loses nothing in weight, either at 100° or at 170° C., and at a
higher temperature melts, emitting a yellow vapour. Analysis
gave for it the formula C*H*N*09; and it is probable that it
                                                                                                          -

    amalgam on nitrobenzamide.
       When a solution of azobenzoate of soda in excess of caustic
    soda was boiled with solution of green vitriol, hydrated oxide of
    iron was formed at first, which speedily changed into black pro
    tosesquioxide of iron on the addition of more solution of protoxide,
    The solution was feebly yellow, and on the addition of an acid a
    yellowish white precipitate was formed, which Strecker calls hy
    drazobenzoic acid. It is nearly insoluble in boiling water, and dis
    solves in alcohol with difficulty, but sufficiently so for recrystalli
    zation, by which it is obtained in yellowish white indistinct
    flakes. It has the formula C*H*NO°, differing from azobenzoic
    acid by containing an additional atom of hydrogen.
       The new acid readily dissolves in the alkalies with a clear
    yellow colour, but on standing in the air these solutions rapidly
    absorb oxygen and are converted into the azobenzoates.         When
     boiled with strong  hydrochloric  acid, hydrazobenzoic    acid is de
    composed into azobenzoic acid and hydrochlorate of amidobenzoic
    acid. The decomposition is expressed as follows:—

       Schwanert* has published the results of a lengthened investi
    gation on the action of nitric acid on camphor, etherial oils, and
    resins. In the case of camphor, about half a pound was heated
    with ten to twelve times               its
                                      weight      nitric acid, with frequent

    cohobation, for about twenty hours. By this time the camphor had
    completely disappeared, and the disengagement               nitrous fumes  of
    had almost   entirely   ceased.    When the     liquid   was evaporated                         to
    about one   half,  camphoric    acid  crystallized   out,  and      further          on
    evaporation      yielded another crop

acid, Gº Hº (Gº Hº)*97, was obtained along with some             the                                          of
ether, when solution   a camphresic acid   of  absolute alcohol was       in
saturated with hydrochloric acid gas. The acid was removed from

                M. Schacht      on Monosulpholactic Acid.           505
 the ether by treatment with weak caustic soda.          Ethylcamphresic
 acid,  C"H"     (Gº Hº)   97, was obtained mixed with the preceding
 compound when camphresic acid was boiled with absolute alcohol.
 Schwanert tried the action of boiling nitric acid on a great num
 ber of oils, resins, and gum-resins, and found that camphresic
 acid was a frequent product of this action; for the details of the
 experiments the paper must be consulted.
     When chloracetic acid is treated with potash, or when chlor
 acetate of potash is boiled with water, chloride of potassium is
 formed together with glycolic acid. This reaction, which was            .
 first studied by Kekulé+, has been applied in other cases as a
 means of passing from the acetic acid to the lactic acid series.
 Carius has further showni that when chloracetate of potash is
 treated with hydrosulphate of potassium, the monosulphoglycolic
 acid is formed; more recentlyf Schacht has applied the same
 reaction to the preparation of monosulpholactic acid.          He first
 prepared chlorolactate of potash, and treated this at a tempera
 ture slightly over 100° with hydrosulphate of potassium, when
the following reaction took        place:–
             C3H4 KClO3 + KHS=KCl            + C3H5 K0°S.
           Chloropropionate        ,         Monosulpholactate
             of potassium.                     of potassium.
 The solution was saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen, diluted,
 and precipitated with acetate of lead; the precipitate was dif
fused in water, then decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen, and
the liquid, after removing hydrochloric acid, treated with car
 bonate of barium, by which the barium-salt was obtained. From
the barium-salt the lead-salt was prepared, from which in turn
the free acid was produced by treatment with sulphuretted
hydrogen.
    Pure monosulpholactic acid crystallizes in broad needles which
are grouped in masses. It is soluble in the ordinary media, and
its dilute solution can be boiled without its being decomposed.
The acid forms a crystalline but very deliquescent potash-salt,
and with silver a white amorphous precipitate.
    When the acid is treated with dilute nitric acid, it yields an
acid identical with one obtained by Buckton and Hofmann in
the action of strong sulphuric acid on propionamide.
    Carius has prepared monosulphomalic acid by the action of
monobromosuccinic acid on sulphide of potassium. The reaction
required a temperature of above 110°. It is expressed by the
following equation:—

         induced currents, upon which the true explanation of the pheno
         menon in question depends, our knowledge of the same, from
         an experimental as well as from a theoretical point of view, is
         still very deficient. The paths of the currents induced in the
         rotating conductor have by no means been experimentally de
         termined with certainty; for, as I shall elsewhere show, the
         methods employed in investigating the curves described by these
         currents do not attain the object in view. These methods, in
         fact, are based upon the inadmissible assumption that the cur
          rent-curves, and the lines of level of the potential of the free
          electricity, constitute two orthogonal systems.        In a theoretic
          point of view, however, the treatment which the problem has
          hitherto received is still more imperfect, as will be evident from
          the following résumé. The laws of currents excited by magnetie
          induction in linear conductors were completely established by
          Neumann, Weber, and others, and reduced by Weber to the
          general principle of the mutual action of moving quantities of
          electricity.   Kirchhoff” afterwards exhibited the general differ
          ential equations for the variable electro-dynamic condition of
          stationary solid conductors, taking into consideration the in
          ductive action produced between the several parts of the con
          ductor by the variations in the intensity of the current; and he
          deduced from these equations certain general conclusions. With
          respect to the induction in solid conductors moving under the
          influence of a magnet, however, the general differential equa
          tions, upon whose integration the solution of the problem
          depends, have not as yet even been exhibited. Shortly after

508           M. E. Jochmann                      on the Electric Currents induced
by Feliciº must be here mentioned. Instigated by the observa
tions of Matteucci, this author sought to determine the induc
tion in an infinitely thin and unlimited plane disc, rotating
under the influence of one or two opposite magnetic poles
situated in the plane of the disc. Although, as will be after.
wards shown, this case is only admissible as a limiting one, in
consequence of the discontinuity therein involved, and although
Felici, in solving the problem, employs several hypotheses

The constant C is determined from the arbitrary total quantity
of free electricity which exists on the sphere. In fact the quan

         A  noteworthy result, immediately deducible from this, is that
    the form of the current-curves induced by a single pole is indepen
    dent of the distance of the pole from the azis of rotation; whilst,
    as shown by the expressions (37), the current-density is pro
    portional to this distance, and vanishes when        a-0.       The equa
    tion (38)     represents  a system  of curves of the fourth order,
    of which, however,       only those branches correspond to the           pro
    blem for which
                                p= w/?-Hºº-Fº
     has a positive value.     The currents are situated in planes parallel
     to the two by which the disc is bounded; the parameter & cha
º    racterizes the whole group of current-curves which belong to the
     plane &= c-2; whilst the constant C changes from one curve
#2   to another in the same plane. The system of curves correspond
<U+017F>º   ing to one and the same plane, constructed according to the
     equation (38), is represented in Plate V., wherein the distance
     of the inducing pole from the plane of the figure is shown by
     the line AB, whose length, according to the arbitrary scale
     adopted, is equal to 0-5.
          Since v vanishes for m=0, it follows that no curve cuts the
  º
 s   axis of É.    The denominator of the expression (38) being always
     positive, the corresponding values of m and the constant C are

surface   of water seem to depend (1) on the formation of a film
 of camphor    which is detached from the fragment by the adhe
 sion of the water; (2) on the reaction of such film on the frag
ment; (3) on the evaporation, and (4) on the solution of the film.
In this way a film is always being produced and always being
disposed of; but this incessant formation of the film which pro
 duces the recoil of the fragment, and also the evaporation of the
film, are limited to the surface, while the whole body of the
liquid is concerned in                      its

 tangled with some particles of the powder, and spun round with
 great velocity, very nearly like a small fragment of camphor on

 moved over the surface with vigour. The lycopodium was power
 fully driven away in front of the advancing disk, while other por

      The relative intensities and distinctive characters of the lines are
   represented by figures and letters, placed against the numbers in the
   Tables.
      The spectrum, which extends from a to H, is divided, and forms
   two maps. The air-spectrum and the principal solar lines are placed
   at the top of each map, and below these the spectra of the following
  metals:–Sodium, potassium, calcium, barium, strontium, manga
  nese, thallium, silver, tellurium, tin, iron, cadmium, antimony, gold,
  bismuth, mercury, cobalt, arsenic, lead, zinc, chromium, osmium,
  palladium, and platinum.
      The lines of the air-spectrum are referred to the components of
  air to which they severally belong.         An unexpected result was ob
  served: two    strong  lines of the   air-spectrum,  one of them a double
  line, were seen to be common to the spectra of oxygen and nitrogen.
  These gases were obtained from different sources with identical results.
  The strong red line of the air-spectrum is shown to be due to the
  presence of aqueous vapour, and to coincide with the line of hydro
  gen. The carbonic acid in the air is not revealed by spectrum
  analysis.
      Three pairs of lines and one band of haze are given in the sodium
  spectrum in addition to the double D line. . As these might be due
  to impurities of the commercial sodium employed, the observation
 was confirmed by an amalgam of sodium prepared by the voltaic
 method from pure chloride of sodium.             Two of these pairs of lines
 have been recognized in the spectrum of a saturated solution of
 pure nitrate of soda.
     The two stronger pairs appear to agree in position with solar lines
 having the following numbers in Kirchhoff’s scale:—864.4 and 867-1,
 and 1150-2 and 1154°2.
     The spectrum from electrodes of potassium contains many new
 lines.    For the spectra of calcium, lithium, and strontium, metallic
 calcium, lithium, and strontium were employed.
     Barium was mapped from an amalgam of barium prepared by elec
 tricity from chloride of barium.
     The following metals were employed in the form of electro-deposits
upon platinum:—manganese,           silver, tin, iron, cadmium, antimony,
bismuth, cobalt, lead, zinc, and chromium.          Care was taken that the
other metals should be reliable for purity.

an opportunity of ascertaining whether the gravels at that lower
level exhibited any features different from those of the upper level
at Biddenham.      Although, as might have been expected, some of
the species of mammals were found to be common to the two
localities, yet that under notice furnished some species of mammals,
as well as of land and freshwater shells, together with a few types of
flint implements, differing from those met with at higher levels.
    Mr. Wyatt described the section at Summerhouse Hill in detail,
showing that it tended to support Mr. Prestwich's opinions respect
ing the formation of gravel-beds; he also described the Flint Imple
ments he had recently found, comparing them with known speci
mens from the Valley of the Somme and elsewhere; and he stated
that he was now enabled to add two new localities near Bedford—
Summerhouse Hill and Honey Hill—to those already known as
having furnished similar weapons.
    2. “On some Recent Discoveries of Flint Implements in Drift
Deposits in Hants and Wilts.” By John Evans, Esq., F.G.S., F.S.A.
    Flint Implements having recently been found on the sea-shore
about midway between Southampton and Gosport, by Mr. James
Brown, of Salisbury, and also at Fisherton, near Salisbury, by Dr.
H. P. Blackmore of that place, the author visited these localities in
company with Mr. Prestwich, and gave the results of his observa
tions in this paper.                                               -
    After describing the implements from near Southampton, and
having shown that their condition is identical with that of the
materials composing the gravel capping the adjacent cliff, Mr.
Evans proceeded to review the evidence of the great antiquity of
these remains, which rested mainly on the circumstance that these
gravel-beds, like those of Reculver, are of fluviatile origin, although
now abutting on the sea.
    In like manner the author then described the Fisherton imple
ments, and the gravel-pits from which they were obtained.            The
relation of the high-level gravels (in which the implements were
found) to the lower-level gravels of the valley of the Avon was next
discussed, and the geological features of the former deposits particu
larly described, lists of the fossils (including the Mammalia and the
Land and Freshwater Shells) being also given.        Mr. Evans came to
the conclusion that the fossils bore evidence of the climate, at the
time when they were deposited, having been more rigorous, at any
rate in the winter, than it now is; and to this cause he attributed
the comparatively greater excavating power of the early Postplio
cene rivers.

the Rev. W. R. Dawes, I feel a little more confidence in giving the
result of my own observations.
    Since November 1861 I have most carefully searched for Mr. Nas
myth's “willow-leaves” under various circumstances.
   From November 1861 to April 1862 I was engaged in astrono
mical pursuits at Nice, and on every fine day I examined the sun
with one of three equatoreals—a 4-inch, a 6-inch, and an 8-inch
 (belonging to Mr. Coventry), with powers from 40 to 500.       In the
summer of 1862 I examined the sun at Paris with another 8-inch
object-glass of exquisite definition. In November of the same year
I  revisited Nice; and until my return, in April 1863, I omitted no
opportunity of searching for the “willow-leaves,” but never have I
seen the slightest     trace of “willow-leaves,” “rice-grains,” or
“ thatch.”
   During this spring                 I
                           have also examined the sun with a small
telescope, fitted with a binocular eyepiece belonging to a first-class
microscope, and without any greater success, though the spots are
clearly shown as funnel-shaped depressions or holes: all that see                          I
on the sun is merely a difference of greater or less luminosity.
   A remark was made at our last meeting that perhaps these ap
pearances depend on focus, and the examination of Diatomaceae out
of focus was given as an instance. When I returned home I ex
amined several specimens of Diatomaceae, both easily resolvable and
tests (Navicula cuspidata), with various powers of from 3-inch to a

ON  THE YELLOW COLORATION OF FADED PHOTOGRAPHIC PRINTS.
                           BY M. CAREY LEA.
   Everything connected with the permanence of photographic pro
ducts has an interest so vital to photography, that nothing connected
with it can be considered as trivial. We are yet groping in the dark
as to the causes of failure.     “Sulphuration” is a convenient word,
but it would be more    satisfactory   if we had some idea as to the nature
of the obnoxious insoluble sulphur compound.
   The hypothesis which has for some time past become current                                  is,
that the fading depends upon the presence            the print
                                                            in    some sul  of
phur compound, which with time acts upon the silver, converting                                it,
as    said, into sulphide.
     is                       Sulphide               of
                                             silver we know        jet-blackas
substance, and we habitually convert the reduced silver           negatives    of a
into sulphide when we wish           intensify them. Why then should
                                            to
the production             of   sulphide   of   silver strengthen   a   negative and           de

   MM. Davanne and Girard answer          follows. Sulphide

organic matter, the organic matter enters into the composition and
the compound       yellow. To prove this, they precipitate

again precipitate the same silver solution in presence of starch, and
obtain a yellow precipitate.
    I have paid much attention to the subject of the fading of prints,
and had been forcibly struck by thé anomaly above referred to. The
explanation of the gentlemen just mentioned seemed very satisfac
tory; but the question appeared to have too much importance to
pass it by without verification.               The following results were ob
tained.
     In a test-tube was placed a little boiled starch ; in a second tube,
some water. Two or three drops of a five per cent. solution of nitrate
of silver were added to each, and then hydrosulphate of ammonia.
Both solutions gave a yellowish-brown precipitate without the slight
est difference in shade or colour.            The precipitate afforded by hydro
sulphate of ammonia could not here differ from that produced by
sulphuretted hydrogen, but to remove any doubt on this score, the
experiment was carefully repeated with sulphuretted hydrogen.
The same result precisely was obtained. As a further confirmation,
 the experiment was varied by the substitution of another organic
substance, viz. collodion, instead of the starch.
                           -
                                                                The result was pre
 cisely similar.
     The different result obtained by MM. Davanne and Girard can
 perhaps be explained as follows. The sulphide of silver is a heavy
 substance, and when thrown down from a simple watery solution it
quickly subsides. But solutions thickened with organic matter, such
 as gum, starch, gelatine, &c., retain a precipitate for a long time
 in a state of suspension, thus preserving the original yellowish
 brown appearance.              If,therefore, we prepare solutions             above,       as
 and    pass HS   through      them,   allowing    them      subside,  to
                                                                        and examine
 them only after      a  time, we shall find               in
                                                      the one case       black preci  a

                                                                                 a
 liquid. But     if  we watch the process from the outset, we shall see
 that the reactions are chemically identical, and differ only                 respect      in
 to   the mechanical      suspension     which takes     place               in
                                                                   the one case.
